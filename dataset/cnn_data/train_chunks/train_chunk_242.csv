"(CNN) -- Tribal leaders in Falluja called Tuesday on people who fled weekend fighting between al Qaeda-linked fighters and government troops to return, a signal efforts were underway to dial back the violence that has raised questions about the ability of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to hold Iraq together. In the statement released to CNN, tribal and religious leaders called on government employees and other workers to return to work Wednesday. ""All residents and families who have fled recent fighting should return as well,"" it said. Even as Sunni tribal leaders issued the call, government troops took up stronger positions within sight of the city, according to a journalist in Falluja working for CNN. Conflicting reports emerged over the weekend about who was in control in Falluja, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents during the Iraq War. Some suggested the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), formerly the group commonly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, is in partial control of the city, which is situated roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, in the volatile province of Anbar. The government said this weekend that the Iraqi army shelled Falluja in an effort to clear out the al Qaeda-linked fighters. The statement came a day after al-Maliki ordered Iraqi forces not to target residential neighborhoods in Falluja. It's unknown whether a deal between the Sunni tribal leaders and the Shiite-dominated government prompted what appears to be a clear effort to calm the situation. The journalist working for CNN has seen people moving freely in and out of Falluja, though Sunni tribal forces are manning checkpoints. CNN is not identifying the journalist out of concern for his security. Violence has flared in the province following the arrest of a Sunni lawmaker in Ramadi and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in Falluja and Ramadi. CNN's Saad Abedine and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Statement released to CNN calls on government workers to return to work in Falluja .

"(CNN) -- Brian McLaughlin used to arrive 20 minutes early to on-site client meetings. He would drive around the parking lot to find a space close to the building, and then go inside to cool off from the short walk. The extra weight he was carrying made him sweat constantly inside his suit. McLaughlin had struggled with weight his entire life. At age 10 he weighed 140 pounds; at age 20 he was 280 pounds. By 30, he had reached his heaviest weight of 330 pounds. In 2010, McLaughlin moved from Ireland to New York, after landing a job as software architect for the New York Stock Exchange. He went out for lunch and dinner with his new American co-workers in an attempt to socialize and make friends -- sacrificing all hopes of eating healthy. ""I was living a bachelor lifestyle,"" says McLaughlin. ""I would eat and drink a lot, which played havoc with the weight."" He tried The Atkins Diet and Weight Watchers but nothing seemed to click. He watched as his mother lost 50 pounds on a diet program called Slimming World, which advocates dieting without deprivation of the foods you like. And he saw his girlfriend shed 100 pounds on Weight Watchers. Seeing living proof that people can lose weight inspired him to make some changes of his own. A social sacrifice . It was tough to stop going out to eat for lunch and dinner, McLaughlin says. He used to go out with his co-worker a couple of times a week and indulge in a half-dozen strong cocktails before (and after) lavish three-course meals. ""I'd usually have an appetizer of cured meats, the largest available steak, or a rack of lamb for mains, a side of vegetables sautÃ©ed in butter or oil, rich desserts like molten chocolate lava cake or chocolate ganache and a cheese board with dessert wine to finish,"" says McLaughlin. Between the two of them, McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner. ""I can't remember a meal where I walked away not feeling completely stuffed to the point of almost being sick,"" he says. ""Dinner and drinks used to add up to 5,000 calories alone."" Now he follows the Slimming World plan and prepares his meals at home. They usually consist of fruit and either chicken rubbed with dry spices, or fillet and broccoli or cauliflower. When he does eat out, he chooses carefully. ""I love the dining experience and social aspect,"" says McLaughlin. ""But I realize a 6- or 8-ounce filet is more than enough now."" He also tries to skip cocktail hour. ""Now I tend to drink wine only, and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience,"" McLaughlin says. Different diet, same result . McLaughlin's girlfriend, Allison Dressler, says she found it hard to cook in the beginning of their relationship due to their different diet meal plans. She followed Weight Watchers, which focuses on a point system to limit calories. For Slimming World, McLaughlin would worry about every drop of oil, butter or cooking spray because those were restricted under the diet plan. ""As we cooked more and more we realized a lot of the things he eats are actually good for me,"" says Dressler. ""And a lot of things I eat aren't that bad for him, either."" Neither Dressler nor McLaughlin have gym memberships; they simply walk a few miles a couple of days of the week. McLaughlin didn't want to drastically change his workout plan because he feared he wouldn't be able to stay motivated. ""It's hard to go to the gym after work,"" he says. ""I really wanted to focus on controlling my eating habits more than anything."" That strategy worked. In the last three years, McLaughlin has lost 140 pounds. McLaughlin now goes to work more than two hours earlier than he used to and finishes earlier, which has increased his productivity. ""I don't feel that constant sluggish feeling anymore,"" he says. His energy has also increased dramatically; he no longer lies in bed watching The Food Network until the afternoon. When he first moved to New York, his only hobby was eating and drinking -- now he spends his weekends researching farmers markets to visit, chili festivals, wine stores and fruit-picking spots. The couple recently went on vacation and chose to walk to their terminal rather than take the moving pavements like they use to. Dressler says its these small changes that make the biggest differences. ""A lot of my life still revolves around food and drink, but it's no longer destructive,"" says McLaughlin.

"(CNN) -- Mariah Carey is back in action and ready to let go. The singer is set to release a new single, ""The Art of Letting Go,"" on November 11. She tells CNN in an interview that this is one track she can relate to ""on every level."" ""As a songwriter, I never like to be too totally specific, because I like people to be able to make it about their own life experiences,"" Carey said. ""(But) there is an art to learning how to let go of things in your life, people in your life, things that are not good for you. Whatever the case may be."" At the moment, Carey's focused on letting go of the lingering pain from a recent injury. In July, the singer took a nasty fall on the set of a music video, dislocating her shoulder among other things. ""I fell off something very high, and I dislocated my shoulder, fractured my shoulder, (and) fractured the rib area,"" Carey said. ""It just requires a lot of physical therapy, but I'm like 90 to 95 percent there."" For her new single, the star collaborated with producer Rodney Jerkins and created ""The Art of Letting Go"" through what Carey describes as an organic process. The result, she said, is a song that goes back to her roots. ""There's an emotion to it, as you listen to the song start to finish, that you can tell that it's me if it's anybody that's ever met me or been listening to music over however long. I was 2 when I started! As she continues to recuperate, Carey is looking forward to getting back to her roots. ""There's an emotion to it, as you listen to the song start to finish, that you can tell that it's me,"" she said. ""lt's about letting go of maybe something that's not right for you. But you just don't know how to make that final move and let go of it. Like it's not easy, it's something that you have to learn how to do, and I think we're all still learning."" ""The Art of Letting Go"" will be released on Carey's Facebook page. CNN's Nischelle Turner and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Mariah Carey is releasing a new song on November 11 .

"(CNN) -- Days after a deadly Metro-North train derailment in New York, a top federal transportation official said Tuesday that he has ""serious concerns"" about safety on the railroad. In addition to Sunday's derailment in the Bronx, which killed four people and injured dozens more, Federal Railroad Administration chief Joseph Szabo listed three other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains. ""The specific causes of each of these accidents may vary, but regardless of the reasons, four serious accidents in less than seven months is simply unacceptable,"" he wrote in a letter to the head of New York's transit authority. The letter also describes a May 17 train derailment and collision in Bridgeport, Connecticut; the death of a Metro-North employee on May 28 in West Haven, Connecticut; and a CSX freight train derailment in the Bronx on July 18. More needs to be done immediately to improve safety, Szabo said. He directed New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority to immediately implement a so-called C3RS program, which allows railroad employees to report close calls ""to identify significant precursors to significant safety issues."" ""A C3RS is in place on other rail lines across the country ... and has proven effective in identifying safety issues and lowering injury and accident exposure,"" he wrote. And that's not all, he said. ""We have significant concerns about the current situation at Metro-North, and are actively considering other ways that FRA can use its federal oversight authority to provide additional safety enhancement of MTA operations,"" he wrote. The MTA said it is fully cooperating with the investigation and is conducting a comprehensive look at the safety culture of the authority. ""The safety of the MTA's customers and employees has always been, and will always continue to be, our top priority. We look forward to working with the Federal Railroad Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation to improve safety,"" MTA spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. ""We have been moving forward on a confidential close call reporting system, and we look forward to working with the FRA to implement it."" Combined, the four accidents ""resulted in 5 deaths and approximately 129 injuries to Metro-North employees and customers,"" Szabo said. The July freight train derailment, which damaged tracks and tipped over containers carrying tons of trash, occurred near the area in the Bronx where seven passenger cars derailed on Sunday, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The May collision between two Metro-North passenger trains in Bridgeport sent dozens of people to the hospital after a train heading from New Haven to New York City derailed during rush hour and smashed into a train heading in the opposite direction. Less than 10 days later, a train hit and killed a Metro-North employee who was doing maintenance work on tracks in the vicinity of the construction of a new station in West Haven, CNN affiliate WFSB reported. CNN's Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","NEW: New York's MTA says it's cooperating with investigators .

"(CNN) -- Talk about going from ecstasy to agony. Welsh golfer Stuart Manley thought he won a new Mercedes when he struck a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne. The world No. 346 celebrated wildly and even patted the car -- which was on display. But then Manley was told the car only went to those who hit a hole in one in the fourth and final round and he slumped to an 11 on his ensuing hole, the fourth. ""It's the highest high and then the lowest low I've ever experienced on a golf course,"" Manley told the tournament website. ""I thought the car was mine, and with the crowd, all the hype, I was just buzzing. The adrenaline was pumping so much. ""Then I found out about the car and go and have an 11. ""I kept asking my caddie, 'How many shots is that now?' I actually thought it was a 10 but I was not going to argue, because my head was pretty fried at that point."" Despite the disastrous fourth, Manley managed to finish the round at one-over 72 and stands at two under, total, entering play Sunday. ""If somebody had told me I would've finished on two under at the end of the day after taking an 11, I would have taken it,"" he said. ""I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that point, but you've just got to pick yourself up and get on with it. ""I won't forget this day for a while."" Jason Day -- who lost eight of his relatives in the deadly typhoon in the Philippines this month -- led on home soil, one shot better than Denmark's Thomas Bjorn. Manley was tied for eighth, seven shots adrift. Australia also leads the team standings, with the U.S. one shot behind.","Welsh golfer Stuart Manley hits a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne .

"(CNN) -- Prince Harry is currently in Cape Town awaiting an improvement in weather conditions so that he, along with his fellow Walking With The Wounded teammates, can fly to Antarctica's Novo Airbase and begin acclimating their bodies to the extreme conditions before their 200-mile trek to the South Pole. By committing to head to the bottom of the earth alongside his team, Harry is setting a whole new precedent in terms of royal charity involvement for the future. Members of the royal family serve to provide continuity, promote British interests, and act as global ambassadors by representing all that is great about Great Britain, but a large percentage of their operational life is devoted to charity work. For decades royals have travelled the length and breadth of the country, and indeed the globe, on behalf of their many organizations. They act as patron or president, raise awareness of the cause, cut ribbons, unveil plaques, attend dinners, plant trees, and most importantly -- raise money. A royal patronage is about the best gift a charity can receive short of a wealthy benefactor bequeathing millions of dollars to the cause on their death bed, and in times of recession and economic hardship the survival of many charities rests on the regal shoulders of its patron. At 87 the Queen has more than 600 patronages and at 92 Prince Philip has about 800. According to a recent Time magazine article, Prince Charles raised $224 million for his charities between April 2012 and March 2013. Tickets to the upcoming Winter Whites Gala on behalf of homeless charity Centrepoint were going for the princely sum of Â£500 before selling out almost immediately. The reason for the large price tag and instant sell out? Prince William, Patron of Centrepoint, will be in attendance. Charities can command top dollar when a senior royal rolls out. Along with said royal comes a legion of reporters and wealthy benefactors, and whenever Kate's involved you can pretty much guarantee the occasion making front page news the following day. That type of attention leaves charity heads googly-eyed. The royals have always approached charity engagements with enthusiasm, well aware that their presence allows for worldwide exposure. One need only to look at coverage of Diana shaking hands with an AIDS patient in 1989, or her walk through a partially-cleared land mine field in Angola in 1997, to understand the power of a globally recognized figure. William and Harry, however, have taken things one step further in recent years by rolling up their proverbial sleeves and throwing themselves in at ground level. In December 2009 Prince William spent the night sleeping rough near Blackfriars Bridge in central London. He did so in order to gain a better understanding of what the homeless community experiences night after night. Had he simply dished out soup and shaken hands with a few volunteers he still would have drawn attention to the work of the charity Centrepoint, but by actually bedding down on the streets of Central London he significantly heightened public awareness. In March 2011 Prince Harry joined a team of injured servicemen for the first five days of their trek to the North Pole. Yes, of course it was about raising money for the charity Walking With The Wounded, but as Harry said at the time, it was also about raising an awareness of the debt the country owes to those it sends off to fight. Harry has made no secret of his dedication to the welfare of injured servicemen and women, and the money raised enables the charity to fulfill its mission; however, by taking part alongside his fellow soldiers, Harry gave them far more than a well-funded charity. He showed them that they matter, that their loss matters, and that their lives may continue to inspire. Looking to the future of the monarchy, Charles has made it clear he wants to push for a more streamlined royal family, but I hope that when the time comes he will make room for extended members of the family to step up and continue their efforts on behalf of their chosen charities. As the only blood-born princesses of their generation, Beatrice and Eugenie have already shown a readiness to support causes meaningful to them. Were the Queen to give them an ""official"" role, their potential could be enormous. It comes down to simple mathematics: streamline the monarchy, and funding to the smaller charities that rely on a royal patron slips down the tubes. Royals and charity work will always go hand-in-hand -- and long may it be so. Plaques will remain, trees will grow, and the work of the charity in question will continue, but it is this new hardcore approach that is so exciting. It won't work for everyone, and it would lose its impact if suddenly every engagement required rigorous training, compression chambers, hard hats, life vests and the likes, but we should salute Prince Harry on his epic polar endeavor. Harry's physical disability may be limited to a broken toe, but walking alongside those brave wounded warriors will no doubt leave him with an unbreakable spirit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria Arbiter.","Prince Harry is in Cape Town waiting to continue preparing for a 200-mile trek to the South Pole .

"(CNN) -- Anton Hysen is a football player. He is also gay. ""So what?"" he says. ""Being gay is not a choice -- I hate it when people say that."" In March 2011, Hysen, who plays in the lower leagues in Sweden, became the first man to come out in more than 20 years within the world of football. He broke the taboo. Fast forward two years and, while his life has changed immeasurably, the same problems remain. ""There's so much ignorance,"" he told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""There's a lack of knowledge. Some people who are homophobic don't even know a gay person. It's all about preconceptions. ""I hear that football players are supposed to be masculine. I know plenty of straight guys who are more effeminate. ""There's this illusion that every football player has to be macho and have a model girlfriend. It's not acceptable to be a gay player. ""Why not? We can run, we can play, we can score. So what's the problem?"" The fight against homophobia in football has been stepped up in the UK in particular, with the ""Rainbow Laces"" campaign taking center stage over recent days. Stonewall, a UK-based gay, lesbian and bisexual charity, teamed up with Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to promote the initiative -- which urged players to wear the colored laces to promote awareness. The organization sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in England and the 42 in Scotland but enjoyed only limited success, with clubs unhappy with the inclusion of a gambling firm and a lack of notice given by the charity. Many football fans took to Twitter to say they were unable to even see the laces, especially with players often boasting luminous footwear, while some professionals decided against wearing them for a multitude of reasons. 'It needs to be discussed' But while he supports the campaign -- Hysen wore the laces during his most recent game -- he stresses that it is only a small step in bringing about a meaningful change in attitudes towards homophobia. ""I think it's a good idea,"" he said, after laughing that he had hit the post when he should have scored in that previous match. ""It's not a big change but it is a step forward. It's the least we can do. We can have lectures, we can ban people -- and laces won't change the mind of an idiot. ""A homophobe won't change his mind because players are wearing rainbow laces, but we're putting it into their minds and we're putting the issue into society so we can talk about it. ""It might make people more aware and make them reconsider but it's not going to make people come out instantly. ""We can talk about it and discuss it. It needs to be discussed. There are not many players out there (wearing them) but it's a nice gesture. ""I've heard some idiotic excuses. I respect anyone who doesn't want to (wear them) and has strong opinions on the matter but don't give lame excuses. That's silly. ""There are a lot of different things we can do -- but this shows some players are ready to show their support. Seeing a professional wearing them is great and gives comfort to gay people who are playing and aren't ready to come out."" Who's next? In February, U.S. soccer player Robbie Rogers revealed he is gay but at the same time announced he was retiring from the sport. Rogers, who was playing in England at the time, has since reversed his decision to quit and now plays back in his homeland with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles Galaxy. But not since the tragic death of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight division witnessed an openly gay professional football player. Fashanu, who committed suicide in 1998, became the first £1 million black player in the history of English football when he signed for Nottingham Forest in 1981. Constant speculation surrounded his private life, and at one time he reportedly claimed he'd had affairs with Conservative MPs -- which further fueled media interest. With the rumors continuing throughout his career, he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs. ""You have to understand,"" he said in an interview before his death, ""that footballers are very narrow-minded people. It's the nature of the business. When you put yourself in the firing line, you are open to attack. I know I'm there to be shot down in flames."" Following his passing, one particular group of fans would recite the chant: ""He's gay, he's dead, he's hanging in a shed, Fashanu, Fashanu."" 'I hope someone else will come out' While there has been huge progress since those dark days, the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished. Hysen had hoped that he would become a trailblazer -- but Rogers aside, there has been little movement in terms of players coming out. ""I've had quite a few anonymous phone calls from players who want to come out but I don't know who they are or where they play,"" said Hysen. ""I hope that someone else will come out just like Robbie Rogers did. That was great for U.S. soccer. At last we're having a discussion about it and that's huge. ""It has been pretty quiet and I understand that. People might not want to come out publicly and I understand. ""For me, the whole experience has been really positive. I've not had any trouble at all. If somebody says something, then I don't care. I don't have time for any of that. I don't waste my energy on that. ""Lately it has been really good -- I don't know why it's a problem."" Putting the Gay in Games . But it's not just in football where the problem exists -- the 2014 Winter Olympics have also courted controversy following the Russian government's decision to implement a new law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."" There have been protests across the globe, with some athletes threatening to boycott the Games over what they believe are archaic and draconian laws. Russia says the legislation is intended to protect children by prohibiting discussion of gay rights and relationships within their earshot. ""I don't understand what's happening in Russia,"" sighs Hysen. ""What year are we in? ""It's like the Stone Age out there. I respect their laws. It's their country and I respect that but it's all about human rights. We're all humans. It's prehistoric stuff. It's 2013 now. ""Athletes aren't going there because of their sexuality. You're going there to perform your sport -- you go out there and play and do your best. ""You're not living there -- you're just going to compete. It's a problem. It's difficult because you have to respect their laws but it's ridiculous how we treat people in the 21st century. ""I know a few people going but I'd never go. I'll watch at home on television."" Football family . Hysen is not shy in giving his views -- although he does squirm at the thought that he has become some kind of spokesman for gay sports stars: ""I always speak from the heart and don't care what I say."" With a strong family around him, he has grown into a confident and aspiring young man who quickly realized that his life would never be the same. But by his own admission, the fact that he is the son of Glenn Hysen, the former Liverpool and Sweden international footballer, may have given him an advantage which others may not be as fortunate to enjoy. As a player, his father won the now defunct UEFA Cup twice with Swedish side IFK Gothenburg before moving to England, where he won the league title in 1991. He is now on the coaching staff at Anton's third division club Utsiktens, while brothers Tobias and Alexander are also professional footballers. Dancing star . But Anton is famous in his own right -- his story an inspiration to millions around the world -- while he cites his victory in Sweden's ""Dancing with the Stars"" as another reason for his current popularity. ""In Sweden I get recognized a lot from my football but also from the dancing,"" he laughs. ""I didn't think people would care that much but it's nice. ""When I first came out I thought I would be in the newspapers in Sweden for a couple of days and that's it -- I didn't think people would really care to be honest. ""And then suddenly it went crazy, and within two days the whole world knew, but it feels pretty good. I know that I've done something good with my life.

"Rome (CNN) -- An autopsy has determined that actor James Gandolfini's death Wednesday was the result of natural causes -- a heart attack -- family friend Michael Kobold told reporters here Friday. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary,"" he said. ""There was no foul play, there was no substance abuse, none of that."" The 51-year-old actor had arrived Tuesday with his son, Michael, at the five-star Boscolo Exedra Roma. ""Jim was happy, he was healthy, he was doing really fine,"" Kobold said.

"(CNN) -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien, an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia, co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region. The original structure for Chateau O'Brien was an old French farmhouse that Howard O'Brien, Debbie's husband, transformed into a first-class winery known for its large copper doors, wrap-around sundeck and rich aged wines that include a medium-bodied Malbec, a full-bodied Cabernet Franc, an elegant Petit Verdot, and the fast-selling Tannat Limited Reserve and Late Harvest Tannat. The secret to Chateau O'Brien's success: ""We grow our own grapes,"" said Howard O'Brien, who owns three sprawling Virginia vineyards. Chateau O'Brien is one of about 230 wineries in the state, many of them small, boutique operations that specialize in regional wines. Virginia is relatively new to the wine-making industry by European standards, but it's quickly gaining notoriety among wine enthusiasts from across the country. Virginia ranks fifth in the nation for number of wineries and for wine grape production. As evidence of the emerging quality of Virginia wines, the U.S. Treasury Department designated Middleburg, Virginia, as the newest American Viticulture Area. Many wineries in Northern Virginia are situated about 50 miles from Washington, which makes the experience great for day trips or weekend retreats. Tasting fees at most Northern Virginia wineries range from $6 to $15 per person, and while some Virginia wine loyalists are somewhat optimistically comparing the region to Napa Valley and Sonoma, there are indeed several standouts that can compete with some of the nation's better wineries. Take Delaplane Cellars, a family winery owned by Jim and Betsy Dolphin that boasts panoramic views of the Northern Virginia mountains in a spacious, contemporary setting. At Delaplane, the wine is tasty and the amenities don't stop at the views: The homemade sausage is excellent and the Dolphins also serve generous portions of olive oil and freshly ground pepper for dipping. On weekends, Delaplane pairs tastings with live jazz. Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge, William's Gap Reserve, and Cabernet Franc. ""All of our wines are made from authentic Virginia grapes,"" according to Delaplane's website. ""Our goal is to craft delicious single vineyard wines."" It must be working. On a recent visit to Delaplane Cellars, the large tasting room was crowded and every table overlooking the mountains was filled. I overheard several people talking about how much they enjoyed the wine, and a couple next to me bought six bottles immediately after their tasting. Don't leave without trying the Cabernet Franc with the homemade sausage; it's a real treat. If you want to bring the kids along, consider Barrel Oak Winery, a family-friendly operation where you can take your own picnic lunch. The winery also offers complimentary juice boxes for children. For red wines only, visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg, Virginia, a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke, the former owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins. The winery features Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Boxwood has received three Decanter Magazine World Wine Awards and has been featured in The Washington Post and Washingtonian Magazine. But for customers seeking a personal touch, there's an unexpected pleasure that comes with visiting Chateau O'Brien: The O'Briens. Howard, a passionate wine expert from New York, and Debbie, a charming businesswoman from Alabama, both enjoy conversing with customers and keeping them smiling. Debbie, who is extremely familiar with the art of wine-making, also prepares snack offerings such as ham and cheese croissants, fine cheese plates, fresh baguettes and gourmet chocolates to pair with wines that age two or three years in French oak barrels. On March 9 and 10, the winery is hosting a St. Patrick's weekend celebration with live Irish music and traditional Irish fare for $25 per person. Since Chateau O'Brien opened in 2006, the O'Briens are fast becoming known for their Tannat, a grape traditionally grown in Southern France and Uruguay. Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates, Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape. O'Brien's Tannat has won awards in New York and internationally. ""We wait for the grapes to become ripe, not when it's convenient to serve the wine,"" O'Brien said. ""It's all about the fruit -- and patience.""

"(CNN) -- A man snowmobiling in Montana died when an avalanche buried him near Big Sky resort, authorities said. Rescue crews were called to the scene after the incident Wednesday afternoon. The man in his 40s was in a group of three snowmobile drivers who triggered the avalanche, said Sheriff Brian Gootkin of Gallatin County. The others suffered minor injuries. The county was under an avalanche warning after 8 inches of snow that was preceded by rain Tuesday evening. ""It was not a good recipe,"" Gootkin said. Authorities suspended recovery efforts for the night and will send a helicopter Thursday morning to retrieve the body.

"(CNN) -- If you're confused about whether the Iran deal is an awe-inspiring breakthrough or a cataclysmic disaster, let me help you: The answer is it depends. It depends on what happens in the coming six months. And not just six months from now, but what happens between now and then: a period during which Iran and the world powers are supposed to abide by the deal they made in Geneva last weekend and work to hammer out a permanent agreement. If the Geneva deal in its current form becomes permanent because the two sides can't get to a final resolution and drag out its current terms (the six-month period is ""renewable by mutual consent,"" says the so-called Joint Plan of Action), then what occurred this weekend will mark a calamitous turning point, triggering a chain of events that brings about the very developments that Obama -- and most of the world -- want to avoid. If the accord indeed proves to be temporary, as President Obama maintains it is, to be followed by a much more stringent agreement that brings a verifiable and credible end to Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons' capability, then we can rightly call it a historic turning point, a milestone to progress. Then, Obama and his secretary of state will deserve enormous credit for their achievement. For now, however, hold off on the awards. The deal has some positive points, but it also has many deeply troubling elements. Remember: Tehran has a track record of dragging out negotiations; negotiations started more than a decade ago. And if the six months start to slip, an arms race in the Middle East is sure to start. The Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, fear a nuclear Iran even more than Israel does. Arabs and Persians are historic rivals, even enemies. Iran's revolutionary regime has a stated purpose of spreading revolution, in direct opposition to the stability and survival of the ruling Gulf regimes. The Gulf states will not sit idly by while Iran continues enriching uranium, especially after the world has repeatedly discovered Iran operating secret nuclear facilities in the past. Once Saudi Arabia and Iran engage in a nuclear arms race, others will jump in. Qatar has a rivalry with Saudi Arabia; Egypt looks askance at Qatar, and Turkey will not want to be left behind. The entire region will be swept up in a feverish pursuit of nuclear technology. If you think adding a nuclear arms race to the extremist ideological maelstrom of the Middle East is like adding fuel to flames, you are wrong: It is like adding dynamite to a raging fire. Many people incorrectly describe the Joint Plan as a freeze on Iran's nuclear program. But it is not. The deal reverses some parts of the program, it freezes others, but it allows progress to continue in two areas. The three most significant achievements of the interim deal are the dismantling of the stockpile of 20% enriched uranium, the stoppage of work in the Arak heavy water reactor that could produce plutonium -- another path to nuclear weapons -- and the introduction of more intrusive monitors by U.N. nuclear inspectors. But the accord does not open up the Parchin facility, where U.N. monitors have already said they suspect Iran is testing ways to weaponize nuclear materials. And the deal, most significantly, allows Iran to continue enriching uranium up to 5% purity. Iran maintains this will become permanent. Washington has given mixed signals on the issue. That is one of the two massive concessions made by the major powers. The U.N. Security Council had demanded that Iran stop enriching uranium. Now the United States and the other five countries have implicitly allowed enrichment to continue in violation of U.N. resolutions. In addition, they have started a rollback of the painstakingly built sanctions' regime. The final comprehensive agreement with Iran will come only if Iran truly has decided to give up on what most of the world believes was a goal of either developing nuclear weapons or getting close enough that it is able to do it in quick order, what is known as ""breakout capability."" Iran's new president. Hassan Rouhani, most certainly has presented a much more conciliatory face to the West. But the real power rests with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose rhetoric remains caustic. Just last week, as talks got started in Geneva, Khamenei lashed out at the United States and said Israel is ""doomed to annihilation."" Is Iran now ready to give up what most countries believe is a nuclear weapons program after decades of investment and after enduring enormous hardship to build it? If so, a deal can certainly be reached. Has Iran perhaps reached a more limited objective, with significant but not complete progress? In that case, it will likely try to bring an end to sanctions while holding on to much of the progress. If that is the case, negotiations will prove enormously difficult, even impossible. Or, will Iran try to cheat? Whatever the answer, it is imperative that the United States be prepared to call out Iran if it finds any violations to the agreement. Otherwise, Obama and the United States risk becoming apologists for the Islamic Republic. Diplomacy requires negotiating with foes, and this is no exception. The Iranian regime is a serial violator of its own people's rights. It is a state sponsor of terrorism, and it is the principal sponsor of extremist militias, such as Hezbollah, and the brutal regime of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. If the United States can prevent Iran's dangerous regime from achieving nuclear weapons capability -- and not just in the short term; if it can prevent an arms race in the region, and it can do so without military action, then the Geneva deal will have proved a triumph. We will find out over the course of the next six months. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Whether Iran deal a breakthrough or disaster depends on next 6 months .

"(CNN) -- Next to Beyonce, the musical surprise of the 2013 holiday shopping season so far is the limited iTunes release of ""The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963."" It's a potential gold-mine excavation: fifty-nine previously obscure tracks, unknown outside the subculture of obsessive collectors. Over on the bookshelves, the recently published first volume of biographer Mark Lewisohn's three-part ""The Beatles: All These Years"" takes up considerable space. Titled ""Tune In,"" the first book offers 944 pages on the iconic group, concluding in 1962 -- before they were famous. Beyond serving as baby boomer stocking stuffers, do these kinds of archaeological digs enhance the Beatles' legacy? Or is pop-culture nostalgia starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel? Never officially released and mostly known to hard-core collectors, the actual music on the ""Bootleg Recordings"" consists of outtakes, live versions and two demos of songs the Beatles wrote for other artists. The motivation for its release is complex, extending beyond immediate sales considerations. Due to a recent European Union ruling, the copyright to this material would expire in 2014 if it remained unreleased. So the sudden appearance of ""Bootleg"" on the marketplace may in part be a legal ploy for Apple Records, the company the Beatles began in 1968. But is there a sizable -- even insatiable -- audience for every bit of the scraps and marginalia of Beatlemania? Overall, the numbers are somewhat surprising. Turns out the Fab Four are still doing major business. In fact, recent profits suggest their customers can't only be co-members of the boomers' aging demographic. According to Forbes magazine, the two surviving members and the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison together and individually earned roughly $71 million in 2013 from record sales, royalties, merchandise and licensing. Earlier this year, the UK trade publication Music Week reported the Beatles' Apple Corp. turned over 43.5 million pounds in 2013, an improvement of 2 million pounds over 2012. While archival releases are only drops in this plentiful bucket, the long-defunct group's persistent popularity serves as a lifeboat for the perpetually struggling music retail business. The ""Bootleg Recordings"" (and ""Tune In"") could put Beatlemaniacs' devotion to the test, however. Ten years in the research and writing, Lewisohn's doorstop tome has been hailed as a labor of love -- and digression. The author's minute attention to detail matches the microscopic focus of ""The Beatles Bootleg Recordings,"" where the only arguable revelations are at best minor finds: Lennon's roughly sung demo tracks of two songs, ""Bad to Me"" and ""I'm in Love,"" later recorded by, respectively, Billy J. Kramer and the Merseybeats. It's hard to imagine the retrieved versions replacing the originals in anyone's affections, but casual fans should be entranced by the behind-the curtains glimpses into the early Beatles working process. Even without producer George Martin's finishing polish, the group's signature high energy and unstoppable melodies come through loud and clear. And in the absence of true surprises, there are plenty of eyebrow-raising moments such as two spunky versions of ""One After 909"" (eventually rerecorded on the ""Let It Be"" album). Apple Records may be protecting the Beatles brand by releasing these curios and preventing further substandard bootleg releases, but even fans may question the wisdom of serving up every leftover and prototype. Even from geniuses. On the other hand, the latest (Volume 10) entry in Bob Dylan's ""Bootleg Series"" came out this year to near-universal acclaim. ""Another Self Portrait (1968-1970)"" retrieves obscurities and alternate versions from one of Dylan's most difficult periods. A bit of thoughtful pruning makes this unearthed archival treasure something more than another clearance sale. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Coleman.","Mark Coleman: ""Bootleg,"" a release of obscure Beatles tracks, is a holiday surprise .

"(CNN) -- The exhumation of three bodies from a Florentine crypt may have brought Italian researchers a step closer to confirming the identity of the woman believed to be the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's famous ""Mona Lisa"" painting, also known as ""La Gioconda."" ""La Gioconda"" refers to Lisa Gherardini, the second wife of a Florentine silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The remains of del Giocondo, his son by Gherardini -- Piero -- and Gherardini's stepson Bartolomeo have been uncovered in their family crypt, the authority of Florence has announced. A team led by Silvano Vinceti accessed the remains beneath the Chapel of the Holy Martyrs, in Florence on August 6, it said in a statement. Last year, Vinceti's team exhumed the remains of eight women from the ruins of a Franciscan convent in Florence where old city records said Gherardini had been buried. A laboratory at the University of Bologna had established that three of the skeletons at the St. Ursula convent were consistent with the age at which Gherardini had died, the statement said. Further carbon testing to establish which of those skeletons dated from the 16th century -- when Gherardini died -- was being carried out at the University of Salento, it quoted Vinceti as saying. If DNA taken from the del Giocondo family remains matched one of the skeletons found in the convent ruins, the skeleton could be confirmed as Gherardini's, he said. Scientists could then reconstruct Gherardini's face and compare it to da Vinci's mysterious portrait. Talking to CNN's Ben Wedeman when the convent skeletons were found last year, Vinceti said the reconstruction would have a margin of error of just 2 to 8% -- once researchers factored in that Gherardini had probably been in her early 20s when she posed for da Vinci. Read more: Researchers hope to uncover who's behind 'Mona Lisa' smile . Vinceti told Wedeman he was certain that da Vinci had been commissioned to paint a portrait of Gherardini but could not be sure that the ""Mona Lisa"" was of her, or just contained some of her features. For starters, the famous smile was not Gherardini's, he said. Analysis of the ""Mona Lisa"" had shown that ""when Leonardo began painting the model in front of him, he did not draw that metaphysical, ironic, poignant, elusive smile, but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed."" A reconstruction would finally answer the question art historians had been unable to resolve, Vinceti said: ""Who was the model for Leonardo?""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. and NATO have been quietly talking to National Transitional Council officials for the last several weeks about securing Libya's remaining stockpiles of mustard gas and other weapons material in the event the Gadhafi regime fell, U.S. officials confirm. Topping the list of worries is Libya's stockpile of mustard gas. ""The opposition forces are being asked to keep track of what's going on"" with both weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the regime's inventory of surface-to-air missiles, a NATO official said. ""We have had direct eyes on the storage facilities"" of the WMD for some time, the official said, including the use of satellites, drones and other surveillance aircraft. The official also confirmed that intelligence personnel from the U.S. and other countries have been in Libya in recent weeks to help maintain security at various sites, although he could not confirm Western personnel are currently at those locations. ""Individual nations have folks on the ground,"" he said. A U.S. official also confirmed U.S. intelligence personnel have been involved in monitoring WMD stockpiles inside Libya. Both officials declined to be identified because of sensitive intelligence matters. ""We hope those items don't get out of control"" of the NTC, the U.S. official said. He also noted the U.S. and NATO have told the NTC that now that it has been recognized by many countries, its personnel must conduct themselves within the realm of international law. Congress is already underscoring the worry. ""In particular, we must ensure that (Moammar) Gadhafi's stockpiles of advanced weapons, chemical weapons and explosives don't fall into the wrong hands,"" said Congressman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee in a press statement. Rogers is also concerned about the Libyan inventory of anti tank rockets and plastic explosives. CNN reported earlier this year that Libya still has approximately 10 tons of the deadly blister agent left in its arsenal, according to an assessment from the Arms Control Association. Much of the material has been located at the Rabta chemical weapons facility south of Tripoli. In 2003, Libya agreed to destroy its entire chemical weapons arsenal, which included some 25 tons of mustard gas and 3,300 empty aerial bombs. The entire stock of shells and bombs was literally crushed by bulldozers in 2004. U.S. officials say any chemical weapons material that remains in Libya would be difficult to ""weaponize"" into a form that could be used to conduct attacks, and it's not clear Libyan forces would follow any orders to conduct such attacks.","Nations have been monitoring missiles, mustard gas .

"(Parenting) -- With my 3-year-old twins in tow, I navigated several steep flights of subway stairs, managed four train transfers, and arrived safely at the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. I took photos of them in front of the giant Apatosaurus skeleton and imparted (probably erroneous, but who cares?) facts about the Jurassic era. I am the best. Mother. Ever! To top off the special day, I decided to treat them to an educational toy at the gift shop. My son Theo wanted an astronaut, so I brought him to the space display and let him choose between three astronaut-themed items (I'm so smart to give my preschooler a sense of control by offering him a choice!). ""No, astronaut!"" he began to whine. ""This is an astronaut,"" I said brightly, pointing to one of the helmeted play figures. ""No!"" He then slapped all the items out of my hand and began screaming. Ten minutes later, after Theo had stomped on a dozen packages of freeze-dried ice cream, I tucked one boy under each arm and staggered out. I am the worst mother ever, I said to myself, embarrassed, drained, and near tears. 5 Tantrum Stoppers That Actually Work . Turns out, the scene at the museum was not all my fault, and it doesn't mean my boy is ""bad,"" either. Michael Potegal, Ph.D., a pediatric neuropsychologist at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, has spent the latest part of his professional career studying tantrums and how and why young children have such brutally emotional explosions. And what has he learned in that time? That their outbursts are as normal a biological response to anger and frustration as a yawn is to fatigue. So normal, in fact, that you can make a science out of the progression of a tantrum and predict one down to the second. Kids from about 18 months to 4 years are simply hardwired to misbehave, he says. And that means ""nurture"" (i.e., you) isn't always to blame. 8 Discipline Mistakes Parents Make . The mush behind the madness: Your tot's noggin . Let's take a quick tour of the human brain, stopping at a little blob of gray matter behind the eyebrows called the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is the part of the brain that regulates emotion and controls social behavior. It's also the last area of the brain to develop; it has only just begun to mature at age 4. That immaturity -- as difficult as it makes parenting a toddler or a preschooler -- may serve an important developmental role in the acquisition of language (the most significant social tool humans have), says a new report out of the University of Pennsylvania. The authors posit that the underdeveloped PFC is what allows young children to master a new language much more easily than adults. Simply put, our kids' more disagreeable behavior may be an evolutionary trade-off for the sake of human communication. How Gross is It? Your Germiest Situations Analyzed . Okay, so they've got these mushy brain parts that make them prone to outbursts and irrational displays of emotion, but there's another factor at play in the toddler/preschooler's often difficult behavior: stress. ""Kids this age think magically, not logically,"" explains Gina Mireault, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Johnson State College, in Vermont. ""Events that are ordinary to us are confusing and scary to them. They don't understand that the bathtub drain won't swallow them or that their uncle can't really snatch their nose."" And if you're not sure whether or not a simple bath will end in your demise, needless to say, you're going to feel pretty confused and prone to anxiety -- on a daily basis. How to Say Goodbye to Mom Guilt . This feeling of heightened arousal causes our bodies to release cortisol, known as the ""fight or flight"" hormone. Maybe it should be called ""tantrum juice:"" Cortisol increases blood pressure, speeds up breathing rates, and may lead to confused or unclear thinking (sound like anyone you know?). This anxiety is developmentally typical in moderation, but chronic anxiety or stress -- Is my stuffed Tigger going to come alive and eat me? -- is not; it can turn kids into virtual bundles of kindling primed to ignite at the slightest provocation. How to handle a tasmanian tot . The next time your child has an episode, Potegal recommends asking yourself ""What function does this inappropriate behavior serve?"" If your tyke is looking for attention or a ""tangible"" (toy, food, or other treat), the best response is to ignore the behavior and maintain your own emotional composure. My friend Mana Heydarpour of New York City learned this lesson the hard way: When she told her strong-willed 3-year-old, Ella, that she couldn't watch her favorite TV show, she screamed, ""I don't like you! I'm so disappointed with you!"" ""It made my blood boil so much that I couldn't help yelling back at her,"" Heydarpour says. As a result, Ella's fit lasted for half an hour. Potegal calls this the Anger Trap. ""If you get just as mad and irrational as your child, it's like throwing gas on a fire,"" he says. How to Be a Take Charge Mom . But he warns of another trap, too: the Sadness Trap. ""When you comfort a child in the middle of a tantrum, you reinforce the behavior. Instead, say 'I'm sorry you're upset. When you calm down, I'll give you a hug and we can talk about what happened.'"" This way, you offer support and sympathy while still showing your tot how to regulate his emotions. ""Since that meltdown, I've learned to say 'I'm not talking to you while you're behaving like this,'"" Heydarpour says. ""Ella composes herself so much faster when I manage to do that."" But the above strategy doesn't apply to an ""escape"" tantrum: a child going bonkers because he doesn't want to do whatever it is you want him to (clean up, sit at the table, etc.). In this case, ignoring him gives him what he wants: You're no longer demanding that he wear his coat, or whatever it is that needs to be done. Putting him in a time-out chair doesn't work, either, since that's time he's not putting on his jacket. ""Every second he's not complying, he's winning,"" says Potegal. Instead, tell your kid that if he doesn't get dressed in five seconds, you're going to put your hands on his and do it together. If your tiny rebel makes no move after the five seconds are up, which he won't at first, take his hands in yours and gently force the coat on. ""It's not meant to be pleasant,"" admits Potegal, but it should never include physical harm. If your child begins to slap or bite you, continue putting the coat on and then put him in time-out (or take away a privilege, if that's your standard discipline tactic). That way, your child sees he still has to wear the coat (so his protests were ineffective) and now has an additional consequence for his unacceptable behavior. Toddlers are a literal force of nature who confound even the most calm and prepared. But there's a silver lining to these flop-and-flail-filled years: Just as kids can quickly slip into anger and sadness, so can they slip out of them. The average tantrum lasts about three minutes, according to Potegal's research. That's why, shortly after a tantrum, your kid is back to playing as if nothing happened, while you're still quaking from the event a half hour later. His immature PFC (that mushy part responsible for social cues) allows him to move on without dwelling on past hurts. ""Toddlers can transition from sad to happy and from angry to calm incredibly easily,"" says Potegal. So enjoy that post-freak-out cuddle, and gird yourself for the next round.

"(CNN) -- He spends most of his time playing golf courses all over the world, but Sergio Garcia's thoughts are never too far away from what's happening on a football pitch much closer to home. For the past seven years, Garcia has been president and part-time player at CF Borriol, his hometown club in the province of Castellon on Spain's east coast. ""It's good fun and whenever I'm around I get to practice with them a little bit and play a little bit here and there. This season, I've played probably five games, so not a lot, but I enjoy it,"" Garcia told CNN's Living Golf show. ""As any good Spaniard will tell you, we love football. Sport in general in Spain has been great for the last 10 years or so, but football has been great with the Euro Cups (wins in 2008 & 2012) and the World Cup (in 2010)."" The 33-year-old is a long-term supporter of Real Madrid, but his domestic allegiances have always been divided between the Bernabeu and Borriol's more modest 1,000-seater stadium, where his attachment is not only emotional but financial. Garcia's business involvement with Borriol began in 2003, explains club vice-president, Pedro Fernandez, when one of his friends persuaded him to help out. Three years later, Garcia was installed as club president of the club, which plays in group six of Spain's third division and now has more than 150 members. ""We put together a working group headed by Sergio, as president, his brother Victor and other friends. We make all the management decisions as it relates to the team,"" said Fernandez. ""Sergio has done a tremendous job in the past seven years to create a football academy for Borriol's young boys and girls. ""CF Borriol's goal is to expand the academy and hopefully promote players from the junior teams to the first team."" Spain's dominance of international football and Barcelona's European Champions League success in recent years has been attributed to strong grassroots support for the game. Borriol captain Raul Caballero says Garcia's assistance has been key to the club's prosperity. ""It is very exciting and refreshing to see Sergio and his team support and work for the team. It is just a group of friends who love football and they have a common goal to see the team succeed,"" Caballero said. ""The team would not be here if it was not for Sergio's involvement, so hopefully he will be around for a long time to support the club and the village."" Garcia made his playing debut for CF Borriol in September 2010. Swapping golf shoes for football boots is something he does whenever his schedule permits, as it helps him to relax. ""Playing football is not as much pressure because you don't have that much time to think ... everything is quicker, faster and you are moving all the time,"" said Garcia. ""I have always enjoyed being part of a team and sharing things with your teammates."" Garcia will be looking to rejoin his golfing teammates at next year's Ryder Cup in Gleneagles, Scotland where, if selected, he will make a seventh appearance for Europe in the biennial match against the U.S. For now, Garcia will be reflecting on mixed fortunes in 2013. The season was largely overshadowed by the public spat with Tiger Woods at the Players Championship in May -- a precursor to some unsavory comments about the world No. 1 during a private dinner at Wentworth later that month for which he subsequently apologized. But at least the Spaniard has ended the season on a high, lifting his first trophy of the year with a win at the Thailand Golf Championship earlier this month -- a result that took Garcia back into the world's top 10. As golfers around the world take a break for Christmas, Garcia will be keen to recharge his golfing batteries in the way he knows best -- indulging his other sporting passions. ""I've always said I couldn't just do golf by itself,"" he said. ""I would probably get tired of it quickly. I obviously play football, tennis, paddle tennis and I love watching Formula One on TV and obviously watching football too. ""I love my sports and try to keep as busy as I can with them.""

"(CNN) -- According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription drug overdose deaths in Florida are up a staggering 265% since 2003. But it's not just the deaths that have Florida officials worried; it's the births. ""We saw the number of crack babies that died, and this is just another version of that,"" Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti said. ""We all need to be concerned."" According to state health records, nearly 1,400 Florida babies were born suffering from drug withdrawal syndrome in 2010, a fourfold increase since 2003. The state does not track the specific drug the babies are hooked on, but south Florida doctors and neonatal nurses believe the increase is due to a sharp increase in pregnant women addicted to prescription drugs. ""They go through withdrawal symptoms,"" said Mary Osuch, the head nurse at Broward General Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit. ""They're crampy, miserable. They sweat. They can have rapid breathing. Sometimes, they can even have seizures."" According to the White House Office on Drug Control Policy, prescription drug abuse is the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. Marsha Currant, who runs the Susan B. Anthony Recovery Center near Fort Lauderdale, says prescription drug addiction overtook crack in 2009 as the main problem afflicting the pregnant women who are treated there. ""In the very beginning, it was really 100% crack cocaine,"" said Currant, who started keeping track of drug trends in 1995. ""We see a lot more prescription drugs now."" Currant says new mothers who are hooked on prescription drugs are often reluctant to seek help for fear the authorities will take their babies from them. ""We wanted to have a place where women didn't have to chose between getting treatment and having their children go into foster care,"" she said. Compounding the problem, women who are addicted to prescription drugs and find themselves pregnant cannot safely go off the drugs without medical supervision. They need to be weaned off slowly, or the baby will go into withdrawal in the womb. At the Susan B. Anthony Center, one mother who became hooked on prescription drugs after her husband died says she felt her baby suffering while she was getting clean. ""I know that I'm going through stuff getting off the pills. So what's she going through? She can't talk. She's just a baby,"" Jessica said. Thanks to the center, Jessica was weaned off oxycodone before her baby, Casey, was born. But she fears the long-term effects of her drug abuse on her daughter, who has been suffering from respiratory problems. ""I want to make sure that she doesn't hurt anymore,"" Jessica said. ""She doesn't deserve that, because she's a princess."" Jessica graduated from the center's recovery program last week.","Hundreds of Florida babies have been born addicted to drugs .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British woman won a major legal victory Thursday in her fight to die with her husband by her side if she travels abroad for assisted suicide. Debbie Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband, Omar Puente. Debbie Purdy, 46, who has multiple sclerosis, has been waging a lengthy legal battle to clarify Britain's ambiguous laws on assisted suicide. The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled in her favor on Thursday, ordering the country's director of public prosecutions to spell out the criteria under which it will seek to prosecute someone who helps another person commit suicide. ""I'm ecstatic,"" Purdy said in a statement issued by the campaign organization Dignity in Dying. ""I want to live my life to the full, but I don't want to suffer unnecessarily at the end of my life. This decision means that I can make an informed choice, with Omar (Puente, her husband), about whether he travels abroad with me to end my life.""  Watch Purdy react to the ruling » . Purdy had been suing to force the British authorities to specify exactly when someone would be prosecuted for helping another person commit suicide. What's your view? When is assisted suicide acceptable? Doing so is technically illegal under a 1961 law, and anyone found guilty faces up to 14 years in prison. But the Director of Public Prosecutions has the discretion to choose whether or not to prosecute. The law doesn't make clear at what point a person has broken it -- whether it is illegal to sit with a person on the plane to the clinic, open the door of the car to the airport, or even help them arrange the trip. No one has ever been prosecuted for the crime in the United Kingdom. Lord James Hope of Craighead, in his ruling on the case, emphasized that the verdict did not grant Purdy's husband immunity from prosecution. The court did not rule on the 1961 Suicide Act at all, he pointed out. ""It is no part of our function to change the law in order to decriminalize assisted suicide,"" he wrote. ""If changes are to be made, as to which I express no opinion, this must be a matter for Parliament."" Purdy had spent more than two years fighting the case through Britain's courts, arguing that the lack of clarity in the law violated her human rights. The House of Lords ruled in her favor, in its final case as Britain's highest court. A new Supreme Court will come into being in the fall, replacing the old system under which some members of the House of Lords, the Law Lords, rule on cases on behalf of the entire chamber. Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband. Before the ruling in her favor, she had said she would travel abroad on her own to die if she lost the case, so her husband would be sure not to face prosecution. That would have meant Purdy would die alone. The courts ruled the other way in a similar case eight years ago. British and European courts refused to guarantee that the husband of Diane Pretty would not be prosecuted for helping her to travel abroad to end her life. She died in England after motor neuron disease, an incurable degenerative disease, caused respiratory failure in May 2002.","British woman wins case over traveling abroad for assisted suicide.

"(CNN) -- Randy Travis's publicist denied media reports that the country singer had heart surgery, but he did say Tuesday that Travis received a device to help blood flow. Travis, 54, was admitted to an unidentified Texas hospital on Sunday because of complications related to his ""recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy,"" Travis spokesman Kirt Webster said in a written statement. Travis remained in critical condition Tuesday, Webster said. The singer ""underwent the placement of an Impella peripheral left ventricular assist device for stabilization prior to transferring hospitals."" The Mayo Clinic's website described the device as ""an implantable mechanical pump that helps pump blood from the lower chambers of your heart to the rest of your body."" Travis had recently been on the road, performing in Detroit on June 28 and Chicago on June 29.  He was set to do a show in Deadwood, South Dakota, on Wednesday. He appeared well during business meetings on Friday and Saturday, Webster said.  ""Then on Sunday, it hit him."" Viral cardiomyopathy is a disorder where a virus attacks the muscles of the heart, causing the heart to beat slower, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.  In some cases, the heart can stop, it said. ""Viral cardiomyopathy can be caused by 30-plus different viruses, but it's almost impossible to pinpoint which virus it is,"" said Dr. Ramin Oskoui, a cardiologist and internal medicine specialist in Washington. ""Hospitals use viral cardiomyopathy as a 'catch all' diagnosis."" Travis had a tough year in 2012 with arrests for assault and public intoxication, which earned him probation. ""To say that Mr. Travis' alcohol use exacerbated his problems would be pure speculation, but if someone told me alcohol played a role in his cardiac problems, I wouldn't be surprised,"" Oskoui said. Travis was at the forefront of the ""New Traditionalist"" movement in the 1980s and 1990s, but he faded as the '90s wore on. He made a comeback after turning to gospel music in 1999. His song ""Three Wooden Crosses"" won song of the year in 2003 from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. As one of country music's top-selling artists, Travis has won seven Grammys, 10 Academy of Country Music awards and 10 American Music Award statuettes. His best-known songs also include ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" ""Diggin' Up Bones"" and ""Deeper Than the Holler.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- One year in the job as the Chinese Communist Party supremo, Xi Jinping so far has presided over a relatively smooth transition of leadership. But what is his vision for the next 10 years, when he is expected to serve as paramount leader? No one has a crystal ball that gives definitive clues. In the first few months since he took power, Xi has pushed a popular and arguably progressive agenda: attacking corruption, not just flies (junior officials) but a few tigers (senior officials) too; curbing official extravagance, like senseless banqueting, and, one of my favorites, banning ""empty speeches."" But in recent weeks, Xi has turned ""left"". He allowed tighter control over the traditional and social media, silenced dissenting voices among academics and scholars, and cracked down on liberal activists, petitioners and protesters. At the same time, Xi has paid homage to Chairman Mao Zedong and some of his preaching. He visited a few revolutionary shrines, endorsed the Maoist practices of ""criticism and self-criticism"" -- ostensibly to purify the party ranks -- and advocated ""mass line"" campaigns to improve the party's popularity among the people. Analysts wonder: Is Xi a Maoist or a Dengist? Is he a conservative or a reformist? Clearly, Xi is not a Chairman Mao nor a Deng Xiaoping. Like his two predecessors -- Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- Xi is not a legendary revolutionary figure who can command absolute loyalty. In the current political system, he is merely a primus inter pares -- first among equals, who leads by consensus. Left or right? Like Deng, Xi may not have to seek absolute dominance, a la Mao, to be an effective leader. Instead, he may just seek to find the center of the debate. Still, unless and until there is fundamental political reform, China will remain a nation more dependent on the power of a single leader, a charismatic strongman, than on institutions. Friends in China asked me these same questions, and my honest answer is: no one knows for sure, but I think Xi is signaling ""left"" so he can turn ""right"". Expectations of Xi were high on the eve of the Third Plenum of the Communist Party's central committee, China's 300-plus political elite, who last week met behind closed doors in Beijing. Sinologists had drawn parallels to the Third Plenum in 1978, a landmark meeting that launched Deng Xiaoping's reform and open-door program. Chinese media accounts on documents approved during the plenum signal significant changes: . Prickly issues . China's top leaders have been deliberating these prickly issues for years, but decisions have been put off for lack of consensus or political will. That Xi was able to push these through this time, analysts say, indicates Xi's growing influence. The Plenum has also agreed to set up two new institutions: the Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Economic Reform and the National Security Commission. The security commission will be a supra-ministerial body that will take charge of over-arching security issues, including military and police matters, territorial disputes, cyber-attacks and ethnic unrest. Xi is expected to play a leading role in the two groups, even though Premier Li Keqiang may head the economic reform commission. These institutions, analysts say, will allow Xi and his team to supervise the complex and often conflicting bureaucracies -- the Communist Party, the government, the military and police in a top-down authoritarian way. Proponents of reform sound optimistic. Endorsements . The plenum gives market forces a ""decisive role"" that will allow enterprises and individuals to invest more overseas, economist Wang Zhile, an expert on international business and trade told me. The most significant endorsement came from Wu Jinglian, the octogenarian guru of the Deng's reform program who also served as doctoral degree adviser of Premier Li Keqiang at Peking University. Speaking in Beijing this week, Wu said the system set up by China in 1978 when China embarked on reform and opening was ""the initial primary-stage version of market economy for the late 21st century, which still took on many vestiges of the old system."" The one put forth by Xi, he said, is ""an upgraded version for a more mature market economy system that suits the current demands."" But analysts also caution against excessive optimism. It will take longer than expected to make these reforms work, says economist Cheng Siwei, using the Chinese maxim ""Bu pa man, zhi pa zhan"" -- slowing down is not worrisome; a standstill is. Three decades ago, the late Communist leader Chen Yun, a contemporary of Deng Xiaoping, likened the Chinese economy to a bird and the Chinese political system to a bird cage. While the cage may be enlarged to let the bird fly more freely, Chen argued, it must never be discarded. Xi and his cohorts seem to agree on that .","Far-reaching reform package indicates Xi Jinping's growing influence .
But reforms come as Xi tightens media controls and pays homage to Mao Zedong .

"(CNN) -- Using peaceful means to deal with pro-Western protesters ""remain futile,"" Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Saturday. Interior Minister Vitaly Zaharchenko accuses Oleg Layashko, leader of Ukraine's Radical Democratic Party, of calling for attacks on law enforcement. ""As a result a policeman has been killed with a shot in the head overnight, and three other policemen have been captured by protester,"" he said in a statement. He accused protesters of accumulating weapons and ammunition. Talks between Ukraine's government and leaders from three other opposition parties over the past few days have gone nowhere. Protests against the government began in November when President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union in favor of stronger economic ties with Russia. The opposition is demanding the resignation of the government and early elections, but the government has so far refused and in turn accuses the opposition of creating a climate for extremist behavior. Hundreds of protesters continue their vigil in Kiev's Independence square and surrounding streets where they set up a tent cities and put up barricades. Large plumes of black smoke billowed up from the barricades Saturday as riot police watched and waited nearby. Early Friday the Interior Ministry said that if protesters left the street where the violence has been focused, police would not seek to prosecute them and promised police would not use force against those rallying in Kiev's Independence Square. The European Union is now trying to end the growing stalemate. EU representative Stefan Fule met with Yanukovych and opposition leaders Friday and Saturday. ""My talks in Kiev showed the need for a series of concrete steps to first start to rebuild trust of people by stopping the spiral of violence and intimidation,"" he said. Fule's talks were only a precursor to a scheduled visit next week by the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and a European Parliament delegation.","Dealing peacefully with protesters is ""futile"" said Ukraine's interior minister .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- An American father jailed in Tokyo has been harshly treated, his attorney said Monday, while Japanese authorities said he is getting ""special"" treatment. Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. Attorney Jeremy Morley, in a statement released Monday, said Christopher Savoie -- accused of trying to kidnap his children after his ex-wife took them to Japan -- is being held without trial, interrogated without an attorney present and denied needed medical treatment for high blood pressure.   Savoie has also been exposed to sleep deprivation, and denied private meetings with attorneys and phone calls to his wife, according to Morley, who said the way his client has been treated amounts to ""torture.""   He acknowledged that some of the claims are based on second-hand information from Savoie's wife, Amy, saying she has communicated with people familiar with her husband's case. Police in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan where Savoie is being held, denied the allegations in Morley's statement, saying Savoie gets regular visits by a physician and medicine as prescribed. A Yanagawa police officer, who declined to give his name citing departmental policy, told CNN that Savoie, like any other detainee, has a ""dim"" light in his cell for safety, and is assured to get 8 hours of sleep a day. Savoie is being questioned -- with an interpreter -- within the boundaries of Japanese law, which allows for suspects to be interviewed without the presence of an attorney, the officer said. The law also permits several rounds of questioning for hours on end, the officer said. The officer said Savoie is allowed ""frequent"" visits with his defense attorney in Japan and is generally given ""special"" treatment due to the nature of his case, the officer said. ""If you call this 'torture,' what can we say?"" the officer said. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, lived in Japan, but had moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court then granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and life-long break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said. And, Japanese authorities say, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.","Official in Japan denies ""torture,"" says dad is receiving ""special"" treatment .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- An American soldier turned private security contractor -- who had been detained on weapons-related charges in the United Arab Emirates -- said he knows that he broke the law, but does not understand why the courts took months to review his case while he sat in jail. ""I understand the why, the things that I had were in violations of the laws,"" said Corporal Nicholas Moody. ""Okay, I get that... Why I was held for two months before I even got a day in court, I have no idea."" Charges against the 23 year-old security contractor were dismissed Monday, said his attorney Melhem Sharrouf. Moody, from Nevada, was arrested September 29 during an 18-hour layover in Abu Dhabi while heading back from Iraq. He was charged with possession of weapons accessories -- parts that could accompany a gun, though no firearm itself -- which is illegal in the UAE. ""I was going through security and at the last security checkpoint before getting on the plane... they scanned my bags and determined that the items I have were in violations of their laws and they arrested me,"" Moody told CNN. Moody said he used the items ""in my work as my security guard, and that is why I had them on me because I was just travelling home from a job."" The items included a pistol grip, a buttstock, a plastic front grip, a single-point sling adaptor, a buckle from a single point sling, a cleaning kit and an armorer's wrench. ""I didn't think something like that would be a problem."" he said. Moody said the items were in his possession because he had recently resigned his position in Iraq and they were his personal property. Moody, who has served in Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of the California and then Nevada National Guards, had been released from jail on bail, but it was uncertain when he would be allowed to leave the United Arab Emirates. Moody's visa expired while he was in jail and his passport was being held by the government, his attorneys said. He would need to renew his visa before he could leave. Those who created a support website on Facebook rejoiced about the development in the case. More than 2,500 people have expressed support to the ""Help Bring Nick Moody Back Home"" site on Facebook. ""NICK'S CASE WAS DISMISSED!!!!!!!!!! The paperwork will take a couple days, then travel arrangements will be made for Nick to come home! THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE LOVE, LETTERS, SUPPORT, PRAYERS AND POSITIVE ENERGY!"" the site said. In a November interview, Moody's mother, Lorina Moody, said she was still coming to grips with how he landed in jail. ""Our son is the type of individual who would not have willingly broken the law,"" said Lorina Moody of Susanville, California. ""It seems so ironic that a man who, after serving our country in two combat zones ... is the one who got pulled aside,"" she said. After graduating from high school in 2005, Nicholas Moody enrolled in the California National Guard and, for a time, served in Iraq, according to his mother. He later moved to Reno, intending to attend the University of Nevada campus there, and joined the Nevada National Guard. Nicholas Moody became an inactive Guardsman when he took his latest job in Iraq with a security company, which Lorina Moody declined to name. In that interview Moody said: ""I'm hoping there's a still a chance that this will be resolved in time to make it home to spend Christmas with my family.""

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray's first match since undergoing back surgery in September ended in a straight sets defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi Thursday. The reigning Wimbledon champion went down 7-5 6-3 to the Frenchman, who himself was plagued by injury at the back end of this year. Murray, who has dropped to No.4 in the rankings, lacked sharpness after his layoff and was broken in the 12th game of the opening set to fall behind. The British star has been training at his base in Florida to prepare for the upcoming season and looked set to even the match up when he gained an early break of service in the second set. But Tsonga hit back with two breaks of his own to wrap up victory in 72 minutes at the Zayed Sports City complex. ""The courts here are very fast and you have to react quickly,"" said 26-year-old Murray. ""Jo was sharper than me today, he served very well. ""It's always good fun here. It's great preparation for the season as you have to play against the best in the world."" The organizers of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship have indeed attracted a stellar field with the top two ranked players, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in the line-up. David Ferrer of Spain won the opening match Thursday as he beat Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 7-5 6-1 to set up a semifinal clash against compatriot Nadal. Tsonga's win over Murray has earned him a match against Serbia's Djokovic, while Murray will gain much-needed match practice against Wawrinka in the fifth place playoff. Murray, recently voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year back in the UK, became the first British man to win the Wimbledon title in 77 years when he triumphed at the All England Club back in July, but his season took a turn for the worse as he became troubled by a long-standing back problem.","Andy Murray falls to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi .

"(CNN) -- Zora O'Neill is heading to the Middle East next week. O'Neill, a longtime traveler and author of an upcoming Lonely Planet book on Egypt, is not dissuaded by the evacuation of the U.S. and British embassies in Syria, rumblings of possible Israeli airstrikes against Iran or rioting in Cairo. And it's not because she's reckless. She's heading to the United Arab Emirates and Oman for a month's stay to report on a book about Arab language and culture in the Middle East. After her work there, she'll head to Lebanon for more reporting. ""They're totally out of the fray,"" O'Neill says. ""Americans tend to think about the Middle East as all one big country, but each place is distinct and has its own issues."" With violence in Syria and Egypt escalating and a new travel warning for Syria issued Tuesday, nervous American travelers will likely choose to avoid the entire Middle East right now. However, Middle East travel experts say that plenty of the region's diverse destinations are still open for business and welcoming foreign visitors. Know your tolerance level . Don't go if you're a worrywart and can't enjoy your trip. Knowing there are no guarantees, travelers who get nervous when a car backfires may not enjoy the Middle East. ""If you want to live life at the fullest, you have to take chances,"" says Worldview Travel founder Ricci Zukerman, whether it's traveling to Israel or Bali or the Philippines. ""Those who are afraid have to stay home and hope a plane doesn't fall on their house."" Consider a country that's calm, such as the United Arab Emirates or Oman, where travel agent Lindsey Wallace continues to send clients. ""We're sending lots of clients who switched their plans from Egypt and still want to go to the desert and have fun,"" says Wallace, president of Linara Travel in Eagle, Idaho. ""Those two destinations are largely unaffected (from the recent unrest) or have even benefited from it."" In addition to Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon, countries such as Jordan and Israel are relatively safe right now. (Morocco, though not part of the Middle East, is an Arabic-speaking nation and suffers from reduced tourism when there are difficulties in the Middle East. It is also considered safe for travel.) Israel is famous for not being loved by its neighbors, which means travelers there can expect a heightened state of security at all times, Zukerman says. From the time your bags are checked at the airport to guards checking your car at your hotel, everyone's senses are heightened. That can make travel there safer because everyone knows to call police when he sees a suspicious package or unusual gathering of people. ""If your guide says don't go to Bethlehem today, don't be a smart guy and go anyway,"" Zukerman says. ""Don't go. Most of the time it's a false alarm and that's OK."" The payoff of visiting one of the world's holiest places is worth the heightened security, she says. ""Jews come to see where it all started and Christians to feel holy,"" she says. ""I hear the same thing over and over when people come home. 'I'm not the same person. It was a life-changing experience.' It's worth the little bit of insecurity."" Safe doesn't mean easy . Whether you're going to Egypt to explore the pyramids without competition from other tourists or prefer to talk to locals about the emergence of democracy, O'Neill says it's possible to avoid that country's trouble spots. Traveling there last fall during the uprisings, she found herself sharing the pyramids with a scattering of Chinese and Egyptian tourists instead of the usual overwhelming crowds. ""If you want to check out some serious archaeological, ancient stuff, it's a great opportunity to be in the middle of history,"" she says. Though violent protests continue in Egypt, O'Neill says most of Cairo is safe, as long as you don't get near the demonstrations. That means people wanting to travel to Cairo right now need to know the layout of the city more than those flying directly to Luxor to see King Tut's tomb. Or they need to hire a reputable tour operator who knows where to take them. Even without unrest, independent travel is a constant negotiation. Gone are the days when you could walk the streets of Cairo without concern for your wallet. Pickpockets are out and about, and O'Neill had a hard time avoiding vendors trying to sell her mini-replicas of alabaster pyramids and books about Nefertiti. ""People are always wanting to sell you stuff, and that's true no matter when you go,"" she says. That's why travel agent Malaka Hilton prefers to have control of her guests' entire travel package from start to finish, knowing they'll be with guides and drivers she trusts. Hilton, an Egypt specialist who owns Admiral Travel International in Sarasota, Florida, is still booking clients to the Middle East, alerting them that they'll see bomb-sniffing dogs at hotels, armed guards and other security measures. If you are visiting a conservative religious country or section of the country, be aware of cultural norms and dress modestly. Don't be fooled by locals wearing Western-style clothing. It may be Western design but still modest in its coverage. Ask your travel agent about exceptions to the rule for beach resorts. ""I do tell people from a dress code standard to be respectful of the religion,"" Hilton says. ""Don't show shoulders and don't wear short shorts. You don't want the men or women to stare at you."" Government travel warnings . Make sure you review and discuss relevant safety warnings with travel providers as you're booking a trip to the Middle East. The U.S. State Department lists its travel warnings online. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office offers detailed information and advice about threats to traveler safety in the region on its website.","Clashes in Syria and Egypt have some travelers worried about the entire region .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hope was afoot in Times Square during the third annual Good Riddance Day -- the unofficial holiday on which luck-strapped individuals are encouraged to rid themselves of the ending year's setbacks and prepare for the future. ""We decided that people should have time to get over any regrets before New Year's Eve, so a day like this makes sense,"" said Lori Raimondo, the vice president of marketing for the Times Square Alliance and creator of the event. ""We hope one day it becomes a national holiday,"" she said. Hundreds of hard-knock-yet-resilient participants on Monday were handed black markers and white sheets of paper emblazoned with ""I want to say good riddance to,"" and encouraged to write down their problems. Some also brought old credit card bills or pictures of fizzled out flames. Celebrants were then instructed to throw the sheets and papers and photos into an industrial-size paper shredder. To many, if only symbolically, it offered a palpable release of personal burdens and struggles from the past year. ""There's something about writing problems down and releasing them,"" said Rama Mandel, 45, from the Bronx. ""There's a freedom you feel that just puts you beyond the things holding you back."" Mandel, who works with children with special needs, wrote down three words -- resentment, procrastination and fear -- on three red pieces of construction paper. ""I'm going to replace those words with 'power, action and faith,' "" she said. ""This is a new beginning."" Liz McCarvill, 44, from the Manhattan's West Village, admitted that she visited the event to post it on her blog. However, she was inspired by the concept and decided to participate. ""I just want to say goodbye to preconceived ideas and things that hold me back sometimes,"" said McCarvill. ""It's a great time for a new start."" Tian Donghai, 25, of China, said he studies computer science at Penn State University. About seven months ago, he was rushed to the hospital after a blood clot appeared above his right eye, he said. ""My friends were terrified,"" said Donghai. ""So this year, I say good riddance to poor health."" Some people used the opportunity to remember the loss of a loved one. Sue Domino, 45, was with her family when she wrote the name of her mother, Constance Rose Trainer, who at 73, died suddenly in October of a stomach aneurism. Her mother, who lived in Pennsylvania, had never seen Times Square. ""She would have just loved to see this,"" said Domino. ""She was supposed to be here with us."" Participation in the event appeared to be up this year, said Minerva Martinez, a spokeswoman for the Times Square Alliance. She attributed its popularity to Facebook and Twitter alerts. ""It's definitely getting viral,"" said Martinez. ""I think people can really use this to get on with their lives."" Many participants admitted that with New Year's Eve looming, the thought of the one that got away is still a staple in last year's regrets. ""No matter what the state of the economy or joblessness, people always move on from past relationships,"" said Raimondo. ""There are a lot of ex-boyfriends' names being shredded right now."" Tina Wong, 33, from Harlem, said after a series of bad dates this year that left her wondering if there are any good men in the city, so she says ""good riddance"" to bad dates. Experts say the benefits of destroying a past memory on paper in hopes to expedite the recovery is debatable. David Amodio, an assistant professor of psychology at New York University, said that writing down trivial things and then destroying the writing be an effective way of moving on. However, the technique losses effectiveness when dealing with more substantial life changes. ""If you robbed a bank and wrote it down on paper and threw it away, it probably doesn't help you all that much,"" said Amodio. ""I think the same applies here.""","Hundreds show up in Times Square to get rid of 2009 regrets .

"(EW.com) -- Have you picked your jaws up off the floor yet, Gladiators? If so, well done. Indeed, it was probably a fairly Herculean task considering all the mind-blowing revelations in ""Scandal's"" twisty season 3 premiere. Though several one-on-one scenes took Liv away from her trusted Gladiators for much of the opener, you can be sure this thick-as-thieves crew will be facing the onslaught together in weeks to come. EW talked with three of Liv's fixers — Katie Lowes, Guillermo Díaz and Darby Stanchfield — about their reactions to the premiere (yes, even they were surprised by some things!) and what's to come for Pope & Associates this year. (SPOILER ALERT! If you haven't seen the premiere, don't keep reading.) 'NCIS,' 'The Mentalist,' 'Hawaii Five-0,' 'Castle': Find out what's next in the Spoiler Room . ""It's Handled"" picked up right where the season 2 finale left off — with Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) under the microscope thanks to her affair with President Fitzgerald ""Fitz"" Grant (Tony Goldwyn) going public. Trying to cut off that problem at the pass was CIA black ops commander Rowan (Joe Morton), a.k.a. Liv's dad, who had arranged a convenient international getaway. Surprising absolutely no one, Liv decided to forgo the easy way out and returned to her Gladiators to fix ... herself. Once Liv returned, reformed assassin and personal confidante Huck was a natural choice to escort his mentor back into her inner sanctum. ""It's a really short but really powerful scene when he's pulling her out of the limo,"" Díaz says. ""He's like her watchdog. He's that guy that's always thinking about her safety and protecting her and [making sure] nothing bad's going to happen to her [because] she's the one that saved him."" But can the gladiators save Liv now that she's in the sights of cold-blooded frenemy — and Fitz's Chief of Staff — Cyrus (Jeff Perry)? Even Stanchfield, who plays no-nonsense Pope employee Abby, was shocked when she finally saw one scene in particular play out on film. ""We were watching the first episode where Cyrus starts the 'kill folder' [on Olivia],"" the actress remembers. ""We'd all forgotten about it [since the table read], and we all just lost our marbles. It was incredible."" She adds, ""Cyrus can be so evil — just when you think you were going to trust him! I start to like the guy, and then he does something like that, and I'm just like, 'You're dead forever now ...,'"" then she laughs, ""at least for another episode."" Cyrus isn't the only one who's out for blood. Liv's newest acolyte, Quinn (Lowes), is still practically shaking from the adrenaline boost of her first torture session under Huck's tutelage. Lowes admits Quinn ""got a little bit of a taste for [violence] in the finale,"" but says, ""It's not so much that she wants to go out with a machine gun and start killing people. I don't think she's psychotic, and that's not how I'm playing her. The deal is, she has had a lot of really terrible things happen to her in her life and, for the first time in a while, she was in control of the situation and she was excelling at something and she was causing pain on somebody else. It's that sense of control that gives her a high, that forces her to be addicted to that feeling."" Kerry Washington on how she stays grounded amid 'Scandal' craze . Even Lowes admits how wild Quinn's change in character has been. ""I cannot go back and watch the pilot because we've come such a long way, and such a 180 has happened, and she's grown so much and changed so much as a person,"" she admits. ""This season is a big mix. Darby is always saying, 'Oh, that's Old Quinn! Oh, that's New Quinn!' Now it's really combining together."" For Huck, though, Quinn's new empowerment spells trouble. He considers himself a murder-and-torture addict and now fears he's enabling Quinn. Díaz previews, ""That's kind of what he's dealing with in the first few episodes: Him having created this monster. He knows how seductive it was for him and how caught-up in it he got, in that dark world. He's afraid she's too far gone now, and he doesn't know what to do about it."" However Huck chooses to confront Quinn's growing bloodlust, it's safe to say ""Huckleberry Quinn"" — as shippers affectionately refer to the friendship — will never be the same. According to Díaz, that's not necessarily a bad thing: ""Their relationship has shifted. It's changed a little bit. It's exciting what's coming down the pike."" Stanchfield's character is also facing a relationship in flux with on-and-off lover David Rosen (Joshua Malina), the newly appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The pair had only a brief encounter in the premiere, with David telling Abby to ""return [his] calls,"" but Stanchfield promises, ""It's not over between Abby and David. ... They try. The best way to describe it [is], Abby and David have never done normal — they've never actually been on a proper, normal date. There's definitely an attempt at normal [in coming episodes that] will be interesting for fans. It's been interesting to play. They really are two people who fit. They're a good match together because they're both sort of misfits in a way."" Seeing as the Beltway of ""Scandal"" is packed with misfits and machinations, Abby and David's showmance will be in fine company — starting with a Huck-heavy episode next week.

"(CNN) -- A recent dust-up at MSNBC is driving the latest round of ""gotcha"" between the right and the left. A host has apologized, actually tearing up as she tried to make amends for a segmet that didn't provide information, only insult. And yet, even as the target of the attack says it's time to move on, the right is still incensed. And the left still seems uncomfortable talking about what happened. And it prompts me to kick off the new year with a confession: I'm bored with both the right and the left. In politics, everyone lies. No one tells the truth. They all push their own agendas. Everything is divided into these camps of blue and red, liberals and conservatives. The order of the day is situational ethics. Your guy says something wrong, and you defend him because he's your guy. Next week, your opponent says the same exact thing, and you excoriate him because, well, he's your opponent. Where is the consistency? You won't find much of it in the game of gotcha. The first rule is that you can constantly reinvent yourself. The second rule is that no other player can remind you of the person you were 10 minutes ago. The third is that, once you catch someone on the opposing team saying something intolerant or insensitive, you get to jump all over them and act high and mighty -- that is, until the next time that someone on your team says something intolerant or insensitive. When that happens, you get to act surprised that anyone took offense and accuse the offended of having thin skin. To be sure, there was plenty of offensive material in Phil Robertson's recent comments to GQ magazine appearing to liken homosexuality to bestiality and other deviant behavior. As if that weren't bad enough, the star of the A&E Network's ""Duck Dynasty"" also appeared to minimize the mistreatment that African-Americans suffered in the South before the civil rights movement. The left couldn't wait to pounce. Now consider what happened when MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry and her equally self-righteous guests took a break from portraying themselves as morally superior to conservatives and decided it would be hilarious to turn a baby -- specifically, an adopted African-American baby -- into a punchline. The three used a year-end segment dubbed ""Look Back on 2013 and Laugh"" to poke fun at the adoption of Kieran Romney, who this year found himself in a family Christmas photo, atop the lap of his new grandfather, Mitt. To some on the left, the fact that Kieran is black, and his grandpa isn't, is a real side splitter. Opinion: Why Romney adoption jokes hurt . Upon seeing the photo, guest Pia Glenn was so tickled that the actress burst into song: ""One of these things is not like the others! One of these things just isn't the same. And that little baby, front and center, would be the one."" Harris-Perry laughed at that crack and joked that she'd like to see Kieran grow up to marry North West, the daughter of reality star Kim Kardashian and rapper Kanye West. ""Can you imagine Mitt Romney and Kanye West as in-laws?"" she said. The other guest was not to be outdone. Comedian Dean Obeidallah chimed in with this: ""I think this picture is great. It really sums up the diversity of the Republican Party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black person."" Liberals like to think of themselves as more enlightened than anyone else. But if this is what passes for ""enlightened"" these days, I'd hate to hear what ignorant sounds like. It's pretty clear that while the focus was on the baby (""one of these things..."" and ""one black person""), the real target was Mitt Romney. That is, this was about politics. It was about left and right, and that's boring. What interests me now is how people treat one another, how we interact with each other during the relatively short time we have here on Earth. That is what is going to endure when we're gone, not who we voted for in a given election or our party affiliation. If you're still looking for a New Year's resolution, how's this one? Let's treat each other better. Using a baby -- let alone an adopted baby -- to score cheap political points is not how we should treat one another. That's what happened here. Once politics took over, common decency and good manners went out the window. Harris-Perry, Glenn, and Obeidallah all apologized. But, wouldn't you know it? Even that was a mixed bag. First the good news. Harris-Perry did a great job. A day after the incident, she apologized on Twitter ""without reservation or qualification."" Then, she opened her show Saturday with more of the same and veered off into the larger issue of keeping the families of political figures off limits. ""Adults who enter into public life implicitly consent to having less privacy,"" she said. ""But their families, and especially their children, should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly. My intention was not malicious, but I broke the ground rule that families are off-limits, and for that I am sorry."" Now the bad news. Her guests were not nearly so gracious. In fact, their apologies were less about contrition and forgiveness, and more about politics. Glenn tweeted: ""In a spontaneous reaction to a photo, my disdain for Mitt Romney's political platform led me to inadvertently insult adoptive families."" In a piece for the Daily Beast, Obeidallah (who has appeared on CNN shows and written op-eds for CNN.com) explained that he was in hot water because ""I told a joke that many on the right -- and even a few in the middle -- didn't like"" and because ""those on the right who monitor MSNBC were outraged"" and because ""right-wing media outlets"" had piled on. He said that ""being attacked by right-wing publications"" is not new for him and vowed ""to the self-appointed right-wing pundits"" that he will ""never stop calling out the wrongs and hypocrisy of the right."" All RIGHT, then. Still, Obeidallah wrote, ""I want to sincerely apologize to the Romney family if anyone was offended by my joke."" For his part, Romney told Fox News that he's ready to move on from the controversy. So should we all. Interestingly, the three jokesters only apologized after word of the segment got out and conservative media outlets kicked up a fuss. You see, apparently when you have a show on MSNBC, no one watches or hears what you have to say until someone else repeats it. Now, that's funny. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Dust-up over MSNBC segment is latest round of ""gotcha"" in right-left wars .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Three men charged with conspiring to commit domestic terrorism during the NATO summit were plotting to attack President Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters, the Chicago mayor's home and police stations, authorities said Saturday. A police investigation that began early this month revealed that the three suspects are ""self-proclaimed anarchists"" and members of the ""Black Bloc"" group who traveled together from Florida to Chicago to commit violence as a protest against the NATO summit, authorities said in a statement. Diplomatic marathon: G8 focusing on Greece; NATO, on Afghanistan . ""Black Bloc"" was the group blamed for violence that occurred in recent ""Occupy"" protests, such as in Rome last year when anarchists in ski masks torched cars and clashed with police and even other Occupy protesters. The three men were planning to destroy police cars and attack four Chicago police district stations with destructive devices as a way to undermine police response to other planned actions at the NATO summit, according to a statement by Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Downtown Chicago financial institutions were also among the proposed targets, authorities said. An Illinois judge set bail at $1.5 million for each of the three suspects: Brian Church, 22, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 27, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Betterly, 24, who told police he resides in Massachusetts, authorities said. The three men were charged with material support for terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and possession of explosives or incendiary devices, authorities said. The three men were arrested Wednesday, and charges were announced Saturday, according to authorities. ""The individuals that we have charged in this investigation are not peaceful protesters. They are domestic terrorists who came to Chicago with an anarchist agenda to harm our police officers, intimidate our citizens and to attack their politically motivated targets,"" said Alvarez. According to authorities, Church said he wanted to recruit four groups of four co-conspirators -- or 16 people -- and that reconnaissance had already been done on the Chicago Police Department headquarters. The three men also possessed or built improvised exposive or incendiary devices, a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars, and knives with brass-knuckle handles, authorities said. In court, prosecutors accused the three men of preparing for ""violence and destruction,"" such as stockpiling Molotov cocktails. But a defense attorney called those accusations ""propaganda"" and contended authorities ""infiltrated"" a peaceful group and set up the three men. The three defendants stood expressionless in court, each handcuffed behind the back. A couple dozen of their supporters in the courtroom could be heard faintly scoffing at prosecutor Matthew Thrun as he called the defendants ""self-proclaimed anarchists ... making preparations for violence and destruction."" Thrun said one of the defendants could be heard planning an attack and quoted him as saying, ""this city does not know what it is in for, and it will never be the same."" According to Thrun, the defendants bought gasoline at a BP station, cut bandanas for fuses, and had four empty beer bottles to be used as Molotov cocktails. Thrun told the court that Church made a remark while assembling the Molotov cocktails: ""Ever seen a cop on fire?"" Defense attorney Michael Deutsch accused authorities of ""police misconduct,"" saying undercover agents infiltrated a ""peaceful"" group. ""They even bought the makings of Molotov cocktails and gave it to them,"" Deutsch said in court. Outside of court, he called the case a set-up and an example of ""entrapment to the highest degree."" ""It is sensationalism by the police and the state to discredit the protesters that have come here to nonviolently protest,"" the attorney said. The National Lawyers Guild, which says it's representing the three defendants, said Chicago police arrested a total of nine activists Wednesday at a house in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood and then released six of them. The guild described the three defendants as ""Occupy activists"" and said police provided no evidence of criminal intent or wrongdoing. ""It's outrageous for the city to apply terrorism charges when it's the police who have been terrorizing activists and threatening their right to protest,"" attorney Sarah Gelsomino with the lawyers guild and the People's Law Office, said in a statement. Judge Edward Harmening set the three defendants' next court date for Tuesday. On Sunday, NATO kicks off its two-day summit in Chicago, and the war in Afghanistan is expected to dominate discussions. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Zardari are both expected to attend the meeting. A user's guide to the NATO summit .

"(CNN) -- Shaken police officers in Houston, Texas, provided details Thursday in the death of a 12-year-old Texas boy whose burned body was found in a drainage ditch. Jonathan Foster was last seen December 24. The medical examiner has not released the cause of death. Mona Yvette Nelson, 44, a maintenance worker and an acquaintance of the boy's family, was arrested Wednesday and the Harris County District Attorney's Office has accepted capital murder charges, said spokesman Kese Smith of the Houston Police Department. Police credit a security video taken by a business in helping to crack the case, homicide Capt. David Gott told reporters. Police said the business video was taken around 6 p.m. that day. The video, he said, shows someone pulling up in a silver truck, unloading a body and placing it in a ditch about five miles from the apartment at which Jonathan lived. ""She has still not confessed, still has not said that she murdered Jonathan Foster,"" Gott said of Nelson. ""But she did admit that it was her truck and that she was there at that ditch and she is that person in that video putting that body in the ditch."" The suspect met Jonathan's stepfather two weeks before he vanished, according to CNN Houston affiliate KHOU. Investigators said Nelson, the only suspect, made a ""self-serving statement"" that places her with Jonathan, but she has not admitted to killing the boy. Jonathan's mother was away at work when he disappeared on the afternoon of December 24. The boy's stepfather saw him around 1:45 p.m., Gott said. Jonathan called his mother's workplace and spoke with someone who relayed a message to her. She came home around 2 p.m. to find Jonathan was gone. Officers at the apartment complex were in the process of trying to talk with Nelson, who they understood had talked with Jonathan around 12:30 p.m., Gott said. They had received a video image of the truck and noticed it was similar to Nelson's, he added. No accelerants were found on the body, Gott said. While he would not go into any details, he did say welding torches were found at the suspect's home, along with other evidence authorities said she tried to conceal. They believe the body was burned at Nelson's house. Detective Michael Miller said officers are uncertain about a motive, but he described the suspect he helped interview as showing ""an absolute lack of remorse"" for Jonathan's killing. Nelson, who was being held without bail Thursday, was friends with the roommate of Jonathan's mother, police said. Jonathan was a happy, red-haired and well-liked boy, Miller said. ""It's an absolute tragedy that cannot be put into words."" CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report.","Burned remains of a child were found in Houston, Texas .

"(CNN) -- The Washington Navy Yard is the home to high-level naval personnel and is the workplace for at least 3,000 service members and civilian employees. Located in the heart of Washington, D.C., the premises include a park and many buildings. Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert was at his residence at the Yard on Monday and was evacuated, CNN's Barbara Starr said. She added that in her experience visiting the facility, security is extensive. Everyone must have clearance to be there or valid identification that allows them entry. But she added that ""you could have all the authority in the world to be on the installation"" and still plan to do harm without detection by guards. Read more about entering the Yard . The Yard includes the headquarters for the Naval Historical Center and the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, among others. It's the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, where police said shots were fired Monday. Capt. Mark Vandroff spoke to reporters, explaining that he and his colleagues remained in a conference room in their building -- 197 -- hunkered down until the scene was safe. He described the building as the largest of three overseen by the Naval Sea System command, the Navy's organization that procures and maintains ships and submarines. Building 197 houses headquarter staff, legal team, contractors, engineers and buyers of various weapon and defense systems, among others, he said. Vandroff added that he was very happy that his staff remained calm, though they were scared as they hunkered down in a conference room. ""'Cause we knew if we sheltered in place eventually the police would come get us,"" he said. The Navy Museum at the Yard is open to the public. Leutze Park hosts ceremonies and offers walking tours. The Yard has a dramatic history, its website says. A former shipyard and ordnance plant, it's the oldest U.S. onshore installation. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and designated a National Historic Landmark three years later. The Yard was created in 1799 by an act of Congress, the Naval History and Heritage Command says. It was envisioned as a shipbuilding and fitting facility on the Anacostia River and over the years has serviced several storied vessels, including the USS Constitution. During the War of 1812, the Yard burned down and was rebuilt as a weapons manufacturing hub. It has also been the scene of significant advancements in military technology. During the War of 1812, Robert Fulton conducted research and testing on his clockwork torpedo, and in 1822, Commodore John Rodgers built the United States' first marine railway for the overhaul of large vessels at the Yard, according to its site. The Yard was crucial to the defense of Washington during the Civil War, according to its website. President Abraham Lincoln frequently visited the Yard many times, according to the Yard's site. The body of Lincoln's killer, John Wilkes Booth, was examined and identified on a ship moored at there. Amid World War I, the Yard made Navy ordnance, including the 14-inch naval railway guns used in France in the war. In the years after World War II and into the Cold War era, the Yard's military role lessened.","The U.S. Navy Yard is home to high-level naval personnel .

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- Five people died and more than 80 were injured when a commercial airliner overshot the runway into an adjoining street, crushing three vehicles and splitting into three sections before resting a few feet from a house, officials said. A television image shows the Grupo TACA plane lying in a neighborhood in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Grupo Taca Airlines Flight No. 390 was traveling from San Salvador to Tegucigalpa with 135 people -- 124 passengers, two pilots, four flight attendants and five crew members who were being repositioned. The Airbus A-320 landed at Toncontin International Airport amid high winds and low visibility at at 9:45 a.m. (11:45 a.m. ET), a Taca spokeswoman said. In traveling 300 meters beyond the runway, the jet's cockpit was badly damaged and its fuel tank was breached. Though jet fuel flowed across the pavement, it did not ignite. Emergency workers covered the area and many of the passengers with foam. Among the fatalities were the pilot; passenger Harry Brautigam, president of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, who suffered a heart attack; and a taxi driver whose vehicle was struck by the jetliner.  Watch the site of the crash » . Earlier reports that seven people had died were erroneous, Honduran officials said Saturday. The passengers included one from the United States, three from Colombia, three from Nicaragua and the rest from Honduras and El Salvador, Taca reported. President Manuel Zelaya told CNN en Espanol that he spoke with a friend who was a passenger on the flight. The man told him that the passengers applauded when the pilot landed. That is not unusual, because the airport is in a valley, and the approach can be difficult, he said. But when the plane did not stop at the end of the runway, emergency personnel snapped into action, Zelaya said. Firefighters were at the door within 20 seconds, and they quickly doused a fire that had broken out in one of the motors, avoiding a worse disaster, he said. As a result of the wreck, landings at Toncontin will be rerouted to an airport 45 minutes from Tegucigalpa for all planes except those with 42 passengers or fewer, Zelaya said. The other airport has longer runways, and Zelaya predicted that hangars could be prepared and immigration facilities readied within two weeks. A tropical depression -- a remnant of a tropical storm that hit nearby Nicaragua a day earlier, hung over the city on Friday, said CNN meteorologist Guillermo Arduino. But it was not raining when the plane touched down, and Zelaya said weather did not appear to have played a role in the accident. Toncontin was closed after the accident, but authorities were planning to reopen it during the weekend. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was sending two investigators to the site, as is the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, to help the governments of Honduras and El Salvador in their investigation. In addition, International Aero Engines and the BEA of France were each sending an investigator.

"San Pancrazio, Italy (CNN) -- Helen and Armando Rendón recently visited Tuscany, Italy, for the first time. Residents of northern California, the couple took part in the June 29 candlelight procession honoring massacre victims at San Pancrazio. Rendón, an author, teacher and civil rights lawyer, describes how the experience allowed him a rare glimpse inside the ""real Tuscany,"" not the storybook one depicted in the movies. A former schoolteacher, Helen was reminded of the injustices she witnessed in her native Baghdad during World War II. Here is an edited transcript of their interview. And read the full story of San Pancrazio. What was your experience participating in the San Pancrazio procession? Armando Rendón: I realized that we were the only two people who weren't from Italy or Europe. It was like we were representing the whole rest of the world. I remember just before night fell there was a beautiful sunset. The whole sky was just ablaze. It made me wonder what it was like in 1944 on that date and whether the sky was as beautiful as that. I thought of what the people must have gone through because they thought they were out of the way. But all of a sudden they had these tanks and soldiers coming in and gathering all the men up and killing them. And it was such a contradiction between what we're looking at and what must have happened on that date. That really stayed with me. Helen Rendón: I felt very sad to hear what was going on. I was really very, very sad. They were just a delightful group of people really. And I thought: ""Oh my gosh, that's terrible. Why [did] this happen to them in 1944?"" I know about the history of the Nazis, but I didn't know about that town and what they did. Do you remember something from the evening that affected you? AR: I didn't feel, or sense, any bitterness or hate. That struck me very strongly. They were just there to remember and not to hate. When everything was over, we went to this little club that sits in the back of the village. Some of the older guys were out in the front, chatting and smoking and having a beer or wine. And we went in and got something to drink. They knew that we couldn't really speak Italian. We could just say hello. But there were a feeling of acceptance of ""thank you for being here."" What was your family's experience during WWII? AR: I had grown up in San Antonio, Texas. My grandmother and my aunt were the ones who were raising me during the war years. My mother had gone off to Oakland, California to work. In fact, she worked in a parachute assembly plant. I lived mostly with my grandmother and she had five boys. Four of them went into the service during the war years. You know how they put stars on the windows when you had somebody in service? She had four stars in her front window. I didn't realize all this until I was much older and then I started to ask questions. So I knew the kind of sacrifices my grandmother had gone through. I don't think I really had experienced first-hand the kind of feeling that I felt at San Pancrazio and saw the place where the men had been killed and there were still some bullet holes in the wall. Just incredibly inhumane. That gave me a whole different sense of what the war must have been like to people who were otherwise innocent, and just waiting and hoping that it would be over and pass them by. HR: I was sitting with my parents in Baghdad, Iraq and the Muslims were coming by our house to go to the Jews to kill them. And we told them: ""No, no we don't have them."" We were lying so that they would leave. That's what my father was doing. I didn't know what was going on but I was listening and they said: ""Be quiet. Get in the house."" So they were going into the houses -- they were all empty -- and they started shooting. They stole all their clothes, all their furniture. They were very proud to be with Hitler. My dad was very worried about the beautiful neighbors, the Jewish neighbors we had. How did the experience change your opinion of Tuscany? AR: I had a romanticized idea about Tuscany: a lot of vineyards and people drinking wine out on their patios. I think it's still a romantic place. It's a very human place. What I learned from San Pancrazio was that people suffered. And there was a very difficult history. To recollect the way they do it is really beautiful. It left me feeling very happy to have experienced those moments with them. We saw another side of the Italian people that not many people see. That was really a humbling experience. HR: For me, Tuscany is great. When I finished seeing that beautiful little town, it's great. It didn't affect me negatively. I was sad for them, but it was so delightful. I was impressed by the children and the grandmothers because they were sitting and talking while the children were laughing, running and playing. They were very happy. What thought would you like to leave us with? AR: We honor the soldiers -- the warriors -- the men and women that fought for us and died for us to keep our freedom alive. But we often forget the people, the mothers and fathers, the families that were behind them, waiting for them to come back. So we have to remember the people who sacrificed on the battlefield, but also those who sacrificed at home. And certainly, San Pancrazio gives us an example of the tremendous sacrifice of people who were otherwise innocent. It just reinforces my conviction that we cannot use war as an option in working out our problems.","Couple who attended San Pancrazio memorial share their feelings .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A bomb appearing to target police officers exploded Thursday in an Istanbul neighborhood near the ruling Justice and Development Party headquarters in the city, authorities said. The blast left 15 officers and one civilian injured, Istanbul's police chief, Huseyin Capkin, said. It occurred in the Sutluce neighborhood in Beyoglu district. ""It seems the explosion was done by remote control, as a police van with 21 policemen in it was passing by,"" Capkin told reporters on the scene. ""Their conditions are all good,"" Capkin said. ""There is no one in a life-threatening condition."" Istanbul Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu said the bomb was mounted on a motorcycle that was left by the side of the road. He said plastic explosive was used. ""We do not have clear information about the perpetrators,"" he said, promising an investigation and vowing that such attacks could not harm Istanbul's security. The headquarters of Independent Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association, MUSIAD, is near the scene of the blast. A spokesman for the association, Sadi Dinleyici, told CNN Turk television that the explosion shook their building and they were initially afraid it was hit by a bomb. Turkey has experienced bomb attacks in the past conducted by various groups, including Kurdish separatist organizations, extreme leftists and al Qaeda-related radical Islamists.","NEW: 16 injured people are in ""good"" condition, police say .

"(CNN) -- At least 40 bodies -- all of them wearing uniforms identifying them as army officers -- have been found in a mass grave inside the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles paramilitary in the capital, Dhaka, authorities said Friday. Bangladeshi army soldiers gather near the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters in Dhaka Thursday. The discovery brings to at least 62 the number of army officers who have been found dead after mutinous paramilitary forces took dozens of superiors hostages at the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) headquarters on Wednesday. The Rifles laid down their arms after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina agreed to grant them amnesty. The bodies were found in a grave behind the mortuary building inside the BDR compound in the Pilkhana area of Dhaka, said Cmdr. Abdul Kalam Azad with the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite internal security team that is helping with the recovery effort. ""It's a bad scene,"" Azad said. ""You can only see their legs. We're carrying away only as many as we can fit in ambulances. Then we're going to go look for more."" Earlier, 22 bodies had been recovered from the Buriganga River after the rebelling troops dumped them down a sewer during the standoff, authorities said. The Rifles took their superiors -- all military men -- hostage Wednesday morning after a rebellion they said was spurred by years of their grievances not being addressed. Discontent had been bubbling for years among the ranks of the BDR troops, a 65,000-strong paramilitary outfit primarily responsible for guarding the country's borders.  Watch how the paramilitary revolt spread » . The recruits complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and opportunities to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations.

"(CNN) -- A body found near Lubbock, Texas, has been identified as that of a baby sitter seen in a motel surveillance video with a longtime family friend charged in the case, authorities said Wednesday. The medical examiner identified the remains found Monday about seven miles outside of the city as belonging to Elizabeth Ennen, 15. She had been strangled, Capt. Greg Stevens told CNN. Stevens told reporters that Humberto Salinas Jr., 45, was being held on a $250,000 bond on an aggravated kidnapping charge. Police are talking with the district attorney about taking a murder charge to the grand jury, he said. Elizabeth was reported missing after baby-sitting at a motel for Salinas, who was a friend of the Ennen family and the father of her boyfriend, police said. The girl did baby-sitting jobs several times for Salinas at the motel, where he lived, police said. Stevens would not say whether Salinas was cooperating, but he indicated the remains were not found by chance or through a tip. Elizabeth was reported missing January 5, and Salinas was charged in the case on Friday. Are you missing a loved one? Share your story . A relative of Salinas declined comment when contacted by CNN Wednesday. Stevens defended the time it took to conduct the investigation and arrest Salinas, saying the suspect was a family friend who deceived the family and police on the girl's whereabouts. But police believe Elizabeth was dead by the time they got a report that she was missing, Stevens said. ""They [the family] trusted this guy to speak ... to the officer,"" said the captain, who would not comment on a possible motive. Lily Huckabee, Elizabeth's aunt, told HLN's Nancy Grace that the girl's mother, Virginia, ""is holding on the best she can...."" Salinas was married and ""always presented himself very respectful,"" said Huckabee, who described Elizabeth as loving, caring, shy and interested in music. Police have a January 4 surveillance video of Elizabeth being taken from the Carriage House Inn, but they did not know of it when they began their investigation, Stevens told CNN. According to an arrest affidavit, the video shows Salinas holding the teen's arm and leaving the motel, he said. ""We believe he killed her while he was gone with her,"" Stevens said. Salinas went to Elizabeth's home and talked with her mother early January 5, police said. He helped her file an initial report, the captain said. According to that report, Salinas said he brought Elizabeth home from the motel and went back to get her purse. When he showed up at the house, the mother asked about her daughter's whereabouts. The suspect indicated Elizabeth might have left the neighborhood with his son, believed to be 18 or 19, Stevens said. ""He began misdirecting the investigation, leading it in the opposite direction of the truth,"" the officer said. Police initially classified the case as a runaway, but within days learned the son had a solid alibi. They began looking at the elder Salinas, who initially gave another location for the baby-sitting, said Stevens, adding police for much of the investigation believed Elizabeth had disappeared from her home. ""We came around 180 degrees,"" said Stevens, adding an investigator suggested they check with the Carriage House Inn on possible video. Officers saw the video on the same day they arrested the suspect, police said. Stevens defended his department from criticism on the time it took to make an arrest and find the body. ""These (type of cases) can often take years,"" he said. A candlelight vigil in Elizabeth's memory is scheduled for Thursday night at Monterey High School, where she attended, CNN affiliate KCBD in Lubbock reported. Her funeral is Friday. Diena Thompson, the mother of a girl found dead in a Georgia landfill, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell she has issued financial assistance from the Somer Thompson Foundation to Elizabeth Ennen's mother. Thompson's daughter, Somer, was taken from her Florida neighborhood in October 2009. The child was raped and killed and her body left under a pile of trash.

"(CNN) -- American Jennifer Grout fell just short of the top prize in the ""Arabs Got Talent"" competition after a remarkable run to the finals by a 23-year-old from Massachusetts who barely speaks Arabic. Grout was among the final three contestants left standing on a Beirut stage Saturday night. She was eliminated only just before the end of the televised spectacle on the MBC network, when Syrian dance troup Sima was declared the winner. ""I'm really happy I was in the top three and it was such a good experience, but I'm so happy for Sima because they deserved it,"" Grout said. Grout won over some shocked viewers in the Middle East earlier in the competition with renditions of classic Arab songs, rather than more Western-sounding music other contestants were performing. The winning dancers incorporated Western moves in their performance. Although some journalists in the Middle East had questioned the wisdom of allowing an American in the competition, audience members and even judges on Saturday night's show praised her for calling attention to traditional songs. ""Jennifer's achievement is something that's made me very happy,"" said Lebanese superstar singer Najwa Karam, one of the judges. ""It shows music is universal. When it comes to the arts, there are no barriers between us and any other people in the world."" After the ceremony, members of the audience and some contestants approached Grout to take photos and talk with her. Grout has said she dived into Arabic music three years ago after discovering it online. She previously had studied classical music and opera. After college, she moved to Morocco, where she learned local Berber music and began performing in Marrakesh's Jemaa el Fnaa Square. Asked about her future Saturday night, she said, ""For now, I'm definitely going to go back to Morocco to see all my friends. And after that, who knows?""

"(CNN) -- International investigators say there's no evidence that poet Pablo Neruda was poisoned. Scientists who exhumed Neruda's remains in April revealed details of their investigation last week, confirming that the Nobel prize-winning poet suffered from prostate cancer when he died four decades ago. But the results haven't stopped skepticism from one member of Neruda's family, who told CNN Chile that he's still pushing for answers about what caused the poet's 1973 death. ""This is a first report that ... opens the door for us to request new tests,"" nephew Rodolfo Reyes said in an interview with CNN's sister network. Neruda's death certificate says prostate cancer killed him. But for years his former chauffeur has offered up another theory, claiming that Neruda was poisoned in the clinic where he was undergoing treatment. Last week's report from a team of scientists said investigators found ""no forensic evidence"" to support that Neruda had been killed by anything other than natural causes. ""No relevant chemical agents that could be linked to Mr. Pablo Neruda's death have been found,"" the report said. Neruda died on September 23, 1973, just 12 days after a right-wing military coup ousted socialist President Salvador Allende and brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power. The poet, a Communist Party member, had criticized the coup and Pinochet. Less than two weeks later, he was dead. He had been planning to go into exile the next day -- and the timing of his death was no coincidence, chauffeur Manuel Araya has said. ""I believe that Pablo Neruda was murdered, because Pablo Neruda was a very relevant figure in history, as much in this country as in the world,"" Araya told CNN Chile earlier this year. ""He was going to go into exile on September 24 and they silenced him before then."" Neruda was a well-known political and public figure, having served as a lawmaker and diplomat in addition to his literary career, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 1971. Thousands of people disappeared or died during Pinochet's rule, and many have accused his government of using death squads to wipe out political opponents. Attorney Eduardo Contreras, who represents Chile's Communist Party, told reporters that more tests on Neruda's remains are necessary. ""The Pablo Neruda case is not closed,"" Contreras said.

"(CNN) -- It's become a go-to tool for journalists, a digital man-on-the-street interview when big news breaks: see what they're saying on Twitter. There's just one problem with that, says the Pew Research Center. Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's. The differences? Sometimes Twitter is more liberal. At other times, it's more conservative. And it's very nearly always more negative. ""Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users,"" the report reads. ""While this provides an interesting look into how communities of interest respond to different circumstances, it does not reliably correlate with the overall reaction of adults nationwide."" In the yearlong study, Pew focused on political events such as the result of the 2012 presidential election, the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney and several speeches given by Obama. Some examples: When Obama won re-election, public opinion polls suggested 52% of the public was pleased and 45% unhappy. On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative. Similarly, only 20% of the public told pollsters they thought Obama did a better job than Romney in their first debate (the one in which Obama was criticized for looking tired and unfocused). But 59% of tweets favored him. Part of that might be explained by looking at who uses Twitter. Pew's research shows that Twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean Democratic. In a 2012 survey, half of adults who said they posted news on Twitter were younger than 30, compared with 23% of all adults. And 57% of those who posted news on Twitter were either Democrats or leaned Democratic, compared with 46% of the general public. But Twitter pundits don't always lean to the left. Nearly half of the U.S. public (48%) thought Obama did a good job on his second inaugural address. But only 13% of the tweets about it echoed that opinion. Opinions about Sen. John Kerry being nominated as Obama's secretary of state split the general public: 39% approved, 36% disapproved and 26% had no opinion. On Twitter, a measly 6% expressed support, while 32% were negative and a clear majority, 62%, expressed no opinion. The reason for such a swing, Pew said, is that on Twitter, unlike in opinion polls, users decide what they think is important enough to mention publicly. A generally popular event might not be portrayed that way if an angry minority is more inspired to post about it. For example, nearly 14 million wrote on Twitter about Obama's re-election while a mere 70,000 remarked on Kerry's nomination. Politics also reflect a truth that anyone who's followed the Oscars, Super Bowl, debate nights or, really, any public event can attest to -- the Twitter universe is never happier than when it's being snarky, or downright nasty, to someone. ""The overall negativity on Twitter over the course of the campaign stood out,"" Pew writes. ""For both candidates, negative comments exceeded positive comments by a wide margin throughout the fall campaign season."" There were more negative than positive comments about Obama and Romney on Twitter. The negative comments about Obama bounced back and forth between 40% to 50% throughout the campaign, while positives went up to about 30% and down into the teens. (Remember, lots of comments can be neutral). Romney's negatives were higher. Usually, between 50% to 60% of talk about him was not nice, while positives only broke above 20% during the campaign's final days. Another thing to keep in mind when monitoring the conversation on Twitter: While it seems to be omnipresent among the digitally connected (yes, like we journalists tend to be), its overall reach is modest compared to other media. In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages. Only 3% said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on Twitter.","Study: Twitter opinions rarely reflect those of the general public .
Pew Research says the most significant difference is that Twitter's more negative .

"Bujumbura, Burundi (CNN) -- They're lonely and hungry, condemned to a life of daily hardship with little to hope for. Deprived of food, wearing old clothes, countless homeless children are living on the dusty streets of Bujumbura, the lakeside capital of Burundi, victims of a bloody civil war that wreaked havoc on the tiny east central African country. Scared and neglected, the children's lives are fraught with great danger; some of them suffer from abuse while others resort to a life of crime to survive, earning the name ""kirobezo,"" which means bad child. But not everyone sees them like that. One woman is responding to these young children not with anger but with love -- and a whole lot of food. Affectionately known as ""Mama Dimanche,"" which means ""Mama Sunday,"" Burundian radio presenter and longtime children's advocate Christine Ntahe has made it her duty to feed as many homeless street kids as possible. Every single week, she opens her house on Sundays, providing free meals to Bujumbura's vulnerable youngsters. ""Street children do not get enough to eat, they can spend two days without eating,"" says Ntahe. ""They don't have clothes and mostly they are not loved -- they are hopeless that's why we find them joining armed groups,"" she continues. ""They can steal, they can rob, they can kill,"" she says. ""They can do any bad thing, living that kind of life, I hate it. That's why I invite them every Sunday -- so that we can share food and have a time to discuss."" Read this: War orphans turn tragedy into triumph . No child is turned away. Instead, everyone is made to feel welcome. Before the meal, one teenager says a prayer for the group and then Ntahe hands out large bowls full of flavorful beans and rice. She pays out of her own pocket and, at one point, she even went into debt in order to feed and provide for these children. Civil war . Burundi is one of the smallest countries in Africa and one of the poorest in the world. It gained independence from Belgium in 1962, but after years of tension and coups it descended into a vicious civil war that lasted from 1993 to 2005. The armed conflict left hundreds of thousands dead and many more displaced. Everyone in the country suffered in some way because of the war, but especially children. Half of Burundi's population is under the age of 18, while an estimated half a million children were orphaned by the civil war and HIV/AIDS, with many of them living on the streets. Read this: From the streets to break beats . Nearly 60% of Burundi's children under five suffer from malnutrition, a primary factor behind their desperation and move toward crime, according to Ntahe. ""I have children who are in prison because they have stolen and they do it to get something to eat,"" she says. ""That's why I do my best to protect them so that they don't end up in prison or in armed groups -- they go because they are without hope."" Giving children a voice . Ntahe, 58, has been an outspoken advocate for Burundi's children for several decades now. Back in the late 1970s she began working at the only radio station in the country. After realizing how conflict was pushing children into violent crime, she decided to give them a voice by creating a show about young people and possibly convince them of a better life. During the war, when thousands of people were displaced to refugee camps in neighboring countries, Ntahe used her radio program ""Parlons Avec Les Enfants"" -- or ""Speaking With Children"" -- to comfort those fleeing to Rwanda, Tanzania and DR Congo. Today she still invites a selection of homeless children to join her on her program and discuss anything they want. The more fortunate ones speak about the importance of an education, children's rights and mutual support for one another. Kids can even call in and ask anything they want. Amongst those participating are Ntahe's success stories -- young people like Adrian, a 17-year-old boy who is doing his best in high school, for which Ntahe is paying. ""There are many good stories,"" says Ntahe. ""There are many children who have succeeded; there is a story of one child whose job was to steal -- he was caught and put into prison but now he's an artist, a singer; there is another one who now is taking care of other street children -- he has an education center; there is another one who is now in Canada; another one is in South Africa. There are many stories that make me happy."" It's because of all this work that the U.S. embassy in Bujambura decided in March to honor Ntahe by naming her the 2013 ""Woman of Courage"" for exemplifying strength and leadership. ""She is a generous, warm person who has committed her life to the betterment of children without asking for anything in return,"" U.S. ambassador Dawn Liberi said at the time. Since the award some small donations have started rolling in, but Ntahe says she's not worried about finances. ""The riches I have are in my heart,"" she says. ""You can have a lot of (material) things, but not help anyone -- the best riches are in the heart."" Ntahe says what motivates her are the children who've grown up, avoided violence and improved their lives. ""I say that the young people are the Burundi for tomorrow, but tomorrow is impossible if we don't live well today,"" she says. ""Tomorrow starts today, that's why we hug the children so that they can feel loved and never go back to do bad things. So Burundi has a good future, surely.""","""Mama Dimanche"" is committed to helping homeless street children .

"(CNN) -- They have blown out in spectacular style and drawn criticism from one of the world's top drivers, but Pirelli insists there is nothing wrong with the tires it supplies to Formula One. Pirelli came under intense scrutiny after tire degradation led to four retirements at June's British Grand Prix, while Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso recently described the tires as ""not good."" Pirelli's CEO has defended the rubber provided by the Italian manufacturer, suggesting some drivers are not using the tires correctly. ""I have to say that he was very nervous when he said that,"" Marco Tronchetti Provera told CNN when asked about Alonso's remarks at October's Korean Grand Prix, which was won by newly-crowned drivers' champion Sebastian Vettel. ""It was not because of tires -- he wasn't able to win for a number of reasons. If they didn't use the tires properly, it's not our fault."" Pirelli is in the third year of its agreement to supply tires to F1, and Tronchetti Provera does not rule out the possibility of extending the company's deal beyond 2015. He warns that, if the working relationship between F1 and Pirelli continues, teams should pay attention to the advised limits of each tire compound. With F1 bosses asking for tires not to last as long, in order to make the racing more exciting, pit-stop strategies have become more important -- and teams have been pushing tires to the limit in their search for an advantage. ""We can do whatever is needed, but with the respect of the rules,"" the 65-year-old said. ""It means tires have to be used within the limits we provide teams."" While Pirelli's reputation in the paddock might have taken a knock, Tronchetti Provera insists the brand itself has not adversely affected by its association with F1 -- earning $1.5 billion on sales of over $8 billion last year. ""We had some damages for a few weeks after Silverstone,"" he admits, ""but I think today people understand it wasn't Pirelli's fault."" The 2013 F1 season continues with the United States Grand Prix in Austin on November 17, before coming to a close in Brazil seven days later.","Pirelli CEO defends the tires the manufacturer supplies to Formula One .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray is set to be freed from jail Monday after serving two years for causing Michael Jackson's death. Murray's four-year sentence for the involuntary manslaughter conviction translated into just two years in jail because of California prison rules that give an additional day credit for each day served. A jury concluded after a two-month trial in 2011 that Murray's negligence led to Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. Monday will be the first time Murray has stepped outside of the Los Angeles County jail since November 2011, except for one visit to a hospital and to court. He served his time in the local jail because of overcrowding in state prisons. The cardiologist, who was hired to serve as the pop icon's personal doctor for his comeback tour in 2009, told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his intractable insomnia for two months so he could rest for rehearsals. Prosecutors argued that his negligence included leaving Jackson unmonitored and unattended while the powerful anesthetic was being pumped into his vein through an IV drip. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was ""playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,"" by using propofol to put him to sleep in ""a reckless, obscene manner."" Murray's lawyers unsuccessfully argued that Jackson self-administered the drug while Murray was out of his bedroom. He remained unremorseful during his two years in jail. ""My entire approach may not have been an orthodox approach, but my intentions were good,"" Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper interview last April. He said his intentions were to wean Jackson from propofol. He said he succeeded in eliminating propofol from his insomnia treatment three days before Jackson's death. ""I explained to Michael that this is an artificial way of considering sleep. It was basically sedation, minimal sedation,"" he told Cooper. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor imposed the maximum sentence on Murray, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Judge Pastor, in a 30-minute speech explaining his sentence, cited Murray's ""pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray."" Jackson died ""not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,"" Pastor said. ""He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made."" Murray, he said, became involved in ""a cycle of horrible medicine."" Jackson family members and fans have complained that Murray should have been prosecuted for second degree murder -- not manslaughter. Murray can no longer practice medicine since his licenses were suspended in California, Texas and Nevada in the wake of his conviction. His lawyer indicated he would try to get them reinstated so he can treat patients again.","Dr. Murray's 4-year sentence translated to 2 years in jail under prison rules .

"(CNN) -- A Vatican spokesman said Monday that Pope Benedict XVI feels much pain after revelations that members of the clergy were involved in widespread sexual abuse of children from the 1950s through the 1980s in Belgium. ""The publishing of this report is a new cause of pain for us, for the victims,"" Father Federico Lombardi said. The announcement came after leaders of the church in Belgium said Catholic priests who abused children should tell their superiors. ""We want to repeat this call with force,"" said Bishop Johan Bonny, the bishop of Antwerp. ""It is to everyone's advantage that the abuser in a pastoral relationship communicates this fact to his superior"" or to a new ""center for investigation, healing and reconciliation,"" which he announced Monday. The church has identified four experts to start preparatory work on the center, he said, but he did not name them. Belgian church officials will begin interviews Tuesday as a follow-up to a church-backed investigation that detailed hundreds of assertions of sexual abuse of children by clergy and others working for the church from the 1950s into the late 1980s.  It was led by Dr. Peter Adriaenssens, who is both a church investigator and a psychiatrist. ""From the mistakes of the past, we wish to take the necessary lessons,"" said Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard, the head of the Catholic Church in Belgium. ""In the interviews that will be conducted from tomorrow, we will consider the relevant reflexions and proposals of Professor Adriaenssens."" The process will take time, because ""it is impossible to try to resolve these traumatic experiences too quickly,"" Leonard said. ""We want to commit ourselves to giving the maximum support for the victims,"" he said. ""We must listen to their questions in order to restore their dignity and help heal the suffering they have endured."" The commission said it received about 500 reports from alleged victims, about 60 percent of them from males. It cited 320 alleged abusers, of whom 102 were known to have been clergy members from 29 congregations. Thirteen of the alleged victims committed suicide, it said. ""We can say that not a single congregation escaped sexual abuse of minors by one or more of its members,"" the Commission on Church-Related Sexual Abuse Complaints said Friday. ""The stories they contain and suffering make us shudder,"" Leonard said. Linda Opdebeeck told CNN that her abuse as a Belgian schoolgirl did not begin immediately. ""He had a little room at school, and when you had a problem, you could go to him,"" she said. ""He was very charismatic; he was very friendly. I was alone. I didn't have brothers or sisters. I was an only child. I was fat, and I was lonely. So I went to him in his little room, and he listened to me, and I had a nice feeling. But a year later, he started to abuse me."" But Opdebeeck, now in her 40s, said she felt unable to tell anyone else what was going on. ""I knew I had to be silent because he was a friend of my parents,"" she said. ""What could I say? He was always saying that I had to shut up or something bad would happen to me."" Years later, she confronted him but found little satisfaction. ""There were three men at the table, and he was just telling that he didn't remember any more, and it wasn't so bad, and I had to feel pity because he was old,"" she said. ""It seems to me that the victims are the abusers and the abusers are the victims when you hear them speaking about 'Just forgive us and continue your life.' "" The abuse, she said, has had an impact on her faith. ""I try to separate my faith and the church, but it's very hard,"" she said. ""Perhaps there is a God, but then he has nothing to do with all the men there. No. The church is finished."" In last week's report, investigators had information about when the abuse started for 233 of the alleged victims. Forty-eight were 12; one was 2; five were 4; eight were 5; seven were 6; ten were 7. Of the 230 alleged victims about whom investigators said they had reliable information, more than 70 percent are currently between the ages of 40 and 70, it said. Ten percent are 31 to 40. Four alleged victims are 20 to 30 years of age, and one is younger than 20, it said. At the other end of the scale, five alleged victims are aged between 80 and 90 years old, and one is older than 90. Belgian police raided Catholic Church headquarters in the country this year and questioned a cardinal over allegations of a cover-up by the church. Belgian police questioned Gotfried Danneels, the country's former Catholic archbishop, for about 10 hours over accusations he knew of sexual abuse in the church but failed to stop it, the Belgian prosecutor's office said in July. Danneels was being considered a witness but could become a suspect, prosecutor's spokesman Joseph Colain said. Danneels, who was questioned July 5, could be interrogated again as the investigation continues, Colain said. Danneels was archbishop of Belgium for more than 30 years before he stepped down in January. Belgian police raided the national headquarters of the Catholic Church in June over allegations of child abuse, prompting an angry response from Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders. Investigators seized archdiocese archives covering 25 years as well as personal computers and other personal possessions, said Fernand Keuleneer, a lawyer for the archdiocese. Police raided Danneels' private residence and the headquarters of the Catholic Church in Belgium as a meeting of bishops was taking place. They detained the bishops and other church employees -- even the cook -- for about nine hours, the Rev. Eric De Beukelaer said. Members of a Belgian church commission that helps sexual abuse victims resigned en masse to protest the raid a week after it took place, said De Beukelaer, a spokesman for the Mechelen-Brussels Archdiocese. The commission worked with people who have been abused by clergy members, said the spokesman. The Belgian Prosecutor's Office said in July that it is investigating death threats against witnesses and magistrates involved in clergy child abuse cases. The Vatican criticized the raids but reaffirmed its ""strong condemnation of any sinful and criminal abuse of minors by members of the church."" It cited ""the need to repair and confront such acts in conformity with the law and teachings of the Gospels."" The Catholic Church is facing allegations that clergy members abused children in at least half a dozen countries, including the pope's native Germany, as well as Belgium, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands and the United States.

"(CNN) -- Imagine this: in your hot little hands you hold a blueprint for a luxury hotel in one of the most idyllic -- and tiny -- locations in the world. There's just one problem -- there's no space to build the thing. The answer? Create a five-star yacht hotel. That's exactly the thinking behind Gibraltar's new $200 million Sunborn Yacht Hotel; a permanently moored vessel which could spell the future of architecture in land scarce cities around the world. ""In Gibraltar there's a huge demand for hotels, but how do you do it in such a small jurisdiction?"" Sunborn Gibraltar CEO, Brian Stevendale, told CNN. ""Unlike traditional building -- which involves trucks, cranes and a huge amount of disruption -- we have a ready built product that can be delivered to these prime areas."" Ship-shape . The mammoth 142-meter superyacht will rest its anchor in Gibraltar's Ocean Village Marina, located off the southern tip of Spain, with plans to open its doors to the public by the end of this year. Boasting 189 rooms, spa and gym, cocktail lounges, conference rooms, and even a ballroom, the luxury liner will be one of the grandest structures in the Mediterranean. At seven storeys tall, the vessel will dwarf nearby yachts in the marina, with rooms expected to cost between $300 and $3,000 per night. Plug in, tune out . The whopping boat, originally built in Malaysia, will be attached to the dock via six superstrong hydraulic arms, each weighing eight tons. Guests will enter through an enclosed glass bridge and Stevendale says once on board ""they will feel no different to being in a five-star hotel on land."" ""It's intriguing that something so large can literally just be plugged in to a port,"" he added. ""We will have enormous power cables safely secured underground."" Small territory, big ambition . Measuring just 6.8 square kilometres, the British territory of Gibraltar is a small state packing a big punch. Much like Monaco or Singapore, Gibraltar is a sunny tourist destination with a thriving economy -- yet lacks the space for urban development. That's where the Sunborn Yacht Hotel comes in, with Stevendale saying it could pave the way for similar vessels across the world -- and even be used at temporary events such as the World Cup or Olympics. Coming to a city near you? Gibraltar follows the company's first yacht hotel -- the ""Sunborn Princess"" -- which was moored at Naantali Spa Resort in Finland in 2002. There are now plans to anchor similar floating hotels in London and Barcelona. But with each contract usually spanning 10 years, Stevendale says its unlikely the vessels will be doing much cruising once they're in place. And if Sunborn is on the right track, the most successful boats could be those which never even set sail.","With land at a premium, property developers increasingly turn to floating hotels .

"(CNN) -- I will always love you. Unless you cause a ruckus and divert a non-stop flight from Los Angeles to New York to another airport. A customer on an American Airlines flight would not stop singing ""I will always love you,"" the classic Dolly Parton song also made famous by the late Whitney Houston in the movie ""The Bodyguard."" The flight was diverted to Kansas City's airport on Thursday after the woman became disruptive, according to CNN affiliate KMBC in Kansas City. A passenger video appears to show the woman singing the song as she's taken off the airplane by police. ""The passenger was detained, not arrested, and then released pending further investigation by the TSA (Transportation Safety Administration) and federal air marshals,"" said Tom McKenna, a Kansas City International Airport spokesman. ""I can confirm that she was singing 'I Will Always Love You' as she was escorted off the plane."" said McKenna. Kansas City Aviation Department officials told KMBC that the woman failed to cooperate with a federal air marshal. KMBC reports that the woman told authorities her behavior was a result of her diabetes.

"(CNN) -- An Australian teen was sentenced to two months in prison in Indonesia for marijuana use in a case that has drawn international attention. The sentence includes time already served so he is scheduled to be released on December 4, local prosecutors said Friday. He will leave Indonesia after this release and will be blacklisted from re-entering the nation for six months, Prosecutor Gusti Gede Putu Atmaja said. The teen had been moved to an immigration detention center from the police headquarters in late October. It was unclear where he will serve his detention. The 14-year old, whose name was not publicly released, has been held since his arrest last month in Bali while on holiday with his parents. The boy's attorney, Mohammad Rifan, said last month he hoped to avoid a prison sentence for his client and have him released to undergo drug rehabilitation. Indonesia's drug laws are among the strictest in the world. But they have a provision, article 128, under which those arrested with small amounts of drugs can be released to rehabilitation if they can prove they are an addict. In the case of underage offenders, that requires a declaration from the youth's parents, officials have said. A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said last month that the nation's policy on drug offenses is clear. ""I believe everybody should know by now that illegal drugs in Indonesia will face a really severe penalty,"" Michael Tene said. The case has drawn international attention, prompting Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to speak to the teenager on the phone, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said last month. Gillard's office told the network that she offered reassurance to the youth. Visitors to the country are warned, upon arrival, that some drug crimes carry a maximum penalty of death. Still, many have been arrested and convicted for various drug offenses. Two Australians are on death row in a Bali prison while six others are serving life sentences.

"(CNN) -- A group of friends got lucky when they bought a winning Powerball ticket at a Detroit-area porn shop. Mike Greer claimed the $128.6 million prize on Friday, on behalf of a group of southeastern Michigan residents that he dubbed ""Team Victory Club."" At a press conference in Lansing, Michigan, Greer wouldn't answer questions as to who purchased the ticket at Uptown Book Store in Highland Park, or why they were at the store in the first place. ""Nobody cares,"" said Greer. Uptown Book Store, an adult novelty store a few miles north of Detroit that also rents pornographic videos, will get $50,000 from lottery officials for selling the winning ticket. It shares a building with the Deja Vu strip club. At the same press conference, Steve Mays laid claim to a winning $141 million Mega Millions prize. Mays, who said he's been retired the past 10 years, said it was ""to be determined"" what he'd do with his jackpot. He opted for the annuity plan, spreading out his winnings over 26 years, according to CNN affiliate WILX. Team Victory Club, on the other hand, opted for a lump sum payout of $69.6 million before taxes. Greer said that the winners planned to give some of their money to an unnamed local church, ""and maybe fix some things around the house."" ""The prize is a blessing,"" said Greer, who did not divulge how many people would share the prize. ""We were in shock. Like I told my family, everything has changed, but nothing has changed."" Friday's dual announcement marked the largest single-day payout since the Michigan Lottery began 38 years ago, and the first time that a single state lottery has had Powerball and Mega Millions winners so close together, according to the Michigan Lottery.","A ticket that won a $128.6 million jackpot was purchased at a Michigan porn shop .

"(CNN) -- Embracing the hair you're born with sounds like it should be the easiest thing in the world, but for some, it's a huge challenge. Nikki Walton, a 29-year-old licensed psychotherapist whose own journey to hair acceptance has grown from a passion into a business, knows that hurdle all too well. As the founder of CurlyNikki.com, Walton now confidently boasts a lush, natural texture that lives up to her online nickname, ""Curly Nikki."" On her website, she leads the charge for a community of women seeking a resource and a space where they can let their hair down, just as it is, no straightening required. But Walton can vividly recall the days when straight hair meant beautiful hair, and if she couldn't be seen with it straight, she'd rather not go out at all. As a young adult, Walton would feel ""gorgeous"" and ""ready"" to take on the world when her dark hair's natural twists and turns were straight, sleek and swinging thanks to a stylist's heat tools. But when that style fell flat and the frizz began to appear, ""I would become an introvert; I didn't want to do anything,"" she said. Eventually, the boyfriend who was driving her to and from hair appointments -- and who's now her husband and father to their 2Â½-year-old daughter -- intervened. ""He said, 'This isn't healthy. I don't know if you've noticed, but you need to step back and assess this. You're pretty, and I want you to feel pretty no matter what the condition of your hair is,' "" Walton recalled. ""And he was right. My hair was running my life. My confidence was in flux with my hair."" That conversation inspired Walton to take action, and she soon found herself researching ways she could work with the kind of hair she was born with. Once she unchained herself from her flat iron, she found not only a more genuine confidence but a new freedom to live her life as she chose -- not as her hairstyle mandated. ""Once you get to that freedom,"" she said, ""you'll be very excited to help those around you achieve that as well."" Walton has been lending that helping hand on CurlyNikki.com for the past four years, and she recently compiled her accumulated wealth of hair care know-how into a book, ""Better Than Good Hair: The Curly Girl Guide to Healthy, Gorgeous, Natural Hair."" Walton describes the guide as a little like ""What To Expect When You're Expecting,"" mixed with the approachable, easy-to-understand wisdom she extends on the Web. Depending on the person, opting to wear one's hair in its natural state can feel like a rebirth of sorts. Some women may choose to cut much of their hair off -- doing a ""big chop,"" as it's called -- to get rid of heat-damaged or chemically straightened locks. For others like Walton, who opted to wear her hair more naturally but skipped the dramatic haircut, there's still a learning curve to figure out how to wear one's natural hair texture. ""In my house,"" Walton said, ""any time we had somewhere important to go, if it was Easter Sunday (or) Christmas Mass, we had to make sure our hair was pressed and braided neatly. That's what my mom knew, that's what her mom knew, so we didn't even question it."" By the time she was in middle school, Walton would want to ""shrink into a hole"" at the salon while she waited for a stylist to blow dry her freshly washed hair. ""I didn't want people to see my hair. I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror,"" she recalled. ""I didn't even know what my real texture looked like. ... I just knew that if it got a little bit wet, or if I sweat(ed) a little bit too much, I put my hands into my roots, and it felt terrible."" As a result, Walton had to do both a habitual and a mental shift when she decided that having healthy hair was more important. That new way involved regularly trimming her hair herself and wearing what she calls ""low-manipulation"" styles, like buns, which meant she wasn't putting added stress on her hair with constant washing and styling. Celebrity hairstylist and salon owner Ted Gibson concurs with Walton's careful, routine trimming, which he says is essential whether you chemically straighten your hair or are as natural as can be. ""Sometimes women, when they get a relaxer, they don't want to get a haircut, but that's part of the service for us,"" Gibson said. ""Getting your ends trimmed is essential in growing your hair and making your hair so that it's in better shape. Hair will split after a period of time, and that's sometimes where thinning hair comes from."" It took Walton about a year and a half to get rid of her damaged bits, and at the time, she was simultaneously working on being able to leave the house with her new, natural 'do. At first, ""you have that spotlight effect, because you think everybody's staring at you, because you're very self-conscious,"" Walton said. ""And most people aren't staring at you, and if they are, maybe they're thinking good things, not the negative things you're projecting onto them."" On her site and particularly in her book, Walton emphasizes how necessary confidence is to the process. ""This is your hair, and people have to accept it because you do. And when you exude that confidence, people get that from you and they don't bother you. Often, we have to fake it till we make it, because people will be able to detect that insecurity."" The phrase ""natural hair"" is thrown around a lot, and it can mean different things to different people. There are those who would agree with celebrity stylist Laini Reeves, for whom being natural starts with the product. ""Being a hairdresser, I look for two things: I look for performance, and I look for ingredients. It's hard to find completely 100% natural hair care that has the performance that you need, but technology is becoming so advanced that the chemists know how to alter ingredients that make it have the performance,"" said Reeves, who's worked with stars like Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. For example, if you're a curly, you might want to check out coconut oil to use as a conditioner, Reeves said, in an effort to rebuild the hair and get a softer texture. ""My advice to anybody: Read the label and educate yourself,"" Reeves said. ""I'm not an extremist. I'm not anti this or that; I just like to make more conscious decisions in my life."" Walton, too, cautions against the perception that maintaining natural hair means standing against chemical straighteners or straight hair overall. ""It's all about achieving versatility and achieving healthy hair and achieving the freedom to be able to wear your hair curly or straight,"" she said. ""The goal that I had for myself was to feel just as attractive and just as professional and sexy with my hair curly as I felt when it was straight. I'm there in that place now, and I want other women to be able to experience that too. That level of confidence, we call it genuine self-esteem -- the kind that doesn't fluctuate."" There's also a side benefit to all of that confidence, Walton added. ""Accepting what your hair does naturally will help you attain a better quality of life,"" she said. ""You can straighten your hair and do whatever you want to do, because we're women; we like to change it up. It's that key of getting comfortable in your own skin. My quality of life has greatly improved now that my first thought and consideration is not my hair."" Have you struggled with going natural?

"(CNN) -- When Piper Below lost her dog, Jack, on a morning walk, the last thing she expected was to find him with the help of hundreds of strangers on the Internet. But since Below was desperate to track him down, she did just that -- by going to popular Internet forum Reddit and posting a plea on the Houston board for residents to look out for her dog. After an outpouring of people offered to keep an eye out, one Reddit user found Jack wandering in the parking lot of a grocery store and reached out to let Below know. ""REDDIT HE'S FOUND!!!! AND YOU DID IT!!!!! I have to leave to take him to the vet but he seems like maybe he's ok. I COULD KISS YOU ALL!,"" Below wrote on the forum. Below, a professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health, told HLN that she was originally worried that she couldn't dedicate the time to Jack that he deserved. After finding the dog wandering dazed in the middle of the street in early September, she took him in and tried to do what she could to nurse him back to health. ""He had skin infections, eye infections. He was filthy, malnourished, you name it,"" she said. ""He seemed sweet for a dog that didn't seem coherent. I have never owned a dog before, but I did my best to nurse him back to health."" After a few rounds of meds and some good rest, Jack seemed to be making a speedy recovery ... but Below's plan to find him a home elsewhere was quickly eroding. ""I kept seeing this incredible personality come out of him,"" she told HLN. ""When we went to the vet to get his issues addressed, he just set his chin on my knee and waited calmly while he got prodded and poked. He had only known me for a week, and he had stolen my heart."" Below had made the decision to keep Jack in early October. She, Jack and a neighbor were walking in an empty lot near her home on December 1 when Jack slipped through a gap in the fence and took off. Below watched as he ran into the street and was hit by a big, white truck. ""He bounced off the truck, got up and ran back toward us. I thought he was coming back, but he darted off instead. And I knew I had to find him,"" she told HLN. That night, Below decided to take to Reddit to see if she could spread the word to look for Jack. She posted in several different forums and went to sleep after spending time with supportive friends. The next morning, she woke up to hundreds of messages. A Reddit user put her in touch with a man that maintains a large email list of people involved in animal rescue, which eventually led to one of the people on the list finding Jack. Below was at work at around 3:30 p.m. Monday when she got a phone call from a woman who said she had her eyes on Jack nearby. Below darted as fast as her legs could carry her to find them. ""A man came up to me when I was running to meet her and asked if I had seen a dog, and I said ""I'm looking for my dog!' and he said 'I'm from Reddit!' It was crazy and amazing,"" Below said. Below finally found Jack with the woman who had contacted her, and when she did, the reunion was nothing but tears and palpable relief. ""I saw his body relax as soon as he saw me,"" she told HLN. ""So I had this scared, filthy dog in my arms, and I was crying. There just aren't words."" Below said that the support from Reddit stunned and amazed her. ""I got e-mails from people that said 'I go on a walk every day. I'll reroute near where Jack was lost and look for him.' One woman said she was stuck at home with an injury and had nothing to do, so she would go look for him. And even when we found him, we met someone who was out looking for him,"" she told HLN. While not a heavy Reddit user before now (Below describes herself as more of a ""lurker""), she said that the site is an incredible tool for gathering information and that she uses it daily to keep an eye on what's going on in the world. ""It curates the entire Internet for you,"" she told HLN. ""And thanks to it, I found my dog.""","Piper Below lost her dog during a morning walk .

"(CNN) -- George S. Patton did not like Willie and Joe. Bill Mauldin, on top of a jeep (his favored mode of transportation), was a hero to soldiers for his cartoons. The famed general was a spit-and-polish man, and ""Willie & Joe"" -- Bill Mauldin's popular cartoon dogfaces, who appeared every day in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes -- were anything but: unshaven, rumpled, their boots caked with mud, eyes weary from days on the line. The general made it known that he was not amused, and eventually Mauldin -- a 23-year-old sergeant who'd entered the Army to escape an aimless life in the rugged Southwest -- was summoned to Patton's impressive headquarters, a requisitioned palace in Luxembourg. ""Now then, Sergeant,"" Patton said to Mauldin, as recalled in a new biography, Todd DePastino's ""Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front"" (W.W. Norton). ""About those pictures you draw of those god-awful things you call soldiers. ... No respect for the Army, their officers, or themselves. ... What are you trying to do, incite a goddamn mutiny?""  See some of Mauldin's award-winning work » . That was the last thing on Mauldin's mind. He was trying to tell the truth. The cartoonist, who died at age 81 in 2003, had a storied career that included two Pulitzers -- including one for ""Willie & Joe"" -- several best-selling books and renown from veterans. But he never let his abiding concern for the regular guy stray far from his thoughts. ""If I see a stuffed shirt, I want to punch it. If it's big, hit it. You can't go far wrong,"" he once said. DePastino, a history professor at Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania, found Mauldin's work a revelation. Like many of the postwar generation, all he knew of Mauldin were the occasional references in Charles Schulz's ""Peanuts,"" in which Snoopy would talk about quaffing root beers at Mauldin's house. ""I got 'Up Front' [Mauldin's first book], read it, and was stunned by the genius of the artwork,"" he recalls in an interview. ""It was like a hidden transcription of the war. ... I wanted to know what was behind the cartoons, and why they were allowed to be published."" Indeed, ""Willie & Joe"" was unlike anything that had appeared in America during World War II. In the early years of the war, the U.S. government had focused on the upbeat, but as the optimism of U.S. entry gave way to the two-steps-forward, one-step-back grind of daily battle -- coupled with stark sacrifices at home -- the strategy fell apart. Mauldin's characters were bluntly honest: War was dirty, absurd, bitter hard work. ""Willie & Joe"" quickly caught on with both enlisted men and -- upon syndication in the States -- the general public. ""I think the home front was hungry for the truth,"" says DePastino. Mauldin's cartoons provided ""a needed dose of realism,"" he says. ""[The message was] the enemy is lethal and people overseas are sacrificing more than you are."" But Mauldin had some officers on his side, up to and including the Supreme Allied Commander himself, Dwight D. Eisenhower. When Mauldin returned to the States, he was a hero. His first book, ""Up Front"" -- a memoir with cartoons -- became a tremendous best-seller, as did the follow-up, ""Back Home."" For a time he lived in suburban Rockland County, New York, among other successful artists and writers. But life among the creative swells gnawed at him, and in the late '50s he became an editorial cartoonist, first for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, later for the Chicago Sun-Times. He took on racism, Cold War politics, Vietnam and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. He also went through the classic changes of his generation. He struggled with alcoholism. He was twice divorced, grappled with the counterculture, watched the World War II generation become forgotten and then deified. Through it all, he maintained a healthy skepticism for the establishment, whether it be martinet officers, self-important politicians or the suits in the corner office. DePastino remains surprised that his is the first biography of Mauldin, which perhaps speaks to the low regard our culture -- even pop culture -- has for cartoonists. ""If Mauldin had been a writer, there would have been a biography [by now],"" he says. But the soldiers themselves -- men such as Schulz, a World War II vet who didn't meet Mauldin until years after first mentioning him in ""Peanuts"" -- knew Mauldin's value. When he talks about the book, DePastino says, he gets his most emotional responses from veterans and their families. ""His art was about a group of men who are suffering unspeakable horrors in the trenches. His audience was those very men,"" he says. ""It's odd -- he was kind of mirroring their lives back to them. ... He was doing this for those guys. How many artists do that?""","Bill Mauldin created award-winning ""Willie & Joe,"" about Army grunts, in WWII .

"(CNN) -- Valentine's Day evokes a variety of expectations. Some look forward to a romantic dinner or a special gift, while others treat it like any other day. Whatever the case, how you approach this nationally recognized ""holiday"" reflects your expectations within your relationship, experts say. ""It varies from couple to couple, but usually the way you feel about it is a metaphor for your expectations of the relationship,"" said family psychotherapist Fran Walfish. If someone's more easygoing and has low expectations, it says something about his or her ability to be flexible and adaptable, she said. On the other hand, if a husband expects the wife to surprise him with dinner at a restaurant he's secretly dying to go to, it shows that he sets the bar high in the relationship and expects her to deliver, Walfish said. It doesn't hurt to use Valentine's Day as an opportunity to step up your game and show you care, but don't let the relationship live or die based on this day alone, she said. ""The affirmation and declaration of love is not in a gift or in one day. It's a 365-day year experience of feeling like your partner has an interest and desire to know your wants and comfort level."" What couples do also tends to evolve depending on the stage of the relationship. CNN's team of feature writers and producers solicited feedback from Facebook and beyond on how folks plan to observe Valentine's Day, if at all, with bonus information on nontraditional relationships. Young love . For new couples, Valentine's Day is a good opportunity to set the record straight as far as expectations, with an open, honest discussion, which could help determine whether the relationship's going to work, Walfish said. Among our Facebook friends, that means dinner or drinks at a place they've been dying to try. A card, candy, or a thoughtful gift might be involved to let your partner know you're serious. If Valentine's Day occurs early in the relationship, the female tends to expect more from the guy, and he's probably stressing out over the situation, said Blaire Allison, ""The Love Guru,"" who coaches people in matters of the heart. ""When you're first starting a relationship, there's always that fear factor involved because the guy doesn't want to disappoint the girl, but he but doesn't want to do something over the top that'll scare her off,"" Allison said. The DINKS (double-income, no kids) Married or not, this ain't their first rodeo, and they tend to know what they want out of the evening. Plus, having no kids means more time, money and flexibility to do whatever you want. To us, it kind of seems like the best situation for doing something for the holiday, as it elicited the most diverse responses. For some, it meant date night at Carnegie Hall or steak frites and a night in a hotel. A friend who's a vegan chef is making a special meatless meal for her sweetie, complete with chocolate cookies with raspberry jam centers. Eatocracy managing editor Kat Kinsman says she and her husband buy each other Scotch or Madiran wine, and he cooks the same meal every year: steak (the first year, it was heart-shaped), pattypan squash, hen of the woods mushrooms. Another constant: ""There is NEVER a restaurant involved."" When money is tight, a bouquet of flowers does the trick, one friend said, as they're ""cheaper than jewelry and healthier than chocolate."" Speaking of thoughtful and unhealthy, one person who flew home from a conference in Chicago brought a deep-dish pizza back to her significant other. Married with children . Children might change priorities in a relationship, but that makes Valentine's Day the perfect opportunity for a couple to reclaim some time just for themselves, Walfish said. ""Many people who've been married for a long time can get lazy and stuck in a rut and don't want to take the energy and initiative,"" she said. ""If there's no time to get away, after the children go to sleep, plan to be together and not in pajamas and take the time to make good eye contact and commit."" Things are a bit different for one friend now that he and his wife have a toddler. But he still writes a poem for his wife and they make handmade gifts for each other. Another friend and her husband have cut back on dinners out since the birth of their daughter and purchasing a new home, but they still exchange cards. The long haul . Eventually, the children grow up and leave the nest, if all goes according to plan. For some, it's an opportunity to reclaim life as a couple. Dinner and flowers are generally a part of the celebration, with special enhancements when possible, said a relative who lives in Europe. In recent years, the couple have spent weekends in Barcelona, Spain, and Oxford, England. The husband bought a picture for his wife of two people walking in a park together that reminded him of them. ""All the more special since I gave it to her on Valentine's Day,"" he said. ""Still my favorite picture."" Nontraditional relationships . Not every relationship fits into one of those categories, but that doesn't mean nontraditional lovers don't want to celebrate their relationships just like the rest. Take, for example, polyamorous ""families,"" which consist of multiple romantic partners, from as few as three to north of 20 in some instances. ""Each of my partners is like those in any monogamous relationships,"" said Shara Smith, a representative of the Polyamory Media Association, which provides members of the press with information and spokespeople on how polyamory works. ""There's really no difference between how I feel about my current partners or how we relate to each other. The only difference is I didn't have to break up with one to start the other."" Smith, her three male partners and their additional ""metamors"" are going out for dinner at a nice steakhouse in Tampa, Florida. All told, there will be six of them around the table. ""I don't personally observe Valentine's Day, but my partners' other partners do,"" she said. ""The holiday's not important, but making my loved ones feel that I care about them is important.""","What couples do on Valentine's Day depends on the stage of the relationship .
For new couples, it's a good opportunity to set the record straight for expectations .
Valentine's Day can be an opportunity to reclaim life as a couple ."
"(CNN) -- In a tent on the lawn just in front of the United States Capitol, immigration reform advocates are entering their second week without food to protest congressional inaction on legislation that would create a road to citizenship for 11 million aspiring Americans. The core group at the ""Fast for Families"" has gone 13 days surviving only on water — including Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, Dae Joong Yoon of the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium and Cristian Avila with the group Mi Familia Vota. They have pledged to continue their fast until immigration reform is enacted by Congress or until doctors tell them their lives are at risk. Last week, Vice President Joe Biden and Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council in the White House, visited the fasters. This week, during a speech in San Francisco about the urgent need for immigration reform, President Obama gave a shout-out to those fasting. The president said, ""We hear you. The whole country is with you."" Which is, of course, partially true. The fact is that a strong majority of Americans do indeed support the goals of those fasting and want a comprehensive immigration law that includes a road to citizenship. According to a recent poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute, at least 73% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans support such a measure. Not only that, but about three-in-four voters in key Republican-represented swing Congressional districts also support immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship. So who, exactly, isn't with the fasters? Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. If the immigration reform bill already passed by the Senate were brought for a vote in the House, it would likely pass — because 29 House Republicans have indicated their support, including many from those swing districts and districts with growing Latino communities. Yet Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner refuses to give the bill a vote. Yeah, you read that correctly — a bill that would bring relief to millions of undocumented immigrant families just in time for the holidays, a bill that a strong majority of voters in both parties support, a bill that everyone from community groups to business groups resoundingly supports, a bill that would actually pass both Houses of Congress and become law despite our historic levels of gridlock — that bill isn't even being brought up for a vote because John Boehner just doesn't want to do it. Such is the sad state of so-called leadership in the Republican Party today. If you haven't seen the video in which teen activists confront Boehner while he's eating his breakfast at a diner and tell him their stories of how immigrant families are being ripped apart every day in America, it's worth a watch. Boehner says he'll ""try to find a way to move a bill forward."" But in fact, he has been the one singlehandedly blocking a vote. So the brave souls in the tent in front of the Capitol continue not to eat. Are they hungry? Sure. But, as Eliseo Medina, a son of Mexican migrant farmworkers, told the Washington Post, ""(T)here is a deeper hunger within me, a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery among those who come here to escape poverty and violence in search of the American dream."" The juxtaposition is powerful. At a diner near the Capitol, you have Boehner casually dumping salt on his plate of food while seeming completely uninterested in the plight of the two teens who are telling him how their families have been torn apart by America's broken immigration policies. In a tent near the Capitol, advocates are literally starving themselves to protest Boehner's callous inaction. This Thanksgiving, may we remember the story of our nation's founding — not always a simple story for all involved, and certainly not since, but at it essence, a story of people coming to a new land seeking new opportunity. And when we sit down to eat our turkey and fixings, may we remember those who are going without food to support the millions of aspiring Americans whose families cannot be together this holiday season because of our broken laws. And may we pray that John Boehner, sitting with his own family and saying grace, can find it in his heart and political calculus to bestow grace on others — and finally let immigration reform have a vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","People fasting in D.C. to protest inaction on immigration reform with path to citizenship .

"San Diego (CNN) -- When asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants, President Barack Obama has responded: Yes, we can! Other times, the answer was: No we can't! This week, at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, Obama was heckled by an audience member who was later identified as Ju Hong, an undocumented student from South Korea who graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in political science. When Hong pleaded with Obama to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families, Obama responded: . ""Now, what you need to know, when I'm speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community, is that if, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition."" But, on October 26, 2011, at the University of Colorado-Denver, Obama said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt. ""We're not going to wait for Congress. I'm going to act with or without Congress. Where they won't act, I will, through a series of executive orders. ... We're going to look every day to see what we can do without Congress."" And on October 25, 2010, on the Spanish-language radio show, ""Piolin por la Manana"" -- when host Eddie ""Piolin"" Sotelo asked him why he hadn't moved faster on immigration reform, Obama responded: . ""I am president, I am not a king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen."" Yet, two years later, while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among Latinos, Obama managed to get something done without Congress' approval. On June 15, 2012, he announced that his administration was offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to allow undocumented young people to temporarily avoid deportation and apply for a two-year work permit. Speaking from the Rose Garden, Obama said: . ""It makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. ... In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we've tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. ... Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people."" Confused? Join the club. Obama's immigration schtick is simple. He blames Republicans for the fact that we don't have immigration reform. H3 covers up for Democrats in Congress who have had a poor record on immigration. He insists that his administration is not deporting Dreamers or anyone else who isn't a hard-core criminal. And -- as he did this week -- he claims that his hands are tied because he needs Congress as a dance partner. So if a president takes action without Congress, he violates the law? But this isn't true. There's such a thing as the executive order. Obama has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt. It's a well-worn presidential tool -- George W. Bush issued 287; Bill Clinton issued 308. In his most recent use of executive power, Obama is attempting to tinker with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act so that Americans can keep their health plans a while longer. The point: When it comes to using the power of the presidency for causes he really cares about, Obama is no shrinking violet. So he must not care about immigration. The audience in San Francisco wasn't buying it. Hong shouted at the president that he had ""the power to stop deportations for all"" because there are ""thousands of families separated every single day."" The actual figure is about 1,100 deportations every day if apprehensions and deportations keep pace with the rate in previous years -- roughly 400,000 per year, totaling a record of nearly 2 million since Obama took office. Obama pushed back against Hong, insisting that he didn't have the power to stop deporting people or dividing families. ""That's why we're here,"" he said. Other people in the crowd sided with Hong and began to shout: ""Stop deportations! Yes, we can!"" On the defensive, Obama unleashed the left's favorite weapon: condescension. ""So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" he said. ""What I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done."" You know what is an easy way out, Mr. President? Not being constrained by core principles because you change your position whenever you need to get out of a scrape. After the exchange, Hong claimed that he hadn't planned to challenge the President of the United States, but that he couldn't take it anymore. ""This is very urgent,"" he told reporters. ""This is the only venue where I could speak out, and I'm representing the voices of other undocumented students who are actually in the detention center right now and who cannot be here."" Bravo. This young man is a hero for bravely speaking truth to power. Way to represent.

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- A California couple accused in Qatar of deliberately starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death appeared in court Tuesday. The hearing was the first for Matthew and Grace Huang since they were released from custody last month on bail. They have been ordered to remain in Doha. The couple deny charges of murdering Gloria, one of three children they adopted from Africa. She died in January. Both the defense and the prosecution presented written and oral arguments to the court Tuesday. In his statement, the prosecutor painted a picture of Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane people who had been ""cheaply sold"" their adopted child. He called for both to be given the death penalty for the girl's death and, in colorful language, suggested that he could visualize her rushing up to the judges' bench, begging for justice. He said the Huangs kept Gloria locked in her room, deprived of food and water, and that a key was found on the outside of the door. The prosecutor argued that both the hospital and forensics reports on her death indicated that she died of starvation and that any witness statements should be discounted by the court. He also cited testimony from one of the girl's brothers, saying the child told prosecutors that their parents used to punish Gloria for stealing food by locking her into her room. Medical records . Defense lawyer Sami Abu Sheikha argued that there is no evidence to indicate the couple had wanted to kill their daughter. Witnesses had seen Gloria eating on the Friday and the Monday before her death in the early hours of Tuesday, January 15, the lawyer said, adding that two days without food would not have been enough for her to starve to death. He also pointed to hospital and forensic reports that showed she died of dehydration and cachexia, a wasting condition. This can result from causes other than starvation, Abu Sheikha said. The reports showed that her pancreas was inflamed, which could mean it wasn't working properly, and there was inflammation of the lungs, he said. The reports also showed that Gloria had ingested food and liquid that was still in her intestines and bladder, he said. The defense lawyer also cited Gloria's siblings as telling the prosecutor she had been playing with them outside her room before she died. Other witnesses had also seen her the day before her death, he said. Abu Sheikha added that photographs showed bottles of water beside the child's bed and that, in any case, her room had a bathroom where she could have drunk the water from the taps if she needed to. He said her medical records showed that she had a history of eating disorders. Defense effort . The judge ordered that the defense be given another chance to rebut the prosecution's arguments in a hearing February 5. The two defendants appeared more relaxed and better rested than in their previous court appearance, when they were still in detention. Grace, who had previously appeared in court with her head covered, was this time dressed in slacks and a blouse with her hair uncovered. No relatives of the Huangs' were in court Tuesday, but a handful of staff members from the U.S. Embassy in Doha were present. The David House Agency, an advocacy group for Americans overseas, has been coordinating the Huangs' defense effort. In August, the agency set up a website that describes the circumstances of their detention. Matthew and Grace Huang moved to Qatar in 2012 with their three adopted children. Matthew, a Stanford-educated engineer, was working on infrastructure projects related to the 2022 World Cup. But everything changed January 15, when he found his daughter dead. The parents were arrested, charged with murder and accused of starving their daughter to death. The David House Agency says Gloria's eating disorder involved starving herself and then bingeing on food. It says this disorder arose from her childhood in Ghana before she was adopted. CNN's Leone Lakhani, Schams Elwazer and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Grace and Matthew Huang deny murdering their adopted daughter, Gloria .

"(CNN) -- A judge granted a temporary restraining order Friday to keep a 13-year-old girl on life support after she was declared brain dead following a tonsillectomy at a hospital in Oakland, California. Alameda Superior Court judge Evelio Grillo gave the family of Jahi McMath and hospital officials until Monday to appoint an independent physician to further examine the girl. Jahi was declared brain dead December 12, three days after she was to have surgery to remove her tonsils. Doctors at Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland had recommended the tonsillectomy and other procedures to treat Jahi's sleep apnea, weight gain, inability to concentrate, short attention span and other afflictions. Her surgery initially appeared to have gone well, said Sandy Chatman, Jahi's grandmother who is herself a nurse and who saw the girl in the recovery room. But soon after surgery, Jahi's condition quickly deteriorated and she went into cardiac arrest, her family said. A scan showed two-thirds of Jahi's brain had swollen. Doctors declared her brain-dead, and days later planned to take her off life support until receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the family's attorney, Christopher B. Dolan. Jahi's mother, Latasha ""Nailah"" Winkfield, who has maintained a constant vigil by her daughter's bedside, said her daughter has responded to touching and shows other signs of life. In a meeting Thursday night between Jahi's family and doctors, attorney Dolan said the girl's mother pleaded with doctors to insert a feeding tube, keep her on a ventilator through Christmas and give the family 48 hours' notice should doctors decide to take Jahi off of life-support. In their written response to the family's court motion Friday, attorneys for the hospital said Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland had ""no duty to continue mechanical ventilation or any other medical intervention for its deceased minor patient Jahi McMath."" ""Ms. McMath is deceased as a result of an irreversible cessation of all functions of her entire brain, including her brain stem,"" the response said, adding, ""Tragically, Ms. McMath is dead and cannot be brought back to life."" Attorney Dolan said the family was told by hospital officials Thursday that it was ""time to come to a consensus about terminating life support."" The attorney said the family was told, in effect, ""She is morally and legally dead, dead, dead."" Hospital officials have publicly called on the family to allow them to discuss Jahi's case, citing patient privacy laws that currently prevent them from disclosing information. ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Jahi McMath. This is a tragic situation,"" Dr, David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, said in a statement. ""We want the public to know that the family has not permitted us to discuss the medical situation. We implore the family to allow the hospital to openly discuss what has occurred and to give us the necessary legal permission -- which it (the family) has been withholding -- that would bring clarity, and we believe, some measure of closure and deeper understanding of this medical case,"" the statement read. Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey told CNN that the girl's mother wanted to keep Jahi on life support but hospital representatives informed them that long-term life support was not an option. Hospital spokeswoman Melinda Krigel said that the hospital has no policy about terminating life support. ""We work with the family to determine when that will happen,"" she said in an e-mail. ""There are instances when the coroner may request termination, but we always work with the family to respect their wishes."" Attorney Dolan said McMath's family has repeatedly asked doctors for the release of Jahi's medical records so he can hire an independent physician to determine whether she is legally dead. ""Their response has been, 'It's not our policy while providing care,'"" said Dolan. In a statement, Children's Hospital denied the family's assertion. ""Jahi's family has the same access to our medical records as the family of any patient at Children's. All families have the right to review the record while the patient is in the hospital, and have access to the entire record after the hospitalization has ended."" Dolan said court intervention was the only remedy to prevent doctors from terminating the life support. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Tom Watkins and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: The family of Jahi McMath wins a temporary restraining order .

"(CNN) -- The inside accounts of the Obama administration's internal debate over Afghanistan may be grabbing the headlines, but former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' new memoir has some other eye-openers as well. Yes, Gates levels blistering criticism at Congress, Vice President Joe Biden and former colleagues and describes White House aides working to undercut President Barack Obama's confidence in his own commanders. But in ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,"" the low-key Gates -- who replaced Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon late in George W. Bush's administration and was kept on by Obama when he took office in 2009 -- also talks about his own moments of doubt, anger and frustration. Here are a few items from the book that may surprise readers. -- Take this job and shove it: Gates fantasized about quitting . ""All too frequently, sitting at that witness table, the exit lines were on the tip of my tongue: 'I may be the secretary of defense, but I am also an American citizen, and there is no son of a bitch in the world who can talk to me like that. I quit. Find somebody else.' It was, I am confident, a widely shared fantasy throughout the executive branch."" -- Bush and Obama 'had much more in common than I expected.' That wasn't always good . ""Both were most comfortable around a coterie of close aides and friends (like most presidents) and largely shunned the Washington social scene. Both, I believe, detested Congress and resented having to deal with it, including members of their own party. And so, unfortunately, neither devoted much effort to wooing or even reaching out to individual members or trying to establish a network of allies, supporters -- or friends,"" Gates writes. ""They both had the worst of both worlds on the Hill: they were neither particularly liked nor feared. Accordingly, neither had many allies in Congress who were willing to go beyond party loyalty, self-interest, or policy agreement in supporting them."" However, Gates adds, ""I liked and respected both men."" ""I witnessed both of those presidents make decisions they believed to be in the best interest of the country regardless of the domestic political consequences, both thereby earning my highest possible respect and praise. Although, as I've said, political considerations were far more a part of national security debates under Obama, time and again I saw him make a decision that was opposed by his political advisers or that would be unpopular with his fellow Democrats and supportive interest groups."" -- The price of public service: . Gates writes that he spent $40,000 on lawyers to help him fill out financial disclosures and other government paperwork. Before his 2006 confirmation hearing, he filled out a 65-page questionnaire from the Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, Bush's chief of staff, Josh Bolten, ""asked if I had any ethical issues that could be a problem, like hiring illegal immigrants as nannies or housekeepers. ""I decided to have some fun at his expense and told him we had a non-citizen housekeeper. Before he began to hyperventilate, I told him she had a green card and was well along the path to citizenship. I don't think he appreciated my sense of humor,"" Gates wrote. He told his wife, ""I have to do this, but I just hope I can get out of this administration with my reputation intact."" -- 'I couldn't sleep that night' Gates writes that an encounter with a woman in a restaurant who had two sons fighting in Iraq drove home the human dimension of the job. ""I couldn't finish my dinner, and I couldn't sleep that night,"" he wrote. ""Our wars had just become very real to me, along with the responsibility I was taking on for all those in the fight."" -- Time to go: . By early 2011, ""My fuse was really getting short. It seemed like I was blowing up -- in my own, quiet way -- nearly every day, and no longer just in the privacy of my office with my staff ... I had blown up at (National Security Adviser Thomas) Donilon and the vice president at a meeting on Libya on March 2 and at House Defense Appropriations chair Bill Young on the third, and had come close to openly arguing with the president in the NSC meeting that same day, and had gone off on Donilon again on the fifth. Partly, I think, I was just exhausted from the daily fights."" In addition, he wrote that his desire to protect U.S. troops -- ""from the wars we were in and from new wars -- was clouding my judgment and diminishing my usefulness to the president, and this is played a part in my decision to retire."" He left that June, with Obama awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- the highest U.S. civilian honor -- on his way out.","Bob Gates' memoir includes quitting fantasies, fears for troops .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown announced Tuesday almost $1 billion in midyear budget cuts as a result of insufficient state growth. The so-called ""trigger cuts"" will result in reduced spending for universities, schools, prosecutions, and in-home care for the elderly and disabled, Brown said. ""They're not good,"" Brown said of the cuts. ""This is not the way we like to run California, but we have to live within our means."" The latest round of cuts is on top of $16 billion in reduced spending that the state enacted earlier this year, Brown said. The $1 billion figure is better than an earlier estimate that as much as $2.4 billion in trigger cuts would be needed by the end of this year, Brown said. California's economy -- the eighth largest in the world -- grew by about $100 billion this year, allowing the state's cuts to be less than the $2.4 billion figure, Brown said. ""The good new is the economy of California is recovering,"" the governor told reporters in Sacramento. ""But it's not enough to close the California deficit that has been built up for years."" In June, California lawmakers passed a budget bill that reduced the state's deficit from $26 billion to $5 billion, officials said. California's general fund spending this year amounts to $85.9 billion, down 6.1% from the prior year. ""General fund spending as a share of the economy is now at its lowest level since 1972-73,"" a summary to the California budget says. Next November, California voters will go to the polls to consider taxes that would provide $7 billion in additional revenue, Brown said. ""We need a real serious public discussion between now and November on whether or not people want to spend more,"" he said. ""All I can say is you can't provide money that you don't have. That's the point here: You either cut or you tax,"" Brown said. ""As the governor of California, I'm sensitive to what these cutbacks do to real people.""","NEW: Next November, California voters will consider taxes raising $7 billion in revenue .

"(CNN) -- Illegal weapons have been found inside the northern Prague residence of a Palestinian diplomat who died Wednesday of injuries suffered when he opened a safe in the living room and an explosion occurred, police said Thursday. ""Several illegal firearms were seized by the police in the flat of the late Palestinian ambassador,"" Jamal al Jamal, Prague police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova told CNN about al Jamal, 57. She would not say how many weapons were found or where they may have come from. In the Czech Republic, all firearms must be registered with authorities; possession requires a permit. Police said Wednesday that al Jamal died after an explosion possibly related to his improper handling of a safe inside his house in the neighborhood of Suchdol. He died after he was taken to Prague Military Hospital. ""The explosion was most likely caused by dangerous or unqualified manipulation with the safety box by the ambassador himself,"" Zoulova said Wednesday. ""The explosive device was probably part of the safety mechanism of the safe."" She added that authorities had found evidence of explosives in the debris. However, police have ruled out any ""criminal involvement of a third person intending to kill a particular person,"" she said Thursday. She had said Wednesday that the incident was not related to terrorism. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry announced that the explosion occurred minutes after al Jamal opened an old safe that had been moved from the old diplomatic mission to his two-story house, which was being readied to house the new diplomatic mission. A high-level delegation sent by the ministry arrived in Prague on Thursday to help with the investigation. The house was newly constructed, said CTK, a state-run news agency. The blast, which occurred about 12:30 p.m. (6:30 a.m. ET), also injured al Jamal's 52-year-old wife, who was treated at an area hospital for smoke inhalation and shock. The couple's son, who was also in the house at the time of the blast, was not hurt. Al Jamal had been a diplomat in the Czech Republic since last October, CTK said.

"(CNN) -- Take one part Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" two parts Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" and an even larger measure of guesswork and North Korea's latest political drama could seem like a Cold War thriller. For North Korea watchers, the all too real political theater playing out in Pyongyang may offer another tantalizing glimpse behind the opaque curtain of the North Korean regime, but raises more questions than answers. Depending on how you read the signs, the execution of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's uncle and formerly trusted regent, Jang Song Thaek, either shows a young leader further cementing his control, or the first death throes of a regime teetering on collapse. In the absence of any independently verifiable information, and in a regime where paranoid rhetoric is the normal register of almost all diplomatic language, any conjecture is likely to be as accurate as it is to be wide of the mark. North Korea: Leader's 'traitor' uncle executed . For Jasper Kim, the founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, North Korea remains for analysts a ""Rubik's Cube that no one can solve."" He said North Korea is a master at carefully choreographing the way it releases news events to cloak its real intentions. Nevertheless, he said a careful reading between the lines of North Korean new agency KCNA sometimes reveals glimpses of the state of the regime. He said that far from asserting the leadership of Kim, recent events suggest that his position has been seriously eroded by the execution of his uncle. ""My guess is that these events happened some time ago and they are only now being released,"" Kim told CNN. ""The fact is that we don't know what's going on in North Korea but what we are seeing coming through on KCNA is very concerning. ""When you look at the language used in these KCNA reports it is particularly hawkish and it's much more reflective of the military than it is of Kim Jong Un. ""Basically we are seeing the hardline faction reassert itself. For Kim Jong Un, Jang Song Thaek was the bridge between him and his father, and now he will have very little protection."" He said that North Korea, famous for tightly controlling the drip feed of real information coming out of the country, was now sending out violently mixed messages. ""The recent release of the prisoner (Merrill Newman) and this execution couldn't be more at odds; what this indicates is that it's a chaotic situation in there,"" he added. ""What this points to in terms of regime change is that it's a question of 'when' rather than 'if.' ""What history tells us is that when it does happen it will be unexpected and extreme and everyone must be prepared for the worst case scenario."" For Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, however, the purge of Jang shows a young leader consolidating his grip on power. ""Some of the reasons are quite obvious and very transparent and many predicted that this was going to happen. What is really surprising is how it happened. Pretty much everybody expected that in the near future a state head would be removed from power,"" Lankov told CNN. ""But people did not expect that it would happen in such a dramatic and theatrical manner."" He said that Jang's removal and execution displayed the deadly manner of generational political change in North Korea. ""Kim Jong Un became the leader of the country after only one year of being a kind of anointed successor. He has had no time to create his own team, so he's had no choice but to rely on the team from his father and this team consists of people who are in their 60s and 70s and sometimes even older. He said that this politburo consisted of men who could be Kim's father or even grandfather. ""Imagine how difficult it is to run a country -- especially one with a strong Confucian tradition -- when all your senior advisers are older than you. And these are people who can have very different ideas of goals and strategies. ""It was clear from the first days of his rule that he would remove most of the people around him. Jang was particularly vulnerable exactly because he was initially appointed by late Kim Jong Il to be a regent -- the chief adviser to the young ruler. ""But being a regent is a dangerous job. The king gets older and he feels more and more irritation and to hold more of a grudge against these noisy, strange, grumpy old men. ""For a regent, it's very good to know when to retire but not everyone is smart enough.""

"(CNN) -- Actress Mackenzie Phillips reveals she had a long-term incestuous relationship with her famous father, musician John Philips, in a tell-all memoir, according to People.com, which obtained an advance copy of her book. Actress Mackenzie Phillips reportedly reveals a family secret to Oprah Winfrey. Phillips, the 49-year-old former child star and daughter of the Mamas and the Papas founder John Phillips, says she had sex with her father the night before she was to marry Jeff Sessler, a member of the Rolling Stones entourage, in 1979, according to People.com. ""On the eve of my wedding, my father showed up, determined to stop it,"" writes Phillips, who was 19 at the time and a heavy drug user, according to People.com. ""I had tons of pills, and Dad had tons of everything too. Eventually I passed out on Dad's bed."" Phillips, best known as Julie Cooper on the sitcom ""One Day at a Time,"" says the sexual relationship became consensual as her life began to spiral out of control. During her time on the hit CBS comedy, which ran from 1975 to 1984, she battled drug addiction and underwent drug rehabilitation. She later was fired from the show in 1980 because of her drug abuse.  Watch Phillips discuss her arrest » . Eventually, she and her father went to rehab together and she later toured with him in a band called the New Mamas and the Papas, according to People.com. ""I was a fragment of a person, and my secret isolated me,"" she writes, according to People.com. ""One night Dad said, 'We could just run away to a country where no one would look down on us. There are countries where this is an accepted practice. Maybe Fiji.' "" Phillips will reportedly unleash the secret she has kept to herself for 31 years in an interview on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" scheduled to air Wednesday. Phillips' book, ""High on Arrival,"" comes out the same day. Phillips has led a troubled life that has included substance abuse and a 2008 arrest at Los Angeles International Airport on suspicion of cocaine and heroin possession. She later pleaded guilty to one count of cocaine possession and was ordered to a drug rehab program. The interview features Phillips discussing the time she spent hiding in her home, compulsively purchasing items from a television shopping channel as well as the events surrounding her arrest. In a promotional clip for ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" Phillips also says her father shot her up with drugs. John Phillips, who died in 2001, had a well-documented drug problem and was convicted of drug trafficking in 1981. He told many stories of his drug abuse in his memoir, ""Papa John."" Mackenzie Phillips also tells Winfrey about an encounter she purportedly had with rock 'n' roll legend Mick Jagger. ""One Day at a Time"" co-star Valerie Bertinelli also appears on the Winfrey show in support of Phillips. Phillips' career as an actress took off when, as a teen, she performed the role of Carol Morrison in the 1973 film ""American Graffiti.""

"(CNN) -- Tottenham Hotspur acted swiftly after their worst home defeat in 16 years to dispense with the services of manager Andre Villas-Boas, the English Premier League club announced Monday. Liverpool's 5-0 thrashing of Tottenham Sunday left the north London club in seventh place, five points below the Champions League places and eight adrift of leaders Arsenal. It followed a 6-0 loss to Manchester City last month and a tally of just 15 goals in 16 EPL games this season. ""The club can announce that agreement has been reached with head coach, Andre Villas-Boas, for the termination of his services,"" read a short statement on the Tottenham website. ""The decision was by mutual consent and in the interests of all parties. We wish Andre well for the future. We shall make a further announcement in due course."" Villas-Boas, 36, spent 17 months in charge of Tottenham, taking over from Harry Redknapp before the start of last season. Inspired by Gareth Bale, Tottenham achieved their best ever EPL points tally of 72, but narrowly missed out on a Champions League place to their arch-rivals Arsenal. Bale's world record sale to Real Madrid in the transfer window preceded a spending spree by Tottenham as they invested a reported Â£105 million ($171 million) on new players. Results have been mixed, with a 100 per cent record in qualifying for the last 32 of the Europa League -- where they have been drawn against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk -- and progress to the quarterfinals of the English League Cup with a match against West Ham United Wednesday. But the pressure began to build after a sorry display against Manchester City, combined with earlier disappointing EPL home defeats to West Ham and Newcastle. Sunday's reverse, inspired by Luis Suarez, left Villas-Boas in an unenviable position, although he was defiant to the last. ""The call to make that decision is not mine because obviously I won't resign and I'm not a quitter,"" he told gathered reporter after the Liverpool match. ""The only thing I can do is work hard with the players to get them back on track. This is a top-four squad but in our Premier League form we are not there,"" he admitted. Villas-Boas previously spent nine months in charge at Chelsea before owner Roman Abramovich replaced him with Roberto Di Matteo. He had forged his reputation and was spoken of as the ""new Mourinho"" by leading Porto to the Europa League title and the Portuguese league and cup double in the same season. Villas-Boas becomes the fifth EPL manager to lose their job this campaign, following Paolo Di Canio (Sunderland), Ian Holloway (Crystal Palace) and Martin Jol (Fulham), while West Bromwich Albion parted company with Steve Clarke Saturday. Russia manager Fabio Capello, the former England head coach, has been installed as an early favorite by British bookmakers. Capello's former assistant with England at Roma and Real Madrid, Franco Baldini, is currently Tottenham's director of football. Tottenham later announced that former players Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand would take charge of first team affairs in the interim, assisted by Chris Ramsey, who is head of player development. Spanish La Liga side Valencia also parted company with their coach Monday after a poor weekend result, losing 3-0 to high-flying Atletico Madrid. Miroslav Djukic was relieved of his duties after only six months as the defeat left them 10 points adrift of Athletic Bilbao, who occupy the final Champions League spot. Like Villas-Boas, Djukic had guided his team into the last 32 of the Europa League, where they will face Dynamo Kiev, but their league form has been indifferent.","Tottenham Hotspur sack manager Andre Villas-Boas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Suits were swapped for jeans and sneakers throughout London's financial district today, as bankers heeded warnings to dress down to avoid the potential wrath of G-20 protestors. Bankers in London head to work in casual attire. Many city workers have been urged to dress down to avoid attention from protesters. ""Only about 20 percent of people probably just refused to dress down. Everybody else is in jeans,"" said Jesse Feldman, a banker at French investment bank, Société Générale. All week banks and investment firms located in London's City neighborhood have been advising employees to not dress in regular business attire. ""Staff are permitted to wear casual clothing -- jeans/trainers -- commencing March 30. Avoid briefcases/branded bags/computer cases: Put materials in rucksacks or carrier bags where possible,"" U.S. bank, J.P. Morgan told employees in an email statement last week quoted on City news Web site Hereisthecity.com. Employees at Rothschild investment bank in London were told simply not to bother coming into work at all today. Among those who did commute to the office, bystanders said that the bankers are still easy to spot, conspicuously reading UK newspaper The Financial Times or dressing in a uniform business casual look. ""On the tube this morning I thought it was ridiculous because all these bankers couldn't have looked more like bankers trying to dress down,"" Feldman told CNN. Instead of jackets, ties and Oxford shoes, polo shirts, khakis and loafers now fill the streets around the City and much of central London. ""I saw two bankers wearing matching baby blue sweaters, tight jeans and Church's -- ridiculous,"" Feldman added, referring to the up-scale brand of traditional English shoes. One Web site that covers news and gossip in the City has been tracking the banker backlash to the warnings. ""It's a mixture: people are falling into two types. The banks and the funds are certainly encouraging the staff to wear casual dress, but some are determined they won't cower to protestors and are still showing up in suits,"" said Vic Daniels, publisher of HereistheCity.com. On Monday, Bloomberg quoted one City professional, Graham Williams, 66, who said: ""We're not pansies ... most of us have played rugby or boxed. ""If any of those guys do get violent against us individually because we are wearing a suit, we will take action."" The site also offers humorous advice for bankers to respond to protestors by dumping ""large blocks of ice"" to ""render them harmless,"" and encouraging bankers to ""find your inner G20 [sic] spot."" Despite the jokes, precautions proved valuable Wednesday as thousands of angry anti-capitalist protestors converged on the City for demonstrations to coincide with the G-20 summit. By midday protestors had started smashing windows at a branch The Royal Bank of Scotland. Earlier in the day 11 people were arrested after being stopped in an armored personnel carrier. Thousands of police are continuing to patrol the streets in anti-riot gear.","Fearing protesters bankers dressed down for work in London today .

"(CNN) -- CNN is among a handful of news outlets partnering with Facebook on a feature that will help share data about what users are talking about on the social network. On Monday, the site rolled out two new tools. The first, Public Feed API, lets users display a real-time feed of public posts that contain a certain word. So, for example, it could be used to show how quickly new references to ""Syria"" were appearing on Facebook during coverage of the conflict there. The other, Keyword Insights API, breaks down the number of posts that mention a term during a given time frame. So, in the previous example, it could show how many people had posted to Facebook about Syria in the past day, week or month. Keyword Insights also lets users display anonymous results by gender, age and location. So, for example, it might show that 65% of chatter about Syria is coming from men, or that people talking about Miley Cyrus are overwhelmingly under age 34. ""We are committed to building features that improve the experience of discovering and participating in conversations about things happening in the world right now, including entertainment, sports, politics and news,"" Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice president for media partnerships and online operations, wrote in a blog post. The first wave of media partners is CNN, Buzzfeed, NBC's Today Show, BSkyB, Slate. and Mass Relevance. Facebook says it has begun discussions with other media partners and marketing developers and will make the tools available to more partners in the coming weeks. The partners are able to begin using the tools starting Monday. In his post, Osofsky noted that, with more than 1 billion accounts, Facebook is a useful way to gauge how widely topics are resonating. ""If there is something interesting going on, people are talking about it on Facebook,"" he wrote. ""From favorite television shows to sporting events to the latest news; the conversations are happening on Facebook. Last week's kick-off of the NFL season garnered over 20 million likes, comments, and shares on Facebook by over 8 million people.""","Facebook rolls out tool to help media outlets crunch its data .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved the nation's parliament Monday and called for new elections. But the move did little to appease anti-government protesters who remained on the streets by the thousands. Between 100,000 and 150,000 demonstrators rallied in Bangkok, with protest leaders saying their goal Monday is to storm Shinawatra's office, known as Government House. The country will hold new elections by February 2, but embattled Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra may not be her party's choice to run, a government spokesman told CNN on Monday. ""I don't know whether the Pheu Thai Party will still vote (for) her to run again or not,"" said spokesman Teerat Ratanasevi, referring to the ruling party. Yingluck's move Monday comes a day after Thailand's main opposition party, Democrat Party, said its roughly 150 members would resign en masse from parliament because they could no longer work with the government. ""I don't want our country and the Thai people to suffer from more losses,"" Yingluck said in a televised address. But opposition party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva said the massive protests leave the government little choice. ""I think the best way for the Prime Minister to show responsibility is by returning power to the people,"" he told CNN. Still, dissolving parliament and calling elections appear unlikely to placate protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the Democrat Party. He has called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" Q&A: What's behind the protests in Thailand? Thaksin's influence . During the weeks of demonstrations, protesters have occupied various government offices. The rallies have been mostly peaceful, but clashes between protesters and government supporters on November 30 left five people dead. Protesters and police, who had confronted each other with tear gas and rocks in parts of Bangkok last week, agreed to a truce Tuesday in a show of respect for Thailand's revered king, who celebrated his 86th birthday Thursday. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where parties affiliated with Thaksin, who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland, have won every election since 2001. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse Yingluck of being nothing more than Thaksin's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied.

"(CNN) -- A New Zealand gas station owner turned international fugitive has been sentenced to four years and seven months in prison after stealing millions of dollars accidentally deposited into his bank account. Hui ""Leo"" Gao, dubbed the ""accidental millionaire,"" sparked a global manhunt after fleeing New Zealand with his girlfriend Kara Hurring in April 2009. Hurring was sentenced to nine months' home detention for her part in the heist, according to CNN affiliate TV NZ. The 33-year-old was also ordered to pay back $9,615 (NZ$11,830) at the rate of $60 (NZ$75) a week, the broadcaster said. Gao's journey from the forecourt to fugitive began in April 2009 when Australian bank Westpac accidentally gave him access to $7 million (NZ$10 million). Gao had applied for overdraft financing for the gas station he co-owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand, court documents said. The bank approved his application with a $100,000 limit, however while inputting the figure a bank employee made a clerical error and gave him access to 100 times the intended amount. Gao discovered the error the next day and told his girlfriend, Kara Hurring that he was ""fâ€”ing rich"" and had millions of dollars, court documents said. In less than one month, the couple withdrew $6.8M from Gao's bank account and transferred it to accounts in Hong Kong and China. In late April 2009, Gao fled to Hong Kong where he was joined a few days later by Hurring. Before leaving New Zealand, the couple had been living together in Rotorua with Hurring's six-year-old daughter, court documents showed. In early May, the bank became aware of the error and alerted authorities who issued an Interpol alert for the missing couple. Hurring spent almost two years on the run before returning to New Zealand in February 2011 to renew her daughter's passport, TV NZ reported. In May, she was found guilty of 28 counts of theft and two counts of money laundering, according to court records. Gao was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011 and extradited to New Zealand two months later.  In June, he pleaded guilty to seven charges of theft. Westpac, the Australian bank, recovered about $2.9M from the couple's New Zealand accounts, but has yet to recoup the remaining $3.8M. Crown Prosecutor Fletcher Pilditch told the court the bank was continuing to dedicate considerable resource to recovering the stolen money, TV NZ said.","New Zealand's 'accidental millionaire' jailed for bank account theft .

"London (CNN) -- British police have arrested a couple on suspicion of holding three ""extremely traumatized"" women captive for more than 30 years, Scotland Yard announced Thursday. One of the women -- a 30-year-old Briton -- ""appears to have been in servitude for her entire life,"" Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland said. She and the other two women, a 57-year-old from Ireland and a 69-year-old from Malaysia, have been taken to a place of safety and are being cared for by a charity, police said. The man and woman arrested are both 67, police said. They were taken into custody at their home in the south London borough of Lambeth and were being held as part of an investigation into slavery and domestic servitude, police said. Their names were not released, and police said only that they are not British nationals. They were later released on bail. Hyland said it was an unprecedented case for the Met's Human Trafficking Unit. ""We've seen some cases where people have been held for up to 10 years, but we've never seen anything of this magnitude before,"" he said. Police said they'd been alerted in October to the situation by Freedom Charity, which got a phone call from a woman saying ""she had been held against her will in a house in London for more than 30 years."" Freedom Charity spokeswoman Aneeta Prem said the organization had taken ""immediate action"" to plan a rescue after learning of the women's situation. ""Facilitating their escape was achieved using utmost sensitivity and secrecy and with the safety of the women as our primary concern,"" she said, describing the work of those involved as ""outstanding."" A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity prompted one of the victims to call for help. CNN's Max Foster said police had told him that the women had been released in October after sensitive negotiations by the charity. The charity had worked to gain their trust and coax them out of the house, communicating through prearranged phone calls. ""Over time they built up that trust, the police gathered outside the house and then they had the confidence to leave the house,"" Foster said. ""It seems to have taken place in a suburban area of south London, in an ordinary street."" News of the couple's arrest first spread on Twitter. I'm a modern-day slave in America . Hyland praised the actions of Freedom Charity and said police were working with the organization to support the victims. ""They are extremely traumatized, which explains the discrepancy between when the Freedom Charity were contacted and the arrests were made,"" he said. ""It would be wrong of us to move at a pace that would further traumatize any victims."" The women had ""some controlled freedom"" during their captivity, Hyland said. Investigators have seen no evidence of sexual abuse, he said. ""We're very early in the investigation. We're not investigating offenses of a sexual nature. There haven't been any arrests of a sexual nature, so that's the circumstances at the moment."" Slavery's last stronghold . UK Special Envoy for Human Trafficking Anthony Steen told CNN he was not surprised by the case as there were likely to be many cases of domestic slavery in the country. ""We don't know the number but we know it's pretty huge. Domestics are hidden away,"" he said. ""The difference between slavery when it was manifest in America -- as it was in England -- was that you could see it everywhere,"" Steen said. ""Since then having abolished it, it's grown, it's got bigger and bigger -- in fact they say it's between 10 and 20 times the size it was in the 1800s."" Steen said the largest number of people involved in slavery in Britain were in brothels, and that group was followed by men held against their will in debt bondage. Freedom Project: Ending slavery . CNN's Max Foster in London contributed to this report.","NEW: The accused man and woman, both 67, are released on bail .

"(CNN) -- The power of any pastor over his or her parishioners is derived from their ""calling"" to minister the Gospel from God, or as some call it, the anointing by the Holy Spirit. But the role of a pastor -- the Bible speaks to being a shepherd of a flock -- also comes from the belief that it is their moral standing as the earthly representative of God to lead their congregations spiritually. If you read the writings of Paul in 1 Timothy 3 (New International Version), he offers the following instructions: ""Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, he desires a noble task. Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church)...He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap."" As we witness the salacious and troubling sex allegations leveled this week against Atlanta megachurch pastor Bishop Eddie L. Long, it is clear that many are confused to hear four young men come forward and allege that the man of the cloth, the husband and father, sexually coerced them and used the power of his prophetic position to engage in sex with them. It is even more shocking considering Long has preached with conviction against homosexuality and gay marriage. The details outlined in three lawsuits -- a fourth man stepped forward on Friday -- have rocked the Christian community. Bishop Long isn't just a preacher with a storefront church. He oversees a massive 240-acre complex in Lithonia, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta, a congregation of 25,000 members, schools, and an international ministry that is seen on TBN, Daystar, The Word Network and online. He is widely respected as a strong man of God who ministers annually to fellow pastors, men, youth and a mega women's conference. His influence is tremendous and far reaching, even in the areas of education and politics in Georgia. With all that said, and I fully understand that he has vigorously denied the allegations, there is no doubt in my mind that for the sake of the church, Long and his family, he needs to remove himself from the pulpit as the leader of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in order for the issue to be resolved to its conclusion. In an interview with me on Thursday on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Long's attorney, Craig Gillen, said his client would speak for the first time on Sunday at 11 a.m. and address the issue before his congregation. While I disagree with waiting five days since the allegations were revealed -- if someone accused me of doing this and I know in my heart I didn't do it, I would be screaming from the top of Georgia's Stone Mountain -- Long first and foremost owes an explanation to his personal family, and then his church family. If he does indeed stand before the New Birth family, Long should be honest and forthright, not mince words or engage in double talk. And after whatever he says, he should take it upon himself to ""sit himself down."" In the Christian church, when a pastor is accused of wrongdoing, going through a divorce or violating the biblical call to be above ""reproach,"" the senior pastor orders them to be ""sat down."" That means they don't carry out their ministerial duties. The point is to protect the integrity of the Word of God, as well as to allow that pastor to get his or her affairs in order. As the leader of New Birth, there is no human authority above Long. But he has a heavenly father that he has to answer to, and he must not allow his personal travails to interfere with the good and expansive works of the church. Souls still need to be saved, people still need to be healed, the sick still must be cared for, and the naked clothed. Yet I also hope that when Long speaks, he does one of two things: If in his mind and heart he has done no wrong, he will launch a vigorous defense of his name and integrity and vow with every fiber in his body to fight the charges, even if that means spending every dime he has and not settle the lawsuits. But if he is guilty of what is alleged, I pray that Long doesn't stand before his church as its spiritual father and continue the charade of saying ""I didn't do it"" and tear into his accusers. God, Long and those young men know what took place, and as someone who has listened to many of his sermons and read his books, Long has often talked about the need for Christians, especially men, to be accountable for their actions and confess their sins. If guilty, and if he truly cares about his enormous flock, he will stand before them and admit to the error of his ways, and not put them through more pain and heartache. He is a charismatic pastor who has always been known to preach an uncompromising Word, unwilling to say what folks want to hear, but instead, what they need to hear. Bishop Long, your congregation and the world don't want to hear excuses. They don't want ambiguity. Your motto at New Birth for years has been ""Taking Authority."" This is the time for you to live that credo out before your flock, no matter what the outcome will be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Four lawsuits have been filed against Bishop Eddie Long .

"Baltimore (CNN) -- When Geremen Teklehaimanot came into the Baltimore Medical System office Thursday hoping to renew the same sliding-scale health policy that he had last year, he got more than he bargained for. The 34-year-old limo driver was met by not one health benefits expert but two. ""I'm going to sign you up for your sliding scale, and let me introduce you to someone else who will help,"" said Darlene Middleton-Lawson, the health benefits adviser at Baltimore Medical System. ""This is Jekisha Elliott. Jekisha is a navigator. She is going to talk to you about what else might be possible."" In August of this year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave out $67 million in Navigator Cooperative Agreements. The grants pay to train, support and certify advisers, also known as patient navigators, who work out in the field and on the phone. The navigators partner with local medical systems to help people figure out how the new Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces work. Obama offers funding to help communities understand Obamacare . Most people who will become newly insured through Obamacare have no experience buying health insurance. Navigators can't tell people what plan to pick, but they can walk people through what might work best based on their family circumstances and health. Based on his income, Teklehaimanot may qualify for a subsidized health plan through the new Obamacare marketplaces. ""That's wonderful,"" he said. ""Just wonderful. Let me show you something."" He took out his smartphone and showed Elliott his browser. It was stuck on the website for Maryland's health insurance marketplace. ""See, it says I'm almost in,"" he said. This week the sheer volume of interest overwhelmed the Maryland site. All across the country there were reports of long wait times at other state and federal sites. Teklehaimanot wasn't discouraged. He seemed excited about the possibility of buying his own policy, and Elliott is someone who can help. Elliott is the official navigator team leader for the nonprofit HealthCare Access Maryland. Maryland will get about 300 certified navigators who will be essential during open enrollment. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in March found that 67% of the uninsured under the age of 65 -- the people who could most benefit from Obamacare -- said they didn't understand how it could affect them. Middleton-Lawson met Elliott for the first time Thursday. Dressed head to toe in bright pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Middleton-Lawson literally did a small dance of joy when she learned a navigator was in the building. ""I'm so glad you are here,"" Middleton-Lawson said. ""People can't sign up fast enough for this, and they do need help."" ""Answer 'yes' to one of these,"" Elliott told Teklehaimanot as he filled out forms. Elliott's calm demeanor and reassuring tone visibly seemed to put Teklehaimanot at ease. Elliott used to be a teacher. She misses her special needs students, but finds this navigator work fulfilling. ""It's helping people who are willing to learn, and it's helping people who are in dire need of health care,"" Elliott said. ""With this program it will definitely give them a peace of mind."" Obamacare's coverage gap: The poor caught in between . Here in Maryland, the state has fully embraced Obamacare. It opened its own marketplace and expanded Medicaid. About 13% of the population in Maryland doesn't have any kind of insurance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means nearly 750,000 people are probably not getting all the medical attention they need. About half that population is now eligible for Medicaid with the state's expansion. In addition to navigators like Elliott, HeathCare Access Maryland also set up a call center. It's staffed seven days a week with people who can take calls in 200 different languages. Elliott says it's gotten a ton of calls this week. Only a few were angry (some people call not for help, but to vent about Obamacare). ""Mostly, the angry callers just want to be heard,"" Elliott says. ""So, we listen to those too."" Most of the questions the navigators get involve the cost. With subsidies, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates the majority of people should be able to find coverage for $100 or less a month. Even a bare-bones policy covers preventive care like immunizations, mental health, rehab and other services. Her navigator job, Elliott says, also has a side benefit. Her friends now call all the time. ""Even though they have jobs, some of them still don't have insurance,"" Elliott said. ""A lot of my friends are calling me and saying 'OK, where do I need to go? What do I need to do? Can I come to your house?' We are at a place in life where you have a job, but you can't afford to buy a health plan. I think this is going to be a really good thing because now it's going to be really affordable to people."" Toward the end of his visit, Teklehaimanot's smartphone still hadn't connected with the Maryland marketplace. He hasn't signed up for a new plan yet, but he does have more information. He has until December 14 to sign up if he wants his family to have coverage starting January 1. For many, signing up for a new policy may take several conversations or several website visits. ""I know there's some general frustration right now with the online part,"" Elliott said. ""I'm confident though we'll work the kinks out, and regardless, I know they will be happy once they get all the benefits. It can be life-changing.""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- My son has a new video game, and I have a new problem. I want him to clean his room, and I tell him that he can do it when the game is over. My problem is that, as he informed me recently, this game is never over. It just keeps going on to new levels, with new challenges. It never ends. That reminds me of the immigration debate. In the vortex of New York and Washington, pundits and policy makers are once again dangling the possibility that Congress could pass immigration reform soon. Yeah. That won't happen. We've been hearing that immigration reform is around the corner at various times over the years, since George W. Bush kicked off this debate in September 2001 when he welcomed then-Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner and the leaders announced that their countries would seek an accord to match workers with employers. A dozen years later, we're still haggling over legalizing the undocumented -- and much more. But guess what? There is action on immigration in America, only it's not happening at the federal level. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie is expected to sign this week a bill that would allow undocumented immigrant college students to pay in-state tuition. In California, the state Supreme Court has cleared the way for Sergio Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who went to college and law school and took the bar exam, to receive a law license. In Colorado and Arizona, lawmakers have in recent years proposed the states create their own guest worker agreements with Mexico to ensure that employers have access to labor no matter what Congress does or doesn't do. These solutions concocted by the states aren't perfect. They have their problems. But at least they're an attempt to do something, and not wait around while Washington does nothing. In the East Coast corridor, most of the media doesn't really understand the immigration issue. For one thing, they treat it like just another issue, when it is arguably the most divisive issue that Americans have confronted since slavery. Besides, the media hates complexity, and so it tries to oversimplify the immigration issue as being solely about Republican obstinacy. If only the GOP would get on board, the narrative goes, we'd have immigration reform. What about the fact that many Democrats oppose granting legal status to the undocumented? How does that fit into the narrative? It doesn't help that elected officials and advocacy groups are generating fog, and that special interests are putting their own agendas ahead of the needs of those they claim to represent. I live in Southern California, and I spend a lot of time traveling thru the Southwest. In Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas or San Diego, immigration isn't just an election-year wedge issue but an everyday reality. It would be difficult in these places to find anyone who believes that Congress is poised to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year. Everyone knows that Congress is more likely to approve major legislation in odd-numbered years, because many members spend much of the even-numbered years either campaigning for re-election or avoiding doing anything risky that might jeopardize their re-election. Such as legalizing the undocumented. If you're a Republican representing a district in the Southwest or the South, risky could mean voting for legislation that legalizes the undocumented and puts you crossways with the nativist wing of your party. If you're a Democrat from the South or the ""Rust Belt"" states like Ohio or Michigan, risky might mean supporting a bill to legalize the undocumented and antagonizing rank-and-file union members who worry about having to compete with newly legalized immigrants for blue-collar jobs. So why bother keeping up the charade that immigration reform is just around the corner? Easy. In the words of Omar Little, the fictional gunman and stickup man in the HBO series, ""The Wire,"" it's because ""it's all in the game."" The immigration game is based on three principles: dishonesty, disconnect and divergent interests. The game is dishonest, because the participants advance one lie after another, from denying that resistance to immigrants has anything to do with racism to insisting that American workers would gladly do the worst jobs for the right salary to claiming that immigrants aren't assimilating and so on. There is a disconnect between those who argue about reform efforts and those directly impacted by them. U.S. citizens have the luxury of haggling over the details of an immigration reform package, because most of them won't be directly affected one way or another. And those most affected -- the undocumented -- aren't at the table. And there are divergent interests between people who think they're actually on the same side. Republicans have to watch out that they're not betrayed by fellow Republicans, Democrats by fellow Democrats. This issue splits parties and divides coalitions, so it's every special interest for itself. All this is happening on the federal level, and it's a mess. The game is designed to go on indefinitely, in part because politicians and advocacy groups won't let it end. Democrats want a wedge issue to use against Republicans, and they don't want to be known as the ""pro amnesty"" party. Advocacy groups need to keep funds rolling in by convincing supporters that the battle continues and the stakes have never been higher, so they can pay rent and salaries. Readers often ask me what I would propose by way of an immigration reform plan. I have one. It includes: improved roadways and better surveillance equipment for the Border Patrol, tougher employer sanctions, National Guard troops on the U.S.-Mexico border, a tamper-proof ID card, a pathway to earned legal status without including citizenship in the deal but allowing people to pursue it on their own, a 10-year ban on public benefits for legalized immigrants and their children, an increase in legal immigration, and other reforms. Yet we can't even get to that -- to my plan, or yours -- until we restore honesty, integrity and common sense to the debate. And that means ending a game that no one ever wins.

"(CNN) -- Monday is tax day, and in case you're wondering where your money went last year, President Barack Obama is eager to let you know. He's giving you a detailed receipt. For the third year, taxpayers can visit the White House website for the nitty-gritty on how the government spends tax dollars from American households. To see your 2012 contributions to the nation's military, Social Security, health care, community development, agriculture and NASA, among others, visit the site for the year's ""taxpayer receipt."" ""You deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent,"" White House spokeswoman Colleen Curtis said in a statement. Any politics involved? The annual public disclosure comes amid a tussle among the president, Democratic legislators and their Republican counterparts over 2014 budget proposals. Legislators from both parties have slammed each other's proposals, as well as that of the president. In his budget, Obama has taken the red pen to social spending items dear to liberal Democrats in his own base and handed bigger tax invoices to the wealthy and corporations, something Republicans have resisted. His proposed reductions on Social Security and Medicare spending have caused consternation among some of Obama's supporters, who argue it will leave vulnerable Americans without enough support. Meanwhile, Republicans have also protested the proposed revenue increases and the fact the budget doesn't balance. The $3.8 trillion proposal aims to cut deficits by $1.8 trillion over the next decade. What do we pay the most for? Spending on the military and health care programs take up the bulk of federal income tax revenues, according to the White House. A married couple with one child making $50,000 a year -- roughly the median household income in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- paid an average of $995 in federal income taxes in 2012, just 1.99%. This does not include Social Security and Medicare taxes. Nearly a quarter of income taxes, $245.17, went to a category labeled ""National Defense."" A slightly smaller sum, $223.38, or 22.45%, was spent on ""health care."" Ongoing military operations, such as the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, swallow the largest sum of defense spending, laying claim to more than 10% of taxpayer dollars, the White House said. Medicare and Medicaid, programs for the country's seniors and poor respectively, take up nearly all of the ""heath care"" spending category in the income tax breakdown. This does not include the separate Medicare Tax of $725, or 1.45%, levied on the family used as an example. But there is other combined military and social spending included in other parts of taxpayer receipt, such as an entry for ""Veterans Benefits"" and a separate one for military retirement and disability. The federal government spends comparatively little on education and the promotion of science and technology. Together, they all receive less than 5% of expenditures. This includes NASA's budget. A major exception is the development and construction of weapons technology, which weighs in at 7.62% of total federal expenditures. The biggest tax by far is the workers' contributions to Social Security, which weigh in at $2,100 for a family of three earning a median income of $50,000 per year. That's 4.2% of the family's gross income and is more than its federal income and Medicare taxes taken together. How big are taxes and deficits? Over the past 40 years, the federal budget deficit has amounted to 3.1% of gross domestic product per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That was well under the rate of inflation as measured by the labor department's consumer price index for half of those years. At 3.3%, deficits are predicted to be slightly higher over the next 10 years, as rising health care and retirement costs notch up federal spending, the budget office said. Budget deficits in the U.S. and much of the West surged with the onset of the world economic crisis in 2008, but began dropping in 2012, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. U.S. tax revenues -- including Social Security and Medicare -- have amounted to 18% of GDP over the past 40 years and are expected to rise slightly to 19% of annual GDP for the next 10 years, the budget office said. The rate of U.S. income taxes as a percentage of GDP is lower compared to most developed nations, according to the World Bank.","""You deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent,"" White House says .

"(CNN) -- There is nothing terribly surprising in Apple's refreshed line of tablets, but that's OK. We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference. As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past. iPad Air . There were no major new features, such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the iPhone 5S. The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air. The iPad line has been a bit wishy-washy with names. It began by counting each version, but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as ""iPad,"" like Cher. The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag (now $399) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet. Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor. It's 20% thinner than the third generation iPad, measuring in at a slight .29-inch. An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying flat on a tablet, hiding discretely behind a No. 2 pencil. It has also dropped a bit of weight and the Wi-Fi version is now exactly 1 pound (the cellular version is 1.05 pounds). Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first. Nothing makes a regular iPad feel hefty like holding an iPad Mini. You can't unfeel a Mini; it's just so delightfully wee. The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S. The A7 should benefit graphics heavy programs such as iMovie and iPhoto, and Phil Schiller claimed it would double the performance of the previous chip. It is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison. Fresh Apple products always feel zippier than previous generations. Part of that is the steadily improving processors inside, but its also the benefit of working on a new device that hasn't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps, hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade. iPad Mini with Retina Display . The iPad Mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago. Physically, the device is a dead ringer for the original. Fire it up, and you'll see that it addresses one of the biggest complaints about the first version by upgrading the screen to a 2048-by-1536 display that packs in 326 pixels per inch, a big jump from the previous 163 pixels per inch. A number of Apple products already have the Retina Display: the iPhone 4S and up, the fourth generation iPod Touch, the 10-inch iPad and some MacBook Pros. (Apple says Retina Display is so good that the human eye can't spot out individual pixels on the device). Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside. Previously the Mini was a generation behind its larger iPad sibling in processor speed. But this upgrade and the new display put the devices on the same level, so picking a smaller screen no longer means opting for the inferior product. The smaller tablet size is a competitive market, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display is finally Apple's premium offering for the 7.9-inch size. The $399 tablet is now in a better position to take on products such as Google's Nexus 7, Samsung's Galaxy tablets and Amazon's Kindle HDX. Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction. The missing upgrade . Shaving off excess bulk and swapping out faster processors is de rigueur for any product update these days. Other companies might throw in price drops, but Apple is comfortable in its spot at the high-end of the consumer market. It won't start slashing devices for its flagship devices. Instead, the company keeps older models available, though even those are priced somewhat high. Unfortunately, there is one key feature where all the tablet makers seem to have stalled: battery life. Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements. Both new iPads have the same M7 motion co-processor that handles sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, saving battery power by not using the main processor. Other than an hour here or there, mobile devices makers seem stuck at the half-day mark, a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted by carting around chargers and scrambling to re-up anytime they spot an empty outlet at a cafe, airport or friend's house. For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed, popular products, making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S. It may not be as much fun for tech fans who were used to splashy new products and well-kept secrets, but it's probably a solid business decision. According to Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps, replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide. Manufacturers need to compete to keep the customers they already have who are considering upgrading from an old model. All the tablet makers are competing with what are essentially the same minor tweaks. The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.","The new iPads from Apple don't hold a lot of surprises, but the regular improvements are solid .

"(CNN) -- Security screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport singled out Mexican and Dominican passengers for nearly two years, according to a federal report obtained by The Star-Ledger newspaper. The racial profiling was so prevalent in 2008 and 2009 that some TSA employees at the airport referred to their colleagues as ""Mexican hunters,"" a Star-Ledger story based on the 2010 internal report said. A TSA spokeswoman described the situation in Newark as ""isolated"" and said the agency took action to fix it. ""While the actions referenced in the report were based on intelligence reports regarding false documentation, criminal or illegal activity and the possible impact on transportation security, TSA's policies were overstepped,"" spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said. According to the Star-Ledger, the report said TSA agents stationed at the Newark airport would stop Mexicans and Dominicans, asking them additional questions, reviewing their passports and visas and searching their luggage. The report did not specify how many agents were involved, but ""leaves no doubt that the process was widespread,"" the newspaper said. ""The report said Mexican and Dominican passengers were singled out for scrutiny of their travel documents as an easy way to drive up the number of referrals by Newark's (behavior detection officer) unit so that it would appear productive,"" the newspaper said. Farbstein said the TSA does not permit racial profiling, and a manager accused of promoting profiling in the report is no longer in management with the agency. ""Eighteen months ago, TSA took immediate remedial action and retrained the entire behavior detection workforce at Newark,"" she said. Four managers in the report were cited to be disciplined by the TSA, the Star-Ledger said. One manager who was demoted after the investigation told the Star-Ledger that he denied the accusation and had appealed the demotion decision. Several officers quoted in the report said they were directed to use racial profiling, but others said they had never witnessed the practice or been told to use it, the newspaper said. The Transportation Security Administration said the newspaper did not obtain the report through the Freedom of Information Act and declined to provide a copy to CNN. A story published by the Star-Ledger Sunday said the newspaper had obtained the report, but did not disclose how. Ed Barocas, legal director of the American Civil Liberities Union in New Jersey, called the report ""alarming and astounding."" ""The possibility that TSA supervisors coached screeners to profile passengers based on race is deeply disturbing. ... We hope the TSA takes the proper steps immediately to ensure there is no racial profiling in our airports or that screeners are even given the perception that they should profile passengers based on race,"" he said in a statement. There are about 3,000 behavior detection officers at 161 airports in the United States, and plans to expand the program are in the works. In April CNN obtained a list of 70 indicators the officers use to identify people who might pose a threat to aviation. None of those indicators referred to or suggested race, ethnicity or religion. At the time, the TSA told CNN no single behavior on the list would, by itself, ever be enough to draw increased security scrutiny. An officer would only select a passenger for closer examination if they showed several signs of stress, fear or deception, the agency said. CNN's Ines Ferre, Mike Ahlers and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Star-Ledger: A federal report says some TSA officers were known as ""Mexican hunters""

"(CNN) -- Over the past two decades, Bishop Eddie Long has built his public ministry at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, Georgia, upon a testosterone-laden theology and a hypermasculine image. His books bear titles such as ""Taking Over,"" ""Called to Conquer"" and ""Gladiator.""  Typical names for his sermons are ""Conquer and Subdue"" and ""Reign or Maintain."" The ministry motto, ""Taking Authority,"" is signified by a golden sword and shield that adorns the bishop's ring finger. This is why I was saddened to watch Eddie Long duck and dodge allegations that he seduced multiple teenage boys into sexual relationships. One would think that someone who constantly preaches about male headship, rulership, and power would deny these allegations with the same bravado that he defends his right to drive a $300,000 automobile. Yet on Sunday we never heard the term ""innocent,"" or a refutation of the charges.  In fact, we witnessed a cowardly, rhetorical two-step that may mark the tragic end to this bishop's reign. Milquetoast quotes like ""I am not the man being portrayed on television,"" and ""I'm going to fight this,"" are at best nondenials.  Anyone familiar with these sorts of civil cases knows that such word selection is common among those trying to deflect a potential perjury charge down the line. Either Long engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with these young men or he didn't.  To hide behind legal counsel, biblical metaphors and spiritualized acknowledgments of one's imperfection insults the intelligence of those who respect him and his ministry. The question on the hearts and minds of parishioners is not whether he is a ""perfect man.""  Nor does this story have anything to do with David and Goliath, as Long so irresponsibly alluded.  The faithful just want to know whether Long used his authority (and their money) to maintain a teenage male harem under the pretense of mentoring.  Is this too much to ask? As a professor of social ethics who trains aspiring clergy, you pray religious leaders adhere to two important points.  First, although we all fall short of our professed moral ideals, one should never spiritualize indiscretions.  And no religious leader is fit to be called a leader unless he or she is willing to acknowledge when he or she is wrong. Second, we must draw a line between our position and the institution that we are called to serve.  The latter should always be considered more precious and important than the former. Eddie Long had four days leading up to Sunday morning to address these charges.  But aside from a brief yet legally broad statement through lawyers saying that ""the charges against me and New Birth are false,"" he did not counter the boys' allegations. He did choose, however, to invite the media and the world into the house of prayer on the Christian Sabbath.  By doing so, he appears to be the kind of pastor who puts his own protection and self-preservation before the community of faith.  And rather than courageously defending himself, he looked like a coward using New Birth's congregation as human shields. If the bishop wants to take authority, he needs to begin by taking some responsibility. Maybe for the good of New Birth, Eddie Long should take that sword out of his golden ring and fall on it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan L. Walton.","Jonathan Walton: Bishop Long never directly refuted allegations of seducing teen boys .

"(CNN) -- As New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fights back against the biggest political controversy of his career, he's under fire, as expected, from opportunistic attacks from the left. Begala: Three reasons bridge scandal will stick . Cupp: Christie apology hits all the right notes . But there are plenty within his own party who may also be pleased to see the tough-talking Republican governor get a bit of a comeuppance. The party's conservative base has never warmed to Christie. And he angered other Republicans with his 2012 Republican National Convention speech that was more about him than the party's nominee Mitt Romney. And some will never forgive him for his public embrace of President Barack Obama who was surveying damage in New Jersey from Superstorm Sandy just days before the presidential election. Archives: Christie, Obama set to meet again on Jersey Shore . Christie took the first steps Thursday toward rehabilitation -- apologizing profusely and announcing that he had fired two close aides connected the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge -- the nation's busiest -- to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, for not endorsing him in his re-election bid last year. The lane closings caused massive traffic jams in Fort Lee. Christie drops swagger amid heat of scandal . With scandal, Christie loses his top enforcer . Following Thursday's news conference, a top national tea party leader questioned whether Christie had put the controversy behind him. ""Governor Christie held some subordinates accountable. Time will tell whether this is enough,"" wrote Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder and national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. Judson Phillips, who heads the Tea Party Nation, went a step further. ""This incident is proof that once again the most dangerous place on the earth is the spot between Chris Christie and his presidential ambitions,"" Phillips told CNN. ""I strongly suspect there will be litigation as a result of this and the beauty of litigation is the truth will come out. I strongly suspect there is much more to this than what Chris Christie let on in his news conference."" Grassroots conservatives are skeptical of Christie because of his praise for Obama over the federal government's assistance to New Jersey for Sandy damage, and because of his criticism of some congressional Republicans over their initial reluctance to support federal relief aid to Garden State following Sandy. Christie has also angered conservatives with his willingness to work with Democrats on such issues as immigration reform, and his criticism of some on the right, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a tea party favorite who's a possible rival for the 2016 GOP nomination. Christie heralds NJ DREAM Act as message to Washington . Will Christie's immigration bill haunt him in 2016? Thursday, following the Christie news conference, Paul seemed to take a dig at Christie, saying, ""I don't know who e-mailed whom, who works for whom. I have been in traffic before and I know how angry I am, and I'm always wondering, who did this."" Erick Erickson, co-founder of RedState.com and leading voice on the right, wrote Wednesday in an article titled ""The Politics of A-Holes"" that ""There's more here and it is going to be the problem that haunts Chris Christie."" And Breitbart's Matthew Boyle, who's also influential among conservatives, tweeted Wednesday that ""Chris Christie is not a conservative. Don't delude yourself into thinking he is."" But the conservatives couldn't resist an opportunity to get in a dig at their real nemesis. ""The contrast between Barack Obama and Chris Christie in terms of owning a mess and fixing it is now pretty stark,"" tweeted Erickson. ""This could end being a positive for Christie though. People like accountability. They're not getting that with Obama,"" wrote Boyle on Twitter. Jenny Beth Martin made the same point in her statement, writing, ""We're still waiting for President Obama to hold anyone accountable."" Christie's re-election team actively sought out the endorsements of Democratic officials, such as Fort Lee's mayor, in its push to win a major gubernatorial victory as a prelude or launching pad to any 2016 White House bid. They succeeded, as Christie won in a landslide over little known state Sen. Barbara Buono. But the current controversy, born during that re-election drive, gives opponents an opportunity to spin Christie persona of a tough-talking politician into one of a political bully who's not above petty politics. ""This is the other side of the double-edged sword that is Chris Christie's heavy-handed persona and governing style. At one level there's an appeal about it, but underneath it you sense it could blow up,"" Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN. ""The boss sets the tone for those around him and beneath him. I don't think this is the last story we're going to see about problems with Christie's governing style, and even GOP establishment power brokers and money people will be concerned about how this plays in the 2016 primaries and caucuses -- where the GOP field will be more substantive than it was in 2012,"" added Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington public relations firm that has had many conservative and Republican clients. While there's concern, there doesn't seem to be a groundswell of conservative criticism right now. ""I do not believe there's going to be any retribution from conservatives over this,"" Jon Brabender, a Republican strategist and a longtime senior political adviser to former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum, a 2012 presidential candidate, told CNN. ""I haven't heard a single person tell me that the news is great because it's going to hurt Christie. I don't think there will be a piling on by conservatives."" Christie, who's now criss-crossing the country, campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is seen as prime target of Democrats, especially since three national polls, starting with a CNN/ORC International survey in November, showed Christie as the early frontrunner among possible 2016 Republican contenders. And national and state Democrats have been relentless the past two months in highlighting the George Washington Bridge controversy. But the bigger concern for Christie going forward is not Democrats, but opponents in his own party.","The GOP's conservative base has never warmed to Christie .

"(CNN) -- Germany has only produced two Formula One champions, but they are two of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known -- and they can thank one man for spotting their nascent talent. Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel have won 11 world titles between them, winning renown across the globe for their record-breaking feats. And the story of their success started in the small town of Kerpen, where Gerhard Noack is known as the man who finds champions at the local go-kart club. It was at this innocuous circuit, carved out of an old gravel pit, that Noack first spotted the potential of Germany's two giants of motorsport. But his involvement in karting happened almost by accident. ""I got to know the Schumacher family, the father and mother,"" Noack explained to CNN's The Circuit in a rare television interview. ""That's when I first really found out about kart sport. ""That way I also met Michael Schumacher, and I enjoyed it so much, us both being in motorsport, that I stuck with it."" Schumacher grew up in Kerpen, where he graduated from a homemade kart at the age of four to become the benchmark for F1. The 44-year-old, who began his F1 career in 1991, won a record seven world championships before retiring for a second time more than 20 years after his debut season. It is a little ironic that after being introduced to karting by the Schumacher family, Noack would go on to mentor the man who is already well on the road to usurping Schumacher's place in F1 history. Vettel -- dubbed ""Baby Schumi"" when he made his F1 debut seven years ago -- has already won four consecutive world titles with Red Bull and collected several of the old maestro's racing records in the process. All this at the age of just 26 -- no wonder Noack saw his potential as Schumacher's successor. ""Sebastian was not the first great talent after Michael,"" explained Noack, who also coached a generation of German F1 racers that included Ralf Schumacher, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Nick Heidfeld. ""There are many great race drivers that all came from this club but Sebastian was the first one where I felt a special connection. ""He's got something that Michael has too, a very special personality, great will and a lot of talent, and that led me to decide to look after him in that way. ""The first time I saw Sebastian was in 1996. He was a bambini driver and racing in Kerpen. ""We were watching a race particularly closely and it was in the rain. Some of the drivers had changed to rain tires, Sebastian continued to drive with slicks (dry weather tires). ""He was very dominant compared to the others even without rain tires, and that impressed me so much that I said I want to give it another go and see if I can manage this young driver to get into Formula One. ""After the long gap between Michael and Sebastian, I just decided to approach the Vettel family and try to support such a young driver."" Noack decided to temporarily rent out his business to help guide Vettel's career or, in his own words, ""smooth the way for him."" ""After all those years in motorsport I knew a few important people and, thank god, we were lucky to always find the right people at the right time to support Sebastian,"" the businessman explained. ""I myself was his mechanic, his coach, all those things that you need in karting. We went to the races together, we lived together, at the weekends at least, and the family was always there, too. ""I did everything that was needed also to sort out the financial background, to find the right people and the right sponsors, and luckily we always did."" Those connections helped him sign Vettel to Red Bull Racing's junior academy at the age of 13. After a stint as a reserve for the BMW Sauber team, the young racer began his first full season in F1 with Red Bull's junior Toro Rosso team in 2008. This year Vettel became one of just four men to win the F1 world title four times, and Noack predicts his former charge could one day surpass all Schumacher has achieved. ""I believe that Sebastian will certainly be able to get the seven titles,"" Noack said. ""But a lot depends on whether the team he's with at the time is competitive.. ""At the moment there really is no need to change the team. Red Bull are great, it's where the best people are, and he proves it at every race. ""At some point he might change the team. I think in the next few years there is no question about it."" Schumacher, who won his world titles with Benetton and Ferrari, recently conceded in an interview with his former Mercedes team that he is happy for Vettel to take over his mantle. ""If someone can break all these records then I prefer him to do it than somebody else,"" said Schumacher, who Vettel cited as his inspiration growing up. ""I did what I did in my time and he's doing it in his time -- I'm glad it is him in the end."" Schumacher bowed out of the F1 spotlight at the end of 2012 after a second career with the Silver Arrows, and revealed since his retirement that he too has been helping find the next generation of racing stars. ""I'm looking after young drivers in the go-kart area,"" explained Schumacher, who occasionally returns to Kerpen to drop in on his racing alma mater. Vettel is likely to be in the spotlight for many years to come, but he too stays in touch with his roots -- and the man who helped his talent grow. ""The last time we talked in person was at the Nurburgring (home of the German Grand Prix),"" revealed Noack. ""Since he won his fourth title we have only been able to speak on the phone. I hope we will have time again to go out for a meal or have time for a longer chat. ""We have very little time for each other, but that will improve in the winter months."" And does Noack see a changein the boy who has become Red Bull's all-conquering racer? ""He has grown up, that's the only thing that's changed about him,"" Noack reflected. ""Other than that he is, in my view at least, still the same Sebastian that he was when he was eight years old. I never notice that anything much has changed about him. ""He always worked hard, and above all, he has the will to persevere, always challenging his opponents, and ultimately winning. ""That's always been the case with him and you can still see that in him today. All that and he still remains down to earth."" The same could be said of Noack. He may have nurtured two racing superstars but he is content in Kerpen, running his karting business -- and keeping one eye on track for the next racing prodigy.","Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel were both nurtured by the same man .

"(CNN) -- Not surprisingly, the Munich Security Conference last weekend saw heated debates on Ukraine and its current political crisis. Yet while government and opposition representatives faced off with their well-known positions, the real news was an apparent change of minds among Western leaders. Thus, European Union Commissioner Stefan Fule stated that ""if we are serious about helping this part of Europe to transform, the association agreement is only the first step,"" admitting in effect that only the EU's ""most powerful instrument"", membership, will help in the long-term. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton added that Europe and the U.S. are ""developing a plan -- a Ukrainian Plan"", whose numbers ""won't be small"", to provide urgently needed short-term funding to Ukraine's battered economy. And U.S Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that ""nowhere is the fight for a democratic, European future more important today than in Ukraine"". Taken together, the three statements may signal a major shift in Western policy vis-a-vis Ukraine. This much-needed reset comes after months of inaction by both Europe and the U.S. When back in November, Ukrainians rose against their government's decision to abandon closer ties with the EU, senior European leaders were quick to arrive in Kiev to show their solidarity with the protesters. The enthusiastic response that met them at the EuroMaidan, however, faded quickly when European concerns remained lip-service. The U.S. acted even more half-heartedly when its Secretary of State avoided a possible visit to Kiev, sending a deputy instead to hand out buns to freezing democrats. Western indecision clearly played its role in aggravating the political crisis in Ukraine, as it emboldened the government of Victor Yanukovych while driving protesters to despair. As a result, the former essentially attempted to legalize dictatorial rule and, when this prompted further demonstrations, resorted to violence by riot police. The latter, in turn, have only become more resolved but find it increasingly hard to retain unity, moderation and non-violence. Within a few weeks, this has brought Ukraine to the brink of civil war, and any further escalation will have unforeseeable consequences not just for Ukraine but for the entire region and Europe itself. This must have finally dawned on Western leaders. Immediate truce . However, the measures indicated by Fule, Ashton and Kerry are neither enough nor even the most pressing ones. As a first step, Europe and the U.S. must make sure of an end to violence and demand an immediate truce among all conflicting parties. This suspension of open conflict must also involve restraint on part of the Kremlin, Yanukovych's main sponsor, who should be reminded that covert operations by Russian operatives or threats of a military intervention are as disruptive and unacceptable as Moscow's economic stranglehold on Ukraine. Secondly, a long-term monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which Ukraine and Russia, all EU countries and the U.S. are members, must be installed swiftly. The mandate of this mission should be the observation of the ceasefire, ongoing EuroMaidan protests, police actions and possible provocations, enquiries into recent violence, deaths and disappearances, and regular reporting on findings to the international community. Thirdly, the West should impress upon all sides involved that only a genuine national dialogue can pave the way for a political solution of the crisis. Such a roundtable must include President Yanukovych personally and key opposition figures, the leaders of the EuroMaidan and Ukraine's oligarchs, as well as representatives of churches, civil society, media and the country's diverse regions. The EU may volunteer a senior leader to facilitate this dialogue. In an accompanying measure, fourthly, the EU and the U.S. should prepare a credible set of sanctions against anyone that hinders the truce, international monitoring, or national dialogue. Any obstructions of this process, whether by government representatives, law enforcement officials, oligarchs, provocateurs or radical protesters, need to be systematically recorded and answered with visa bans, asset freezes, embargoes against businesses, and criminal persecution. Once these immediate steps have been taken, and hopefully prevented Ukraine from further sinking into civic strife, the West must provide Ukraine with a long-term perspective of development and assistance. Along with Commissioner Fule's recognition last weekend, the EU must give Ukraine a clear prospect of membership, dependent only on the country's commitment to democracy, rule of law, and market economy. 'Ukrainian Plan' In order for necessary reforms to start and succeed, the EU and the U.S. have to swiftly roll out a ""Ukrainian Plan"", as alluded to by Baroness Ashton. A comprehensive aid package must combine emergency funding to prevent an impending default of Ukraine, compensations for a likely economic retaliation by Russia, and assistance for broader market reforms. Both these ingredients have long been missing from Western offers to Ukraine, and it is partly for this reason that the country's government turned its back on Europe. By adding them now, the EU and U.S. would substantially improve their proposal. This should make it much easier for Ukraine's elites and society to agree on a democratic and European future for their country. Such a consensus would go a long way towards ending the current conflict. For this, however, Ukraine needs the West to act swiftly and decisively.

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands recalled its ambassador from Iran, it said Monday, after Iran executed a Dutch-Iranian woman in spite of Dutch efforts to intervene in her case. The Dutch Foreign Ministry feels Zahra Bahrami's remains were treated ""disrespectfully"" after she was hanged just over a week ago, a spokesman said. ""Her body was not returned to her family. Instead it was buried 400 kilometres from Tehran. Bahrami's family was informed at the very last minute,"" the spokesman said, declining to be named. The Netherlands is summoning the Iranian ambassador over the case, and will protest officially with the Iranian foreign ministry, the spokesman added. Iran hanged Bahrami in late January, saying she was a drug smuggler. The Netherlands called it a ""shocking act by a barbaric regime."" But the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran suggested the drug charges were only a pretext to execute her. The campaign said Bahrami was originally charged with security offenses in the wake of widespread protests against the government over a controversial presidential election in June 2009. Bahrami was accused of bringing cocaine into the country twice and selling it. Cocaine and opium were found during a search of her house, the semi-official Fars news agency reported January 29. Her sentence also included 70 lashes and a $1,400 fine, Fars reported. Fars added that during a search of her house, while she was charged with security crimes, 450 grams of cocaine and 420 grams of opium were discovered and, following further investigation, it was found that she had also distributed 150 grams of cocaine. Iran denied Bahrami access to Dutch consular assistance and would not let Dutch officials attend her trial because Tehran did not recognize her dual citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands said on January 5. CNN'S Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","The Netherlands recalls its ambassador after Iran hangs Zahra Bahrami .

"(CNN) -- Syria's embattled government will get at least 10 fighter jets from Russia -- and they want more, Russian state media reports -- moves that come amid rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the Middle East nation's bloody civil war. A source involved in Russia's defense complex told the official Itar-Tass news agency Friday that Russia will sell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government MiG-29 fighter jets to fulfill a ""contract ... concluded long ago."" A Syrian delegation in Moscow is pressing for even more jets, with MiG executive Sergei Korotkov telling Russia's state-run RIA Novosti's news that his company and these Syrian authorities are talking about the ""details and time frame of a possible contact."" Such discussions come on the heels of the European Union's decision to end its Syrian arms embargo. That move was seen as opening the door for European nations to help rebel fighters militarily, though it may give Russia more wiggle room to back its longtime ally, Assad. It's not clear how weapons, fighter jets and ammunition flowing into Syria will affect the fighting there, much less the heretofore unsuccessful attempts to forge a negotiated settlement. About 80,000 people have been killed since the start of hostilities more than two years ago, U.N. General Assembly President Vuk Jeremic said earlier this month. Another 1.5 million or more people have fled the country. In addition to the fighter jets, Russia reportedly sold six S-300 air defense systems to Syria under a 2010 contract. Asked Thursday about these and other arms sales, al-Assad said it is ""not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive."" Blast in Damascus neighborhood kills 8 . ""As far as Russia is concerned, the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis,"" he told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV, according to a transcript from Syria's official SANA news service. ""We have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years, and Russia is committed to honoring these contracts."" Moscow, however, has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying Syria with weapons that can be used against civilians. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described any transfer of S-300s to the region as ""not helpful."" ""Whether it's an old contract or not, it has a profoundly negative impact on the balance of interests and the stability of the region, and it does put Israel at risk,"" he said. Kerry added that halting the bloodshed peacefully should be everyone's first priority. ""The best chance to save Syria (and) for a future Syria that represents all Syrian people and moves beyond this massacre, devastation, killing, sectarian violence ... is through a peaceful resolution that comes about in an organized way,"" he said Friday at a joint news conference in Washington with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. ""In Geneva, we will test who is serious. Are the Russians serious pushing to that? I believe they are. (But) it is not helpful to have a lot of other ammunition, other supplies overtly going in."" Syrian arms embargo: Why more weapons to Syria is a mistake . Conference on crisis planned for Switzerland . He was referring to an international conference on the crisis slated for Switzerland. The plans are being worked out, but al-Assad predicted it will take place in June. ""We have announced a couple of days ago that we agree in principle to attend,"" he said. But the Syrian leader made clear that his position may change, and Damascus' delegation may withdraw, if certain conditions are imposed. ""So the idea of the conference, of a meeting, in principle is a good one,"" he told Al-Manar TV. ""We will have to wait and see."" The National Coalition, the main rebel umbrella group, has demanded al-Assad step aside in order for it to take part in the talks, which were originally scheduled for this month. ""It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces,"" George Sabra, acting chairman of the National Coalition, said in a statement. He cited the siege of Qusayr and attacks on Eastern Gouta, a suburb of Damascus, as well as what he said was an ""invasion"" by Iranian militia members in support of al-Assad. Al-Assad said it's too early to discuss whether or not he'll run again for president in the 2014 election. He'd do so if ""there is a need and public desire"" for him to stay on, but won't ""if I feel that the Syrian people do not want me to lead them."" The Syrian president his only condition is that anything agreed to address the crisis should not be binding until Syrians approve it through a popular referendum. ""Either side can propose anything, but nothing can be implemented without the approval of the Syrian people. And as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people, we have nothing to fear,"" the Syrian leader said. 'Open-ended' Syrian conflict draws in region . Opposition group: 50 prisoners executed . All the deals and the talk have done little to change the situation on the ground in Syria. The killing continued Friday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees reporting 189 deaths, including six women, five children and 19 who died after being tortured. There were 74 people killed in Aleppo province, including 50 prisoners who the group said were executed by government forces in Aleppo's Central Prison, the group said. In addition, Syrian state-run television have reported that forces loyal to al-Assad killed three Westerners -- an American woman, a Briton and a person whose nationality was not revealed. The news outlet said Thursday the three had been fighting alongside the rebels and were found with weapons. The report said they were ambushed in their car in the flashpoint province of Idlib in northwestern Syria, where government forces have been battling rebels for control. TV video showed a bullet-riddled car and three bodies laid out on the ground. It also showed weapons, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. The United States is aware of the report of the reported killing of the American and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. Citing privacy concerns, the official said, ""We are unable to comment further."" Pictures circulating on the Internet show the body of Nicole Lynn Mansfield, 33, of Flint, Michigan, her father and daughter told CNN on Friday. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that a British national was among the dead. ""Their family has been informed and we are providing consular assistance,"" it said. Kerry, the top U.S. diplomat, said that some 1,500 to 2,000 American fighters may be in Syria. ""It's hard to get a peg on the exact number,"" he said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Federal authorities have charged a trendy Santa Monica sushi restaurant with serving whale meat -- an investigation that was spurred by the team behind the Oscar-winning documentary, ""The Cove."" Prosecutors charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of The Hump, and one of its chefs -- Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose. While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States. The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. Lawyers for Typhoon could not be reached for comment. But the restaurant told the Los Angeles Times it accepts responsibility and will pay a fine. The investigation began in October when two members of the team that made ""The Cove"" visited The Hump, officials said. ""The Cove,"" which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary on Sunday. The restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for ""a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced."" Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as ""whale"" and ""horse"" with the cost -- $85 -- written next to them. The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said. The sei is found throughout the world's oceans. Whalers began to hunt them after the population of blue and in whales declined due to overfishing. It is now considered an endangered species. In February and March, the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat, the criminal complaint said. A DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale, Mrozek said. During the last visit in March, officials with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for ""kujira"" or whale meat. One of the officers then saw the sushi chef leave the restaurant and return with a wrapped package that he seemed to have retrieved from a parked Mercedes, the complaint said. The chef then told a customer it was whale meat, the document said. The next, officials raided the restaurant and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat, the complaint said. ""Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species,"" said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. Authorities do not yet know where the meat came from. Conservation agencies are engaged in an ongoing feud with Japan over whaling. In the early 1980s, the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting. Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year. Many in the international community believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter. Critics say that Japan's research is actually a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.","Eatery charged with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for unauthorized use .

"London (CNN) -- For thousands of Iraqi women and girls, the conflict that began in 2003 was only the start of their ordeals. In the chaos of war and the confusion, lawlessness and poverty that followed, an untold number have become victims of sexual traffickers, some within Iraq and others sold over the borders. But the problem of trafficking has gone almost unreported, kept in the shadows by a combination of corruption, religious and cultural taboo and lack of interest by the region's authorities in tackling it, researchers say. A report released by the London-based non-governmental group Social Change for Education in the Middle East (SCEME) Wednesday hopes to change that. Entitled Karamatuna, or Our Dignity, the study highlights the plight of girls as young as 10 or 12 who have been trafficked from post-war Iraq into countries including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for sexual exploitation. Other victims trafficked within Iraq end up in nightclubs or brothels, often in Baghdad, the report says. Some of those brothels ""have been established purely to meet the demand created by United States service personnel,"" it adds. Launching the report, Iman Abou-Atta, a clinical researcher who put her career on hold a year ago in order to produce the study, told a hearing at the House of Lords in London that she had felt compelled to investigate after realizing the extent of the silence around the issue. ""What I came across was closed doors, shame, the unwillingness of authorities of Syria and Jordan and the quietness of civil society on the issue,"" she writes in the foreword to the study. Abou-Atta also encountered resistance when she raised the issue with the British and U.S. authorities whose forces' presence in Iraq has been a contributing factor to the problem, she says. While sexual exploitation existed in Iraq, as anywhere, long before the war began in 2003, ""the invasion and instability that followed led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking,"" she told the hearing. One Iraqi non-governmental organization, the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq, estimates that about 4,000 women, one fifth of them aged under 18, disappeared in the first seven years after the war. Although hard data is hard to come by, the group's research suggests many were trafficked by criminal gangs nationally or internationally, or sold into forced marriage by their own families. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were displaced or made refugees by the war. Prevented from working legally, some men have forced female relatives into prostitution to earn money for the family. Others have taken advantage of others' hardship. One case cited by the study is that of 17-year-old Amira, whose impoverished father accepted a man's offer to hire her for $200 a month to care for his handicapped wife. As well as housework, she was forced to have sex with the man's son and friends. Professional trafficking gangs also target young women after they flee home to escape forced marriage, abuse or violence, the report says. In a finding that may surprise some people, many of the traffickers within Iraq are women, the study says. While some of those have themselves been victims of sexual exploitation, Abou-Atta says, others are in it for the easy money. Other traffickers are taxi drivers who lure girls with false offers of help and then take them to brothels, or young men recruited by gangs who trick vulnerable young girls into eloping and then sell them into sexual servitude. Some young victims are tricked into thinking a marriage proposal is genuine, Abou-Atta said -- and then after being sexually exploited are swiftly divorced and dumped in the streets, all honor gone in the eyes of conservative Arab society. They are then easy targets for further abuse. Once in the hands of the traffickers, the victims face a grim future. One girl, identified as Shada, was left by her father at the Syrian border, the study says. She was trafficked to Damascus, where she was raped by five men and sold to a woman who forced her to work as a prostitute in nightclubs. Many women forced into the sex trade then feel trapped, unable to leave because of threats to their family and a lack of any future in a conservative, predominantly Muslim society that tends to see them as to blame for their ""shame."" Abou-Atta, who spoke to some victims of sex trafficking in Lebanon, said the women painted a dismal picture. ""In the beginning it's a nightmare,"" she said. ""Then they realize there's no choice, they cannot run away."" One woman recounted how when those who had trafficked her learned she planned to flee, they threatened to destroy the life of her daughter by making her shame public -- so she opted to stay, Abou-Atta said. ""It comes to the price of their lives, the price of their families,"" she said. Another cruel practice, particularly in Syria, is the ""mut'a"" marriage, in which a girl is married off for a price to a man on a Friday, only for him to divorce her on the Sunday. ""Research suggests that the rates at which these mut'a marriages are carried out intensifies in the summer when male tourists visit Syria from the Gulf,"" the study says. ""Although this particular kind of marriage is not explicitly called prostitution, it is in effect sexual exploitation, often forced, as a means of either securing livelihood, or generating profit."" While anti-trafficking and prostitution laws exist in many countries in the region, the will to enforce them appears weak -- and they fail to offer much protection for the victims. In a move in the right direction, Syria strengthened its anti-trafficking laws last year, the study says, and toughened the penalties against men involved in trafficking. However, women who have been forced into prostitution continue to face sanctions too. Syria also deports Iraqi refugees found illegally working in the country -- including women forced into the sex trade. Meanwhile, provision of shelters, health care or psychological support for the stigmatized victims of sexual exploitation, who have little other chance of employment, is almost non-existent across the region, Abou-Atta said. She sees improved education and increased awareness as key factors in protecting future generations of women and girls. She also hopes to carry out more field research, to bolster what little hard evidence is available on an issue shrouded in secrecy. The group's efforts were hampered over the past year by the Arab Spring uprising, which made access to many places difficult or dangerous. Houzan Mahmoud, of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq, which published its own report on prostitution in Iraq last year, told the hearing the Iraqi government had opposed her group's work and tried to block its access to the media. She urged Western governments to do more to put pressure on their Arab counterparts to tackle sexual exploitation, and to ensure they do not send vulnerable asylum seekers back to a situation where they may be trafficked again. Religious leaders should play a role by using their influence to change attitudes within society rather than demonizing women who are sexually exploited, she added. Change won't be easy though. At the heart of the issue are the men who are happy to hand over money for sex -- and the corrupt officials at borders and elsewhere who turn a blind eye to what's happening to vulnerable women. ""The problem is there's a demand for this, there's a market for this,"" said Mahmoud. ""This is about money-making and profits.""","Study: Years of conflict have made Iraqi women vulnerable to sex trafficking .

"(CNN) -- A SpaceX rocket with a 7,000-pound communications satellite on top lifted off from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday evening after two earlier launch dates were scrubbed. The Falcon 9 booster thundered into the skies over Florida at 5:41 p.m. in the private space contractor's first attempt to put a satellite into a stationary orbit around Earth -- a flight the company has called its ""most challenging mission to date."" The SES-8 satellite will relay signals to and from the South Asia and Asia Pacific regions from 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. Its first planned launch on November 25 was scrubbed when controllers received questionable readings from the liquid oxygen system in the first stage; the second, on November 28, was called off after finding oxygen in the engine igniter fluid, the company said.

"Shahe, Yunnan (CNN) -- ""Stand to attention,"" barked the class monitor as we walked into the classroom at the Shahe Primary School, an hour's drive from the county seat of Tengchong, a remote region in China's Yunnan Province. On cue, the 30 or so second-grade pupils stood up and greeted us with wide grins and smiling eyes. I had joined a group of leading educators and volunteers from the Teach For All global network, which places volunteer teachers in disadvantaged schools in 32 different countries. They had gathered in Tengchong for their annual conference. We took a side trip to observe in one of the elementary schools that served Shahe's 3,800 villagers and sat in on a mathematics class. To kick off the morning session, the female teacher asked volunteers to step forward and pretend to be ""passengers"" in a bus. Several pupils ""boarded"", a few got off, and a few more got on as the class shouted a running count of the ""passengers."" The teacher spent the rest of the 40-minute class teaching the basics of addition and subtraction, frequently leading the pupils in reciting drills. Through the session, pupils sat still, listened attentively and answered questions often in unison. Initially, I was put off by what seemed like rehearsed recitation and learning by rote. ""Old habits,"" a local teacher said. But later, I understood why. ""It has something to do with collective culture in China,"" said Susan Wang, a graduate of Zhejiang Normal University, who had taught in public schools. ""We ...believe in the importance of reciting repetitively. When a book is read a hundred times, a Chinese idiom goes, its meaning becomes naturally clear. ""That's why from childhood we are taught to recite poetry -- you can at least recite, if not write, poetry. ""For subjects like math, it's helpful because it's about remembering pithy formulas. Teachers even make up doggerels (rhymes) to help memorize them."" For me, my experience in the Shahe classroom illustrates the pros and cons of China's education system. ""Chinese schools excel in knowledge-based teaching,"" said Junheng Li, author of ""Tiger Woman on Wall Street."" ""For subjects like math and grammar, this is very important, especially in a child's early years of schooling."" Li, who attended public schools while growing up in Shanghai, said this intense focus on academics ""cultivates strong discipline, work ethics and stamina."" The Shahe pupils impressed me and fellow observers as disciplined and well-behaved. When I took out my camera, they gladly posed and flashed V signs. Many gathered around me to look at their digital photos. Their eyes sparkled with curiosity. They exuded pent-up energy and hunger for knowledge. ""Except for the migrants, our kids are not as hungry,"" noted an educator for Teach for Austria. ""Here one billion people are hungry, trying to reach the top."" But this traditional teaching method has its downside. It emphasizes lectures and learning by rote, instead of more give-and-take in the classroom. As in many Chinese schools, it's mostly about tests and exams. ""Education was a series of hoops to jump through, not a process of self-improvement or self- discovery,"" said Li, the author. The ""gaokao"" system -- the annual nationwide college entrance and virtually the sole determinant whether a student goes to college -- has largely contributed to this blind cut-throat competition that involves students, parents and teachers. ""For years leading up to gaokao, Chinese kids are tested and ranked on a narrow set of subjects, leading to incessant and often bitter competition,"" Li explained. ""This has engendered a society bent on self-promotion."" In some cases, experts said, that has led to cases of bribery and cheating during the exams. While Chinese students may be strong in basic education and passing exams, they are weak in creativity and innovation. Because the system is geared towards getting high scores in exams, students with special talents are often lost as ""under-achievers."" Many educators now acknowledge the system no longer suits the next stage of China's growth. They consider overhaul of the education system to be critical to China's economic growth and to achieving its goal of competing with the U.S. and other advanced countries in science, technology and innovation. Educational reforms still have a long way to go, but some changes are underway. To relieve students of heavy load, the Ministry of Education last August issued a 10-point decree, stipulating fewer exams, no written homework, no teaching during spare time or holidays and a compulsory hour of physical exercise daily. A long-term blueprint for reform seeks to change the thrust of education by putting a premium on integrating ""learning with thinking"", ""learning with practice"" and ""teaching children according to their aptitude."" These goals require a change in mindset. ""The knowledge economy does not pay for what you know but for what you can do with what you know,"" said Andreas Schleicher, OECD special advisor on education policy. They also require massive investment in resources. For years, China spent only around 2% of gross domestic product on education, compared with the minimum 6% recommended by the United Nations. Since 1993, I have heard Chinese leaders pledge to raise it to 4% of GDP. It was only last year when they finally lived up to that promise.","Pupils at remote rural Chinese elementary school are enthusiastic and hungry to learn .
Rote learning still plays part in China's education system .
Chinese students strong in basic education but weaker in creativity .
Educational reforms still have a long way to go, but some changes are underway."
"(CNN) -- After a contentious year, an embattled President Barack Obama and an unpopular Republican Party are each hoping for better things in 2014. Both parties leave Washington with many big issues unresolved and many battles ahead. It's time to consider what some of the big stories of 2014 may be. Will immigration reform fly? Millions of immigrants are desperately waiting to see whether they will be able to obtain legal status in this country. Immigration reform has stalled in the House after a sweeping bill finally passed in the Senate with bipartisan support. Initially listening to the warnings of tea party Republicans, Speaker of the House John Boehner didn't move on the bill. At most, he argued that he would push for smaller versions of the bill that dealt with issues like border security. But as 2013 came to a close, the mood seemed to change on Capitol Hill. The speaker spoke some tough words that suggested he might take a different direction in 2014. His decision to hire Rebecca Tallent, who had worked on immigration reform in 2006 and 2007 while on the staff of Sen. John McCain, also sent a strong message to conservative groups. Passing immigration reform would be hugely consequential for millions of potential American citizens. And legislation could have big ramifications on the electoral map. Without a bill, Republicans will never win over Latino voters, a massive portion of the current and future electorate that is currently trending Democratic. If Republicans shifted course and took this issue off the table, they could be much more competitive in key states of the Electoral College. Will Democrats lose control of the Senate? This will be the marquee political event of the year. Over the past few months there has ongoing speculation about whether this will be a ""wave"" election that shows a voter mandate about the direction of politics. Initially, during the height of the 2013 budget battles, some experts thought that Democrats were going to seize the momentum from Republicans, who were plummeting in the polls, to regain control of the House and work with the White House to pass Obama's second-term agenda. A recent wave of retirements has also given Democrats some hope they could pick up new seats. However, since the fiasco surrounding the introduction of the Obamacare website, the tide seemed to shift back toward Republicans. There are three questions surrounding the election. First, will majority power shift in either chamber? Second, even if control remains the same, will the election alter the vote count in the House and Senate in a way that makes conditions slightly easier for either party to move legislation? Finally, how will the parties spin the results, as they seek to create the perception that the election has bigger implications for one party or the other? A rare chance to reform the NSA? Changing the way that our national security institutions work has proven to be a near impossibility. As President Dwight Eisenhower said in his farewell address in 1959, the military-industrial complex, with all the vested interests that line up behind existing military programs, makes it difficult to effect major change. But, in the wake of the Edward Snowden story, this year is different and a window for reform might have emerged. The revelations that flowed from the multiple leaks about the National Security Agency surveillance programs have been extraordinarily damaging. The biggest blow has come from international allies who are furious that their leaders and citizens were under surveillance. Many of the President's most ardent supporters have expressed deep disappointment with the commander-in-chief and are insisting on new regulations. A federal judge struck a huge blow to the NSA by deeming much of the collection of meta-data unconstitutional, while the fallout among international allies from the news that their leaders were being monitored has threatened key relations. An advisory panel to Obama has recommended sweeping reforms that would create stronger safeguards on what the NSA can do. Obama ended the year strongly suggesting that he will support the reforms. Most likely, the window for reform will close quickly as new threats to the U.S. emerge. This would be the year Congress and the president could potentially restore some balance between the imperatives of national security and of civil liberties. Who will win the Republican civil war? Perhaps the biggest battle that Republicans face is among themselves. As the year ended, the internal party conflict intensified when Boehner spoke out against the tea party Republicans who had caused him so much trouble over the course of the year. Right-wing organizations, the speaker said, had ""lost all credibility."" He castigated this faction for the damage they had inflicted on their own party and warned that they were more concerned about scoring political points than doing what was best for the country. Boehner is not alone. Business groups have started to mobilize, as they did in a special election in Alabama, to challenge right-wing Republicans. Tea party Republicans are taking this lying down. The attacks have only seemed to energize them. The Washington Post reported that at a meeting of 150 tea party activists in Tommy's Country Ham House in South Carolina, a kickoff dinner funded by the Koch brothers, one attendee dismissed reports of their falling popularity: ""I think it's wishful thinking on the part of the leadership of the Republican Party. I feel more energized."" At this and other meetings, conservative activists have been vowing to double their campaign against Republicans who have become too comfortable in Washington. Indeed, they have taken delight in the fact that Texas Rep. Steve Stockman announced that he will challenge Sen. John Cornyn in a primary. In The New York Times, one tea party activist, Jenny Beth Martin, blasted the Republican leadership and called the recent budget deal a ""betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the Republicans' 2010 midterm shellacking of Democrats."" Will Obamacare flourish or fail? The battles over the Affordable Care Act are not over. As David Weigel recently argued in Slate, 2014 will be filled with all sorts of new attacks on the program. The announcement that the administration would temporarily exempt Americans whose health insurance is scheduled to be canceled from the individual mandate energized Republicans calling for such an exemption for all Americans. The decision, according to Washington Post writer Ezra Klein, ""puts the first crack in the individual mandate. The question is whether it's the last."" One of the challenges to the health care program is a new lawsuit by individuals living in states that don't have state-run exchanges. The suit is based on the fact that the ACA legislation said individuals eligible for subsidies will be identified by state-run exchanges. The plaintiffs argue that in states in which the federal exchange is operational rather than a state exchange, subsidies should therefore not be available. If successful, this suit would have hugely detrimental effects on the program. In South Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri there are bills that would create disincentives for people to use the law. The fight will be fierce in 2014. After a tough start and long rollout, the Obama administration needs to get this program into strong shape soon and start having the benefits roll in to people to diminish interest in Republican efforts to damage Obamacare. Will Obama respond to the lure of Presidential power? Although President Obama began his term as a politician deeply critical of overusing presidential power, a signature of George W. Bush's time in the White House, there is more and more evidence that he is moving in the same direction as his predecessor. His decision to bring in John Podesta, a former adviser of President Bill Clinton who championed a highly aggressive use of executive power to push for environmental legislation, suggests that Obama is thinking about using his authority more freely. Over the past year, we have already learned through the NSA revelations that Obama is much more comfortable with expansive executive power than we previously thought. But in 2014, it is likely that we will see the President use this muscle with domestic issues like climate change, which he has been unable to advance on Capitol Hill. The risk of this strategy is that future presidents can easily roll back any gains. For the time being, however, Obama might just take this gamble, given it might be his last and best opportunity to effect change on the big issues that have eluded him. While surprises certainly lie ahead, we can predict that 2014 will pack a powerful punch politically as both parties dig in for the battles on the road leading to the next presidential election. We will also learn more about what the 2016 election may look like as some of the potential candidates, most importantly Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie, come closer to deciding whether to run. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer says 2014 will begin with some major questions on Washington's agenda .

"(CNN) -- If you are reluctant to challenge your physician on a certain procedure or medicine, you are hardly alone. Focus groups show that many patients feel intimidated by their doctors. They're reluctant to take an active role in discussing their care because they're afraid that the doctor will see them as ""difficult."" Recently, nine medical associations each took the unusual step of listing five medical procedures commonly used in their fields that patients don't need, amounting to 45 tests or procedures. The associations report some of them might actually be harmful. Eight medical associations have signed on to release additional lists in the fall. An annual EKG is an example of one test you can do without, unless family history or symptoms suggest otherwise. Some procedures, such as repeated abdominal CT scans without a significant change in the patient's condition, subject patients to a relatively high dose of radiation and can increase their cancer risk. It is not the government or the courts that issued these lists; the physicians' own professional associations decreed that these procedures usually should be avoided. But many doctors perform them anyway. There are many reasons for this: One is that doctors are often paid a fee for each procedure, and it doesn't take much creativity to convince themselves the patient needs the intervention. Another reason doctors I interviewed told me is that the medical associations' recommendations have no legal standing. These doctors said they can be sued for not screening properly if their patient has a heart attack or some other untoward event. And sheer inertia is also a powerful factor in preventing reform; the test is performed because ""this is what we have been doing for years."" On these and on scores of other medical matters, you cannot be a passive bystander. You need to keep an eye on what is ordered to be done to you and why. Form your own judgments, disregard those doctors who pooh-pooh the Internet. If you can find somewhere to park your general misgivings about the big, bad federal government, you will find that it runs excellent web pages where you can find very reliable information about what ails you, as well as information about possible treatments. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health provide extensive resources. And if you can let go of the notion that the private sector is the best way to get what you need, you will find that nonprofit organizations provide very sound guidance, for instance, the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. It's true there are dubious medical sites on the Internet, and you do best by following the same guidelines that serve well in the financial world: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If anybody tells you that you can lose 30 pounds easily if you buy their junk, let alone cure your cancer with apricot pits and coffee enemas in a few easy visits, click off and move on. Behavioral economics has shown that people are more swayed by anecdotes than by statistics. Parents will think the risks of vaccination are much higher after reading testimonials from parents whose children had negative reactions, in spite of having seen statistical information that says the risks are low. You need to pay more attention to people who say it with figures. When I read in the New England Journal of Medicine that a procedure I was to undergo had a 10% risk of ""esophageal injury with ulceration,"" I forced myself to pay more attention to this statistic than to the tale of a friend who had the same procedure and did well. I am sorry to say that I know quite a few people who agreed to undergo major surgery upon their doctor's recommendation without investigating their options. Some of those surgeries went awfully wrong. But they would not dream of buying a lawn mower, let alone a car, in this way. If you keep in mind what can and often does go wrong, you are likely to find the inner strength to ask questions, even if you have to apologize for not saluting the doctor and doing what you are told. And if you have to pay from your pocket for a second opinion, it's worth it. I have been an inquisitive patient, which is one reason I am hitting 83. I refused to undergo more surgeries than I have and, politely, left some doctors who were too eager to conduct a lot of tests that seemed to me hard to justify. I am not saying it is easy; just that it is vital.

"(CNN) -- In the early hours of New Year's Eve in a small town in Michigan, two boys apparently got a rambunctious idea for some late night fun. When it was over, one of them was dead, authorities said. Brandon Burr and Adrian Chiquito sneaked out of the house early Tuesday in Niles, Michigan, and into Burr's grandfather's car, WOOD reported. The family was unaware of the boys' joy ride until Cass County sheriff's deputies came knocking at the door. When they asked Adrian's father, Kevin Waldrop, and his wife, Jalaine, if they knew that the car was missing from their garage, they were shocked, and Jalaine Waldrop ran into the boys' bedroom. They had not heard the boys leave, they told WOOD. They thought they were upstairs playing video games. Brandon and Adrian shared a room like brothers, because their families lived together under the same roof. ""The kids were gone, and the blankets were stuffed with pillows, and she just knew,"" Kevin Waldrop told WOOD. ""They took the car while we were sleeping."" The crash had split the car nearly in two. Brandon, 14, was at the wheel and was injured, Sheriff Joseph M. Underwood Jr. said. The teen was speeding on roads slick from winter weather, lost control and ran into a tree, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital, where his condition was improving.

"(CNN) -- The United States is on the verge of losing a fierce advocate for democracy in Latin America. Mari Carmen Aponte, ambassador to El Salvador, was initially nominated by President Obama in late 2009. He made her a recess appointment in August 2010. She has hit the ground running in a Central American country that, thanks to her tireless work, has become a close partner and ally of the United States. It was the first Latin American country to send troops to Afghanistan. Aponte has been renominated, but if the Senate does not confirm her nomination next week, she will head home, leaving her impressive work unfinished and a gaping hole in our country's efforts to continue to build and sustain strong and transparent democracies south of the border. Why wouldn't the Senate confirm her? Sadly, as with everything in Washington right now, it would be purely because of partisan politics. It would be because Republicans would rather shoot themselves (and the country) in the foot before they give President Obama a perceived political ""win."" Republican Sen. Jim DeMint is using an even worse excuse to vote against her: a commentary she wrote recently for a daily newspaper in El Salvador urging tolerance and inclusion for gays and lesbians. The op-ed was the result of a State Department directive to all U.S. ambassadors urging them to recognize Gay Pride Month. Last time I checked, tolerance and inclusion were all-American values that we should all hold dear. Republicans need to put these distractions, which have nothing to do with Aponte's clear abilities, aside and recognize that her approval would be a win for the country. There is still time for Republicans to reconsider how important her work in El Salvador has been and how foolish and petty it would be for them to put politics before good policy. This is especially true in a region where we are fighting every day to turn back the influence of totalitarian regimes such as Cuba, and other regimes like Venezuela, that while technically democratic, engage in suppression and human rights violations. Aponte has been a true soldier for representative government, human rights and the rule of law. It is not too late for Republicans to look at her record objectively and realize her many accomplishments not only deserve recognition, they deserve to be seen through to fruition as she fulfills her entire term. Republicans should let her finish her work with the first Salvadoran Government Ethics committee, which she has overseen through a partnership with USAID. They should let her finish what she started by negotiating with the Salvadoran government for the creation of the new National Electronic Monitoring Center, which marks a significant milestone in the fight against organized crime in El Salvador. Republicans should let her finish her efforts with the Partnership for Growth, an economic development initiative focused on understanding the barriers to growth in our partner countries with tremendous potential. Aponte took leadership of the Partnership for Growth and immediately established a joint action plan that could ensure the kind of on-the-ground transformational change that El Salvador needs to give its citizens hope for a better life -- if she can stay to finish the job. In fact, her work on economic development will go a long way toward stemming the flow of illegal immigration to the United States. If Salvadorans believe they will have good economic opportunities to provide for their families in their beloved home country, they will not choose to come to the United States, relieving some of the incoming flow of undocumented immigrants. Republicans could also easily send a message to our neighbors to the south, that they support their countries and want to be true partners with them. In El Salvador, where Aponte has helped unite the country's factions, that message could be sent by approving her ambassadorship. Republicans would also be sending a positive message, at a time when they so desperately need it, to the Latino community in the United States, and to women in general, if they approve Aponte, who has a long and rich history of work in the nonprofit sector and the private sector, as well as extensive experience in government. She is highly regarded by Latinos of all backgrounds here in the United States. Aponte's advocacy for democratic values will be by far her most lasting legacy in El Salvador. She has become a leader of that country's women's empowerment movement, has been a tireless advocate for increased government transparency and accountability, and -- Republicans should be thrilled with this one -- she has been a staunch supporter of the U.S. private sector, constantly looking at ways to support American jobs by opening up markets and opportunities for companies in El Salvador. Aponte has also been an unmoving U.S. presence against any Cuba-Venezuela influence, including sending a direct message to El Salvador's president, Mauricio Funes, about the need to address human rights and democracy with Raul Castro during Funes' first official visit to Cuba. Next week, the Senate should show Americans that on something as simple but important as a nomination to be ambassador to El Salvador, they can get it right. Let's send Ambassador Aponte back to finish the job. We will all be better off for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: U.S. is on verge of losing a fierce advocate for democracy in Latin America .

"(InStyle) -- On August 25th, Claudia Schiffer -- the youngest of the crop of so-called ""original supermodels"" who made their mark on fashion in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- will turn the big 4-0. To celebrate, InStyle took a look back at the top six, and offers updates as to where they are now. Claudia Schiffer, 40 . Then: Schiffer was only 17 when Karl Lagerfeld enlisted her to model for Chanel; a subsequent ad campaign for Guess played up her resemblance to the actress Brigitte Bardot and turned her into an international star. Now: The German-born model, who's married to filmmaker Matthew Vaughn (he directed ""Kick-Ass""), recently gave birth to her third child and continues to pose part-time for brands like Chanel, Ferragamo, Alberta Ferretti (she's the face of their signature fragrance) and Yves St. Laurent. See all the original supermodels: then and now . Cindy Crawford, 44 . Then: The all-American Crawford appeared on hundreds of magazine covers. She also pitched Pepsi, hosted the MTV series ""House of Style,"" and married the movie star Richard Gere. (They divorced four years later.) Now: Re-married in 1998 to businessman Rande Gerber, Crawford has launched several successful businesses of her own, including an eponymous Home Collection and a line of anti-aging skincare products called Meaningful Beauty. Cindy Crawford's secret to feeling sexy . Naomi Campbell, 40 . Then: Discovered at 15 while window-shopping in London's Covent Garden, Campbell quickly went from being an in-demand catwalk star to posing for numerous magazine covers, many of which had never before featured a black model. She represented Nars, Ralph Lauren, and Prada, appeared in music videos for Madonna, Michael Jackson, and the Notorious B.I.G., and dated Mike Tyson, Robert DeNiro, and Eric Clapton. Now: Although plagued by personal scandals, Campbell is still a fashion-world star.

"(CNN) -- Burglars broke into a Southern California home that appears to be that of pop music star Miley Cyrus, police said Saturday. The burglary was reported around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at a residence in Studio City, according to Los Angeles police Officer Rosario Herrera. The homeowner told investigators that some personal items were taken. Authorities found no evidence of a forced entry, nor were any suspects seen at the property, Herrera said. Police declined to name the homeowner. But they did provide an address of a residence that is known to journalists as belonging to Cyrus. The singer's representatives did not return CNN's call for comment on the incident. It threatened to put a damper on a big weekend for Cyrus, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Saturday.","Burglars break in to a home in Studio City, California, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- About 250 veterans gathered today at the World War II Memorial in Washington. They were joined by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to mark the premiere of their 10-part HBO series, ""The Pacific."" It was a high-profile public media event, but for me it was personal. For me, it brought back memories of my dad, who fought the Nazis in Europe. When I was 9 or 10 years old, my father took me to a college basketball game. As the clock ran out, a trumpeter in the pep band thought it would be cute to mark the demise of the rival team by playing Taps. Dad was not amused. ""Shut up!"" he roared. The trumpeter played on, oblivious. Dad got to his feet, fists clenched. ""I said, 'Shut up!'"" Embarrassed, I cringed in my seat. I'd never seen Dad this upset. But most people in the noisy auditorium were unaware of his wrath. He was drowned out by cheers, and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter. Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany. Under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Terry Allen, the ""Timberwolves"" fought through Holland, Belgium, and into Germany, seeing unbelievable carnage. Some men became numb to it. Dad told me about seeing a couple of soldiers carelessly tossing bodies into the back of a truck to be hauled away from the battlefield. As Dad watched, a passing officer angrily chewed out the men: . ""These are soldiers of the United States Army,"" the officer yelled, ""and they will be treated with respect!"" Whenever Dad told that story, his voice would catch. Fast forward. Spring 1995 -- 50 years after the Nazis surrendered and some 35 years after that basketball game. His emotions were still raw as we sat together on the back porch of my home in suburban Atlanta. Over the course of three days, I held a small tape recorder between us as he talked about his life. Not surprisingly, his days in combat with the 104th took up most of the eight hours I captured on tape. Dad was a shy man, placid, slow to anger. Rarely did he show much emotion of any kind, except laughter -- he loved to laugh. So, it was unexpected when, during a taping session, he suddenly broke down and wept. He'd been describing the day he came across a group of Timberwolf infantrymen who'd been caught in a crossfire and slaughtered. ""If it hadn't been for those guys in the infantry,"" he said, swiping at his tears, ""I never would have survived the war."" My dad, N. George DeDakis, remained in the Army Reserves after WWII, retiring as a colonel in 1960. He practiced law in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and died May 29, 1996, at the age of 88. I went in his place to the 56th Timberwolves reunion in Atlanta August 28 to September 3, 2001. (The unit's final reunion will be September 1 in Chicago.) At the Atlanta reunion, I had a chance to relay Dad's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans I met -- and I listened as many of them talked about their experiences. The memories were old, but the tears were fresh. One told me, ""Think of the worst you could go through -- then double it."" Another said he wrote down his story but hid the manuscript in a safe deposit box for his children to read after his death. ""It's too awful to talk about,"" he explained, ""plus, none of them seem very interested in what I did during the war."" One infantryman recounted the shock and horror of finding the bodies of some of his closest foxhole buddies ""dead in the street."" ""I just shut down completely,"" he said. ""My emotions turned to ice. Suddenly, I had no one I could talk to."" ""Could you pray?"" I asked. ""I could until [the] Nordhausen [concentration camp],"" he replied. (On April 11, 1945, the 104th liberated the Mittelbau-Dora camp in Nordhausen, Germany. The bodies of 5,000 starved prisoners were stacked like cordwood and the few hundred survivors were like walking skeletons.) He told me it took years, and the help of several understanding people, to restore in him a semblance of faith. ""How did the war change you?"" I asked several of the men. ""It made me mean,"" one man confessed. Some said it took years, and the patience of long-suffering spouses, before they were able to overcome their anger -- anger they didn't even know they had until others pointed it out to them. During my time with these men, I tried to resist my journalistic instinct to probe. Mostly, I listened. It was a rich experience. An experience, I fear, that will be lost forever if more of us don't encourage these men and women to tell their stories for history.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed a Saudi diplomat in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, on Tuesday, police said. Bangladesh police said Khalaf Al Ali, 45, had served two years at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Dhaka as head of citizens' affairs. The Saudi Embassy in Dhaka confirmed the death but declined to make a comment. Ali was shot dead in the city's highly secured Gulshan diplomatic zone in front of his rented apartment at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, and he died at a local hospital about 5 p.m., authorities said. Lutful Kabir, a deputy commissioner of Dhaka's metropolitan police, said no motive for the killing has been found. ""He was shot in the left chest from a close distance,"" he said after an initial investigation. ""We're shocked. ... It's unexpected and unfortunate. ... We'll use all possible means to bring the culprits to book,"" Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said. ""Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia maintain very good relations, and I believe it will not affect the relations,"" she said. Police said Ali lived alone at his Gulshan apartment and went for a walk late every night. Tapos Rema, a guard at the Saudi official's home, said Ali went for the walk as usual and was attacked when he returned. Witnesses said that when Ali was near his home, shots were fired from a car that then fled. Shamsul Islam, a junior Bangladeshi minister for home affairs, said ""the matter is being investigated, and we'll bring the perpetrators to justice as soon as possible."" Saudi Arabia, where more than 2 million Bangladeshis stay and work, is a key ally and a major donor to Bangladesh. In recent years, Riyadh has tightened recruitment from Bangladesh. In October, Saudi authorities executed eight Bangladeshi workers in public for their alleged involvement in an armed robbery in which an Egyptian security guard was killed. Dhaka criticized the beheadings, as did the United Nations.","Authorities say Khalaf Al Ali, 45, was shot about 1 a.m. Tuesday and died about 5 p.m.

"Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) -- The Roman Catholic Church has not been vigilant enough or fast enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by priests, Pope Benedict XVI said Thursday. ""These revelations were for me a shock and a great sadness. It is difficult to understand how this perversion of the priestly ministry was possible,"" he told reporters aboard his plane to Scotland. ""How a man who has done this and said this can fall into this perversion is difficult to understand."" He added, ""It is also a great sadness that the authorities of the church were not sufficiently vigilant and insufficiently quick and decisive in taking the necessary measures."" British people feel overwhelmingly that the pope has not done enough to punish priests who abuse children, according to a ComRes poll for CNN released as Benedict arrived in the country. Three out of four British people -- and two out of three Catholics in the country -- say he should do more to punish abusive clergy. Critics of the church were quick to pounce on the pope's remarks. ""It's disingenuous to say church officials have been slow and insufficiently vigilant in dealing with clergy sex crimes and cover ups. On the contrary, they've been prompt and vigilant, but in concealing, not preventing, these horrors,"" said Joelle Casteix of SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Another campaigner took aim at the pontiff personally. ""The pope affects the stance of a shocked bystander, when in fact he has been for decades the church's central handler of sex abuse cases,"" said Terence McKiernan of BishopAccountability, a group that tracks reports of abuse by priests. The pope made the comments as he arrived for a historic four-day state visit to Britain, where the issue of abuse, and the Vatican's perceived lack of response to it, has created anger. But there was a warm welcome for him on a cold afternoon in Glasgow, Scotland, for the first major mass of his visit. Tens of thousands turned out to hear him preach, with members of the faithful describing it as a ""happy day"" and calling it a ""great honor"" that he had come. Benedict elaborated in Glasgow on what's expected to be a major theme of his visit, the value of religion in a society that he sees as increasingly secular. ""There are some who now seek to exclude religious belief from public discourse, to privatize it or even to paint it as a threat to equality and liberty,"" he said in his homily. ""Yet religion is in fact a guarantee of authentic liberty and respect."" He also urged bishops to look after their priests -- possibly an oblique reference to the sex abuse scandal -- and warned young people against the temptations of ""drugs, money, sex, pornography, alcohol -- which the world tells you will bring you happiness, yet these things are destructive and divisive."" Benedict started his visit in Edinburgh, where he held a meeting with the queen and greeted thousands who turned out to see him on the streets of the Scottish city. Queen Elizabeth II shook hands with the pope at her Scottish residence near Edinburgh, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, before they sat down for a private meeting. A military marching band played the national anthem God Save the Queen, for which the pope removed his white cap. The pope used relatively strong language in a speech delivered after the meeting, reflecting on the ""sobering lessons of the atheist extremism"" of the 20th century. He reminded the media of its ""greater responsibility than most"" to promote peace and the spread of human rights, and he reminded the country of its ""deep Christian roots"" that he said are still present in ""every layer"" of British life. ""Today, the United Kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society,"" the pope said. ""In this challenging enterprise, may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate. Let it not obscure the Christian foundation that underpins its freedoms."" Those comments, too, resulted in ""disappointment"" from the British Humanist Association, which said the notion that atheism ""somehow fuels intolerance in Britain today is a terrible libel against those who do not believe in God."" The National Secular Society said British secularism ""is not something to criticize, but to celebrate."" ""We have rejected dogmatic religion devoid of compassion,"" the group said in a statement. ""In its place we have embraced and included gay people and given them the right to full equality, given women the right to control their own fertility, given scientists a free hand to seek cures for horrific diseases by the use of stem-cell research."" Though a pope has visited Britain once before -- Pope John Paul II in 1982 -- this is considered the first state visit by a pope to Britain because it comes at the invitation of the queen, not the Catholic Church, as was the case 28 years ago. Benedict's September 16-19 trip is scheduled to include meetings with political leaders, royalty, and bridge-building events with Anglican Church officials. It will culminate in the beatification of British Cardinal John Henry Newman, a Catholic convert who died in 1890 and is credited with helping rebuild Britain's Catholic community. Assistant Chief Constable Fiona Taylor, of Scotland's Strathclyde Police, said earlier this week that she estimated only 65,000 pilgrims would attend the Mass there, short of an initially anticipated 100,000. There has already been widespread outcry over the estimated 12 million pounds ($18.7 million) British taxpayers are having to pay for the visit, though Christopher Patten, the prime minister's representative for the papal visit, has pointed out that one day of last year's G-20 summit in London cost 20 million pounds. Criticism has also focused on the armed police squads needed to protect a religious figurehead previously targeted by attackers. Along with anger about the Vatican's response to child and sexual abuse, there is criticism over the pope being granted a state visit, given the Catholic Church's attitudes towards gender equality and homosexuality. Catholic leaders and government officials have defended the trip, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying Britain and the Vatican have ""incredibly important work to do together"" in promoting a ""multi-faith dialogue."" CNN's Phil Black and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Critics call his comments disingenuous and say he knew about the abuse .

"Patchogue, New York (CNN) -- In the December chill of Long Island, Joselo Lucero stands on the spot where seven teenagers attacked his brother and another Hispanic man five years ago as part of the pastime they made out of hunting and beating up Latinos. His brother, Ecuadorean immigrant Marcelo Lucero, was fatally stabbed by one of the attackers in a sport authorities say the youths referred to as ""beaner hopping."" Authorities called it a hate crime. Lucero points to a patch of grass near the Long Island Rail Road station in this waterfront village where the confrontation began on the night of November 8, 2008. There was the spot where a knife pierced Marcelo's chest; the house where his cries for help went unheeded; the fence where his body crumpled and bled to death. ""For me, it's a symbol,"" Lucero, 38, said. ""That was the end of something, but it was the beginning of the change. A regular person, bleeding ... stood up and fought for what was right."" Another step in that change came Tuesday when Suffolk County legislators voted 14-0, with four absent, for an agreement that gives the U.S. Justice Department rare oversight of the Suffolk County police. County officials later said another vote was taken with three of the absent legislators present, and the settlement was approved 17-0. The 27-page agreement settles a federal investigation of discriminatory policing in immigrant communities in Suffolk, one of the nation's largest suburbs and home to ritzy East Hampton. That investigation was triggered by the 2008 hate crime, which fueled international outcry and exposed a pattern of anti-immigrant violence and what community leaders called police inaction. The agreement calls for additional police training, accountability and outreach to Latinos; better tracking of hate crimes and police discrimination; regular meetings with Latino leaders; and more bilingual officers. The settlement does not cite wrongdoing or specific problems with the Police Department or its policies, even though the Justice Department inquiry found that police helped created a climate where hate crimes went unreported and officers routinely ignored bias attacks. ""The cops that looked the other way are still there,"" said Patrick Young, a lawyer and program director at the Central American Refugee Center. ""The real issue is, Can they reconstruct the culture of the police so that police do not look the other way? We feel they have done a good job of making the police more accountable."" A step forward . For Joselo Lucero and others, the settlement is a tiny step for a county trying desperately to shed its reputation as a bastion of anti-immigrant fear and resentment. ""Let's not be hypocrites,"" Lucero told CNN. ""Who were the police officers who did not follow up on these crimes? Why should I believe these people will change? No one has been named in connection with these cover ups."" After the Marcelo Lucero slaying, dozens of immigrants told federal and county officials about hate crimes they suffered and reports made to officers who failed to investigate, according to Foster Maer, senior litigation counsel for LatinoJustice PRLDEF, formerly called the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. Maer believes the Justice Department failed by not investigating these other alleged crimes reported by the county's Latino community as part of its settlement with Suffolk. That failure, according to Maer, has deprived immigrants of the truth and the entire community of a ""critical learning moment,"" said Maer, whose Manhattan-based advocacy group first took the allegations to federal investigators. The group will ask the Justice Department and Suffolk officials to sign another agreement calling on the county to investigate unsolved hate crimes and establish why previous attacks were ignored. Amol Sinha, director of the Suffolk County Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the young men who preyed on immigrants did not fear any consequences. ""There were instances leading up to that terrible night where kids were out 'beaner hopping' and beating up who they perceived to be undocumented immigrants and never got more than a slap on the wrist,"" Sinha said. ""So often the police would leave them alone or encourage people not to press charges or, if charges were pressed, they were something like disorderly conduct or something light,"" he added. ""They would say, 'They're just teenagers messing around.' "" Suffolk Deputy Chief Kevin Fallon acknowledged that with the growth of the county's Spanish-speaking population, officers had trouble communicating with crime victims. But Fallon denied that the police fostered a climate that encouraged hate crimes. ""It's important to know that the Department of Justice came in to look at that allegation,"" he said, ""and there was no finding on their part."" Fallon said some undocumented immigrants might have been reluctant to report crimes because of their legal status. But the 2,000-officer department wants the message out that ""their status is not a factor for us."" ""I'd like to think we are heading in the right direction,"" he said, referring to police and community relations. ""It's going to take a long time to get that trust back."" 'We're not going to let this happen again' On Main Street in Patchogue, a quiet village of about 12,000 people on the south shore of Long Island, four men from El Salvador and Honduras sitting in a laundromat said they believe some things have changed, while others have not, after the Lucero slaying. ""The police treat you a little better,"" said one man, declining to give his name. ""You don't see small groups of kids hanging around like before,"" said another. ""There are more police around."" ""But you know you're still not safe out alone at night,"" said a third. Verbal and physical assaults against immigrants continue, including, the men said, a recent stabbing of a Latino immigrant outside a deli in Bellport by a group of men armed with bats and knives. But the police are more attentive to Latinos, occasionally picking up men walking home alone at night and dropping them off at their destinations, they said. The climate of fear in Suffolk County was created in part by immigration opponents who found sympathetic ears in the area, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report one year after Lucero's killing. Former County Executive Steve Levy, an anti-immigration firebrand who employed measures seen as hostile toward Latinos, has been singled out by advocates and immigrants alike as an enabler of the hate. ""Suffolk County became ground zero for the anti-immigrant movement and it threw up a sign saying we're a county of intolerance,"" said Luis Valenzuela, executive director of the Long Island Immigrant Alliance. For decades, the influx of undocumented immigrants in Suffolk generated anger and tension in the neighborhood. Recent arrivals said longtime residents make sharp distinctions between assimilated immigrants who've been here for a generation or two and those who arrived more recently. Those are perceived as a threat to local jobs and the quality of life. In recent decades, thousands of immigrants from Latin America have arrived on Long Island. Patchogue's Latino population has risen steadily, with Ecuadoreans making up the largest group, according to advocates. The hostility and attacks predated the Lucero slaying. In 2001, two Mexican day laborers were nearly beaten to death. In 2003, the home of a Mexican family was burned down. Both incidents occurred in the nearby town of Farmingville. ""That was a learning moment for schools and communties to address that issue, and they didn't want to,"" said Regina Casale, who teaches Spanish in the Suffolk County schools. ""They swept it under the carpet. Across the board everybody failed at that moment."" Moving on . Seven students from Patchogue-Medford High School were arrested and convicted in Lucero's death. One of them, Jeffrey Conroy, who was 17 and a star athlete at the time of the attack, is serving a 25-year sentence for manslaughter as a hate crime. Six others pleaded guilty and are serving sentences of between five and eight years. ""When this happened, you heard the teachers, the parents saying we didn't know this was going on,"" Casale said of Lucero's death. ""But all the kids knew. And there's still no visible youth movement saying, 'Let's talk about this. We're not going to let this happen again.' "" Two years ago, federal authorities recommended changes to promote trust between police and Latinos, including ""enhanced training and investigation of allegations of hate crimes and bias incidents, meaningful access to police services for individuals with limited English proficiency,"" the Justice Department said in a statement when the settlement was announced. The Justice Department would monitor the county's compliance for at least a year. ""All residents of Suffolk County deserve full and unbiased police protection, regardless of national origin, race, or citizenship status,"" said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch. Marcelo Lucero, who was 37 when he died and worked in a dry cleaning store, is remembered in a scholarship awarded each year by a nonprofit for whom his brother now works. Every year, Joselo Lucero and community leaders hold a vigil at the intersection near the Patchogue train station where Lucero died. In 2010, the corner was renamed Unity Place. Lucero travels around in his brother's old car, giving talks against bullying and hate crimes at schools around the region. Two students at Patchogue-Medford High School have been awarded the scholarship bearing his brother's name, but Lucero still hasn't been invited to speak there. ""The guys who killed my brother still have friends in the school,"" he said. ""They want to avoid any problems."" Said Casale, who teaches Spanish at a junior high school: ""It's almost like the county wants damage control rather than to take responsibility. They want this to go away.""","Ecuadorean immigrant Marcelo Lucero was attacked and killed in 2008 .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Malian authorities have found a mass grave containing 21 bodies thought to be soldiers killed while a junta chief was in power after a 2012 military coup, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said Wednesday. Investigators found the bodies in a grave close to a military camp in the village of Diago, just north of Bamako, spokeswoman Alasane Diarra said. Last week, Gen. Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested, charged with complicity in kidnapping. A failed counter-coup shortly after he seized power pitted two army factions against each other: the green berets loyal to Sanogo and the red berets loyal to ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure. ""At the military camp in Diago, there were both green berets and red berets soldiers. We do not know which group the soldiers in the grave belonged to,"" Diarra said. Investigations into alleged kidnapping and killings after the military takeover that plunged the West African country into chaos have been ongoing since April 30, 2012. ""The investigators have been working on the case since April, so just after the coup. They have known about the grave for a while, but when they finally went there and opened the grave, there were more bodies than they previously thought,"" Diarra said. The bodies are all male and from different ethnic groups, she said. As the bodies are removed from the grave, forensic investigators will start the process of identifying the men. ""Families of soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their family members,"" Diarra said.","The bodies are thought to be those of soldiers, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Yaya Toure's African reign will stretch into a third year after the Manchester City midfielder was named the continent's best footballer once again. The Ivory Coast star was crowned Footballer of the Year by the Confederation of African Football at a ceremony in Lagos, Nigeria on Thursday. Toure pipped compatriot Didier Drogba, who plays for Turkish outfit Galatasaray, and Chelsea's Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel to the crown. The 30-year-old becomes only the second player to win three successive titles, emulating Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, who now plays for Chelsea. Voted for by African national team coaches and technical directors, Toure needs only one more title to join Eto'o in an elite band of players who have won it for times. Toure, formerly of Spanish giants Barcelona, joined Manchester City in 2010, driving them to the Premier League title in the 2011-12 season. A linchpin of their midfield, the Ivorian has 13 goals to his name already this season as City jostle for another English title, and he was included in the Premier League's Team of 2013. He also helped his country qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, featuring in both legs of the playoff victory over Senegal. In Spain, Real Madrid saw off Osasuna 2-0 in the first leg of their fifth round Spanish Cup tie. With Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale on show, Real took the lead in the first half thanks to a free kick from France striker Karim Benzema. Ronaldo, who is widely expected to be crowned world footballer of the year at FIFA's Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich on Monday, then laid on the second goal for Jese on the hour mark.","Manchester City's Yaya Toure is named African Footballer of the Year .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles woman whom rapper 50 Cent is accused of kicking in a domestic violence incident is a model and an actress who had a part in a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film, her representative told CNN Friday. Daphne Joy, who was born in the Philippines, has a baby by the rapper and is now focusing on safety for the child and herself, said Jim Yeager, a spokesman for the Los Angeles law firm of Meyer, Olson, Lowy & Meyers, which is representing her. The alleged victim, whose name wasn't earlier disclosed by authorities, released her name Friday through Yeager. Joy played a principal mermaid in 2011's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" She's also had roles on TV's ""CSI: Las Vegas,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" and ""Wild 'N Out,"" her website says. 50 Cent's real name is Curtis Jackson. The 37-year-old is facing one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism. ""Daphne Joy and Curtis Jackson have been together for a few years in an exclusive relationship,"" said a statement by the law firm. ""They had a child and now Daphne's number one priority is to ensure both her and the baby's safety during this difficult time. We also hope everyone will respect her and the baby's privacy."" This week, however, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer's office described Joy as ""a former girlfriend"" of Curtis. The alleged victim ""had previously been in a three-year relationship with Jackson,"" the city prosecutor's office said. Jackson denies the allegations, said his attorney, Scott Leemon. ""It is important to note, Mr. Jackson has not been arrested and there is no warrant outstanding for his arrest,"" Leemon said. ""We have been in contact with the LA City Attorney's Office and are currently conducting our own investigation into these allegations."" Jackson is accused of ransacking Joy's bedroom during an argument at her Los Angeles condo last month. Joy lives in the city's Toluca Lake neighborhood. Joy alleges she was injured when Jackson kicked her on June 23, the city attorney said. Authorities allege Jackson caused $7,100 in damaged property and left the scene before police arrived. ""During an argument, Jackson allegedly began destroying the female's property,"" the city prosecutor's office said in a written statement. ""Allegedly when the female locked herself in her bedroom, Jackson kicked open the bedroom door and kicked her, causing an injury."" Police found broken chandeliers and furniture throughout the home. The bedroom closet was ransacked, with clothes thrown all over the floor, and there was a broken television and lamp, the prosecutor's office said. Jackson's arraignment is set for July 22 at Van Nuys Superior Court. If convicted on all five counts, he would face up to five years in jail and $46,000 in fines. On Twitter, the rapper has appeared to give a lighthearted response to the accusations. On Friday, he shared a series of photos of himself lounging around with playful captions such as, ""I'm not in jail I'm by my pool,"" and, ""I'm not in jail I'm on my Gucci couch.""

"Editor's note: Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University. Jeffrey Miron says the government can't assure affordable, high-quality care for all Americans. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Government spending on health care is growing at an alarming rate. If recent trends continue, the two main government programs, Medicaid and Medicare, will increase from 6 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product now to about 15 percent by 2040. This means that, without policy changes, the United States faces enormous budget deficits, substantially higher taxes, or huge cuts in non-health spending. No one wants higher deficits or taxes, and there is no consensus about cutting other spending. The only way to avoid some combination of these outcomes, however, is to reduce the growth rate of what we spend on health. The question, of course, is how? In a report this month, the Obama administration outlines its preferred approach. In a nutshell, the administration's plan is to make health care delivery more efficient. Indeed, the report suggests that improved efficiency can not only slow the growth of health expenditure but also fund government health insurance for the 46 million uninsured Americans. Increased efficiency in health care is indeed possible, but assuring ""high quality, affordable care for every American,"" as the administration seeks to do, is not. Here's why. Most health care is paid for by insurance. When people are insured they do not pay the full costs of the medical care they receive, so they demand the best and pay little attention to the expense. Patients opt for surgery rather than medication or wait-and-see, even when the medical advantages are small. Patients choose new, expensive medications rather than existing, cheaper generics in search of minor reductions in side effects. Family members exhaust every life-saving intervention for an elderly relative, even when the prospects of significant life extension are minimal. Doctors order excessive diagnostic tests, partially to avoid malpractice liability. If most people paid the full cost of their insurance, the incentives that insurance creates for excessive care would be modest. Insurance companies would utilize co-pays, deductibles, coverage limitations, and other contractual features that discourage inefficient levels of care, and more generous policies would be more expensive, discouraging demand for such coverage. Most people, however, do not pay the full cost of their health insurance. The poor and the elderly receive free or highly subsidized insurance via Medicaid or Medicare. Much of the working-age population gets subsidized insurance because employer-paid health insurance premiums are not treated as taxable income. Thus most insurance policies do not contain adequate incentives for patients and providers to balance costs and benefits in choosing the level of care. This absence of cost incentives is especially problematic -- paradoxically -- because of the technological progress that has occurred and will occur in medicine. These advances in health care are beneficial, but the new techniques are expensive. The implication is that patients and doctors constantly face the choice between high-cost, state-of-the-art care and moderate-cost, conventional care. If these decision makers face little financial penalty for choosing the best possible care, they will do so every time. Thus subsidized-insurance combined with medical advancement means rapidly increasing expenditure. This suggests that to restrain government health spending, policy must reduce existing subsidies, not introduce new government insurance. Inefficiencies in health care are a problem, but they persist because existing subsidies mean health care providers face limited incentives to control costs. A new government insurance program for the uninsured just makes things worse. In addition, this program will undoubtedly cost far more than initial estimates, as has occurred with Medicare and Medicaid. One way to reduce health insurance subsidies is to eliminate the tax-exemption for employer-paid health insurance premiums, while simultaneously lowering other taxes to hold revenue constant. This change in the structure of taxation would cause those now covered by employer plans to choose less generous packages and therefore make more efficient choices about health care. A second way to reduce subsidies is to gradually increase the age of eligibility for Medicare from its current level of 65, to 70 or more. This makes sense because of the improvements in life expectancy and health status of the elderly that have occurred over the past 40 years. A higher age of eligibility would reduce expenditure directly by shrinking the Medicare beneficiary base, and indirectly by pushing more people to face the cost-control measures in private insurance plans. Rolling back subsidies for health insurance is not pleasant medicine, but past improvements in health technology mean that even low-cost care is superior to the state-of-the-art a few decades ago. Society must accept that we cannot give everyone the best care all the time; the attempt to do so will bankrupt the economy. As in other areas, societies must make tradeoffs about health, and that happens well only when governments subsidize less.

"New York (CNN) -- The reward for the safe return of an autistic New York teen grew to $77,500 Monday as divers joined hundreds of officers who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week. Avonte Oquendo, 14, was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4. Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system this weekend as workers combed the underground network. All 468 New York City subway stations have been searched, and aviation, harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically, the New York Police Department said. The teenager, who is unable to communicate verbally, is fascinated by trains, his family said, and officials have shifted their search underground, a spokesman for the New York Police Department told CNN on Sunday. Searches of train stations, tracks and tunnels were also conducted late last week, Paul J. Fleuranges of the Metropolitan Transit Authority said. Though there are no leads, Daniel Oquendo Jr. fears his brother may have been taken. He told CNN affiliate WABC, ""It hurts. It's very stressful to know that someone would take an innocent, poor, mentally disabled child and take advantage of them."" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly held up a missing poster of Avonte at the Columbus Day Parade on Monday and said, ""We have redoubled our efforts. We have hundreds of police officers and detectives engaged in this search. We've enlisted the help of the guardian angels society, many volunteers."" David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, told CNN last week that he is looking into how Avonte was able to leave school grounds unsupervised. ""Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred,"" he said. Avonte's mother says the situation is ""heartbreaking."" ""I just need to find my son because he needs his family; he cannot fend for himself out there,"" Vanessa Fontaine told CNN affiliate WABC last week. ""This is just the hardest thing, to have your child disappear and you cannot bring him home with you,"" she said. The surveillance video provided by the police department shows that no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. ""He is supposed to have one-to-one supervision at all times,"" Fontaine said through tears. ""He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old."" The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with police. The school is not commenting. The Oquendo family filed a ""notice of claim"" Wednesday, said Perecman, marking the first step of a lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information about the claim. Police say Avonte was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Missing posters are being handed out, and the surrounding areas are under investigation, WABC reported. ""He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me.' He doesn't know that,"" Fontaine said Monday. ""He doesn't know fear."" Anyone with information about Avonte is asked to contact the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit tips at the Crime Stoppers website, nypdcrimestoppers.com or text to 274637(CRIMES), then enter TIP577.

"(CNN) -- A Dutch football club is facing criticism for playing in the United Arab Emirates, despite being told its Israeli defender would not be allowed in the country. Vitesse Arnhem, second in the Dutch league, is in Abu Dhabi for training and matches with two German teams during its mid-season break. The team's spokeswoman Esther Bal says the team was told just one day before the trip that defender Dan Mori could not enter the UAE. Like most Arab countries, the UAE does not recognize Israel, and its immigration policies stipulate that Israeli citizens will be refused admission. Still, Bal says planning for the trip began about six weeks ago and the team had been assured on the phone repeatedly that the 25-year-old Mori would be allowed to enter because he was an athlete. No officials in the UAE could be reached for immediate comment. Esther Voet, director of the Center for Information and Documentation on Israel, told CNN ""Vitesse should have had the team spirit not to go without Mori."" Over the weekend, two Dutch politicians also criticized the team for travelling to the UAE. Geert Wilders, leader of the rightist Party for Freedom, called the team ""cowardly"" on his Twitter account. ""Vitesse did not have to go to the UAE to protest the refusal to let Mori in."" However, Bal told CNN, ""We're a football club. We want to stay away from politics,"" adding that Mori himself, encouraged Vitesse to go ahead without him, ""putting the team's interests first."" According to Bal, Vitesse was unable to pull out of the trip as would have affected the other teams. ""We were under pressure. We had obligations with the teams we're playing,"" said Bal. Vitesse is playing German Bundesliga clubs Wolsfburg and Hamburg this week, before heading back to The Netherlands on Saturday. On its return, Bal says the team will contact world governing body FIFA to evaluate the situation. This is not the first time the UAE has come under pressure for stopping Israeli athletes from entering. Last year, the English Premier League team, Swansea City, was told its Israeli player, Itay Shechter, could not go to Dubai for training. The club considered canceling their mid-season camp. Israeli athletes have been allowed to attend international sporting events in the region, however. In October, Israeli contestants participated in the Swimming World Cup in Qatar, but images of the Israeli flag were omitted from parts of the competition. In 2009, Shahar Peer was denied entry into the UAE for the Dubai Tennis Championship, but played in subsequent tournaments.","Vitesse Arnhem under pressure after its Israeli defender was not allowed entry to the UAE .

"(CNN) -- Engineers have restored propulsion power to a cruise ship carrying about 1,000 people after it was left adrift off Indonesia by an engine fire, cruise company Azamara Club Cruises said. The ship is now sailing directly to Sandakan, in Malaysia, at a speed of between three and six knots and is expected to arrive within 24 to 48 hours, the company said. The Philippines Navy said it had sent a patrol boat which is accompanying the cruise ship. All of the nearly 600 passengers on board the Azamara Quest are safe but five crew members suffered smoke inhalation during the fire, the company said in an online statement. One crew member who was more seriously injured is doing better but will be taken to a hospital as soon as the ship reaches shore, it said. ""The damage caused by the fire will require us to cancel the rest of Azamara Quest's voyage once the ship arrives in Sandakan,"" it said. As of Saturday morning local time, the ship was located 200 miles off the port city of Balikpapan, on the Indonesian island of Borneo, in calm seas, the company said. The fire broke out at about 8:20 p.m. local time in one of the ship's engine rooms, where it was contained and quickly extinguished, the company said. Power was restored to one of the engines late Friday, allowing the ship to restart its air conditioning, running water, plumbing and refrigeration, Azamara Club Cruises said. The fire broke out after the Azamara Quest had set sail from Manila, in the Philippines, Officer Francis Wong, chief of communications for the Philippines Navy, told CNN. The ship's captain reported the fire to the Philippine naval authorities, who sent a Cessna aircraft and two patrol gun boats to the cruise ship in response, he said. As of noon Friday Philippine time the fire was under control, he said. ""When we left the ship was safe and close to Palawan,"" he said, referring to an island province in the Philippines. The Azamara Quest was on a 17-night sailing voyage that departed Hong Kong, China, on March 26, and was due to include port calls in the Philippines, Borneo and Indonesia before concluding in Singapore on April 12. Anyone booked on the Azamara Quest for a cruise starting April 12 is advised by Azamara Club Cruises to check the company's website on Monday for an update. Azamara Club Cruises, which operates two cruise liners, is part of the giant Royal Caribbean Cruises group.

"(CNN) -- Five Rwandans accused of involvement in genocide in their native country were arrested in Britain on Thursday, London's Metropolitan Police Service said. The men appeared in a London court under an extradition warrant alleging offenses that include genocide and murder between 1993-1994. They were identified by police as Vincent Bajinya, Charles Munyaneza, Emmanuel Nteziryayo, Celestin Ugirashebuja and Celestin Mutabaruka. At least 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda's 1994 genocide. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis also were killed. The five men are expected to appear again in the same court on Wednesday.","At least 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda's genocide .

"(CNN) -- Last year, at Wellesley High School in Massachusetts, David McCullough Jr., an English teacher at the school and the son of the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough, gave the commencement address. He knocked it out of the park, and his words traveled far. What he had to say, America was desperate to hear. McCullough believes that much of today's youth is ""pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped"" and shielded from reality. He told the graduates: ""Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you."" I've had the privilege of delivering a commencement address, at a university in central California, and I hope someday to deliver another. In fact, I already know what I want to say. So let me try it out on the class of 2013. Talk to college professors or human resource managers or employers. Read the research done on the so-called Millennial generation, and you'll find lots of evidence that McCullough was on the right track. The young people of today have often spent their lives being coddled, catered to and spared the stress of living up to expectations. People usually tell them only what they want to hear. Obama to new grads: ""No time for excuses"" Not me. I'd rather tell our future leaders what they need to hear. Here are 10 provocative pieces of advice that this year's class of college and university graduates would be wise to take to heart: . 1) Have your parents introduce themselves to you. Interview them, and record it. Ask them about their lives, and what stories or lessons they'd like to share with their grandchildren. They gave you life, so the least you can do is try to understand theirs. When they're gone, you'll be glad you did. 2) Follow your passion but be open to the idea that your passion might change and evolve over the years as you do. Don't be afraid to change course and go in a different direction. You're allowed to have second thoughts, about what you want to do and how you intend to spend your life. 3) Never forget that, despite what society has told you, you're not special, as McCullough said in his graduation speech. The world doesn't revolve around you. And you mustn't feel entitled to anything. No one is better than you, but you're not better than anyone else. Treat everyone with respect, as long as they treat you the same way. 4) Break out of your comfort zone. Do what you're most afraid of. Avoid what is easy and predictable. Travel the country and the world. Meet new people and strive to see the world from their vantage point. Stay curious. Ask questions. And never stop learning. 5) Don't just accept failure, but welcome it. Expect it. Learn from it. Treat it as a valuable learning experience. Remember, if you always get everything you want, and accomplish everything you set out to do, then you've failed anyway. Because you've set your goals too low. 6) Question authority and challenge your beliefs. Jump into the public debate. Become engaged. Democracy is a participatory sport; you take part, or you get taken apart. It doesn't matter what you believe. What matters is that you thought your way there and can explain why you believe it. 7) For those of you who choose, or are able, to get married -- and hopefully, one day, all of you will be -- who you decide to marry will go a long way toward determining your success. It's more important than degrees from fancy schools. People can either lift you up, or bring you down. Choose well. 8) For those who you who choose, or are able, to have children, when you set to raise them, give them the one thing they want most: your time. Teach them to be productive. But more importantly, teach them, by example, to be good people, who treat fellow human beings kindly and with respect. 9) As you go through life, don't be afraid to have high expectations of your children, of others, and of yourself. There are worse things than being disappointed because someone didn't perform as you hoped. Like giving up on them and not expecting much from the beginning. 10) Finally, many years from now, when you go to your rest, your most important accomplishment in life won't be the money you earned or the success you enjoyed. The only thing that will endure, and let the world know you were here in the first place, is the impact you had on other people. Make it a positive one. That's it. Take it, or leave it. Everyone enjoys the comfort of a warm bath. But sometimes, what's called for is a cold shower.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When the economy gets tough, the tough come out fighting. For some businesses, that means bringing out a fighter brand -- a cut-price version of a flagship product, marketed under a new name, and intended to fight back against budget competitors. ""Jetstar"" is a fighter brand that worked, beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand. When it's done right it can destroy cut-price competition, but done badly it can drive a business to the brink of bankruptcy. Mark Ritson, associate professor at Melbourne Business School, has written an article for the October issue of Harvard Business Review discussing the benefits and pitfalls of launching a fighter brand. He says that over the next six months a number of new fighter brands are likely to appear in response to the recession. ""Fighter brands are very unusual but they are becoming increasingly common,"" he told CNN. ""It's high risk and high reward, and when it works it can have astonishing results."" Ritson gives the example of Intel, which launched its budget ""Celeron"" chip in the late 1990s to in response to AMD's low-priced chips, which were threatening Intel's premium ""Pentium"" brand.   Read more business features  With ""Celeron,"" Intel came up with a budget alternative to ""Pentium"" for the lower end of the market and cemented its position as market leader. But Intel's success is the exception rather than the rule. ""The majority of fighter brands not only haven't worked, but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them,"" said Ritson. General Motors' (GM) ""Saturn,"" United Airlines' ""Ted,"" and Kodak's ""Funtime"" film range are all high-profile fighter brands that failed. Despite the appeal of taking on the competition in a fist fight, launching a successful fighter brand is easier said than done. ""The problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out,"" Neil Saunders, consulting director with Verdict Research, told CNN. Ritson says one element in building a fighter brand is to avoid creating a low-price product that is so attractive that it steals customers who would otherwise be buying that company's premium-brand product. On the other hand, if the fighter brand is too expensive or too low quality, it won't put up much of a fight against the opposition it's designed to attack. Another complication is that even the biggest companies don't have the money and managerial time to distract themselves with a new brand at a time when they should be concentrating on their core products, and then there is the difficulty in operating at an unfamiliar low price level. ""The airline industry is a prime example, where people have launched fighter brands to combat the budget airlines and have been notoriously unsuccessful,"" said Saunders. ""If it's not your business model it's not easy to operate, and it's not usually these airlines' business model."" United's ""Ted,"" and Delta Air Lines ""Song"" were launched to combat budget carriers, but they weren't up to the challenge. In fact, Ritson says those fighter brands contributed to United and Delta's bankruptcy. But with its budget ""Jetstar"" airline, Qantas managed to find the holy grail for fighter brands -- beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand in its own right. So what was different about the Qantas model? ""One thing was that Qantas took a long, hard look at the numbers and decided if they could be profitable,"" said Ritson. ""One of the problems with fighter brands is that they are oriented towards destroying a competitor and because of that managers pay a lot less attention to the bottom line."" He gives the example of GM's ""Saturn,"" a car designed to take on fuel-efficient, affordable Japanese cars. ""Saturn"" sold plenty of cars, at least at first, but its high operating costs meant it lost millions of dollars, playing a huge part in bankrupting GM. So given the huge risks involved, should companies even consider launching a fighter brand? ""Only do it if you can win and it fits with your existing proposition,"" says Saunders. Ritson cautions, ""The minute you add a new brand to your portfolio it's hundreds of thousands of hours of management time, and millions of dollars in development, advertising and distraction. ""Ask the question, 'do I need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market, which means I need to change my existing strategy with existing brands?' Otherwise you will lose five years and $50 million.""","Fighter brands are designed to fight back against low-priced competition .
Done wrong, fighter brands can drive a company to the brink of bankruptcy .
GM's ""Saturn"" is a fighter brand that failed, while Intel's ""Celeron"" succeeded .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- At last, a Wisconsin mother and her long-lost son met Saturday for the first time since her estranged husband spirited him away to Mexico more than 30 years ago. It was an emotional reunion in the San Diego airport, heightened by the fact that the mother speaks only English and her 37-year-old son only Spanish. David Amaya Barrick, whose father took him across the border at about age 2 from Chicago, was biting his nails just before his mother, Kathy Amaya, now 60, appeared before him in the airport. They embraced, hugged and kissed -- the first time they've laid eyes on each other in about 35 years. The son spoke in Spanish: ""I love you and I missed you a lot. I welcome you into my life."" The mother declared to her son: ""I love you and I'm very happy to see you and I'm not going to let you go."" Later, the son told reporters that he was at a loss of words. The mother remarked: ""He's all grown up."" Abducted son reunites with father after 13 years . The mother and son will spend a few days in San Diego getting to know each other again. They will do so during long strolls along the beach, they said. Then they will travel Tuesday to her home in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where they will enjoy Thanksgiving together. Kathy Amaya, an assistant housekeeper at a hotel, has four adult children who are half-siblings to David Amaya. Two of those adult children live with Kathy Amaya. Saturday's journey to see her son also marked another milestone in Kathy Amaya's life: It was the first time she ever flew in a plane. The separation between mother and son spanned 1,800 miles and lasted more than 30 years. The mother counts the absence as 35 years, the son as 34 years -- an exact figure to be certainly figured out while they get reacquainted. The family saga then took a dramatic turn by how David Amaya was discovered: He was arrested illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border at Imperial Beach, California, on October 30. The U.S. Border Patrol thought he and a Mexican national were smugglers because they were in the company of six Romanian nationals. They were all arrested after crossing a flood control tunnel frequented by intravenous drug users and polluted by human waste. Bandits had earlier robbed David Amaya of his money and cell phone, leaving him only the clothes he was wearing. David Amaya didn't even have any identification cards on him. At first, he said he was a Mexican national, and then, as if he summoned a distant memory, he told Border Patrol agents that he was a U.S. citizen born in Chicago. Freed Iranian journalist, 'proud' son dream of a reunion . Border Patrol agents checked out his story and indeed found his birth certificate -- as well as his mother, in Wisconsin. Complicating the drama are the conflicting parental accounts about the son's relocation to San Luis Potosi, Mexico, where he was raised by paternal grandparents. Kathy Amaya said her estranged husband took the boy to Mexico without her permission and wouldn't return him. She mailed letters to the grandparents in San Luis Potosi, but those notes were never answered, she said. More recently, she searched for her son under the name ""David Amaya"" for years on social media, but she never knew that he was using her maiden name -- Barrick -- as part of his full name, a common practice in Latin America. Her estranged husband, who hasn't made himself available for comment, told their son that his mother abandoned him at an orphanage because she didn't love him, David Amaya said. But after the father put the boy in the grandparents' care, ""he almost never spent time with me,"" David Amaya said. At one point, the mother nearly lost all hope of ever seeing her son again, unable to make contact with him, she said. When the couple divorced in 1986, they didn't settle on child custody, so police were unable to help her, she said. David Amaya will spend the holidays with his mother in Wisconsin for a month, and he hopes to speak with his father about what really happened to him when he was 2 or 3 years old. Then David Amaya will return to San Diego to build a new life. He was a drummer in a band in Mexico and now likes San Diego's proximity to Mexico and its cultural atmosphere. Moreover, he's taken a liking to a local church pastor, Freddy Rivas, who has helped Amaya with food and shelter since the Border Patrol released him this month. Amaya was recently baptized at the church. While in Mexico, he married and divorced, and his ex-wife and their two children live in Mexico City. As he makes a new home in San Diego, he says he will recount his life by writing a book.","Mother tell her long-lost son: ""I love you and ... and I'm not going to let you go.""

"(CNN) -- A computer problem that grounded United Airlines flights across the country has been repaired, the airline announced early Saturday. The Chicago-based airline blamed the computer malfunction on ""a network connectivity issue"" Friday night. The problem, ""was resolved through troubleshooting procedures and restored at midnight,"" wrote United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart in an e-mail to CNN. ""The airline issued a waiver policy permitting customers on affected flights to cancel or rebook their itineraries without penalty,"" Hobart said. ""United apologizes for the disruption caused to travelers at affected airports and is re-accommodating travelers where necessary."" The computer malfunction brought United's system of scheduling departures, reservations and processing passengers to a halt at airports across the United States. The problem left passengers stranded for hours in grounded planes, airport lobbies and security lines. Michael Goldenthal, who was on an airplane at O'Hare when the problem occurred, said it became apparent something was wrong as the flight was taxiing. ""We were on the runway when the pilot came on the P.A. and said they had lost contact with the company computer system which measured the weight of the plane,"" Goldenthal said. Goldenthal said the aircraft taxied around for nearly an hour and then returned to the gate for additional fuel. But passengers were not allowed to get off. Long lines of people could be seen at airports in cities across the country, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver. Many passengers sat on the floor as they waited. Chris Hou and his wife, Jennifer, became stranded at Los Angeles International Airport while waiting on a connecting flight to Denver. ""We're pretty easy going people. We travel a lot. We understand that problems happen,"" Chris Hou told CNN. ""I just think there would be a little more information. All they say is 'we have a computer problem.' By the time you get to hour three, it gets a little frustrating."" Hou told CNN less than a hour later that he and his wife were about to board a plane to Denver.

"Paris (CNN) -- A man suspected in a series of attacks in Paris, including a shooting Monday at a daily newspaper, had written a ""confused"" letter accusing journalists of being paid ""to make citizens swallow lies with a small spoon,"" Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters here Thursday. The letter was given to police by an acquaintance of the suspect, Abdelhakim Dekhar, Molins said. ""He attacks capitalism and the dehumanization of the suburbs,"" the prosecutor added. Dekhar, who was born in 1965 and had lived in London for several years, was arrested Wednesday night after the acquaintance identified him as the man whose picture had been circulated by police as the suspect in the shooting on Monday of a 23-year-old photographer's assistant at the daily newspaper Liberation in Paris. The assistant, who was shot twice in the chest, was recovering Thursday in a hospital, Molins said. The acquaintance, who met Dekhar 13 years ago in a London restaurant where they both worked, told police that he had accompanied Dekhar early Wednesday to an underground parking garage in the northwest suburb of Bois Colombes, and that Dekhar had told him he wanted to kill himself, Molins said. That evening, investigators found the man inside the garage -- ""half-conscious"" after ingesting medication -- and took him to a Paris-area hospital, Molins said. Investigators also found a letter typed by Dekhar expressing his last wishes and medication, but did not find the weapon used in the shooting, Molins said. DNA samples linked him to bullet shell casings and a car that was seized Monday, the prosecutor said. That car had been carjacked near the Societe Generale bank towers in the Paris neighborhood of La Defense. Authorities also suspect that last Friday, Dekhar broke into BFMTV, a television news channel, and threatened journalists with a gun before fleeing. His record includes having served two four-year terms for other offenses, Molins said. Authorities were studying a 15-year-old psychiatric report on Dekhar to try to understand his motivation.

"(CNN) -- Poor Steve Ballmer. The burly Microsoft CEO, who announced Friday that he will retire next year, has been the victim of some unfortunate timing. When he took over leadership of Microsoft in 2000 Ballmer had to follow iconic co-founder Bill Gates, who had built the software titan into the most valuable company in the world. Then Ballmer was blindsided by the swift rise of Steve Jobs and Apple, whose iPod, iPhone and iPad led a mobile revolution and made Microsoft appear slow and out of touch. On a more positive note, Ballmer has been credited more recently for re-imagining the company's core product with the bold Windows 8 operating system and leading a 2013 revival of Microsoft's once-flagging stock. Under his reign, Microsoft has a mixed record of success with its consumer products. Here's a look at some of the company's more notable hits and misses of the Ballmer era. Hits . Windows XP -- This version of Microsoft's desktop operating system was released in 2001 and used on more than 80% of PCs at its peak. The software also showed surprising staying power: Many IT managers, frustrated by the buggy Microsoft Vista, downgraded to the older but more reliable XP. Today, 12 years after its launch, XP still runs almost 39% of the world's desktop computers. Xbox -- Launched in 2001, the venerable video gaming console and its successor, the Xbox 360, have sold more than 100 million units. Some blockbuster games, such as the ""Halo"" and ""Gears of War"" series, are available only for the Xbox. Its Kinect system was hailed as a step forward in motion-control gaming, while Xbox Live, Microsoft's online multiplayer gaming network, now has more than 46 million members worldwide. Microsoft will release its next-generation console, the Xbox One, in November. Bing -- Ballmer in 2009 introduced Microsoft's Bing search engine, which drew praise for its attractive visuals and predictive-text features that produced search suggestions before users were done typing queries. It won't challenge Google's dominance any time soon, but Bing has emerged as a credible rival. It has gradually increased in popularity and now commands almost 18% of the U.S. search engine market. Windows Phone 7 (and 7.5) -- With this launch in late 2010 and early 2011, Microsoft completely rebuilt its mobile operating system from the ground up by adding a more intuitive interface, better social-networking tools and a high-def screen with colorful ""live tiles."" It was a radical move for a company that for years had been playing it safe. Misses . Internet Explorer 6 -- This version of Microsoft's widely used desktop browser was roundly criticized for its security flaws and lack of support for modern Web standards. Zune -- In 2006, Microsoft finally launched its answer to Apple's hot-selling iPod. But the clunky Zune line of portable media players never caught on, and by late 2009 their market share had dropped to 2%. It didn't help that at midnight on December 31, 2008, all of Zune's 30GB models froze up for a day -- a problem with the way the device's internal clock recognized (or didn't recognize) leap years. Microsoft put the Zune out of its misery in 2011. Vista -- Released in 2007, this successor to Windows XP was an immediate dud. Critics complained about its cost, sluggish speed, restrictive licensing terms and how Vista aimed to discourage the copying of protected digital media. One survey of corporate users found only 8% said they were ""very satisfied"" with the operating system. Stung by the reaction, Microsoft rushed out Windows 7 less than three years later. Surface tablets -- Again, Microsoft found itself chasing Apple, this time with a belated attempt to dethrone the market-leading iPad. Launched in October 2012 -- more than two years after the original iPad -- the Surface tablet was Microsoft's first attempt to integrate its new Windows 8 operating system with its own hardware. Despite some good reviews, the Surface hasn't clicked with consumers. Microsoft earned only $853 million from the Surface between its launch last fall and the close of the company's fiscal year -- a small fraction of iPad sales revenue during that time. Said AllThingsD, ""That's a particularly sad showing for the tablet, given the blustering smack-talk with which Microsoft launched the device.""","Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced Friday that he will step down in the next 12 months .

"(CNN) -- The runner-up in Honduras' presidential election says she will not recognize the outcome and is demanding a vote-by-vote recount. The strong allegations of fraud by Xiomara Castro, the wife of ousted former President Manuel Zelaya, raise the possibility of political unrest in the Central American country. The leftist candidate says her political party has uncovered evidence of fraud and vows to challenge the triumph of ruling party candidate Juan Orlando Hernandez. With 80% of votes counted, electoral officials declared Hernandez the winner with more than 35% of the vote, placing him six percentage points ahead of Castro. Castro had been mostly quiet since election night. Friday was her first public appearance since the vote. ""I am here, once again before you, to reiterate that we have found countless evidence of the disgusting monstrosity with which they are robbing the presidency from our people,"" she said. International election observers have said there were some irregularities, but in general agreed that the elections were transparent. The U.S. State Department noted that the Organization of American States and European Union observers reported a clean election. ""We support the ongoing work of (electoral officials) and the political parties to finalize the results and resolve inconsistencies in a transparent manner and urge the Honduran people to continue to demonstrate their respect for rule of law and peaceful, democratic processes,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Castro said she would not back down from her challenge and accused the ruling party of rigging the system to help their candidate. ""We reject the legitimacy of any government that is the product of this suffocating assault,"" she said. Following her husband's ouster in a 2009 coup, Castro founded the Liberty and Refoundation Party (LIBRE) on a platform that carried on her husband's projects and found herself at the top of some polls. A victory by Castro would have been a remarkable comeback for Zelaya back to the presidential palace, even as a first husband.","Electoral officials declared ruling party candidate Juan Hernandez winner .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The opposition Syrian National Council called Monday for urgent military intervention on the part of the international community to help halt the grinding violence and protect civilians. The SNC, an umbrella group that represents the opposition abroad, also demanded a no-fly zone across Syria and a ""speedy operation"" to arm the Free Syrian Army, a group of fighters made up primarily of defectors from forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. ""Sympathy messages are no longer enough. ... What is needed is actions on (the) ground and decisions and measures against Assad's gangs,"" the group said in a statement after a meeting in Turkey. Its demands came as diplomatic efforts to resolve the yearlong Syrian conflict faltered. The U.N. Security Council took up the issue of Syria again on Monday, with the United States and Britain pushing for quick action on a resolution and Russia warning against a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach. All sides called for an immediate end to the violence even as an opposition group said that dozens of women and children in the city of Homs had been stabbed and burned to death over the weekend. ""There is a growing understanding of the need not to talk to each other on the basis of take-it-or-leave-it, but bring the positions together and be guided not by the desire of revenge, of punishment, who is to blame and so on and so forth, but by the basic interests of the Syrian people,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters after the Security Council met. ""And this requires an immediate end of violence as the number one priority."" Lavrov invoked the specter of Libya, whose government was overthrown last year after U.N. Security Council resolutions authorizing NATO enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect innocent civilians led to widespread bombing of Libyan military forces. He cited reports that members of al Qaeda are responsible for fomenting violence in Syria and pointed to the Free Syrian Army as also being to blame. Still, the Russian foreign minister described a cease-fire in Syria as ""an absolute must."" He said he hoped weekend meetings between al-Assad and Special Joint Envoy Kofi Annan ""would succeed in developing some ideas which would make it possible for us to agree on how to stop the bloodshed immediately, how to stop the fighting, irrespective of the source of the violence."" For others at the meeting, the fount of the violence was not in doubt. ""The United States believes in the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all member states, but we do not believe that sovereignty offers a grant of immunity when governments massacre their own people,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters. She described as ""cynical"" the Syrian army's ""fresh assault on Idlib and continuing its aggression in Hama, Homs and Rastan,"" even as al-Assad was meeting with Annan in Damascus. In an acknowledgment that Russia and China last month vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have condemned al-Assad and called on him to step aside, Clinton called on ""all nations, even those who have previously blocked our efforts,"" to speak with one voice in calling for the killings of civilians to end and a transition to democracy to begin. Valerie Amos, U.N. humanitarian chief, described as ""clear deadlock"" the situation on Syria at the world body. ""It's not an ideal situation,"" she told CNN. ""But we have to keep working on this, we have to keep trying, because there are people who need help."" Amos said she recently returned from a refugee camp across Syria's border with Turkey, where she spoke with displaced Syrians ""who were very angry about what's happening in Syria and being abandoned by the international community."" Asked whether Annan had left Damascus empty-handed, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was ""far too early"" to draw that conclusion. ""He has said that he has made proposals. Clearly, all concerned will be taking some time, but I hope not much time, to react to those proposals,"" he said. The U.N.'s Human Rights Council met Monday in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss an International Commission of Inquiry report issued last month. The report said Syrian government officials were responsible for ""crimes against humanity"" committed by security forces against opposition members. Monday's diplomatic efforts came in the wake of continuing bloodshed. In the Syrian city of Homs, at least 45 women and children were stabbed and burned to death, opposition activists said Monday. The massacre took place late Sunday, activists said. The killings occurred in the Karm al Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network. The Adawiya neighborhood of Homs was also involved, according to the London-based Syrian Network for Human Rights. Children were stabbed to death in front of their mothers, and women and girls were sexually assaulted and then shot, the network said. Hadi Abdallah, a spokesman for the opposition Syrian Revolution General Council, said the attacks occurred after ""Syrian forces and thugs"" stormed homes. Life and death under Syria's military onslaught . The LCC called the killings a ""massacre orchestrated by the regime"" of President al-Assad. Another 108 people were killed Sunday nationwide, activists said. The LCC reported Monday's death toll was 44. Tuesday will be a day of mourning across Syria, the LCC said. ""Stores should remain closed; work, universities, and schools should not be attended; and streets should be blocked,"" the group said in a statement. ""We urge everyone to participate, even if only symbolically, by wearing black ribbons, raising black flags, or wearing black."" CNN's Arwa Damon: Activists say no optimism for peace . After sunset Sunday, a live video feed online from opposition activists showed bodies from the Homs massacre. The Syrian Network for Human Rights described a scene of brutality, saying the men were separated from the women and children and ""systematically tortured"" for hours. Some were sprayed with gasoline and set afire, while others were shot, the network said. Activists recovered 31 bodies, the human rights network said. Others were burned, and still others were taken to unknown locations by security forces. Syrian state-run media said the bodies shown were killed by ""armed terrorist groups,"" which the government blames for the violence in the nearly year-long uprising. ""The terrorist armed groups have kidnapped scores of civilians in the city of Homs, central Syria, killed and mutilated their corpses and filmed them to be shown by media outlets,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. On Monday morning, state-run TV aired a montage of telephone calls reportedly from Homs. The anchor listened to callers denouncing the killings and blaming the Karm al Zaytoun massacre on what they called anti-government armed gangs. The state-run news agency reported that 15 army and law enforcement ""martyrs"" targeted by armed terrorist groups were buried Monday. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But the majority of reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. CNN's Hala Gorani: Witness to killing fields . The United Nations says more than 7,500 have died in the past year, and at least one activist group says more than 9,000 people have been killed. A funeral was held Monday for American Marie Colvin, one of several journalists killed in Homs, on Long Island, New York. She and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed February 22 in a shelling attack on a makeshift media center in the neighborhood of Baba Amr.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- When I was a child in Adelaide, Australia, I loved games with clear, unambiguous rules; puzzles that were tough but fair; and the clean, abstract, simplicity of numbers and symbols. So it is perhaps not surprising that I have been drawn to mathematics for as long as I can remember. For much of my childhood, playing with mathematical problems, equations and facts was one of my favorite activities; I even went so far as to compete in international high school mathematics competitions, racing to solve tricky sets of problems in a few hours. I still remember the realization in college at Flinders University in Australia that mathematics was not just an abstract game of symbols, but could be used as a tool to analyze and understand the modern world. Why are some statistics trustworthy and some not? Why are some investment strategies sound, and others risky? How come a computer can search the entire internet for you in a matter of seconds, but cannot read a printed word if it is even just slightly distorted or blurred? How come our modern array of satellites can tell millions of drivers their location with amazing accuracy, but cannot correctly predict the weather a fortnight into the future? Knowledge of mathematics can answer these questions, and make the world comprehensible and orderly rather than mysterious and capricious. Once I saw the power of this knowledge, and the satisfying feeling when everything ""clicks"" and one sees a confusing problem resolve itself into a clear solution, I was hooked for life. I wanted to use mathematics to explore and understand as much of the world as I could. In 1992, when I was 16, I moved to the United States to start working on my Ph.D. at Princeton University in New Jersey. I alternated my time between Australia and the United States for many years, but by 1999 I had a permanent job in the United States, on the faculty of UCLA's Department of Mathematics. By 2002, I was married to an American -- we were married in the United States -- and last year I became a U.S. citizen (while retaining Australian citizenship). Of course, my life is more than just my work. I am a husband and a father and a proud citizen of two countries; my homeland of Australia and my adopted country here in the United States. I identify with them both. I enjoy a good meal, a good vacation or a good movie, much as anyone else would. But mathematics is both my profession and my hobby, and the place where it seems I am best able to make a contribution; so if I had to answer the question ""Who am I?"" I would have to say, ""a mathematician."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terence Tao .","When he was a boy in Australia, Terence Tao says, he loved games, puzzles, math problems .

"(CNN) -- Long before the heady, rock star-like run for the White House, before ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the pillbox hats, Marilyn's ""Happy birthday, Mr. President,"" Camelot and the limo drive through Dallas, John and Jackie Kennedy were a young newlywed couple much like any other newlywed couple -- with one notable difference: By the time of their wedding they were, in a sense, already superstars. The pair had appeared on the cover of LIFE magazine mere months before their wedding, in July 1953, perched on the sloping deck of a sailboat off of Cape Cod, both of them smiling, windblown, emphatically New England-y, beside the cheeky headline, ""Senator Kennedy Goes a-Courting."" They were both from prominent, monied, influential families, and they were frequently, together and apart, featured in what are still occasionally called the ""society pages"" of major newspapers. When they married in Rhode Island on September 12, 1953, it was national news. LIFE magazine sent photographer Lisa Larsen, then in her late 20s, to cover the highly publicized event. Her photos from the occasion offer not only a solid before-and-after record of the nuptials, but a surprisingly intimate chronicle of one of the most high-profile American weddings of the 20th century.

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities Wednesday announced an indictment charging three men in connection with a massive international cybercrime scheme that involved creating and distributing a virus that infected more than a million computers in the U.S. and Europe. Justice Department and FBI officials in New York announced the indictment against a Russian, a Latvian and a Romanian who officials say caused tens of millions of dollars in losses. Most of the losses, officials said, resulted from the theft of personal bank account information. The defendants allegedly created and distributed the ""Gozi"" virus that had targeted the banking industry for several years beginning in 2005. All three defendants are in custody. One of them, the alleged creator of the virus, Nikita Kuzmin, 25, is from Moscow but was arrested in the United States in November 2010. In November, Latvian Deniss Calovskis, 27, who allegedly wrote the computer code, was arrested in his home country. In December, Mihai Paunescu, 28, was arrested in his native Romania, accused of enabling cybercriminals to distribute the Gozi virus and other malware. U.S. authorities are seeking the extradition of both Calovskis and Paunescu. The indictment was unsealed and announced in the Southern District of New York by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer and George Venizelos, Assistant FBI Director in New York. The officials said more than a million computers were infected across Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and Turkey. In the United States, more than 40,000 computers were infected, including many at NASA. Prosecutors say Kuzmin pleaded guilty to other computer fraud charges in May 2011. If convicted on the new charges, including bank fraud conspiracy, he could face up to 95 years in prison. Calovskis could receive up to 67 years in prison if convicted, and Paunescu could receive up to 60 years in prison if he is convicted in a U.S. court.","Three men are accused of creating, distributing ""Gozi"" virus in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- As a campaign for Saudi women to defy the driving ban in their country heats up, one of the country's leading female bloggers was detained in Riyadh on Thursday after a woman she was with did just that. Eman al-Nafjan, who tweets as Saudiwoman and has been one of the leading voices urging Saudi women to get behind the wheel on October 26, was in a car that was stopped by police in Riyadh, the capital, as she filmed another woman driving. Al-Nafjan, who has been calling on Saudi women to upload videos of themselves driving in different parts of the kingdom, spoke exclusively with CNN on Friday about what happened. ""Yesterday, I kept getting called by women I know who wanted me to film them driving,"" she said, explaining how she spent most of the day filming and uploading information about those excursions online. ""When I was live tweeting, some people took it into their heads that we had to be stopped,"" said al-Nafjan, ""and then called the police."" She was live tweeting as they were pulled over, posting a picture of the police car that had pulled alongside them, accompanied by the message, ""Police stopped us."" That tweet set off a flurry of concern and supportive messages from Twitter users throughout Saudi Arabia. Al-Nafjan initially felt queasy about being stopped, but her unease and worry quickly dissipated when she saw that ""police were smiling and easygoing, and their attitude was very positive. The police were really nice to us."" They were taken to the Olaya Police Station, where she and Azza, the woman who had driven her, waited. ""The vibe I got was that they didn't know what to do with us. We could see the police going around, calling, waiting,"" explained al-Nafjan, who says she believes this is a sign that the driving campaign has gained momentum and that many in Saudi Arabia, including officials, think the time has come to allow women to drive. October 26 campaign . Women who want Saudi Arabia to lift a de facto ban on their driving have launched an online campaign urging Saudi women to stage a demonstration by driving cars on October 26. ""There is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so,"" reads part of an online petition on the Oct26driving.com website. Even though the website was reportedly blocked in Saudi Arabia shortly after its creation in late September, the petition has so far garnered more than 14,000 signatures. No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior and Justice ministries for comment on the issue. Just a day before being stopped by police, al-Nafjan posted online another video she filmed of a woman driving for two hours throughout Riyadh. They were not stopped, and the video shows male drivers waving to the women and supporting them with the thumbs-up sign. That video quickly went viral, eliciting numerous comments. While most were supportive, there was also a negative reaction -- at one point, a hashtag was created calling for al-Nafjan's arrest. Al-Nafjan says her husband was also made to come to the police station Thursday. When al-Nafjan was finally told to come inside, she was asked if she knew that what she did was wrong. ""I said it's not wrong,"" said al-Nafjan, who was then told to sign two documents: one stating that she would no longer get into a car with a woman driving, and another that she would no longer film women driving. When asked if she would adhere to those agreements, al-Nafjan said that ""it doesn't matter whether or not I go out. This isn't about me. This is a people's movement. This is not about me. This is about many women."" Al-Nafjan, who was in extremely high spirits while speaking via phone with CNN, said the experience with police ultimately bolstered her confidence in the movement she is helping spearhead. She said the lack of her arrest and her and Azza's quick release show that this campaign is making a difference and things are beginning to change. Other challenges to driving ban . The issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been contentious. And while such demonstrations are extremely rare, they have been staged at least twice before. In May 2011, prominent Saudi women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif was arrested after uploading a video to YouTube that showed her driving in Saudi Arabia. She spent more than a week in jail and quickly became a hero to numerous women in her country and across the Middle East. In a sign of just how influential she had grown, on June 17, 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia, emboldened and inspired by al-Sharif's ordeal, participated in the ""Women2Drive"" campaign by getting behind the wheel, defying the ban and driving throughout the streets of their cities. In 1991, a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through Riyadh. After being arrested, many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces. Recently, a leading Saudi cleric made headlines when giving an interview in which he warned Saudi women that driving could cause damage to their ovaries -- a comment that was widely interpreted to be a reaction against the October 26 driving campaign and how popular it had grown. In addition to prohibiting driving, the country's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts, working, traveling and going to school without the express permission of a male guardian. Saudi Arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler, King Abdullah, who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women's rights. In January, he appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women had been chosen for the country's top consultative body. In 2011, he announced that women could run for office and vote in local elections in 2015. And in 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female Deputy Minister.","Blogger Eman al-Nafjan tweets about filming a female driver, talks about their detention .

"(CNN) -- Philippine President Benigno Aquino III declared a state of national calamity as the death toll from Typhoon Bopha, the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, continued to climb. At least 540 people have died since the typhoon, known locally as ""Pablo,"" hit Tuesday, the Philippines' emergency management agency said Sunday, while nearly 1,100 are reported injured. Another 827 people have been reported missing, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. Aquino's declaration of a state of national calamity will allow local governments to access funds for rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts in their areas, the official Philippine News Agency said. The declaration will also help national and international aid reach stricken communities, and will mean price controls are imposed on basic goods, the news agency said. The U.S. Defense Department said it will assist in relief operations, with an emphasis on reaching communities isolated by infrastructure damage. Among the worst hit areas was the poor, remote Compostela Valley region on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where thousands of flimsy houses have been ripped to shreds. Scores of people died, many them swept away in flash floods that roared down from the hills. The epicenter of the devastation appears to have been in New Bataan, a town about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Montevista and close to the steep mountains. The flash floods hit it head-on Tuesday, washing away families huddled in their homes and soldiers stationed in a compound in the town. On Friday, Aquino visited the area, as well as Boston, in Davao Oriental, to see the destruction for himself, the PNA said. He ordered government agencies to speed up relief efforts and the reconstruction of roads and bridges to help much needed supplies and assistance reach the affected areas. ""I have Mindanao on my mind, especially the number of people missing. I am hoping these people will be found safe and sound,"" Aquino was quoted as saying ahead of the visit. The president said he was saddened that some families would spend the holidays in evacuation centers because their homes were destroyed. Rescuers struggle to aid Philippines storm victims . Large parts of New Bataan and many of the people who lived there are now buried under mud, fallen trees and rubble, said Arnaldo Arcadio, an emergency response program manager for Catholic Relief Services, a humanitarian group. ""The mood is really gloomy,"" he said Thursday after visiting the town, where 90% to 95% of the houses are believed to have been destroyed or damaged. Residents who evaded death now lack food, shelter and, most of all, drinking water, since the nearest source is 5 kilometers away, according to Arcadio. ""They are just trying to survive,"" he said, noting that the knee-deep mud in many places made it difficult to get around, with several areas of the town completely inaccessible. Bopha raked across Mindanao and several other Philippine islands before moving off into the South China Sea. The powerful typhoon brought savage winds that uprooted entire banana plantations in low-lying areas, and relentless rain that unleashed torrents of rocks and mud down the mountainsides where shanty-dwelling miners dig for gold. Preemptive action was taken in northern Mindanao, expected to feel the full force of the typhoon, but in the end it was the less prepared communities of Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental, further south and east, that bore the brunt.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A Turkish prosecutor has openly accused police of interfering with a high-level corruption investigation. ""Court orders have not been carried out and there has been open pressure on the judicial process from both the chief prosecutor's office and from the police force, which is supposed to carry out the decisions of the courts,"" Muammer Akkas said in a Thursday statement. He spoke one day after three Cabinet ministers resigned their posts, after their sons were arrested or temporarily detained in an anti-graft sting, semiofficial news agency Anadolu reported. One of them, Urbanization and Environment Minister Erdogan Bayraktar, went further than the other two, not just resigning his Cabinet position but also calling on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to step down. Turkish media reported a possible second wave of detentions as imminent late Wednesday, but the raids did not materialize. Instead, an apparent deadlock within the judiciary emerged as Akkas, the prosecutor, issued his statement saying the judiciary was under the heel of the government. Akkas accused police and prosecutors of ignoring a decision of the courts by refusing to carry out more raids. In a televised statement, Chief Istanbul Prosecutor Turan Colakkadi fired back, saying that Akkas had mishandled the investigation and leaked information to the press, leading to his removal from the case. Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan and Interior Minister Muammer Guler, whose sons were also arrested in the investigation, also resigned Wednesday. Erdogan accepted the resignations, Anadolu reported. The sons were detained in a roundup that included the head of a public bank, several bureaucrats and high-profile businessmen. The roundup came after a two-year investigation by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office into allegations of corruption including money laundering, gold smuggling and bribery. Many analysts see the corruption investigation as a public fight between Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamist preacher living in self imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Erdogan has repeatedly said since the corruption arrests began that international organizations with branches inside Turkey are trying to destabilize the country. ""This country has never been and never will be the operational space of international organizations. We will not allow the interest lobby, the war lobby, the blood lobby to carry out an operation under the guise of a corruption operation,"" he said Sunday. Turkey is expected to hold local elections next year, and some analysts see the raids as a test of Erdogan's grip on power, especially after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests. Demonstrations continued Thursday, with marches in Istanbul, Mersin, Izmir and Adana, where police used water cannons on marchers. Protesters chanted: ""The ministers are thieves,"" ""Everywhere is bribery, everywhere is corruption,"" the ""Public will clean this dirt"" and the ""Prime Minister is a thief."" The Prime Minister had been expected to reorganize his Cabinet, because some of his ministers will be running for office in March. Late Wednesday, he announced a Cabinet shuffle, naming 10 new people. After the announcement, former Culture Minister Ertugrul Gunay tweeted his displeasure. ""I wish success to the new members of the Cabinet. I will suffice to say for now that I don't find the choices for Justice and Interior positions suitable,"" he wrote Wednesday. One day later, he and two other members of parliament -- Izmir MP Erdal Kalkan and Ankara MP Haluk Ozdalga -- were sent to Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party's disciplinary committee with a request for their dismissal. According to Anadolu, the party announced it is taking this disciplinary action against three of its members for ""disparaging remarks"" against its ideals and core policies. Gul Tuysuz reported and wrote from Istanbul. Talia Kayali and Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: Protesters march in Istanbul, Adana, are met by police .

"(CNN) -- I was a young man fresh out of police college when I suddenly found myself stepping over fingers, arms, legs and other body parts. We suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the Umkhonto we Sizwe, the militant arm of the African National Congress. It was a beautiful spring evening in Johannesburg, South Africa, but the stench of death and destruction was once again hovering over the nation. We suspected that this man accidentally blew himself apart as he was planting a bomb at one of Johannesburg's most popular shopping malls -- a mall where my mother shopped and my friends and I played miniature golf. I was the first officer on the scene, and that experience was seared into my memory. Across town from the mall, blacks were living in squalor. There were great divisions in our country. Many of my colleagues were terrorizing black families who were crying out for the rights of simple human dignity: the simple right to have a vote in the country of their forefathers, the simple right to drink water from the same faucet as a white man. Rights they had been denied by an oppressive, minority-white apartheid government. I witnessed officers charging a group of black people with a van and then taking their money. The people were just playing a game by the side of the street. The police themselves were also divided. During those years, if a white officer had a black officer with him as a crew member and went to stop by his house, the black officer would usually have to wait in the police van. My maid, a wonderful Zulu lady, was shocked when I not only invited a black sergeant into my home but offered him a cup of tea from the same kind of cup I would use. Read more about Lochner's experiences in South Africa . The racial and tribal tension in South Africa was a powder keg ready to explode into full-scale civil war. Civil wars have destroyed many African nations, and South Africa seemed destined for the same fate. Nelson Mandela was a human rights lawyer and freedom fighter, and to some white South Africans and others, he was a terrorist. Mandela was the Marxist friend of the Communist Soviet Union, from where he received training and weapons to wage his struggle. The Rivonia trial, as it became known, ended in 1964. Mandela was sentenced to life in prison for his participation in several bombings around South Africa; some were deadly. A saint, Mandela was not. Then a miracle was born. It was February 11, 1990. The white apartheid president took the whole world by surprise when he announced the unconditional release of Mandela from prison. We were shocked. It was completely unexpected. After his release, South Africa suffered some of its most severe political violence as Mandela and the white minority struggled to find a peaceful transition to a ""one man, one vote"" system. A few months later, I moved to Dallas, Texas. I remember constantly being on the phone with my family and hearing about the terrible violence going on. How will you remember Mandela? Share your story on CNN iReport . The white minority that was enjoying power under the apartheid system was terrified. Many were convinced they would be brutalized and driven out like those in neighboring Zimbabwe. It was during this time that Mandela's strength and humility became evident. On May 10, 1994, with the entire world watching in awe, Mandela was peacefully and joyously inaugurated as South Africa's first post-apartheid president. Friends and former colleagues said voting lines had never been so long in South Africa. It was just a really exciting time. Mandela had the daunting task to unite groups of people who had been at war with each other for decades. How could he succeed? How could Mandela overcome decades of hate, decades of distrust? How could Mandela father a nation that would soon be called a miracle, a rainbow nation? Amazingly, Mandela's 27 years in prison became the catalyst to his success. As Mandela wrote in his autobiography, ""A Long Walk to Freedom,"" he was suffering at the hands of his captors, and he became determined to study his enemy. He wanted to understand them. He wanted to know them. Mandela did the unthinkable. He befriended his white Afrikaner prison guards. He learned their language and studied their culture. Mandela even went to church with them, and his heart was changed. Mandela's friendship with his prison guards was sincere and endured to his death. So what was it that allowed Mandela to miraculously unite a nation? Mandela forgave the Afrikaners. Forgiveness. Yes that same forgiveness Jesus expressed when he cried out to his Father while hanging on a cross: ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."" Forgiveness removed the shackles of hate, and Mandela knew that mutual forgiveness was the key to national reconciliation. Mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of South Africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce. To this day, I am so passionate about the role forgiveness played in Madiba's life. I remember so clearly how I had to personally take steps to overcome the ingrained apartheid mentality in South Africa. Even as a little boy, I noticed how the church custodian always sat in the back. I never experienced the kind of suffering Mandela did, but I can relate to him as I know he must have had to work hard at overcoming his prejudices, too. He came to embrace rugby, which was a symbol of apartheid and despised by blacks. South Africa had been banned from international rugby for decades, but suddenly found themselves back on the international scene after the 1995 rugby World Cup was awarded to South Africa. He united the entire nation behind their rugby team, and their World Cup victory became one of the most storied events in the history of international sports. Mandela chose a symbol of hate and turned it into a symbol of hope. As seen in the movie ""Invictus,"" Mandela insisted on forgiveness as the key to uniting his beloved country. He went from political prisoner to people's president. How did he learn to forgive? This is something worth exploring. An officer I knew, who was one of those involved in charging black people with a van, started seeing things differently. He apologized for treating people the way he did simply because they were black. ""I realize that the way I was treating people was wrong,"" he said. I have forgiven the terrorist who bombed the mall in Johannesburg that day. I have no animosity or bitterness. Just think about it. What would you do if you were treated the way Mandela and his people were? It's almost like a miraculous, supernatural transformation had taken place in Mandela's life, and consequently, in the whole nation. Forgiveness freed Madiba, and forgiveness freed his country.

"Madrid (CNN) -- The youngest daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos won't appeal preliminary charges against her for alleged financial crimes, and will give unprecedented testimony before a judge on February 8, a court and her lawyers said Monday. Princess Cristina will be the first direct member of Spain's royal family to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime, Spain's royal household confirmed. Her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, the King's son-in-law, already faces preliminary charges in the same case. He testified last February about his business dealings and the alleged diversion of public funds that have been at the center of a judge's investigation. The princess and her husband, through their legal teams, deny any wrongdoing. Judge Jose Castro is leading the investigation at a local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. In April, the magistrate brought preliminary charges against the princess in this case, but they were dropped in May after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. But Castro continued his investigation and on Tuesday, in a 227-page order, again leveled preliminary charges against her. Before that, prosecutors said publicly they would oppose the renewed preliminary charges. On Tuesday, the princess's lawyers vowed to appeal again to a provincial court. But in recent days, there was a sudden change of position. In a prepared statement Saturday, the princess's lawyers said that an appeal of the preliminary charges would have ""collateral effects"" for the princess by dragging out the process and that she had decided to ""appear voluntarily"" before the judge, who initially set March 8 as the court date. On Monday, the judge told reporters that given the new situation, he felt obliged to move up the court date, to February 8. That's a Saturday, and, as with her husband last year, authorities think a weekend day is a better time for the court appearance in central Palma de Mallorca, given the intense media attention, a court spokeswoman said. The case centers on Urdangarin's nonprofit foundation, which obtained public contracts from regional governments to stage sports and tourism events. The judge is investigating whether some of those funds were diverted for private use. The judge wants to question the princess about alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a company she had with her husband. He seeks to determine how much knowledge or participation the princess may have had in this company's activities, according to the court order last Tuesday. The preliminary charges eventually could be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion. Urdangarin, an Olympic medalist in handball, was granted the title of duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina in 1997. The fraud scandal has created unprecedented problems for Spain's popular royal family and kept the country riveted. There have been open calls for the King, 76, to abdicate in favor of his son, Crown Prince Felipe, 45, who is seen as untouched by this and other scandals. But the royal household has said the King does not plan to abdicate. In April, the royal household revealed that it had asked the government in February 2013 to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities. The government approved the law in September.","Princess Cristina, King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, won't appeal preliminary charges .

"(CNN) -- In death, Paul Walker has found more fame and exposure than ever before. The announcement that Universal Studios plans to donate a portion of the ""Fast and Furious 6"" DVD, Blu-ray and digital sales to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide, is just the latest instance of the continued buzz that has surrounded the actor since he and a friend were killed in a car crash on Saturday. Autopsy blames impact and fire for actor Paul Walker's death . The attention has run the gamut from the charitable to what some have viewed as exploitative. According to E!, fans were not happy when a commercial for the Cool Water fragrance featuring Walker -- who served as as a spokesmodel for the men's cologne -- was run in the United Kingdom during a soccer match hours after the actor's death. Michele Scannavini, chief executive officer of Coty Inc., which owns the Cool Water brand, issued a statement of apology. ""We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul's family, friends and fans around the world,"" he said. ""We are working quickly to suspend all of our ads featuring Paul out of respect to his family and friends. We apologize for any upset that may have been caused by those that were aired subsequent to his death."" Similarly Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf cafÃ© in Los Angeles found itself in hot water after actor Jason Biggs tweeted a question as to whether their tip jars marked ""Fast and Furious"" and ""Varsity Blues"" ""seem exploitive [sic] and in poor taste?"" ""This is completely inconsistent with our brand values and the jars have since been removed,"" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to the site Gossip Cop. ""Our thoughts and condolences remain with the many friends and family of Paul Walker during this difficult time."" Denver D'Rozario is a marketing professor at Howard University who has conducted research on the use of images of dead celebrities in advertising and marketing. Companies know that a celeb has a built in fan base that can be marketed to, he said. He said the family of the celeb plays a key factor in the discussion regarding the ethics of money making post a star's death. The family is ""the No. 1 stakeholder that has to be consulted,"" he said. Some celebrities, such as Paul Newman who died in 2008, have authorized that certain endorsements be allowed after their death. The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise has been wildly successful. ""Fast & Furious 6"" earned $238 million domestically and $788 million worldwide. Production of ""Fast & Furious 7,"" which was filming in Atlanta at the time of Walker's death, has been halted. On Wednesday, the studio released a tribute video to Walker. Walker played ex-police officer Brian O'Conner in the series, a role which helped catapult him to celebrity. But nothing compared to the attention being given him and his career now. The Internet has paid homage, if it can be called that, with a series of memes, some of them respectful and many of them not. The Twitter account 4AutoInsuranceQuote sent out multiple tweets (including to @CNNShowbiz) that questioned whether Walker was insured at the time of the accident and encouraged getting a quote for coverage. The London Evening Standard reported on the outrage following those tweets with at least one Twitter user calling for the company's social media manager to be fired. The Twitter acccount links to the 4AutoInsuranceQuote website, but CNN was unable to reach anyone at the company via the provided phone number. When Jezebel editor Erin Gloria Ryan tweeted (and later deleted) ""Why couldn't it be Scott Walker :-( #wisconsintweets"" referring to the Republican Wisconsin governor who this summer was criticized for an abortion law he signed, she was roundly slammed. Ryan apologized via Twitter including saying ""No excuse. It was dumb. I'm sorry."" Writing for New York Magazine's ""The Cut,"" Ann Friedman noted that discussion about the actor and the tragedy was inescapable after the crash -- as was the grieving. 5 reasons why we loved Paul Walker . ""Over the course of the next two days, nearly every heterosexual woman in my life mentioned the death of the Fast and the Furious actor,"" she wrote. ""They were low-level distraught, as if they'd lost a distant cousin or ex-boyfriend from way back, but their sadness was palpable."" Such grief could easily calculate to robust sales for the DVD of what may become Walker's last ""Fast & Furious"" film if the studio decides to scrap the latest production, given the sensitivities of showing an actor who died in a car crash in a film about driving fast cars. Estates of countless stars including Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson saw boosts in sales of items associated with them after their surprising deaths. That could also mean a boost for Walker's charity, Reach Out Worldwide, which offers assistance around the world during disaster. According to 2011 tax information from the organization, 35% of the funds raised went to the charity's programs. The rest of the funds are used for administrative and fund raising costs. D'Rozario said the success of any sales attributed to Walker is up to those who supported his career. ""Ultimately it's all about the fans,"" D'Rozario said. ""The fan base is not going to go away just because a celebrity dies.""","Paul Walker's fame has increased since his death .

"Washington (CNN) -- In her grilling on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reiterated a frequent assertion in the Obamacare sales pitch --- consumers have options when shopping for insurance plans on the health care exchanges. ""The 15% of our neighbors and friends who are uninsured have affordable new options in a competitive market,"" Sebelius said in her testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. After apology, Sebelius subpoenaed over Obamacare website . But a CNN analysis found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state, and many Americans are discovering that they have very few options. Fact-checking Obamacare claims . In West Virginia and New Hampshire, for example, residents shopping on the exchanges can only purchase plans from a single company. Contrast that with the state-operated exchange in New York which has 16 participating companies, an average of five per county. Wisconsin, which is on the federal exchange, has 13 participating insurers, although some counties in the state have only one. So what prices are people finding in states where only one insurer lists on the exchange? In states with many insurers on exchanges, plans vary far more dramatically in price. Some are more expensive but many are significantly cheaper. Big difference state-to-state . In Pennsylvania, for example, with 10 insurance companies listed on the exchange, a 27-year-old can buy a silver plan from Highmark for $133.83. Highmark is the same insurance company that operates on the West Virginia exchange. A 27-year-old in West Virginia, meanwhile, can purchase silver plans ranging in price from $193.93 to $250.69 a month. In New Hampshire, that same individual can browse silver plans costing from $236.46 and $238.62 a month. These prices do not include offsets from subsidies. Individuals are also able to view less expensive bronze or catastrophic plans on the exchanges (the latter only being available for buyers under age 30) as well as more expensive gold plans. Platinum plans, which offer the highest level of coverage, are not available in West Virginia or New Hampshire according to the data on Healthcare.gov. Your options under Obamacare . A Department of Health and Human Services report released in late September asserted that an average of eight insurance companies would be participating in states on the federal exchange; try telling that to a resident of New Hampshire or West Virginia with their single choice. In general, urban and suburban counties with higher populations tend to have more insurers, while it's common for rural counties to be limited to one or two options. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer, compared to the 117 million in counties with more than five insurers. There is no data to indicate how many of those people will be shopping for insurance in the exchange. Special coverage: Health care in America . Rural areas suffer; not profitable . Rural areas are, on the whole, less desirable to insurance companies because they offer a smaller pool of potential customers. It is also more difficult for insurance companies to make a profit in rural counties because there are fewer health care providers and lack of competition allows regional hospitals to charge more for services. Yet, the number of insurance companies operating on the exchange is often a fraction of the number that actively sells insurance in the private market. In Wyoming, for instance, there are six companies that actively sell insurance but only two advertise plans on the exchange. In North Carolina, nine companies sell plans, but only two of those are on the exchange and only one of those sells statewide. Some companies are choosing not to participate in certain areas because they are waiting to see how the implementation of Obamacare plays out in the first year. It remains to be seen how many will ultimately sign on despite the problems the exchange has faced so far. The technical problems facing the website are, to some extent, drawing attention away from the shortage of insurance options. But some lawmakers are now calling on the administration to address the issue. A group of senators and congressmen from Arkansas wrote to Sebelius on Monday, expressing their frustration at the lack of options in their state and calling on her to release information about her department's correspondence with state officials. ""Before the law's implementation, state insurance officials claimed that there would be as many as eight carriers offering coverage in the individual market,"" wrote Senator John Boozman and Representatives Tom Cotton, Steve Womack, Rick Crawford and Tim Griffin. ""However, a consumer logging on to the AR Health Connector website will find, at most, four plans offering coverage, while 60% of the state will have no more than two provider options."" ""This is a disappointing, if unsurprising, failure of the reforms promised by Obamacare, which will mean decreased competition among plans, leading to higher costs, higher premiums, and less consumer choice."" Lawmakers: Arkansas families pay more . Arkansas is one of six states that operate exchanges in partnership with the federal government. The authors of the letter say that families in Arkansas now have to pay 100%-600% higher premiums under Obamacare. New York site lists bakery, mechanic for Obamacare help . A lack of options is certainly having an effect on insurance prices -- how much is still up for debate. Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation looked into the link between options and price, and found that in counties with more than five insurers, the average premium was about $20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer. Cox specifically compared the pricing available for a 40-year-old individual shopping for a silver plan. The Obama administration, for its part, has discounted the significance of this analysis. ""Under the Affordable Care Act, nearly all consumers (about 95%) will have a choice of two or more health insurance issuers, often many more,"" HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement to CNN, ""and nearly all consumers (about 95%) live in states with average premiums below earlier estimates."" Peters added that, ""In the marketplace, new rating and benefit rules along with bans on pre-existing exclusions allow insurers to compete for customers based on price and quality."" This information is also reflected in the September HHS report. What else can go wrong with Obamacare? Comparisons difficult to make . Premiums on the federal exchange are lower than those previously projected, but comparing rate changes in any given state is tricky, according to Cox, who co-authored a report for Kaiser in September outlining the changes that individuals in the private market could expect. Because all plans must offer an expanded set of benefits under the Affordable Care Act, they cannot be compared straightforwardly to plans offered in the past. Another reason why insurance options and prices vary so significantly from region to region has to do with how state governments choose to use their rate review authority, which was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. In some states, officials can prevent insurance companies from raising rates if they believe those rates are unjustified, and some states have used this authority to keep prices down on the exchanges. Other states, such as Florida, have acted to formally reject their rate review authority, thereby preventing any state influence in prices. State laws can also play a role in promoting insurance competition. In Arizona, for example, there is a state requirement that prevents insurance companies from cherry-picking which counties they offer PPO plans in, according to Arizona Department of Insurance spokeswoman Erin Klugh â€” although they can selectively offer HMO plans. Because of this rule, Arizonans across the state have multiple insurers to choose from. CNN's Adam Aigner-Treworgy and Jessica Stanton contributed to this report .","CNN analysis shows Obamacare choices, premiums vary from state to state .
In West Virginia and New Hampshire, consumers only have single choice .
Rural areas have fewer Obamacare options because of sparse population, providers .

"(CNN) -- In 2010, the American Board of Internal Medicine suspended or revoked the certification of 139 physicians for giving away or soliciting examination questions for a board review company. CNN subsequently reported on residents preparing for certification examinations using questions reproduced by people who took previous exams. Residents taking the American Board of Radiology medical physics examination wrote down test questions (""recalls""), and shared them with future examinees. Dermatology residents also reproduced questions (""airplane notes"") minutes after the certification examination. Question reproduction violates copyright policies. However, some physicians CNN interviewed said that recall use is like preparing with a study guide since questions are used to confirm underlying knowledge, not rote memorization of answers. Consistent with this view, only 43% of medical students surveyed at a UK medical school thought it was clearly wrong to convey information about test content to another student examinee. However, such behavior should create concern for the quality and integrity of patient care. Medical students who cheat on examinations are more likely to falsify information in a patient's medical record. Patients want physicians to be certified based on a valid assessment of the knowledge necessary to provide high-quality care. If patients cannot trust the knowledge that board certification is expected to measure, the medical profession loses the public's confidence. Moreover, certification should indicate the ability to care for patients, rather than efficient test preparation. Notably, although patients express a highly favorable view of certification, it is not required by most hospitals and health care plans. The distinction between cheating and guided study is crucial. Old test questions and recent examination experience are routinely used to create study materials. The American College of Physicians produces a summary of concepts and information most likely to appear on the ABIM certification exam. The content of this summary is shaped by post-examination residents. The First Aid series for medical students is updated annually based on examinee reports. Using a focused study guide created based on examinees' input bears some similarity to studying from practice questions that may have been on a recent examination. The difference lies in the detail and specificity of the information conveyed. Nevertheless, from the public's perspective, both practices represent ""shortcuts"" for examination success. Drivers of dishonest behavior . Cheating in education and sports creates unfairness between ""competitors."" Unlike performance-enhancing drugs, the use of Ritalin and Valium to improve test performance is not considered cheating. Difficulty concentrating and anxiety are perhaps considered abnormal disadvantages from which examinees deserve sparing. The unfairness perspective is reflected in a dean's observation in the CNN report -- since use of reproduced questions is so pervasive, this norm does not cause any unfair advantage. Unfortunately, 57% of surveyed medical students claimed that others' cheating had unfairly disadvantaged them. The difficult content of the radiology physics exam is one reason for the use of reproduced questions. For most physicians, the exhaustive study of biochemistry and pharmacology is a rite of passage based on knowledge rarely used. In fact, the physicians interviewed by CNN said that the necessity to demonstrate proficiency of arcane material unimportant for practice was a root cause of residents using reproduced questions for exam preparation. In other words: Test content that medical students view as unnecessary for clinical care makes them more likely to cheat. Of course, a desire to succeed underlies the decision to cheat: 40% of 665 medical students across six schools admitted to doing something unethical to avoid a poor evaluation. However, fear of failure is not generally sufficient -- social context is important. Academic dishonesty is strongly connected to peer behavior. Many medical students believe certain forms of cheating can be justified if the motivation is to assist friends. Of 2,459 medical students from 31 schools, 41% had cheated during high school and 59% thought that cheating was too common to eliminate. When misconduct becomes an established norm, as it apparently has among certifying residents, it does not become acceptable, but can be difficult to stop. How to limit unethical behavior . The use of reproduced questions for board examination preparation threatens medicine's integrity and public trust. Moreover, indisputably dishonest behaviors are far too common among trainees. Punishments and honor codes do little to reduce academic dishonesty in medical education. Responses to unethical acts have also been hampered by divergent opinions about the severity of specific violations and appropriate punishments. However, peer behavior has a strong impact on ethical decisions. The image of dermatology residents writing down test questions together in a restaurant suggests this has become an established norm. Trainees find it more acceptable to engage in unethical conduct when their friends are as well. The best way to limit unethical behavior is to embed academic honesty into institutional cultures, perhaps through role models and curricula that emphasize the respect that a virtuous professional may earn. Case-based ethics training may improve moral reasoning, although the impact on conduct is unknown. Examination content must be highly relevant for the patient-care activities that will be endorsed. Esoteric questions suggestive of academic hazing should be eliminated. Not reusing test questions would reduce the incentive to reproduce questions in verbatim form, but might jeopardize the consistency of passing standards, while increasing expenses. In the end, successful certification must demonstrate that physicians are vested with the trust of both their peers and the public. Sponsoring rigorous examinations that cover material critical for patient care will bolster what the profession provides patients. Ultimately, the integrity of the medical profession and the faith that patients place in physicians demand the highest moral standards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Ruhnke.","Doctors were disciplined for sharing examination questions .

"(CNN) -- It is easy to be confused by the welter of headlines and selective excerpts that have been leaked from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' upcoming book ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War."" (I have not yet read the book.) Gates asserts President Obama lacked conviction about his own decision to put more troops in harm's way in Afghanistan. As described in the Bob Woodward summary of the book in the Washington Post, Gates writes that the Commander-in-Chief was ""skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail."" He also condemns what he saw as ""suspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior White House officials — including the president and the vice president."" In one meeting about Afghanistan in particular, Gates said that after listening to the President, he concluded, ""The president doesn't trust his commander, can't stand Karzai, doesn't believe in his own strategy and doesn't consider the war to be his."" He is particularly brutal about Vice President Joe Biden, who Gates asserts ""poisoned the well"" against U.S. military leaders, and who he says ""has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."" Gates also doesn't mince words about top officials like former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon or key Obama adviser Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. At the same time, Gates commends Obama's intelligence and character, his decision to go after Osama bin Laden, and in his concluding chapter, according to the New York Times account of the book, as far as the President's overall Afghanistan strategy he writes, ""I believe Obama was right in each one of these decisions."" He also has strong praise for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mixed in with his lengthy expressions of frustrations with others in the administration and in Washington, notably the dysfunctional crowd on Capitol Hill. Compounding the apparent dissonance within Gates' narrative, there is another conflict to reconcile. Gates is a man known for bipartisanship, discretion and keeping his own counsel, and yet he is blasting a sitting President that he served, and revealing details of private and off-the-record exchanges without apparent regard for confidentiality, and in a manner that is sure to be politicized. It might be easy to dismiss his account — as some, seeking to defend the President, already have done on Twitter and in the blogosphere — as so contradictory as to not be credible. But that would be a mistake. Gates is one of the most distinguished, most widely respected national security public servants the U.S. has produced in half a century. In addition to running the Pentagon for both Obama and President George W. Bush, he ran the CIA and was Deputy National Security Adviser. He is exceptionally intelligent, committed and few can rival his experience or perspective. No, the contradictions in Gates' comments do not invalidate them. Rather, they illustrate important facts. In the first place, they reveal Washington and policy making as they are: Very little is clear cut, and personalities and politics play as big a role in key decisions as do any objective analysis of the merits of any decision. People — including presidents and secretaries of Defense — can be contradictory bundles of good and bad qualities, advocates for decisions that are both right and wrong. But on a deeper level, Gates' narrative is conflicted because he is writing about issues, such as Afghanistan, in which there were literally no good answers. Perhaps, in the very first phases of our engagement there, there was a ""best possible path."" We could have gone in, sought retribution for 9/11, attacked and killed our attackers and then gotten out. The problem became our desire to reduce in a much more sweeping and lasting way the threat posed by al Qaeda, the Taliban, extremists and instability in the region. This led to a long-term commitment in a place where there were no long term ""solutions"" — indeed, the threats posed by extremists are problems that cannot be ""solved;"" they can only be reduced and managed, never eradicated. But once we were into Afghanistan for anything but retaliation, we ended up debating two deeply flawed alternatives. Either we committed significant numbers of troops indefinitely — which would be costly, politically unpopular and unlikely to succeed in doing anything but moving terrorists elsewhere. Or we would pull out and the situation would return to the chaos the region, becoming once again a Petri dish for terror. As it turned out, we will end up demonstrating at great cost that neither approach could work. Gates and the military were right that only an extended military presence could control our enemies on the ground. Biden and his allies were right that getting out sooner would have the same effect as getting out in the medium term. And both will soon see that in Afghanistan — as in Iraq today and in our War on Terror more broadly — our costly investment and that of our brave troops will not change the region for the better. Indeed, right now it looks as if Afghanistan and Iraq are likely to end up worse than we found them, and the sway of al Qaeda and extremists more widespread and powerful. All this is because before Gates and Obama got into office, a fundamentally wrong decision was made by their immediate predecessors. We overreacted to 9/11, seeking not justice but to change the world and a volatile region in ways that were beyond our capabilities. And the battles and tensions revealed among good men and women in the Gates account and others being written of the recent past are the legacy of that watershed error. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: New book by ex-Defense Secretary Gates criticizes Obama, others .

"Rome (CNN) -- Amanda Knox again protested her innocence in the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher Tuesday, in a written statement to the Italian court hearing her retrial. In the statement, presented to the appeals court in Florence by Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, the American student insisted she had done nothing wrong. ""I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,"" Knox said. The retrial began in September without either Knox or her former boyfriend and fellow accused Raffaele Sollecito in court. Both have maintained their innocence. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read aloud Knox's statement Tuesday. In it, Knox said ""there is no scientific proof that puts me in the crime scene"" and that Kercher's killer had left enough traces behind for the court to be satisfied it was not her. ""It is impossible to identify and destroy genetic traces and leave others. I was not there,"" she said. Knox said that her behavior after Kercher's murder was discovered, when she could have left the country but instead stayed to help the investigation, also demonstrated she was not involved in the killing. She complained of her treatment by police, saying she had been lied to, threatened and hit by them. Knox also told the court that she had endured psychological pressure during her first murder trial, in 2009, because she was called many things. ""'I was called a wolf in sheep's clothing, a rapist, a thief, psychotic... Try to imagine your 20-year-old daughter being called all these things,"" she said. ""I am not psychotic. I don't have a split personality."" Knox's ex at retrial: Life has been a nightmare . Acquittal overturned . Sollecito and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Their convictions were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" But Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying that the jury that acquitted them didn't consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini last month said both Knox and Sollecito should be convicted and handed a 26-year sentence for homicide, with an additional four years for Knox for slander. Knox's lawyer called Tuesday for her ""acquittal verdict... to be confirmed."" A lawyer for Kercher's family, Francesco Maresca, gave his closing remarks Monday. ""No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,"" Maresca said. The defense for Sollecito may present its arguments next month. Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle after her acquittal and has been living there since. She says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Guede has been convicted and sentenced for his role in Kercher's murder. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: Kercher family lawyer: Meredith forgotten while defendants write books, earn money .

"London (CNN) -- A second former personal assistant to Nigella Lawson made drug use allegations against the celebrity chef Tuesday as she testified at her own fraud trial. Francesca Grillo and her sister, Elisabetta, are accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. Francesca Grillo said she had not seen Lawson take drugs. But she told the Isleworth Crown Court in west London she had seen repeated evidence of drug use. ""At the beginning of 2012, there were a few episodes when she came down and she had white powder in her nostrils,"" she said of Lawson. ""She brushed it off and said it was makeup."" Asked by her defense lawyer if that could have been the case, Francesca Grillo said it was ""too white to be makeup."" Lawson told her that when she was working on a new book, she needed to stay up through the night, Grillo said. The former personal assistant told the court that Lawson would have a runny nose for long periods of time, even in summer, and that she would have mood changes, going from very nice to ""absent and grumpy."" She also described finding rolled-up bank notes with traces of powder in Lawson's handbag and seeing the remnants of cannabis use around the house. Grillo said she spoke to Lawson's two children about her cannabis use. They told the former personal assistant that Lawson had trouble sleeping, so she would go downstairs and smoke with them because it helped her sleep. Elisabetta Grillo, in her testimony last week, also told the court that she had seen indications of drug use by Lawson but had never seen her take drugs. In her own testimony this month, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, ""I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court last month, he backed off that claim. In the e-mail, which the defense shared with the court at a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Lawson lied in court, former aide says . Luxury goods . The two sisters are accused of spending large sums on luxury goods on company credit cards they were supposed to use for household expenses. Both sisters deny the fraud charge. Questioned by the prosecution about her spending Tuesday, Francesca Grillo insisted that Lawson had approved her purchases. She admitted to having dresses, handbags and shoes from designers including Miu Miu, Christian Louboutin and Gucci. The prosecution outlined the alleged top 50 unauthorized transactions by Grillo, including trips to New York and European cities such as Paris, Milan, Berlin and Antwerp, with significant purchases in exclusive stores. In response, Grillo variously said that the trips were authorized by Lawson or that she couldn't remember the trip, who she went with or whether she was even on the trip herself. She suggested that other members of the family could have used her card. Grillo said that Saatchi had shouted, banged his fists on a table and threatened to ""destroy"" her when he accused her of fraud this summer. ""You don't cross Charles Saatchi, everyone knows that,"" she said. Grillo said it felt ""like a personal vendetta"" against her. Elisabetta Grillo also said Lawson had authorized all her personal spending.

"(CNN) -- It's been the same story, 10 weeks running: Better luck next time, pal. Could Friday turn the tide for the twice-weekly Mega Millions drawing, which has rolled over 20 times now since the 45-state lottery generated a winner? As always, it's anybody's 1-in-259 million guess. Those are the odds of winning Friday's estimated $400 million jackpot. Although five tickets in Tuesday's drawing matched the first five numbers, netting $1 million each, none of the tickets purchased for Tuesday's measly $344 million jackpot matched all six numbers. Mega Millions estimates Friday's jackpot will be the fifth-largest in North America. And while it is a whopping big pile of money, Friday's projected jackpot wouldn't qualify to move into the ultra-tony neighborhood occupied by the record draw. That $656 million jackpot, won on March 30, 2012, was split by winning tickets in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.

"(CNN) -- The lucky winner of an auction for a George Zimmerman painting selling for about $100,000 could see the artwork personally delivered by the former neighborhood watchman himself. The eBay posting originally stated that the portrait would be sent via expedited shipping from Sanford, Florida, but in a response to a buyer who wanted to drive from Arkansas to pick up the painting, the terms changed. ""The price it is at now has well exceeded my $.99 minimum; therefore, whoever wins within the Continental United States, will receive this painting delivered by me personally,"" the reply says. The 18-by-24-inch canvas features a blue, waving American flag with the words, ""God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all"" emblazoned across it. The auction was posted Monday at a starting bid of 99 cents and is scheduled to end Saturday. As of Wednesday, 108 bids had been logged for the painting, ratcheting the price up to $110,100, but it appears some bids were retracted and it was selling for $97,500 in the afternoon. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., says George painted the piece. ""Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,"" the item description reads. ""My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors."" Zimmerman appears to respond directly to at least 11 questions sent about the item, although the site states more than 900 inquiries were made. ""Just wanted to tell you we all love you and stand behind you. You have so many people on your side I hope you know that!"" a commenter wrote on the eBay page. ""Thank you so much for the words of kindness and support,"" reads the answer. ""I do know how many great Americans are still here, I run into at least 3-5 a day that go out of their way to tell me the same. Your Friend, GZ."" ""I am truly sorry our government run liberal media and justice department persecuted you they (sic) way they did,"" another comment says. ""God Bless you. You have nothing to apologize to me for. The system is broken, an innocent man should not spend one second without his God given liberty, solely because a small sect of uneducated loud mouths. We must fix it. If we can't fix it together, then we owe many people a sincere apology,"" the reply says. Photos were added to the auction Tuesday, including one of a grinning, flannel-clad George Zimmerman holding the painting. The artwork has stirred up controversy online and in art circles. As of Wednesday, at least a dozen other listings could be found on eBay with their own takes and variations of Zimmerman's posting, including one with the American flag bearing the words, ""Not for a coward to hide behind."" Consultant and art appraiser Jane Cofer said it appears there was skill required in producing the work. ""It's not the worst painting I ever saw. He was certainly able to capture some shadows in the flag and some movement,"" Cofer said. Those who are driving up the price are likely not art lovers, but more likely Zimmerman's supporters. ""America seems to love to support their causes, to put money towards them -- to support that,"" she said. Online, a flurry of tweets and Facebook postings deride the painting's originality and even accuse Zimmerman of plagiarism. A Democratic Underground blog post points out if one were to zoom in and Photoshop one of its own photos of the American flag, which the site purchased from Getty Images, it would look very much like Zimmerman's painting. When contacted, the site administrator said he thought it was ""humorous"" Zimmerman had picked an image the site had used for its T-shirts long ago. ""Nor are we accusing Zimmerman of photoshopping his artwork. If you do a Google image search for 'US flag' or 'American flag,' that particular image comes up near the top of the results. So it appears to us that Zimmerman found the image on Google and used it as the basis for his painting,"" Dave Allsopp said in an e-mail. ""Since most of the people who visit our website are critics of George Zimmerman, we thought they would find it amusing that he'd used a photograph that we had once used on our T-shirts."" The listing states that the painting is a signed original and that it was made using donated household latex paint. Zimmerman has been in and out of the spotlight since his July acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. Last week, Florida prosecutors said they would not charge Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in November resulted in his arrest. Previously, he was stopped several times for speeding. Zimmerman told a judge last month he had $150 to his name and was $2.5 million in debt. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Winnie Dunbar contributed to this report.","NEW: Lister, who claims to be George Zimmerman, says he will personally deliver art .

"(CNN) -- He's a huge, strangely dressed man who sneaks into people's homes at night, then yells, ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" at the top of his lungs. Who wouldn't be afraid of Santa Claus? ""A 2-year-old knows what a regular person looks like, and Santa ain't it,"" author Nancy Watkins says. Authors Denise Joyce and Nancy Watkins know at least 250 toddlers who are. The two recently published a book called ""Scared of Santa: Scenes of Terror in Toyland"" that shows photos of children on St. Nick's lap -- most of whom are desperate to leave. The project started at the Chicago Tribune, where both Joyce and Watkins work. They asked readers to send in their photos and got an overwhelming response that's still going strong. Last week, the Tribune's ""Scared of Santa"" Web site had 2 million hits. An agent saw the journalists' success and proposed the stocking-stuffer book. Now anyone can enjoy the chapters labeled ""Titans of Tears,"" Misery Squared"" and Watkins' favorite: ""Santa Claus Is Comin'... After You."" ""We still laugh at [the book],"" Watkins said. ""I'll open it up and be like, 'Oh you remember that one!' It just cracks me up.""  See photos of screaming toddlers » . CNN talked with Watkins about her love of photos of scary Santas and why she never forced her son onto Santa's lap. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: How did the original idea for this book come about? Nancy Watkins: It started out as a reader interaction feature for the holidays. We put the call out to readers to have them send us their photos. We were not the first people to do this, I must confess. The Palm Beach Post did it first, and then they shared the idea with other papers in this organization we belong to. So that's how it came about. And we got a great response in print. Then it really took off when it went online, and it's still going pretty strong at the ChicagoTribune.com/scaredofsanta. CNN: Do you have any favorite photos or parts of the book? Watkins: Well, you know, that would be like choosing a favorite child. But in general, I think Denise and I both love the photos of the scary Santas. We have a whole chapter devoted to the Santas you would just not want to run into in a dark alley, and you can see why the kids would be scared of those guys. Especially the vintage ones. I love the ones that are from the '50s and '60s, and we've got some that go as far back as the '20s. Those are just really fun to look at and see that being scared of Santa just goes back many, many decades -- probably to the dawn of time.  Watch Watkins talk about the book » . CNN: What do you think is so scary about Santa? Why do kids react that way? Watkins: Well, I think you need to look at it from the perspective of a 2-year-old. I think 2- to 4-year-olds are most likely, first of all, to completely freak out over Santa. When they're younger, everyone looks weird and new and different, and you just never know what's going to make a kid cry at that age. But a 2-year-old knows what a regular person looks like, and Santa ain't it. Santa is huge, and he's got that crazy white suit, and he's got the huge white beard and the hat. And he's sitting on this great big throne. He's very intimidating to a real little kid. So he can be the nicest, sweetest Santa on the planet, but I can see why a 2-year-old would have a meltdown. Especially, you know, after waiting in line for an hour, and there's kind of already a lot of noise. And then this guy starts yelling, ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" at them. CNN: It said in the book that you never made your kid sit on Santa's lap. Is that true? Watkins: I never forced him to. We tried every year. We would wait in line, and he was always up for it, always wanted to go see Santa, until we got right up to his turn and then forget about it -- he was not going anywhere near him. And I just thought, well, OK, I wasn't going to force him. Now looking at these pictures, I think, well maybe if I had just done it one time, it'd be funny to have the picture now. Because these families keep these photos -- they might have some of the nice, smiley pictures too, but I think it's these crying pictures that really become heirlooms. You know, they bring them out, and everybody laughs at them. And as the kids get older they have to suffer through it, but then they kind of grow to appreciate it, too. CNN: Do you have any like that of you? Watkins: My mom scrounged around trying to find some, and we did find one, but I was not scared. I was very happy to be seeing Santa at the bank. I don't know if they still do that, but back in the '60s you could go see Santa at the bank. And my brothers and I were just as happy as can be because we knew where the toys were coming from, and we were going to be polite to Santa. CNN: Have you had any complaints from Santas or Santa associations? Watkins: Well, for the book, Denise actually interviewed the president of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas, and so we got some comments from them. No complaints from Santas -- at least not yet. We did hear from kind of a grouch on Amazon.com who objected to our laughing at and making money at the expense of crying children. But not yet has anyone come up to us and said, ""I am scarred for life because I was afraid of Santa."" So I'm pretty sure that most of these kids are over it in about five minutes.","Journalists Denise Joyce and Nancy Watkins wrote ""Scared of Santa""

"(CNN) -- The Gettysburg Address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last. Length: A little over two minutes. Message: Stay the course of a difficult war. If Democracy won't work here, it won't work anywhere. Short enough to comfortably fit into a social media status box, and shared in its entirety hundreds of times every day, according to recent data from Facebook. Memorable phrases are quoted even more often. It has been 150 years since President Abraham Lincoln got up in front of thousands of people in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to dedicate the Soldiers' National Cemetery at a turning point in the Civil War. His words are some of the most memorable in American history, forever stamping our collective minds with ""four score and seven years ago,"" and ""all men are created equal,"" and of course a ""government of the people, by the people, for the people."" Some of this wasn't really his coinage, but we'll get into that later. Politicians portrayed themselves differently in Lincoln's day, seeking to give a more powerful kind of impression, said Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""If you did that today, people would think of you as somehow flowery and old-fashioned and ... why are you doing that?"" The modern trend is for leaders to ""play the folksy card,"" Baron said, portraying themselves as ordinary Joes and Janes who are exactly like you in every way -- except for the fact that they are hoping to achieve a position of immense power. Baron said the last president with an ""oratorial"" style -- on the whole -- was probably John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 100 years and three days after the delivery of the Gettysburg Address. We still remember Kennedy's delivery of lines like, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett's marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Lincoln had no speechwriter. Today, most politicians have at least some help preparing their words. Everett had been the main attraction, but Lincoln's speech started picking up steam afterward and seemed to ""go viral"" in the manner of its day. Newspapers wrote about the speech. In some cities, people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech, and key phrases were incorporated into Lincoln's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death. Newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address . Sound familiar? Cornelius said overall, Civil War-era America was a consumer-driven society that had a few things in common with our Internet-saturated world. One can only imagine the tweets that would have been written about such a speech in modern times. ""OMG. Lincoln just said in two minutes what Everett tried to say in two hours. #NailedIt #Boom"" Today, children learn the address in school, especially in Northern cities, and documentary guru Ken Burns is asking people to record themselves saying the speech from memory. Ken Burns: Learn the Gettysburg Address by heart . People also share the quotations on social media. Certain phrases seem to stick out, and Facebook numbers show which ones we like to share. We found that people in some states, like Delaware, were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others. Here is a nonexhaustive rundown of some of the most popular phrases in the speech, in order of appearance. 'Four score and seven years ago' Pretty much everyone knows this part of the Gettysburg Address, even if they think a score is just something from sports. But no, in this case a score is 20 of something. Here, a span of 20 years. This line is a bit of an inside remark shared with the audience, believed by most historians to be a reference to Psalm 90:10, which most people of the day would know is an allusion to the human lifespan. ""The days of our years are threescore years and 10,"" says the psalm. ""And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."" Cornelius said Lincoln used such phrasing as a subtle reminder that the nation was only a youthful 87 years old. Lincoln felt the United States was setting an example for the world, and he didn't want the experiment in democracy to fail. ""He's a little bit worried that the nation might die at about the average lifespan that a human would,"" Cornelius said. ""He's putting forth straightforward political terms in a poetic way."" That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said. 'All men are created equal' More clever wordplay is at work in this famous quotation. ""In his call for democracy and equality, (Lincoln) doesn't mention slavery, but everyone knew that was what he was talking about,"" Cornelius said. See what he did there? This phrase can be interpreted as both an allusion to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and also as a not-so-subtle jab at the institution of slavery. Little doubt exists that Lincoln opposed slavery, and in fact loathed it, Cornelius said. Slavery was at the heart of the war. Lincoln struggled with how to go about eliminating it, and had to be convinced by legal thinkers and abolitionists that he had the governmental power to tackle it. 'These dead shall not have died in vain' Something about this part of the speech may be touching a nerve somewhere. This part was the second-most-mentioned phrase in the entire speech, rivaling ""four score and seven years ago"" in popularity, despite the fact that it's not a particularly well-known part of the Gettysburg Address. But Lincoln can't take full credit for this phrase, Cornelius said, because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war. It speaks to a need for soldiers' deaths to mean something, if they must occur -- a timeless desire we echo today. How tech preserves the Gettysburg Address . ""This is always a problem in warfare. Why should any other people die? There is always a percentage of the population that will make that argument at a certain point. Lincoln's contrary point was that they died defending you. They felt so strongly about the right of the cause. They felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind. You should continue on and further this effort."" 'This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom' This phrase was mentioned by many readers who commented on this story. For some, it has become a point of political contention due to the presence of the words ""under God."" There are five versions of the speech, and one of them omits those two words. Obama stands out from the Gettysburg crowd . Another slightly earlier portion of the speech was also frequently cited: ""It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us."" The takeaway there is persistence in the face of adversity. 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people' This famous phrase, as well as the few words immediately before and after it, got lots of mentions on Facebook. Baron pointed out that anything at the end or beginning of a speech is probably automatically more memorable. It doesn't hurt if a speech is structured to enhance this effect, either. It's such a beloved word grouping that numerous people have borrowed it, massaged it and restated it with a slightly different twist, like a game of telephone in an era without telephones. Cornelius said historians trace this part back to Daniel Webster, a senator and U.S. secretary of state before the Civil War. Webster's words were, ""The people's government, made for the people, made by the people and answerable to the people."" It was later repurposed by the abolitionist minister Theodore Parker, who talked about a ""government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people."" Even Lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address, Cornelius said. Cornelius said the key to the power of this phrase is in its skillful use of repetition. The point of ""people"" is driven straight into your mind by its frequent mention. That's why so many people have recycled it over the years. Fast-forward to today, and we're still sharing all the phrases above. Cornelius said one can see the endurance of Lincoln's speaking legacy by taking a stroll into the Lincoln library's gift shop, where you can pick up your very own T-shirt with a Lincoln quotation on it. One recently released item has the whole text printed on it. Lincoln's speech endures like few others, especially in our everyman-politician era. Maybe that's why people can't help but post the speech on social media, 150 years after the fact. Why do you think the Gettysburg Address endures today, and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the United States?

"(CNN) -- At this year's International Consumer Electronics Show, the televisions will be bigger, the watches smarter and more attractive, and the homes and cars more connected. CES, which kicks off next week in Las Vegas, is a giant technology trade show that mixes dozens of major tech companies with hundreds of scrappy startups. The big names show off their most recent lines of gadgets alongside eye-catching prototypes of future devices that may or may not ever make it into stores. Smaller companies fill booths with oddball gadgets and robots, plus more mundane fillers like phone accessories. Here's a peek at what to expect from 2014's first big technology conference. A gadget for every limb . There are devices to go on wrists, faces, waistbands and necks. Wearable-technology makers will push even harder to make these small gadgets go mainstream after a year of mostly awkward and misguided offerings. The main focus has been on smartwatches, but so far products like Samsung's Galaxy Gear have combined only half-baked hardware and clunky designs. Google Glass is not yet available outside a select group of beta testers, but it already has something of a reputation problem. One area that has managed to find a profitable niche is fitness tech. Wearable devices like the FitBit keep it simple by tracking steps, calories and other workout stats, and by synching collected data to smartphones. Fitness wearables overlap with health tech, with devices that track vital signs and help doctors monitor patients from far away. But it's still unclear if companies will be able to transition sporty and geeky wearables into legitimately fashionable designs that will appeal to mainstream consumers. Major tech companies at CES can be particularly tone-deaf when it comes to appealing to women. (An area of the show floor dubbed ""Mommy Tech"" is an ominous sign.) The intelligent house . It's not enough for phones and wristwatches to be smart. Some of the same technology that goes into wearable devices (tiny sensors and low-power wireless connections) is being used to make homes more connected as well. The promise of a smart home that saves energy and can be controlled from a phone has been around for several years, but the industry was still figuring out how to best make the various devices speak to each other. This year there will be even more vendors shilling home gadgets, but outside of home security systems -- a smart thermometer like Nest or a code lock -- it's not clear whether regular consumers are itching to wire up their entire homes so that they can dim the lights from halfway around the world. The home-automation industry still has some issues to untangle before it connects with mainstream homeowners. Conflicting communications standards, like ZigBee and Z-Wave, are fighting for supremacy. A handful of major companies want to own the entire connected-home ecosystem, such as Lowe's with its Iris system. Other smaller companies such as SmartThings see a future where various bits and pieces of a home from different vendors can work together. TVs are still a thing . Televisions continue to be a dominant product at CES, with major companies like Sony, Samsung, LG and Sharp trying to make screens bigger, higher-resolution and splashier than ever before. There will be gimmicky and extremely costly features, like curved screens, and other new form factors that will appeal only to the most well-funded audio/visual fanatic. Last year, 4K was the new ultra high-resolution buzzword, but the volume of 4K content continues to be minimal. (Expect to see some new 4K compatible cameras and camcorders.) Google gave the format a boost this year when it announced it is working on a way for the new devices to stream 4K content from services like YouTube without gobbling up all the bandwidth. The new streaming format, called VP9, will be demonstrated by major TV manufacturers at CES. Other TV trends will include OLED screens, Internet compatibility in the form of improved TV operating systems, and gesture controls. Many TV companies have eased off of 3-D televisions, which still haven't caught on despite years of hype. Cars connect with smartphones . Driving and smartphones may not mix now, but car companies are still looking into ways to safely combine the two. Detroit's annual auto show doesn't take place until later in January, but the tech developments inside the cars will make an early appearance at CES. It takes much longer to design and produce a new car than it does a smartphone, tablet or computer. That means such in-car technology as dashboard computers often feel out of date as soon as they're released. Some car manufacturers are working around this issue by adding compatibility for iOS and Android devices and including safe new ways to interact with the systems while keeping eyes on the road. Cars are new territory for the smartphone operating-system battle, with Apple and Google each angling for prime placement inside of popular car brands. For example, Audi is expected to announce next week a partnership with Google to bring Android systems to its cars. In-car information and entertainment systems are a minor feature when compared to what's going on inside some vehicles. Major car companies, universities and tech companies like Google are all working on automated-driving features. Fully self-driving cars are still a ways off, but early features that will let vehicles communicate with other cars, gather data about your driving patterns and take over in stop-and-go traffic are beginning to appear. The games people play . CES is not the biggest show for video-gaming news. The major console releases came out just ahead of the holiday rush, and game shows E3 and GDC don't take place until later in the year. But some smaller gaming products will bring a bit of fun to CES this year. Mobile gaming is a huge market, so look for smartphone- and tablet-compatible accessories and controls, motion sensors and fun add-ons that communicate with your devices over Bluetooth. Valve's SteamOS gaming platform is expected to have a big presence at CES, while cult darling Oculus Rift -- a virtual reality headset -- also will be on the floor. Some tech that started with game systems, such as motion-controlled interfaces, will branch out into other devices.","The International Consumer Electronics show starts Monday in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko is determined to justify his reported $42 million price-tag and help Manchester City win trophies after completing his long-expected move to the English Premier League club. The 24-year-old has signed until mid-2015 after sealing his switch from former German champions Wolfsburg on Friday night. He is not eligible to play in City's FA Cup third-round tie at second division Leicester on Sunday, but is looking forward to boosting the club's title challenge in the league against Wolverhampton on January 15. ""Manchester City were my first choice and only choice,"" Dzeko told the club's website. ""I was always attracted most to joining them. I have been linked with them for a long time and have watched them a lot on television. ""They have been playing well this season and now the speculation is over, I just want to do my best."" Who will be the bargain buys of the January sales? Dzeko became Robert Mancini's ninth signing since taking over in December 2009, and the Italian coach's first this year. He had been linked with Italian club Juventus and Manchester United, and his arrival could mean that Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor and Paraguay's Roque Santa Cruz leave City this month. ""City are playing for first place in the Premier League and that is what I want,"" Dzeko said. ""I am excited to play alongside players such as Carlos Tevez and Yaya Toure, whom I have only seen on the television, and to be in the same team as players I have played against such as Jerome Boateng and Vincent Kompany. ""They will help me achieve my goal to be better in the future. I want to show the fans why the club paid the money for me. Everyone expects goals and I want to score them, but most of all I want to contribute to a successful team."" In Saturday's other transfer news, former City boss Mark Hughes boosted his Fulham squad with the signing of midfielder Steve Sidwell from Aston Villa on an initial six-month contract. Struggling Villa have signed Tottenham's England Under-21 defender Kyle Naughton on loan for the rest of this season. Manchester United's 19-year-old Italian striker Federico Macheda has returned home on loan with Sampdoria, who needed a replacement after allowing Antonio Cassano to join Serie A leaders AC Milan. Juventus boosted their forward ranks with the free signing of Genoa's veteran former Italy international Luca Toni, who is seeking to rebuild his career following high-profile spells with Roma and Bayern Munich. Juve will be without Fabio Quagliarella for the rest of this season after the forward tore knee ligaments in Thursday's 4-1 defeat by Parma. Genoa have signed Slovakia midfielder Juraj Kucka following the departure of Francesco Modesto and Raffaelle Palladino to Parma, who have also signed Spanish midfielder Tony Calvo on loan. Spanish club Malaga have brought in former Real Madrid, Sevilla and Arsenal striker Julio Baptista from Italian club Roma, with the Brazilian costing a reported $2.5 million. In Turkey, league leaders Trabzonspor have signed twin Poland internationals Piotr and Pawel Brozek along with forward Mehmet Cakir. Galatasaray have signed Turkey striker Kazim Kazim and Argentine midfielder player Juan Culio.","Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko completes reported $42 million move to Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Even as last month's events in Benghazi, Libya, become clearer (it was a terrorist attack), the aftermath of Benghazi on American politics and on American policy is far from settled. The immediate question is why did it take so long to characterize accurately what happened there? Writing in The Daily Beast, respected diplomatic observer Leslie Gelb answers that question by reverting to a well-used theme when he blames current policy and political problems on the quality of the intelligence. Commenting on Ambassador Susan Rice's serial talk-show assertions that the Benghazi attack was ""spontaneous,"" he opines that Rice's ""mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value."" Gelb reinforces his point by saying that he made the same mistake in his own op-ed by relying on ""what the intelligence briefers told me."" Odd that he would receive an intelligence briefing. Equally odd, his assertion presumes that policymakers are simply passive clients of their intelligence officers. Did anyone challenge the video-inspired, spontaneous-event narrative with information like that reportedly revealed to Congress by Ambassador Pat Kennedy soon after the attack: that this was a complex and synchronized assault? What we know about the Libya attack . This theme of intelligence shortcomings was carried over by multiple government officials cited in a lengthy Wall Street Journal piece that outlined ""shifting views within the intelligence community"" as one source of the administration's problems. According to the Journal's sources, early intelligence reports of an al Qaeda connection to the Benghazi attack were discounted by the White House, following the lead of the director of national intelligence. ""The intelligence community made me do it"" defense is a bit peculiar given the aftermath of the flawed 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The outcome of that episode was a commitment by the intelligence community to give policymakers the benefit of the range of views within the community and to attach confidence levels to assessments. One wonders what level of confidence (low, medium or high) the intelligence community attached to its judgment that the Benghazi attack was related to an anti-Islam video and spontaneous and how already emerging dissenting views arguing the attack was preplanned were presented to senior officials. In any event, given the administration's existing narrative about its success against al Qaeda and the inherent attractiveness of the spontaneous attack plotline (a spontaneous attack would be neither predictable nor preventable and therefore less likely to invite blame for a lack of sufficient security), there were likely strong instincts in the White House to accept and publicize the original director of national intelligence assessment regardless of confidence levels or competing analysis. Strong instincts, but not necessarily good instincts. First of all, on a political level, the early story seemed to confirm earlier criticisms of administration wishful thinking in the face of similar events. Sen. Susan Collins, for example, criticized the Pentagon for labeling as ""workplace violence"" the 2009 killings of 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood. The Army officer charged in the rampage had communicated with a known terrorist and was shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" during the shooting. Similarly, the man in an attempt to down an aircraft near Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, the final turn of one in a series of complex plots launched by al Qaeda in Yemen, was prematurely labeled an ""isolated extremist"" before all the facts were in. Even more importantly, if wishful thinking can sometimes create political problems, it could take a far more important toll on the development and implementation of actual policy. The decision to intervene in Libya, though wrapped in a U.N. Security Council resolution to protect innocent life, was also a decision to overthrow the Libyan government, and U.S./NATO airstrikes continued until that goal was achieved. With that ""victory,"" Libya was predictably thrown into chaos: no central government, no institutions of civil society, fractious armed militias, a budding jihadist movement in the east, lingering regionalism and tribalism elsewhere. Predictable consequences were not confined to Libya. Awash with weapons and fleeing mercenaries, northern Mali was broken off from the center and became a haven for a strengthening al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. How prepared were we for these predictable consequences? Clearly Ambassador Chris Stevens threw his heart and soul and ultimately his life into trying to shape a positive future. But were the full government's efforts adequate to the task we helped create? Although we were less immediately responsible for the overthrow of regimes in Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen, we will be no less affected by the outcome in those states. The same will hold true for Syria when the day of reckoning comes for Bashar al-Assad's regime. What level of effort is the United States prepared to exert? We shouldn't fool ourselves. Our influence will often be far from decisive. But neither will it be trivial. And surely, in a time of global challenges and fiscal pressures, we will have to pick our investments and ""interventions"" carefully. But that will require a realistic rather than a wishful appreciation of events. Over the past year the administration has repeatedly emphasized that ""the tide of war is receding"" and that ""it's time to do some nation-building here at home."" Many have read this as advertising an American retrenchment from commitments abroad. Some may think that wise and are prepared to live with the consequences. One only hopes that the calculation of the consequences has been carefully done, based on hard realities, and not on the kind of wishful thinking that would turn a complex, synchronized terrorist attack into a kind of jihadist flash mob. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden.","Michael Hayden says intelligence briefers are being blamed for confusion over Benghazi attack .

The incorrect description of the attack fits pattern of wishful thinking on terrorism, he says ."
"(CNN) -- There was the news that made the headlines. And then there were the personal stories that made a lasting impact on only a few people, but touched the lives of millions. This year, CNN invited people to share their personal essays with the world, and they delivered. Dozens of iReporters had the courage to pour out their hearts with unforgettable stories of pain, loss, joy, courage and anger, many of which were published on CNN.com. Parenting was a huge topic this year. Gun control and frustrations with government were also on people's minds. As 2013 comes to a close, here's a look back at some of the best stories we received and the people who shared them. The mother raising her kids without religion . Deborah Mitchell stirred intense debate on CNN.com in early January when she posted seven reasons ""why I raise my children without God."" Readers who disagreed with her view flagged the iReport as inappropriate so many times that we had to put a note on it asking people to stop. Mitchell, a mother of two teenagers in Texas, said she simply wanted people to stop fearing atheists. ""I do not want religion to go away,"" she wrote. ""I want my children to be free not to believe."" Her story drew more comments than any other iReport story to date and resulted in a book contract for Mitchell. Her memoir, ""Growing Up Godless: A Parent's Guide to Raising Kids Without Religion,"" comes out this spring. The woman whose son taught her Oscar Pistorius was just a man . Cynthia Falardeau had always searched for a role model for her 10-year-old son, whose right hand was amputated at birth. The first time she saw South African runner Oscar Pistorius run on his carbon fiber blades, she was ecstatic. But Wyatt calmly told her, ""Mom, he's just a man."" Falardeau never really processed her son's wise words until Pistorius was accused of shooting his girlfriend on Valentine's Day 2013. Her brave piece became one of the first iReport personal essays published on CNN.com. The Venezuelan who won't miss Hugo Chavez . When Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez died in March at 58, CNN.com reader Juan Francisco De LeÃ³n posted a passionate critique about the controversial leader. More than 200,000 views and 41,000 Facebook shares later, ""10 reasons why I will not miss Chavez"" quickly became a talker (and spurred a fact-check post). ""Rest in peace now,"" he wrote, ""while we try to rebuild the mess of a country that you left us."" The nurse who feels safer with guns in the house ... Mother of three Tracy Scarpulla used to be adamant about not having guns in the house. But her husband, a Marine and firm believer in the right to bear arms, thought having a gun would ensure their safety. After their first child was born, they agreed to have one gun locked in a safe. Since then, Scarpulla has slowly changed her views on firearms. ""I think mothers need to educate themselves and learn how to best educate their kids,"" she wrote in an essay for CNN. ""I work with a lot of other mothers and a lot of them are shocked that I was taught how to shoot. I understand because I was there at one point. I was scared of guns."" ... and the activist whose father and son shot themselves . After reading Tracy Scarpulla's essay arguing for gun ownership, Dorothy Paugh was compelled to respond. Paugh lost her father to suicide by gun 50 years ago, and in April 2012, she lost her son in the same way. She now hands out educational materials to gun shops on suicide prevention modeled after New Hampshire's Gun Shop Project. ""Our love affair with guns in this country needs to be tempered with a healthy dose of respect for all the dangers of ownership,"" she wrote in an essay for CNN. ""I support the right of individuals to make informed decisions about whether and how to keep a gun in their house."" The stay-at-home mom who caught Sheryl Sandberg's attention . When Jennifer Kuhle shared her thoughts on iReport about ""Lean In,"" the best-selling book from Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, she hardly expected to hear from Sandberg herself. Kuhle, who has two young children and lives in Pennsylvania, explained that the book's message that too many women are choosing not to 'lean in' to their professional lives,"" as she put it, initially made her feel inadequate and depressed. She later realized that Sandberg's point was to put yourself fully into whatever you choose to do, be it parenting or working. ""When the time is right, I'll lean into my career once again, and I know I'll do it with gusto,"" Kuhle wrote. ""But right now, my family is my favorite. And I wouldn't have it any other way."" Sandberg shared Kuhle's iReport on her personal Facebook page, writing, ""Of all of the things that have been written about 'Lean In,' this post is one of my favorites."" The professor who fought his child's bullying with music . Virginia teen Mano Kolman is often treated as ""not very cool,"" as her father gently puts it. She has high-functioning autism and walks and talks a little bit differently from other kids. Tired of the teasing, her parents came up with a plan: Her dad, Barry, a music professor, would give Mano clarinet lessons. A year and a half later, Mano is a proud member of her middle school band. Her parents can tell from the way she brags about being a member that it's made a world of difference in her social life, and they say the lessons made her more focused in school, too. They shared their story on iReport in hopes of helping other children with autism. The lesbian who cried when DOMA was reversed . The webcam was rolling as tears streamed down Nikki Boudreaux's face on June 26. With a scream of ""booyah"" and a fist pump, she cried from joy that the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, was declared unconstitutional. ""This means me and my honey can get married!"" she exclaimed, holding up a picture of herself with her partner, Jessica, in a video she posted to CNN iReport. The Texas pair tied the knot on October 21 in a quiet ceremony on the Brooklyn Bridge. Meanwhile, the hunt is still on for a new home. The loan they hoped to get from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is still up in the air; Boudreaux says she was told same-sex spouses still can't be added on for disabilities benefits. The teacher who almost left his disabled daughter . He had never experienced so much love, or so much fear. In June, Jack Barr Jr. opened up about coming to terms with his daughter's Down syndrome diagnosis. He spent the first year of Marley's life wallowing in a deep depression that had him contemplating either suicide or giving his daughter up for adoption. One day, Barr went out for a ""walk"" that he intended to be permanent. ""I had no intention of going back,"" he said. ""I was going to leave my wife and daughter."" But with the support of other families in the Down syndrome community, he faced the reality of Marley's condition. Barr, a teacher in Bangkok, shared his journey so other parents would know they are not alone. ""Once I overcame my own selfish expectations for my daughter,"" he wrote, ""I slowly began to see the beautiful girl that would change my life forever."" The student who was groped in India . A story that sparked record traffic to iReport and often tumultuous debate from its readers, Chicago college student Michaela Cross' allegations of sexual harassment while studying abroad in India opened up a conversation between the two nations and beyond about women's rights, cultural differences and finding justice. Coming so soon after news of the deadly gang rape of a young woman in Delhi, Cross's raw, earnest and often angry account pushed people's buttons. ""This is the story you don't want to hear when you ask me about India,"" she said. ""But this is the story you need."" The woman who doesn't want any more children . Jessica Crookston loves her 8-year-old son and has no desire for more children. Feeling hounded by friends, family, relatives, co-workers and perfect strangers, she wrote eloquently about her decision not to expand her family and the judgment that has followed. ""Whether my family includes one child, two children or 10 children -- it's none of your business."" Many parents of only children could relate, as they wrote in the comments. The boy who got his stuffed wolf stitched up by a doctor . It was one of the sweetest stories we saw all year. Joshua Wade, a 9-year-old from Colorado, brought along his stuffed wolf to keep him company while he underwent an endoscopy. Before being sedated, he noticed the wolf had a tear in one of its seams. Pediatric gastroenterologist Christine Waasdorp Hurtado quietly sewed up the animal with real sutures while Wade was under anesthesia and brought it out with a surgical mask and gloves on his paws. Joshua's dad Kevin Wade wrote, ""It was such a sweet gesture by busy, but caring, professionals, and I will never forget it."" The actors who were stopped in South Carolina -- but not for an autograph . Hollywood actors Cherie Johnson and Dennis White were passing through South Carolina when they said they were stopped by police, handcuffed and questioned on suspicion of drugs. The black actors shared their experience with iReporter Krystol Diggs, and their account of alleged racial profiling became the third most-viewed iReport of all time. Many readers said they had experienced similar situations with law enforcement. The ensuing media coverage from CNN and others prompted an investigation into the incident by the Marion County police.

"(CNN) -- Even when pulling a 60-degree angle bank turn over the Dubai desert, the U.S. military's V-22 Osprey aircraft is hardly approaching the limits of its capabilities. ""What it's doing for us operationally, it's changing the game plan,"" says Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Duffy after the test flight at the Dubai Airshow earlier this week. ""We're still exploring what this aircraft can do."" What the aircraft has been doing recently is helping with the relief efforts in the Philippines after the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan - it's unique ability to tilt its rotors from vertical to horizontal allows it to act like a helicopter or turboprop plane and land without need for a runway. Duffy admits that it is a complicated aircraft to fly. Pilots -- be they experienced with fighter jets or helicopters -- have to train for around 24 weeks. But after all the tests and simulator hours, ""it really is a thrill to fly, wherever we go people always ask us about it."" Naturally Duffy is a fan, he's part of the hard sell that goes on to help procure orders for Bell and co-producer Boeing, much like all the other manufactures that gathered at the airshow that employed a mix of schmoozing and test-flight ""wow-factor."" ""It's a great opportunity for all the main equipment suppliers to show both their commercial and military offerings to they key decision makers in the UAE,"" says Charles Forrester, an analyst for IHS Jane's Defense Industry. ""As domestic markets are shrinking due to budget cuts, the large manufacturers are working hard to improve their export sales into regions such as the Middle East."" UK prime minister David Cameron flew into the UAE before the airshow began to boost the bid to sell 60 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Emirates. While that deal remains unfulfilled, the rules of engagement, at least for sales of military hardware in the region, seem to be changing. The U.S. and Western European companies have long had political and economic links with many Gulf countries but more is being asked for them. ""Many countries in the region are becoming more demanding in terms of industrial participation as part of procurement,"" says Forrester. ""Known as 'offsets', these can cover direct participation in the construction and manufacturing process, technology transfer or direct investment in a country's defense industry."" These offsets then are more than just sweeteners, but increasingly part of the package that aircraft manufacturers have to offer to boast sales. Another big piece of kit that doesn't have the advantage of an operational showreel like the V-22 Osprey is Airbus Military's A400M airlifter -- one of the newest aircraft in the skies. The first planes were delivered to the French Air Force in September. For his part former Mirage fighter pilot and A400M test engineer Eric Isorce is thoroughly impressed with the machine after 5,700 hours of test flights. ""Its like nothing else, its a real plane for the 21st Century."" Analysts believe that will be important as delays to the aircraft development meant it missed out on some potential orders from countries in the region who were renewing their fleet of multi-use cargo planes. IHS Jane's Defence estimates that the market for heavy-lift military planes is worth around $30B, and Airbus have stated they are keen to capture at least half of it. But it's not just a battle between big manufacturers from the U.S. and Europe.

"Paris (CNN) -- French prosecutors named the suspect held in connection with a newspaper shooting this week as Abdelhakim Dekhar. Dekhar allegedly shot a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation in Paris on Monday. On Thursday, French President Francois Hollande thanked police for capturing him. It ""prevented the worst from happening again,"" he said in a statement. Dekhar was arrested Wednesday in Bois Colombes, in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators are trying to determine if the man is connected to the shooting at the newspaper, as well as two other Monday crimes -- a shooting that injured no one in front of the Societe Generale towers in Paris, and a carjacking near the towers in the Paris neighborhood of La Defense, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Police said a man shot a 23-year-old assistant photographer twice near the heart in the lobby of Liberation's offices in Paris. The photographer is being treated at a hospital. The gunman fled after the attack, and authorities released photos showing a 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 man with a ""European appearance"" and graying hair. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old. Paris police said they had no information about the man's motive. On Friday, a gunman broke into BFMTV, threatening journalists before fleeing. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. But it has not been established that it was the same man.","The suspect resembles a man who also attacked a French TV station .

"(CNN) -- World champion Casey Stoner boosted his hopes of defending that title with victory at an incident-packed Dutch MotoGP at Assen Saturday. A first corner accident saw San Carlo Honda Gresini's Alvaro Bautista end the hopes of title leader Jorge Lorenzo, the Yamaha team leader clearly unhappy at the premature end to his race. It left the Hondas of Stoner and Dani Pedrosa to dominate affairs with Lorenzo's teammate Ben Spies in pursuit. Stoner took a lead he maintained to the checkered flag, closely followed home after a thrilling duel by Pedrosa. Andrea Dovizioso in the Monster Tech Yamaha overhauled Spies for third. His teammate Cal Crutchlow of Britain continued his fine season with fifth, just ahead of former world champion Nicky Hayden of the United States on his Ducati. Hayden's teammate, seven-time champion Valentino Rossi, continued his disappointing season back in 13th after being forced into the pits for a late tire change. Stoner, who had started on pole, has pulled level with the unfortunate Lorenzo at the top of the overall standings. Bautista is under investigation after the crash and apologized to Lorenzo for ending his chances. ""At the end I arrived so fast into the corner and I tried to stop the bike to stop Lorenzo from dropping out. I'm so sorry for him,"" he told BBC Sport. Spain's Marc Marquez, riding a Suter won the Moto2 category race, while his compatriot Maverick Vinales was first across the line in the Moto3 race on his FTR.","World champion Casey Stoner wins MotoGP at Assen .

"(CNN) -- The women of the year helped bring the economy back from the brink, worked against tyranny, and championed equality, education and justice. Most of all, they helped open our eyes to how much remains to be done. Malala Yousafzai . If 2012 was the year most of us first heard about the 14-year-old Pakistani girl, it was 2013 when we learned nobody could silence her, especially not the cowardly Taliban men who tried to kill her. Malala had become a vocal advocate of the right of all girls to an education, a frightening prospect for the Taliban. In October 2012, machine-gun toting extremists walked onto a school van, asked for Malala, then shot her in the face. Instead of intimidating her, the Taliban turned her into their own worst nightmare -- a powerful girl more admired and articulate than ever. This year we found that Malala's impact is just beginning. As a leading candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, her advocacy for girls inspires hope around the world. And she's just getting started. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot . What is it about macho politicians who get so scared of brave women? In Russia, President Vladimir Putin's suppression of the political opposition spurred an unlikely force, the defiantly named punk rock group Pussy Riot. The female band protested Putin's increasing authoritarianism. When five of them broke out into an anti-Putin song, ""Punk Prayer,"" at Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral, two of them -- Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina -- were arrested and put in prison. Why did Putin decide to free them before their sentence was finished? Because Pussy Riot has become synonymous with the harshness of the Putin regime. The group's outspokenness raised an international outcry so strong that even the Russian president, normally impervious to global public opinion, started to feel the pressure. Tolokonnikova sent out letters describing the brutality of prison life and went on a hunger strike. On her release from prison, Tolokonnikova fearlessly shouted, ""Russia without Putin."" She and Alyokhina dismissed the release as a public relations stunt by a president trying to improve his image ahead of the upcoming Olympic games in Sochi, Russia. That's exactly what it was. Delhi rape victim . As 2012 was coming to an end, a horrific gang rape occurred in the Indian capital, capturing the world's attention over the following months and, more importantly, awakening the Indian people to the crisis of violence against women. The Delhi rape victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was gravely injured, and she died of internal wounds in 2013. Her tragic case galvanized Indian women and men to fight the epidemic of rape in India, a battle that continues in the face of even more brutal attacks. Angela Merkel . When the European Union nearly fell into the economic abyss, there was one leader who held it together, standing up to criticism and holding firm on a controversial austerity program despite vilification and recrimination. The policy may not have been the best route to recovery, but in the chaos it was Merkel who saved the Union. Forbes named her the world's most powerful woman, as it has for eight of the last 10 years. Germans re-elected her to a third term earlier this month. She emerges from the crisis as the undisputed leader of the European Union, and a key player as the U.S. and Europe struggle to maintain their political and economic pre-eminence in the face of a rising China and a chaotic Middle East. Hillary Clinton . When Malala spoke in the U.S. this fall, Hillary Clinton was sitting in the audience as the young activist declared, ""Even in America people are waiting for a woman president."" Endless speculation about whether Clinton will run for president in 2016 is underpinned by the belief that she has a very good chance of becoming the next president of the United States. To a large extent, she stands as a symbol of the incomplete pursuit of equality. But if she becomes president, her impact would become more than symbolic. She would have more power than anyone on earth, and with it the opportunity to truly reshape the world. Whatever she decides, nobody doubts her abilities. She has already answered the question, ""Is a woman qualified to be president of the United States?"" with an emphatic, ""You are crazy to even ask!"" Michelle Bachelet . In 2006, voters in Chile elected Michelle Bachelet to a four-year term as president. This year, they voted her back into office. During the last few years, the former political prisoner and pediatrician became the first head of U.N. Woman, working for global gender equality. Bachelet comes from Latin America, the land that gave us the word ""machismo."" But her tenure has proven to Latin America that charisma and skill have no gender. Can a woman be a good president? The voters have said yes twice. Janet Yellen . Here's a name you're about to start hearing a lot more often: Janet Yellen. The brilliant economist was nominated by President Barack Obama to become the world's most powerful banker, heading the U.S. Federal Reserve. Yellen is uniquely qualified for the job. She has a slightly more growth-oriented approach than her predecessor, and that's good news for the unemployed, still struggling despite a booming stock market and modest economic growth. The highly respected soon-to-be first female Fed chief will get to work and tackle some of the challenges facing America's economy. Lucky country! Sheryl Sandberg . In what many people believe is a post-feminist era, women are pursuing careers and families and blazing their own trails without looking back. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer at one of the world's most successful social media companies, Facebook, took time to stop and examine the landscape. It's time, she urged, for women to push a little harder. In her best-seller, ""Lean In,"" she exhorted women to lean in to their ambitions. Equality is not yet here, she said, inspiring post-feminist women to break barriers. Sandberg may yet make feminism cool once again. Opinion: For women, missteps to learn from . Beyonce . There was a time when women artists were the playthings of businessmen and corporations. Today, many of the most successful women entertainers have taken control of their careers and carved their own paths. There are many examples, but perhaps none as impressive as Beyonce, whose career continues to reach new heights. She has amassed a huge fortune -- estimated at $300 million -- delighted her fans, and managed to stage dazzling surprises. At the end of 2013, the 32-year-old unveiled a ""visual album,"" an online album recorded and filmed while she was traveling the world on an enormously successful concert tour. When major corporations decried the unorthodox marketing of the new release, she unabashedly took them on, shocking Walmart buyers by showing up in person and paying for their Christmas shopping. Beyonce may be revolutionizing the music industry. The Saudi drivers . Remember the Arab Spring? Much of it unraveled in 2013. It had never quite made it to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the concept of democracy is so distant that women are in many respects treated as children. Among the many restrictions they face is the particularly crippling law that bans them from driving cars. Despite repeated arrests, Saudi women activists are doggedly demanding their right to drive, a symbolic and practical necessity. They have staged repeated acts of civil disobedience, and plan to keep doing it until they succeed. They may yet start their own quiet revolution.

"(CNN) -- As they seek solace from the ignominy of a ban from representing their country because of a drinking bout, six Australian rugby internationals might just have been served the perfect tonic - knowing that they are not part of the country's Olympic team. A day after a total of 15 players were disciplined for breaching 'internal team protocol', the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) issued guidelines about how its own athletes should behave at future Games after the consumption of alcohol. There is to be no 'swaying, staggering or falling down' while rambling or boisterous conversations, annoying team members and difficulty in paying attention to others are also outlawed. While drinking may be permitted outside the Olympic Village, team members have been left in no doubt as to the expectations now placed upon them. ""These restrictions have been implemented to ensure that Australia's Olympic athletes are given the opportunity to compete to the best of their ability and with distinction,"" said a statement bearing the name of AOC President John Coates. The failure to comply with these directives, which include the non-consumption of any alcohol in the Olympic village, would likely lead to expulsion from the team camp. The first test for Australian athletes will come at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. The measures came after a 2012 Olympic Games where some Australian athletes were criticized for their drunken behavior at an Olympics where the nation collected its lowest medal haul in 20 years. The swimming team's drunken behavior was particularly frowned upon following an independent review, while a rower was detained by police for damaging shop windows after a drinking session. Last week, it was the turn of Australia's rugby players to hit the headlines for their drinking. Veteran international Adam Ashley Cooper was one of the six suspended, along with Nick Cummins, Liam Gill, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Benn Robinson and Paddy Ryan. While the latter will miss the match against Wales later this month, the remaining five will all miss this weekend's clash with Scotland. Yet the extent of the consumption of what coach Ewen McKenzie called ""inappropriate levels of alcohol"" went even further, with a further nine players warned as to their future conduct. ""Let's be clear - these are internal sanctions and aren't a result of any complaints or reports of inappropriate or sinister behavior while our players were out,"" said the former international. ""We've done this because we need to continually reinforce the need for our players to make smart decisions to benefit the team. ""The worst thing you could do for the Wallabies in the long term is nothing, because that would mean we would be ignoring poor culture and a significant performance issue."" Despite the drinking spree, which took place early on Wednesday morning of last week, Australia defeated Ireland 32-15 in Dublin three days later, with Cummins among the try scorers. Several Australian rugby players have been involved in drinking incidents in recent times, including James O'Connor -- who lost his contract with the national team as a result -- and Kurtley Beale, who has sought counseling for his problems.","Australian Olympic Committee issues stringent drinking code .

"(CNN) -- When Jon Bohmer sat down with his two little girls for a simple project they could work on together, he didn't realize they'd hit upon a solution to one of the world's biggest problems for just $5: A solar-powered oven. Inventor Jon Bohmer with the oven he has made out of a cardboard box. The ingeniously simple design uses two cardboard boxes, one inside the other, and an acrylic cover that lets in the sun's rays and traps them. Black paint on the inner box, and silver foil on the outer one, help concentrate the heat. The trapped rays make the inside hot enough to cook casseroles, bake bread and boil water. What the box also does is eliminate the need in developing countries for rural residents to cut down trees for firewood. About 3 billion people around the world do so, adding to deforestation and, in turn, global warming. By allowing users to boil water, the simple device could also potentially save the millions of children who die from drinking unclean water. Bohmer's invention on Thursday won the FT Climate Change Challenge, which sought to find and publicize the most innovative and practical solution to climate change. ""A lot of scientists are working on ways to send people to Mars. I was looking for something a little more grassroots, a little simpler,"" Bohmer said Thursday. Bohmer's contest win notwithstanding, solar cooking with a cardboard oven isn't new. Two American women, Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole, were the solar box cooker's first serious promoters in the 1970s. They and others joined forces to create the non-profit Solar Cookers International -- originally called Solar Box Cookers International -- in 1987. Further, the organization's executive director, Patrick Widner, said that the plans for a solar box cooker were found in a book published by the Peace Corps in the 1960s. ""We are pleased that Mr. Bohmer has taken up the cause and interest of the 95 member organizations and 160 individuals of the Solar Cookers Worldwide Network,"" Widner said. ""It would be a pleasure to work with Mr. Bohmer in Kenya where we have been promoting the use of solar cookers for ten years."" Bohmer, a Norwegian-born entrepreneur based in Kenya, said he also had been looking at solutions ""way too complex, for way too long."" ""This took me about a weekend, and it worked on the first try,"" Bohmer said. ""It's mind-boggling how simple it is."" The contest was organized by the Forum for the Future -- a sustainable development charity -- and the Financial Times newspaper. Among the judges were British business magnate Richard Branson and environmentalist Rajendra Pachauri. The public also voted on the finalists. Bohmer's invention beat about 300 other entries, including a machine that turns wood and other organic material into charcoal, wheel covers that make trucks more fuel efficient by reducing drag, and a feed supplement for livestock that reduces the methane they emit by 15 percent. Bohmer named his invention the Kyoto Box, after the international environmental treaty to reduce global warming. The box can be produced in existing cardboard factories. It has gone into production in a factory in Nairobi, Kenya, that can churn out about 2.5 million boxes a month. Bohmer has also designed a more durable version, made from recycled plastic, which can be produced just as cheaply. He envisions such cardboard ovens being distributed throughout rural Africa. ""In the West, we cook with electricity, so it's easy to ignore this problem,"" he said. ""But half the world's population is still living in a stone age. The only way for them to cook is to make a fire. ""I don't want to see another 80-year-old woman carrying 20 kilos of firewood on her back. Maybe we don't have to.""","Inventor Jon Bohmer has created a $5 oven made out of cardboard boxes .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal left it late to stay top of the English Premier League title race as Niklas Bendtner and Theo Walcott scored in the last two minutes at the Emirates Wednesday to beat Cardiff City 2-0. The match looked headed for a draw until Danish international Bendtner converted from close range to break the deadlock and Walcott rounded off the job in injury time. With Manchester City and Chelsea both winning, the three points was vital for the Gunners, who were top heading into the New Year and maintained a one-point advantage over City. They are also an unexpected 11 points clear of reigning champions Manchester United whose recent revival came to a shuddering halt with a 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the late kickoff. Tottenham, who recently replaced Andre Villas-Boas with Tim Sherwood, moved up to challenging sixth place with a third win in four games for the new manager. They took the lead just before half time through recalled Emmanuel Adebayor after a smart counter attack and added a second through Christian Eriksen in the 66th minute. Danny Welbeck pulled one back within a minute and Tottenham had to ride their luck in the last few minutes, but it added up to a fourth defeat at Old Trafford for United under David Moyes. Earlier, Cardiff, without a manager since the sacking of Malky Mackay, restricted leaders Arsenal to few opportunities despite their domination. Jack Wilshere was denied a penalty in the first half and then struck the base of the post after the break until Bendtner reacted quickly to score after Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall saved superbly from Bacary Sagna's header. Former Manchester United star Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a guest of Cardiff owner Vincent Tan at the match, increasing speculation he will take over from Mackay. Second-placed City picked up their seventh straight win in all competitions in the early kick off, beating Swansea City 3-2 at the Liberty Stadium. City's Brazilian defender Fernandinho opened their account after just 14 minutes following a Samir Nasri corner, which was not cleared by the home defense. Swansea leveled in first half injury time when Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony headed home, but the expensively assembled visitors stopped up the pace after the break and his international teammate Yaya Toure restored their lead with a deflected effort near the hour mark. City's Aleksandar Kolarov crashed home what proved to be the clinching third eight minutes later before the impressive Bony grabbed a late consolation in injury time from long range. ""It was a very good result because Swansea are a strong team here at home and also away,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports. ""I think the way we won today is very important for us."" Jose Mourinho's Chelsea also kept up the pressure with a 3-0 win at Southampton, started by a header from Fernando Torres, who was a threat throughout, on the hour mark. Second half substitute Oscar set up Willian for a fine second just 11 minutes later and rounded off a superb performance with the third goal. It left Chelsea two points adrift in third spot. Fourth-placed Liverpool, still smarting from successive narrow losses to Manchester City and Chelsea, stayed in touch, four points adrift, by accounting for Hull City, winning 2-0 at home. Daniel Agger put them ahead with a 36th minute header with Luis Suarez netting his league leading 20th of the campaign with a fine free kick after the break. At the other end of the table, Fulham were indebted to Dimitar Berbatov for their winner in the 2-1 home victory over fellow strugglers West Ham. Nicolas Anelka, under investigation by the English FA for his controversial goal celebration in the draw at West Ham, played 88 minutes for West Bromwich Albion in their vital 1-0 home win over Newcastle. Sunderland remained rooted to the bottom as Gabriel Agbonlahor's 15th-minute goal gave Aston Villa a 1-0 win at the Stadium of Light, while third-bottom Crystal Palace were held to a 1-1 draw by Norwich City.","Arsenal stay top of the English Premier League with late goals .

"(CNN) -- Laurent Blanc stood down as coach of the French national team Saturday in the wake of their quarterfinal exit at Euro 2012. A statement on the French Football Federation (FFF) website confirmed he would not be renewing his contract after two years in charge of Les Bleus. The FFF said Blanc had contacted their president, Noel Le Graet, to inform him of the decision. The executive committee of the FFF will meet Tuesday to begin their hunt for a successor ahead of the qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The 46-year-old Blanc took over from the much criticized Raymond Domenech after the disastrous French showing in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa where a player strike and an exit at the group stages proved a national humiliation. The former Bordeaux coach, who was a key player in France's 1998 World Cup triumph and their victory at the 2000 European championships, appeared to have restored their fortunes going into Euro 2012. But an unbeaten 23-match run was ended with a 2-0 defeat to Sweden in their final group match, leaving them to face defending champions Spain in the quarterfinals. Reports of a dressing room row after that defeat was hardly the best preparation for the last eight clash which ended in another 2-0 reverse. Manchester City's Samir Nasri reacted angrily to that setback in media interviews and he is facing disciplinary action by the FFF. Blanc's departure has followed, having survived a scandal in April 2011 when he allegedly favored the introduction of race quotas on the number of dual nationality players at France's national youth training centers. He was exonerated of any wrong-doing after appearing before a joint hearing of the FFF and the French Sports Ministry, but he faced criticism from ex-teammates Lilian Thuram and Patrick Vieira. Former Lyon coach Paul Le Guen and Didier Deschamps, a former French captain, have been touted as possible successors to Blanc, who is set to return to club management.","Laurent Blanc stands down as coach of French national team .

"(CNN) -- Rain has played havoc with the U.S. Open in New York in recent years but two new retractable roofs mean the weather-related woes will soon be a thing of the past. The United States Tennis Association said Thursday at a news conference in New York that tennis' largest stadium would benefit from a retractable roof as early as 2016, bringing the event in line with two other majors that already have cover -- the Australian Open and Wimbledon. A more realistic forecast for that roof is 2017, though, the USTA said. The USTA added that the tournament's secondary show court, Louis Armstrong Stadium, would have its own retractable roof by 2018 and hasn't ruled out the possibility of covering a third arena at a later stage. The overall cost of the wide ranging project -- which will also include building a new and bigger Louis Armstrong Stadium and Grandstand Court -- is expected to hit $550 million, the USTA said. Both of those stadiums are roughly 50 years old. The retractable roof over Arthur Ashe alone is expected to cost in excess of $100 million. The men's governing body in the U.S. will ""self-finance"" the project through a combination of bonds and ""USTA revenue generation,"" it said in a statement. ""We have been working toward a viable design for a roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium for more than a decade,"" USTA chairman and president Dave Haggerty said in the statement. ""Through a long and arduous process, we feel that we now have a design that meets the criteria of being architecturally sound, aesthetically pleasing, reasonably affordable and buildable."" Players including women's No. 1 Serena Williams welcomed the news, which likely will mean the tournament won't enter a 15th day. The previous five editions have seen Monday men's finals because of rain, in some cases leading to an unfair advantage for one of the participants in the finale. In 2008, while Roger Federer was already through to the final after completing his semifinal on a Saturday, Andy Murray had to finish his semifinal a day later due to bad weather before contesting the final on the Monday. ""Obviously it's going to be great,"" Williams told reporters in Cincinnati, where she is competing at the Western & Southern Open. ""It's good to know they're going for it. ""When I first started playing the Open back in the '90s, it didn't rain and now it rains only on the final weekend. Last four U.S. Opens I've played, they've had to change completely the schedule. ""You just got to keep moving with the times,"" said Williams, who missed the 2010 U.S. Open due to a foot injury. Murray, however, said having a roof wasn't without its negatives. ""I don't necessarily miss being rained off, but rain delays used to be part of (grand slams),"" Murray told reporters in Cincinnati. ""That's kind of going away gradually. ""I don't particularly like going from indoors to outdoors. It's also so tough. But it's good for TV."" The USTA has indeed for years looked into having a retractable roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium -- which seats 22,500 fans -- but it was thought the extra weight couldn't be supported. Technological and engineering advances have now made the work possible. By the time all the enhancements are completed, it's anticipated that an extra 10,000 fans per day will be able watch the tennis on site. Tennis' other major, the French Open, is hoping to have a roof in place for 2018 although that is not guaranteed. Tsonga pulls out of New York . Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, is skipping this year's U.S. Open because of the knee injury that forced him to retire at Wimbledon, he told his website. The entertaining Frenchman was forced to stop against Ernests Gulbis in the second round at the All England Club in June and hasn't played since. ""It would be stupid to go there knowing full well that I have no chance because I'm not prepared enough,"" the world No. 8 said. Although he has yet to win a grand slam -- the French men's drought in singles extends to 30 years -- Tsonga had reached the quarterfinals or better in four of his five majors prior to Wimbledon. He's optimistic of returning in time for an indoor tournament in France in mid-September. This season's U.S. Open begins August 26th.","The U.S. Open will have a retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium as early as 2016 .

"(CNN) -- It looked like Manchester United was in the midst of a familiar charge after it beat Norwich at the end of December for a sixth straight win. But the momentum was snapped by Tottenham to begin 2014 and the Red Devils suffered their second consecutive defeat at Old Trafford when they were humbled by modest Swansea 2-1 Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup. A late red card brandished to Fabio proved costly. Swansea had never won at the Theatre of Dreams in 10 previous visits and only returned to the top flight of English football three years ago following a near 30-year absence. United manager David Moyes didn't exactly field the reserves, either, although Wayne Rooney wasn't in the squad as he continues to nurse a groin injury and Robin van Persie remained sidelined. ""When you lose games at any club, it's difficult,"" Moyes told BT Sport. ""We've got a big game on Tuesday (in the League Cup semifinals) and we'll get the team ready for that. ""We were a bit unlucky to lose. We had some opportunities, not enough, and we were down to 10 men."" Wayne Routledge opened the scoring for Swansea -- which visits Old Trafford in the Premier League next Saturday -- in the 12th minute but Javier Hernandez leveled four minutes later. Instead of going into another gear as it had done so often in the past under former boss Alex Ferguson, United allowed the Welsh side to stay in the game. ""We played quite well at times, got near the edge of the box quite regularly but didn't make an opportunity to score the goal,"" said Moyes. ""I thought for long periods we had good control of the game."" Fabio was dismissed for an 80th-minute challenge on Jose Canas and 10 minutes later, surging striker Wilfried Bony headed home Routledge's cross to hand United a fourth loss in its last six outings at Old Trafford. Bony scored twice against United's city rival, Manchester City, on Wednesday. ""We were coming here to not lose, and this is perfect for us,"" Bony told BT Sport. ""I think the key to the game was the red card. We had to do our best to get one more chance."" Chelsea and Liverpool earlier survived upset bids from Derby and Oldham, respectively, in football's oldest knockout competition, both winning 2-0. Sunderland, last in the Premier League, beat third-tier Carlisle United 3-1 but West Ham's struggles continued as Nottingham Forest of the Championship crushed the Hammers 5-0.

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman who was sentenced to 20 years for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband has been released from prison as she awaits a new trial, her attorney said. Marissa Alexander was released Wednesday night, attorney Bruce Zimet said. Last month, an appellate court ordered a new trial for Alexander. The case will be retried because the jury had incorrect directions, the court ruled. Alexander's case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh. The case shined the spotlight on Florida's ""stand your ground"" law after she unsuccessfully argued before her 2012 trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law. According to court paperwork filed in Duval County, Florida, Alexander was granted a pretrial release with special conditions and a $150,000 bond.

"(CNN) -- Kevin Pietersen's career as an international cricketer has been ended by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The ECB said Tuesday that it was not considering the batsmen for selection for the upcoming tour of the West Indies or the ICC World Twenty20 which takes place in Bangladesh during March and April. In a statement released on the ECB website, England cricket's governing body said the time had come to start the rebuilding process following the tour of Australia in which England were whitewashed 5-0 in the Ashes Test series. Read more: Australia completes Ashes rout of England . In a statement released Tuesday, ECB managing director Paul Downton said: ""Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates. ""However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy. ""England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill. ""This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career."" Pietersen, a hugely talented and flamboyant batsmen, burst onto the Test scene in 2005 against Australia scoring two half-centuries on his debut at Lord's. The two innings set the tone for a maverick career in which he amassed 8181 runs in 104 Tests including 23 centuries and a further 5,616 runs in one-day and Twenty20 internationals combined. For all his runs on the pitch -- Pietersen is England's leading international run-scorer -- the 33-year-old has also been perceived to be a divisive figure in the dressing room at times during his career. Pietersen said in the ECB statement that it had been a ""huge honor"" to play for his country. ""Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever,"" Pietersen said. ""Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years. ""I feel extremely fortunate to have played at a time of great success for England cricket alongside some of the best cricketers the country has ever produced. ""I want to thank everyone for their fantastic support and I wish the team the very best of success going forward. ""I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will continue to play but deeply regret that it won't be for England."" The news of Pietersen's departure from the international scene saddened and confused his former England captain Michael Vaughan who tweeted: ""Sad way to end a mavericks England Career .@KP24 will be missed...Would love to know what he does that is unmanageable !!??""","Kevin Pietersen told he has no future as international cricketer with England .

"London (CNN) -- A technical issue at the UK's air traffic control center in Swanwick is causing delays to hundreds of flights Saturday across the United Kingdom, including Heathrow Airport. The National Air Traffic Services said in a lunchtime statement that it had identified the problem and anticipated it would take until 6:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. ET) to resolve. An issue with the center's internal telephone system has resulted ""in a significant reduction in capacity in some areas of UK en-route airspace,"" it said. However, ""Safety has not been compromised at any time."" NATS would normally have handled about 2,000 flights by noon on Saturday but was about 20% down as a result of the morning's problems, it said, with about 1,700 handled. ""We now understand what the problem is and our engineers are working hard to rectify the issues as quickly as possible,"" the statement said. The NATS center at Swanwick handles flights for much of England and Wales, including the airspace around London which it says is one of the busiest areas in Europe. Stranded travelers voiced their frustration on Twitter. ""Flight changed and pushed back twice. Delay of just two hours. Let's hope it stays that way,"" said Carolanner. A Heathrow spokeswoman said, ""Flights from many UK airports, including Heathrow, are subject to delay and cancellation. If you are flying today you should check the status of your flight with your airline."" Airport information boards indicated the problem is affecting departures to a greater extent than arrivals. Heathrow, to the west of London, is one of the busiest airports in the world, serving 70 million passengers annually according to its website. On average, around 191,000 passengers transited the airport daily in 2012. Gatwick, Stansted and Luton Airports in southeast England are also suffering disruption, as are other busy UK airports, including Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Dublin Airport in Ireland said it was also experiencing some flight delays and cancellations as a result of the problems in the United Kingdom. Low-cost airline Ryanair said on its website, ""Ryanair has been advised of an equipment failure within UK Air Traffic Control which will cause significant flight delays and possible cancellations."" Transatlantic operator Virgin Atlantic said it was ""experiencing some delays,"" while shorthaul airline Easyjet said it was ""experiencing severe delays to flights to, from and within the UK."" British Airways said the problem had caused delays to some flights and ""led to significant shorthaul cancellations."" NATS said the technical problem involved its internal communications system. ""At night, when it's quiet, sectors of airspace are combined. As it gets busier in the daytime the sectors are split out again and additional control positions are opened to meet the traffic demand. ""Because of the problem with the internal telephone system, it was not possible to open the additional control positions this morning, resulting in a significant reduction in capacity in some areas of UK en-route airspace.""","NEW: Disruption to flights in Britain is also impacting Dublin Airport .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Grosskreutz scored an 87th-minute winner to send last year's beaten finalists, Borussia Dortmund into the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday. The Bundesliga side finished top of Group F after beating 10-man Marseille 2-1 in the Stade Velodrome. Robert Lewandowski got Dortmund off to the perfect start with a goal in the fourth minute but German joy didn't last long as Marseille defender Souleymane Diawara equalized in 14th minute. Despite having a numerical advantage for two thirds of the game -- Marseille's Dimitri Payet was sent off in the 34th minute -- Dortmund couldn't find a winner until Grosskreutz drove home a low winner with three minutes remaining. ""It was a great feeling to get the winning goal and put us through as group winners,"" Grosskreutz said. ""It was amazing to celebrate the goals with the fans, we deserved to go through,"" the 25-year-old added. ""We had lots of chances, but stayed patient and got our reward. I can't wait to get in the dressing room and soak up the atmosphere, there might be a few beers drunk as well."" Dortmund's better head-to-head record against Arsenal ensured they finished first in the group while the Gunners clinched second place despite losing 2-0 away to Napoli. Gonzalo Higuain's 73rd-minute goal gave Rafa Benitez's side hope -- the big Argentine turning neatly on the edge of the area before unleashing a low left-foot shot into the bottom corner of Wojciech Szczesny's goal. Two minutes later, Arsenal were down to ten men when Mikel Arteta received a second yellow card. Worse was to come as Jose Callejon doubled the home side's lead in injury time. With news filtering through of Dortmund's late goal, Napoli's chances of progressing now rested solely on scoring an unanswered third, but Callejon's deft touch over an advancing Szczesny proved to be the last kick of the match. Napoli also finished the group stage with 12 points, but an inferior goal difference sees them drop down into the Europa League. At Stamford Bridge, Demba Ba's 10th minute goal proved the difference between Chelsea and Romania's Steaua Bucharest. The 1-0 win ensures the West Londoner's retained top billing in Group E. Jose Mourinho's side will be joined in the last 16 by Germany's Schalke after they beat 10-man Basel 2-0. The Swiss side's defender, Ivan Ivanov was sent off in the 31st minute with Schalke taking full toll of the extra man in the second-half. Goals from 20-year-old Julian Draxler in the 50th minute followed by Joel Matip seven minutes later ensured second place in the group for the Bundesliga side at the expense of their opponents. Violence mars Milan progress . Neymar scored a hat-trick as Barcelona thumped Celtic 6-1 to ensure top-dog status in Group H.

Pedro made it 2-0 in the 39th minute with Neymar effectively killing off the contest with Barcelona's third and his first Champions League goal a minute before halftime. Three minutes after the break, the Brazilian scored again before completing his hat-trick in the 58th minute. Cristian Tello completed the rout with a sixth goal in the 72nd minute before Giorgos Samaras got a consolation for the Scottish champions two minutes before the end. The Catalans will be joined by AC Milan after they drew 0-0 with Ajax at the San Siro in a game that was marred by violence before kickoff. Italian news agency ANSA reported that three Ajax fans had been admitted to hospital after being stabbed outside the stadium prior to the match. One of the victims is in a serious condition after being stabbed in the stomach, ANSA reported. The incidents followed fighting between the two sets of supporters earlier in the day. Group G high-flyers Atletico Madrid made it five victories out of six with 2-0 win against Porto. Defeat for the Portuguese side means they lose out on qualification to Zenit St Petersburg who despite losing 4-1 to FK Austria Vienna are into the knockout stages. Galatasaray through to last 16 . A 85th minute strike from Wesley Sneijder earned Galatasaray a 1-0 win over Juventus on Wednesday as Tuesday's Group B Champions League match concluded after play had been suspended following a snowstorm on Tuesday night. The Dutch international's goal at the Turk Telekom Arena earns Roberto Mancini's side a place in the last 16 at the expense of their Italian visitors. With seven points, Galatasaray finished second to runaway group winners Real Madrid, while Juve had to settle for third place (on six points) and a place in the Europa League. The match, which resumed in the 32nd minute (the time when the referee stopped Tuesday's game), was played on a pitch bearing many muddy scars from the snow clearance. Mancini admitted afterwards that it may have been better not to play the game, but expressed satisfaction with the result. ""It was a difficult situation, but the lads did well. The point we took from Turin served us well and today we deserved the win,"" Mancini told Sky Sports Italia. The draw for the first knockout stages of the Champions League will take place on Monday December 16 in Nyon, Switzerland. The full list of teams is as follows: .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona and Atletico Madrid remain virtually inseparable in La Liga after Saturday night's top-of-the-table clash at the Vicente Calderon Stadium ended in a 0-0 draw. As the season reaches its halfway point, both the Catalans and the Red and Whites have 50 points, with only Barcelona's superior goal difference separating the two teams. The first half was a tight affair with both teams careful not to give away an early advantage in what could be a decisive game in the fight for the title. Read more: Who will be crowned world's best footballer? Despite scoring twice in his comeback match against Getafe in midweek, Lionel Messi once again started on the bench but came on for the injured Andres Iniesta at halftime. The Argentine's introduction gave Barca more bite in attack but still Atletico held firm. Neymar's arrival in the 66th minute -- the Brazilian striker also started on the bench after missing the match against Getafe with a bout of gastroenteritis -- added another string to Barcelona's attacking bow but a goal didn't materialize. Messi, who will be hoping to retain FIFA's Ballon D'Or when the winner is announced on Monday, passed and probed but couldn't find a way through. His best chance came nine minutes from the end but the 26-year-old was denied by a fine save from Atletico's Belgian keeper Thibaut Courtois. Diego Simeone's side had their moments too with Diego Costa narrowly missing out at the far post when Brazilian defender Miranda flicked on Koke's corner kick in the 28th minute. Turkish midfielder Arda Turan, who provided much of the Atletico's creative spark, also saw a chance go begging with 12 minutes to go -- his mistimed volley easily scooped up by Barcelona's keeper Victor Valdes. Both teams are now six points ahead of third place Real Madrid, but Carlo Ancelotti's side will reduce their arrears to three if they beat Espanyol on Sunday. In Saturday's other La Liga fixtures, fouth-placed Athletic Bilbao romped to a 6-1 victory over Almeria while Valencia's stuttering season continued as they went down 2-1 at Celta Vigo. Two matches were played in Serie A on Saturday with Parma climbing to seventh after running out 3-0 winners at second-from-bottom Livorno while the match between Bologna and Lazio ending goalless.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Some people see a silver lining and go looking for a cloud. They just can't feel good about the world they live in, even when they're presented with a feel-good story. Instead of rejoicing in a positive development, they're critical and cynical and mean. You'll find these folks in both political parties, and all across the ideological spectrum. This includes the left-leaning media and the liberal blogosphere, where they seem to have a tough time praising a Republican for doing something right. And some on the right would probably say that about me. I've spent plenty of time in the last quarter century writing about things that Republicans do wrong. But criticizing Republicans when they deserve it doesn't stop me from giving credit where it's due. So let's give credit to Josh Romney, the 38-year-old son of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who, police have confirmed, helped four people -- a husband, wife, and two teenage sons -- after a car crash in Holladay, Utah. It all happened on Thanksgiving night. After dinner with his parents and family, Romney was driving home with his wife and children when, he told reporters, he saw a car speed by him and crash into the kitchen of a home. He rushed to the scene of the crash. He said that he helped the four passengers out of the wreckage of the car and, police confirmed, he walked them to the front lawn so they could get medical attention. An adult male was in the basement of the home at the time, and he wasn't injured. And the family wasn't seriously injured. That's good news. Afterward, Romney went to Twitter -- the modern-day town square -- and tweeted about the experience. He included a photo of himself standing next to the wreckage. This being a photo, he was smiling. The tweet simply read: . ""Was first on scene to big accident, see pic of car in the house. I lifted 4 people out to safety. All ok. Thankful. â€” Josh Romney (@joshromney)."" That's it. Not exactly a victory lap, is it? Yet, for his trouble, the hero of this story got hammered by the left and other Twitter users. ""Why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene?"" wrote Twitter user Laila Yuile in reaction to Romney's tweet. Others wrote that Romney's post constituted a classic ""humblebrag,"" a kind of sneaky boast where someone uses 140 characters to show off without letting it show. We are told that some consider ""humblebragging"" to be an even worse breach of etiquette than plain ol' generic bragging because it tends to be served up with a side of fake modesty. #Seriously? This is what we've come to? We now go hunting for bad behavior, even when someone does a good deed. Is this sort of thing a result of boredom or poor manners? ABC News Blogs reported that the term ""humblebrag"" was coined in 2011 by American comedian Harris Wittels. It noted the blowback this way: . ""Josh Romney, Mitt Romney's son, is drawing some flak after rescuing four people from a car crash on Thanksgiving. It wasn't the act itself that sparked the ire of so many on social media, but rather the tweet he posted in the aftermath of his self-acknowledged heroism."" United Press International reported this: . ""Josh Romney says he helped rescue victims of a car crash in Utah, but now he's getting grief for talking about it on Twitter."" I admit that posing in front of wreckage from an auto accident is a little creepy. And, even in the age of Twitter, it should be possible to render aid to those who need it without feeling compelled to broadcast it all over the Internet. And yet, it's hard to detect any amount of gloating either in the text of Romney's tweet, or in the statement he issued the day after the accident, part of which read: . ""My family and I are grateful that no one was seriously injured and glad to have been able to help those affected by this terrible accident. What I did to help the people involved in the accident is what anyone else would do who witnessed such a potentially dangerous situation."" This young man sounds like a class act. Which is more than I can say for those petty souls who, in this case, went out of their way to cast a good Samaritan in a bad light. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Some look for gloom even in feel-good stories, like that of Josh Romney's tweet .
Romney tweeted picture of himself, saying he was first on scene of crash, helped victims .
He was slammed online for ""humblebragging""; Navarrette: Really? Helping a bad thing?

"(CNN) -- Every sport has its gods. In boxing it's Muhammad Ali, in soccer it's Brazil's Pele and in basketball it's Michael Jordan, but this week India, already a country with no shortage of deities, paid homage to cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. The 40-year-old's final bow as a professional cricketer came Saturday as India completed an innings and 186 run victory over the West Indies on his home Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Tendulkar's part in the proceedings on the final day amounted to a couple of overs of bowling, cheered to the rafters by a packed stadium, which could have sold out 10 times over. After the final West Indies wicket fell, a tearful Tendulkar held court with an emotional speech in which he thanked everyone who had supported him, particularly his father, who passed away in 1999. ""Without his guidance I don't think I would be standing in front of you,"" he said. Tributes also followed for his mother, his wife Anjali and their two children before he turned his attention to his fanatical following in India. ""I know there are so many guys who've fasted for me, prayed for me, done all sorts of things for me. Without all that life wouldn't have been like this for me,"" he said. ""I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and say that time has gone by rather quickly, but the memories that you've left with me will always be with me forever and ever."" Many in the crowd were left in tears and they roared out his name in approval, grateful for his incredible career which saw him become the first man to score 100 international centuries. A further century proved out of Tendulkar's reach in his final Test, dismissed for 74 Friday as India took command of a match they wrapped up the next day to win the series 2-0. Our god . But his fans will forgive him this relative ""failure"" because Tendulkar is not just a sports star, but also an icon in a country of more than 1.2 billion people. His fans often wave placards at matches that read, ""Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God."" Himself a devout Hindu, the diminutive 5-feet 5-inch all-rounder was well-known throughout his career as a modest superstar who never lost his cool either at the batting crease or in front of the cameras and fans. Former India captain Rahul Dravid told CNN that Tendulkar would be remembered as ""the benchmark"" against which all the nation's cricketers measured themselves. In a game where 100 runs -- or a century -- is regarded as the high-water mark of batting achievement in any match at any level, Tendulkar last year reached 100 hundreds at international level and now holds almost all coveted batting records except for cricket legend Don Bradman's career average of 99.94 runs. Even ""The Don"" as he is known in Australia -- the cricketing prodigy of the 1930s and '40s who was still alive when Tendulkar made his Test debut in 1989 -- once remarked on the Little Master's prodigious talent. ""I saw him playing on the television and I was very, very struck by his technique. I asked my wife to come and have a look at him. Because, I said, I never saw myself play, but I feel that this feller is playing much the same as I used to play ... It was just his compactness, his stroke production, his technique, it all seemed to gel as far as I was concerned,"" Bradman told reporters. Completing his stellar career, Tendulkar scored 15,921 runs in 200 Test matches at an average of 53.78 each innings, and 18,426 runs in 463 one-day international matches at 44.83 each time at bat. Shane Warne -- the famous Australian leg spin bowler and another of Bradman's favorite contemporary cricketers -- rated him the greatest player of the modern game. ""Sachin Tendulkar is, in my time, the best player without a doubt -- daylight second, Brian Lara third,"" said Warne, who said of the Indian that it was ""a pleasure bowling to him."" True sportsman . Australian cricket commentator Gideon Haigh said Tendulkar was well-known for his grace under pressure in a sport better known in modern times for its towering egos. ""Certainly, he has left a strong imprint on his cricket contemporaries,"" Haigh wrote in The Australian newspaper. ""They knew him, for example, for never throwing his bat after a dismissal; he would sit down in the dressing room, reflect, but never brood."" In India, his popularity has reached beyond cricket's stadiums and -- with a career unsullied by controversy or scandal -- he has become a marketer's dream. With a net worth of about $160 million from endorsements, property and cricket earnings, according to Singapore-based Wealth X, Tendulkar is cricket's richest player and the country's biggest icon. Walk into any shopping mall in India, and there's a good chance you will see Tendulkar on a poster or a billboard. He endorses 17 products including Canon, Visa and Adidas. Canon has spent $50 million on advertising over the past five years -- and half of that on Tendulkar alone. ""It has worked phenomenally,"" Canon India's senior vice president Alok Bharadwaj told CNN. ""We notice that the awareness of our brand is improving and since people respect him a lot there's almost a subtle admission that if Sachin is saying it, then it has to be true."" Tendulkar is known to be choosey about what he endorses and will not, for instance, put his name to alcohol, despite large offers from corporations . Despite his commercial success, the ""Little Master"" says it's always been about the cricket. ""The fact was that it was all happening because of cricket and my focus always stayed on cricket, the rest of these things happened around cricket and even today cricket is the focal point, cricket is the ultimate thing for me ... it's that simple,"" he told CNN in an interview in 2008. CNN's Gary Morley also contributed to this report.","NEW: Sachin Tendulkar makes tearful farewell to cricket Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The Arkansas Geological Survey is trying to unravel a mystery: What is causing earthquakes in the town of Guy, Arkansas? Since September 20, the community of 549 residents north of Little Rock has experienced an almost constant shaking from 487 measurable earthquakes. ""We've had 15 today including a 3.1 (magnitude) from this morning,"" Scott Ausbrooks, geohazards supervisor for the Geological Survey, said Monday. ""These are shallow quakes between two and eight kilometers (between one-and-a-quarter and five miles) below the surface."" While earthquakes aren't unusual in the Southeast state, the frequency is. ""This time last year we had 39 quakes total for the entire state,"" said Ausbrooks. Most of the quakes in the swarm -- a localized surge of earthquakes with all of them about the same magnitude, according to the United States Geological Survey -- are so small they go unnoticed. The largest, a 4.0 on October 11, caused the only documented damage, cracking a window at a visitor's center to a state park. Guy Mayor Sam Higdon said when the swarm first happened, citizens took notice. ""They were calling City Hall asking, ""What are you going to do?'"" he said. In response to the constant bombardment of tiny quakes, Higdon's office has organized a three-hour long town meeting, and sought the help of state geologists and members of the oil and gas industry to find answers. ""My wife wants to buy earthquake insurance. I'm trying to talk her out of it,"" the mayor said Monday. There are several geologic faults in the area, but none associated with the New Madrid fault, the large seismic fault in the region and one that was the source of an estimated 7.0-magnitude earthquake in 1811. And there was another historic flurry of earthquakes in 1982, 15 miles south of Guy. Geologists know it as the Enola Swarm, responsible for 15,000 quakes within a year's time, followed by more shaking in 2001. At first, town officials assumed the current wave of shakes came from work at a gravel company on the outskirts of town. Ausbrooks says the state Geological Survey has no idea whether the current swarm is a natural or man-made event, but his office is seriously exploring the latter. ""We see no relation to the drilling in the area, but we haven't ruled out a connection to the salt water disposal wells,"" he said. According to the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, there are at least a half dozen ""disposal wells"" within a 500-square-mile zone around Guy. Licensed by the state of Arkansas, disposal wells are a byproduct of the oil and gas industry and are used to inject drilling waste water back into the earth after drilling. Ausbrooks said drillers inject waste water into the earth at high pressure, and in the area around the town the disposal wells go as deep as 12,000 feet. He points to incidents in Colorado in the 1960s at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, where deep water injection was tied to earthquakes. Last week the state of Arkansas issued a moratorium on new drilling permits. Lawrence Bengal, director of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, said previously his office required only monthly reports outlining the operations of injection wells. ""We're asking well operators to provide daily reports now,"" Benegal said. Ausbrooks said his office is poring over the data trying to determine whether there is a correlation between the disposal wells and the shaking, and he hopes to present preliminary findings to the state next month.","The town of Guy, Arkansas, has been shaken by hundreds of small earthquakes .

"(CNN) -- The old adage has it that you wait ages for one bus then two come along at once -- but Jimmy Walker isn't complaining. Three months ago he won his first PGA title at the Frys.com Open on his eighth year on the tour, but he didn't have to wait long for his second. After a round of 63 at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu he finished one shot ahead of the field to take the Sony Open title and secure an early birthday present ahead of turning 35 on Thursday. A run of four birdies in the final six holes saw Walker finish on 17-under par, one shot ahead of fellow American Chris Kirk, and two clear of Harris English. ""I think Frys taught me a lot,"" Walker told the PGA Tour's official website. ""It was stay patient, stay focused, don't get bent out of shape when you make a bogey or any of that kind of stuff. ""It took me a long time to do it and I feel like I did learn a lot that week. I felt very calm and under control, that's what you've got to do when it's time want to win. ""Today was awesome, I felt in control all day, of my emotions mentally and physically, and it was really cool golf. ""I stayed patient, I didn't make any bogeys, I made a really key par putt on 14 and then the string of birdies there was pretty awesome."" Walker was one of only two players to stay bogey-free on Sunday and after going 188 starts without a PGA Tour win, it has taken him just five more to lock down a second. He credits the work he's done with famed coach Butch Harmon in the past year, who has also worked with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, for transforming his game. ""When I went and saw him, he said I believe in you and I believe you've got a lot of talent, and I think you're under utilizing what you've got,"" Walker said. ""He's a very confident person. When he tells you something, you believe it.""","Jimmy Walker wins the Sony Open title in Honolulu, Hawaii .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the majority of people in the West banking is as easy as walking to a local branch or ATM, or logging into their account from a computer. But for millions in developing countries, even having a bank account is out of reach. In India, at least, that could be about to change. Vodafone India and ICICI Bank, India's largest private bank, have launched M-Pesa, a mobile-based money transfer and payment service that was first established in Kenya in 2007. The partnership, announced in a news release April 17, claims it will give mobile-banking access to some 700 million Indian people who are currently ""unbanked"" -- people with no access to conventional banking services like bank branches and ATMs. Vodafone says service will first rollout in India's eastern regions, including Kolkata and West Bengal, with 8,300 agents. That part of India is home to about 220 million people. Service will eventually be extended across the rest of the country. The M-Pesa system -- where ""M"" stands for mobile and ""pesa"" is the Swahili word for money -- begins with real cash and an M-Pesa agent. A customer signs up, registers a personal mobile phone number and deposits money into the linked account at an agent store, which could be a mobile phone shop, a gas station or a supermarket. To send money, the user inputs a recipient's mobile phone number, the amount of money to send and a security code for protection. To withdraw funds, the receiver visits an M-Pesa agent and requests a withdrawal through his or her mobile phone. Both the receiver and the M-Pesa agent then receive a confirmation for withdrawal, which instructs the agent to give the customer cash. Bills can be paid and mobile talk time can also be bought through the platform. ""For millions of people in India, a mobile phone is a bank account, a front door to a micro-business or a lifeline to people in the remotest areas,"" said Marten Pieters, Managing Director and CEO of Vodafone India. ""Research shows that M-Pesa brings real benefits to users in their daily lives, saving three hours a week of their time and around $3 in money transfer costs -- a significant amount to people in some areas."" Greater cell phone penetration also brings greater economic benefit to local economies, often far removed from urban centers in large developing countries. A 2006 University of Michigan study found that every 10% increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6%. In 2011, India alone added 142 million new mobile phone subscriptions -- twice as many as in the whole of Africa, and more than in Europe, the Middle East and the former Soviet republics combined, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in a June 2012 report. Between 2000 and 2011, India recorded an enormous boom in cell phone subscriptions -- growing from just 3.5 million to more than 893 million. In that same time, China saw mobile phone subscriptions increase more than ten-fold to more than 986 million subscriptions. The United States saw growth of just 87% over the same dozen years to 290 million, says the ITU.","Vodafone India announced launch of M-Pesa, a mobile phone based banking service .

"(CNN) -- At least one in six people worldwide doesn't have access to clean water, and this contributes to about 1.5 million preventable deaths each year, according to the United Nations. Doc Hendley, a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009, is trying to help change that. Through his nonprofit, Wine to Water, the former bartender from North Carolina has helped provide clean water to more than 150,000 people in 17 countries. Wine-tasting events are one way Hendley and his group raise the funds that enable them to distribute water filters and help install wells in communities around the world. And in April, bartenders from 16 countries donated their tips to the cause. Hendley recently talked with CNN about the water crisis and his efforts to help people impacted by the Syrian civil war and the recent typhoon in the Philippines. CNN: What should people know about the water crisis? Doc Hendley: It takes many women and children four and five hours, every single day, just to get water. And then it's absolutely filthy, and it's making their children sick. Diarrhea kills more children under 5 than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. And 88% of (those) deaths are caused by poor sanitation, unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene. A lot of people ask me, ""If this water crisis is so bad, how come we haven't heard much about it?"" Well, here in the West, we help support things that we can empathize with. We know what it's like to lose a loved one to a disease like cancer. We understand what it means to need a good, solid education for a child. So (those causes) get a lot of the spotlight. But it's hard for us to empathize with the water crisis. We wash our cars; we water our lawn. We just can't imagine what it's like to not have access to water. CNN: Why did you start working on this issue? Hendley: I began raising funds to support the fight against the global water crisis back in 2004, and I had an opportunity to live in Darfur, Sudan, during the height of the genocide there. My job was to (work in) refugee camps and get them access to water. When I first started witnessing these women and children and the effort they would go through for a cup of water, and then to see actually the water that they were providing to their kids -- when you see that firsthand, you can't help but be changed. When I came home, it's all I could think about. I dreamed about it. So I decided this is what I want to do with my life. CNN: Why did you get involved in the situation in Syria? Hendley: Right now in Syria, every single day, thousands of people are fleeing their homes because of this fighting ... going to an unknown future, with no resources. In these (displacement) camps, a lot of the men have either been killed or they're all fighting, so it's mostly populated by children and women. The vast majority is children. And as you know, a lot of these kids' systems are very weak, and they're drinking filthy water. My first thought was, ""Let's see if we can get some water filters into these camps."" Another big reason for me was that the first country I worked in, Sudan, was a predominantly Muslim country, and I've really felt a connection with the Muslim world ever since. I really wanted to get out there and reach out, to show that we want to help in any way we can. CNN: What are you doing to help? Hendley: We created a partnership with Zakat (a U.S.-based Muslim charity), and right now we're actively working in two camps in the northwestern region, near border areas between Syria and Turkey. I was able to (go) inside some of these camps, inside Syria. ... The living conditions, they're terrible. On that trip, I was able to bring about 350 filters with me. Until we can get each household to have their own water filter, which is the ultimate goal, we have a couple of distribution areas where people can come with their buckets of water and run (it) through a number of filters in order to clean it. When it's not an emergency situation, we can go into an area and teach them, using their local resources, how to build their own water filter. But in a war zone, like what's going on in Syria, we just need to get a clean water fix immediately. Syria is the very first location that we're using these Sawyer filters. We're really excited about them. If they're used properly, they will last 10 years and filter 250 gallons of water every day. CNN: Do you ever worry about the risk? Hendley: Going inside Syria reminds me a lot of my time (in Sudan). When I was younger, I was a little more reckless; I didn't have as much to lose. Now I have a wife and two kids, and so I do find myself thinking, ""Is this work really worth risking my life over?"" You know, when you see these families get to access clean water, it makes the answer pretty easy: Of course it's worth it. A lot of people think because the number is so big, what can one person really do? It's just too overwhelming. But if you think, ""I could help one other person or five other people or one village,"" you can make a huge difference. CNN: You were just in the Philippines, where you and Efren Penaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year, were helping people impacted by the typhoon. How did that go? Hendley: Having so much support from Efren and all of his contacts helped the process go much more smoothly than it normally would. We brought about 2,000 filters, and we've been able to partner with a local water company, Maynilad, that's helping us provide 500 more. They are interested in doing even more, so with their support we now may be able to reach out to a huge number of people. That really upped the ante for us. ... There's just so much to do in the Philippines. There are so many disasters there -- not just typhoons, but earthquakes. And lots of villages we went to didn't have clean water before the typhoon, and now things are much worse. So there's lots of work to do there, but we're excited about having the chance to help.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese government report Monday heaped fresh criticism on the operator of the nuclear power plant where a disastrous accident was set off last year by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the country. The measures taken by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), the plant operator, and the Japanese nuclear regulator to prepare for disasters were ""insufficient,"" the report by a government-formed panel of investigators said, and the response to the crisis was ""inadequate."" The crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. Even now, more than one year after the disaster began, TEPCO does not seem aggressive enough in examining the causes of the accident at the plant to prevent a recurrence, the 10-member panel, led by Tokyo University engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura, said in the report Monday. The report, the fourth and final one on the nuclear disaster, comes amid growing anti-nuclear protests in Japan. It said interference by the prime minister at the time, Naoto Kan, created confusion in the response to the crisis. It recommended that all nuclear operators in the country conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities. The results of the investigation Monday follow a damning parliamentary report earlier this month that said the crisis was a ""man-made disaster"" resulting from collusion between TEPCO, regulators and the government. That report said the disaster should have been predicted and prepared for. Video: What caused the Fukushima disaster . A February report by independent scholars and journalists also concluded the plant operator could and should have done more. Only TEPCO's own internal report in May said no one could have predicted the scale of the earthquake or the devastating tsunami that followed. However, it did admit it was not fully prepared and acknowledged criticism it took too long to disclose information. TEPCO also found itself under further scrutiny over the weekend when the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said it was investigating a report that subcontracted workers at the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels. As the official investigations into the causes of the disaster at the power plant conclude, attention is shifting to what comes next for the nuclear power industry in Japan. Video: Japan ends nuclear freeze . The government has been holding public hearings around the country to try to gauge public opinion regarding three options it has put forward for a medium-term energy plan. It is expected to decide next month whether to reduce the country's nuclear power to zero as soon as possible, aim for a 15% nuclear role by 2030 or a 20-25% share by the same date. Whichever is chosen, it will be a far cry from the energy policy in 2010, which aimed to raise nuclear power's role to account for more than half of electricity needs by 2030. The anti-nuclear movement is very clear about which option it wants: the grassroots opposition says Japan must become nuclear-free and the number of people making this call is growing. Tens of thousands are gathering outside the prime minister's residence every Friday. Last Friday was the seventh protest that Nagisa Saito has attended. ""What impresses me most is... people never gave up and the crowd is getting bigger and bigger,"" she said. ""Even on a bad rainy day like today, we see this many people gathered, it's amazing."" Video: Nuclear disaster spreads to houses, food . Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda hears the voices, but so far he is not being swayed by them. He authorized the re-activation of two nuclear power plants earlier this month, claiming that without nuclear power, the country and the economy will suffer. ""Japanese society will not be able to function if there is a decision to permanently halt nuclear power generation,"" Noda said last month . But one anti-nuclear protester, who gave his name only as Ozaki, said it was not a simple choice between nuclear and blackouts. ""If there is a power shortage, there are alternatives,"" he said. ""What about coal-fired power stations, hydro-electric power stations, or we can just survive with what we have. We have to be patient, but even with blackouts, we can survive without nuclear power.""

"(CNN) -- Honeymooners and international hotel owners are at the center of an acrimonious showdown over religion between the government and opposition parties in the popular luxury tourist destination of the Maldives. The Tourism Ministry last week banned the use of spas across the country, sparking a fiery debate over Islam's role in the governing of the island nation. The nation's pristine beaches and rich marine wildlife drew nearly 800,000 tourists in 2010. The move has prompted confusion, legal action and civil disobedience in the Indian Ocean nation, which has a population of about 350,000. ""The government has ordered all the spas in the islands to shut down,"" said Mohamed Rashad, the manager of Royal Island Hotel and Aaramu Spa in the Maldives. But the hotel industry ""is not going for that,"" he said. ""We are open today and never closed, and the other hotels are keeping their spas open as far as I know."" The standoff over tourists' rights to have massages and skin treatments at the high-end resorts, many of which charge thousands of dollars for a night's accommodation, came following calls from opposition groups for a stricter imposition of Islamic values in the Muslim country. The opposition's demands conflict with the more liberal stance of President Mohamed Nasheed, who has urged the country to stick what he describes as the more ""tolerant"" strain of Islam that it has practiced for hundreds of years. The situation came to a head after opposition groups staged a demonstration on December 23 in which they advocated, among other things, for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital, Male, and other more densely populated areas. Rather than ignore the demands, the government raised the stakes last week by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas across the country's nearly 1,200 islands. The opposition groups had not sought such a blanket ban of spa activities, said Mohamed Shaheem, a spokesman for Adhaalath Party, which participated in the rally. ""We respect tourists,"" he said. ""We are very happy with the tourism industry in the Maldives."" In a statement, the president's office suggested that the broader ban was an effort to highlight contradictions in the positions of some opposition figures. ""Ironically, the same opposition leaders who railed against spas and the selling of alcohol and pork to tourists are some of the country's biggest resort owners,"" the statement said. Opposition leaders involved in the tourism industry include Qasim Ibrahim, the founder and chairman of Villa Group, which owns five resorts in the Maldives. Ibrahim is also the head of Jumhooree Party, which participated in the December 23 rally. Repeated efforts on Monday to reach Qasim were not successful. The hotel industry reacted to the ban by seeking a temporary court injunction and by holding talks with the government to try to get the spa services at major hotels excluded from the order, said Rashad of Royal Island Hotel. ""This was done for political purposes,"" he said. ""Nobody has come out to check on us or to carry out inspections."" For its part, the government has suggested that it is willing to compromise with the big operators. ""Several have raised concerns over our decision,"" Mariyam Zulfa, the tourism minister, was quoted as saying over the weekend by the local news service Haveeru. ""We are considering allowing resorts to operate spas."" CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","The government bans massage parlors and spas across the island nation .

"(CNN) -- As you step closer to the artwork, it's as if you're venturing into a crimson-hued dreamscape, a psychedelic realm immersed in feverish landscapes and eerie sounds. Yet, this is no dream. Using a special and discontinued technology, which registers an invisible spectrum of infrared light, Irish artist and photographer Richard Mosse has captured beautiful and challenging imagery of people and landscapes in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Designed by the U.S. military in the 1940s for camouflage detection, the Kodak Aerochrome film renders the landscape in an unexpected light, turning shades of lush green into dramatic pinks and glowing reds. The result is both spectacular and shocking: Rolling hills appear dotted with candy-coated trees; river valleys are covered with pink savannah grasses; gun-holding soldiers, clad in purple uniforms, stroll under darkened skies. Set against the horrors of eastern DRC's humanitarian disaster, where more than five million people have died due to war-related causes since 1998, Mosse's surreal palette presents an alternative view of the region's complex situation. Read this: Why the world ignores Congo conflict . It's this juxtaposition of alluring panoramas and defiant militia, of haunting beauty and unsettling violence, that forces viewers to pause and think. ""The idea was to use this medium to see into the unseen, to reveal the hidden and make visible the invisible of this forgotten conflict,"" says Mosse, 33. ""That works really on a very simple level through the color palette,"" he adds. ""The pink is so surprising and shocking and unnatural that really makes people stop."" Mosse first used infrared film in his highly praised 2011 photographic series ""Infra,"" also about eastern DRC. He now takes that project a step further with ""The Enclave,"" a multimedia installation that opened last weekend at the Irish Pavilion of the Venice Biennale in Italy. ""The Enclave"" is centred on a six-screen projection of a nearly 40-minute documentary, shot on 16mm infrared film. Throughout large parts of last year, Mosse traveled across eastern DRC with cinematographer Trevor Tweeten and composer Ben Frost. Embedded with armed militia, they captured video, stills and audio to create a powerful installation about the region's rebel groups and their surrounding communities. ""There's no plot, there's no narrator, there's no dialogue -- it's very much a video art piece,"" says Mosse, who first travelled to eastern DRC in 2010. Read this - War reporter: 'My camera is my weapon' ""Throughout, the camera it's very much a documentary work,"" says Mosse. ""It is unscripted; we just really go into the warzone and it comes to us. We can't really make things up; it's really what we had the luck to capture and what we turned our sights on."" Mosse says that at the heart of the project is an effort to bring ""two counter-worlds into collision: art's potential to represent narratives so painful that they exist beyond language, and photography's capacity to document specific tragedies and communicate them to the world."" ""The Enclave"" is exhibited at Fondaco Marcello in Venice until November 24.","Artist Richard Mosse has taken infrared images of eastern Congo .

"London (CNN) -- A former personal assistant to Nigella Lawson told a court Friday that the celebrity chef had lied in her testimony as a prosecution witness. Elisabetta Grillo, who is accused alongside her sister Francesca of embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from Lawson and her ex-husband, Charles Saatchi, insisted under cross-examination she had told the truth in her own defense. Both sisters deny fraud. On Thursday, Elisabetta Grillo testified that over the years she had worked for the family, she had seen signs of cocaine use by Lawson ""every three days, I don't know, regularly."" In her testimony last week, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, ""I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" Asked by the prosecution Friday if she thought Lawson had lied, Grillo replied, ""Yes."" She gave the same response when asked if Saatchi had lied. Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court he backed off that claim. In the e-mail, which the defense shared with the court in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Grillo said she had never seen Lawson take drugs but said she was aware that she used cocaine and cannabis. She recounted finding a packet containing white powder in the bathroom, rolled up bank notes, and credit cards and CDs with traces of white powder on them. Asked by her defense attorney how she felt about saying Lawson took drugs, Grillo said she didn't like it. But she said it was true. Nigella Lawson: Flirtatious celebrity chef . Personal spending . The two sisters are accused of spending large sums on luxury goods on company credit cards they were supposed to use for household expenses. Questioned by the prosecution Friday, Elisabetta Grillo insisted that Lawson had authorized spending on personal items, such as clothes, designer shoes and cosmetics, on her work credit card. She also said she'd been told she could take out cash on the card. Grillo described Lawson and Saatchi as generous, saying the latter had paid for her to go to Paris in 2008 for her birthday. The trial has been closely followed by the UK media because of its high-profile witnesses, Lawson and Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Allegations of drug use by Lawson emerged in June, around the time she and Saatchi were photographed having an argument in a restaurant. In the photos, which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers, Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat and appears to pinch and look up her nose. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. Lawson, widely known in Britain for her cookbooks and TV shows, has also appeared as a judge on ABC's ""The Taste"" in the United States. The trial continues next week.

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- A former Georgia sheriff's deputy convicted of murder in the slaying of his wife and a day laborer in 2008 was sentenced Friday to two consecutive life sentences plus five years in prison. That means that Derrick Yancey, 51, will have to serve at least 60 years before he is eligible for parole. He stared straight forward and showed no emotion as a Superior Court judge imposed the sentence for the murders of Linda Yancey, 44, who was also a sheriff's deputy, and Marcial Cax-Puluc, 23, a day laborer from Guatemala. Referring to Linda Yancey, Judge Linda Hunter said, ""She was an officer, she was a wife, she was a mother, she was a daughter, she was a sister, she was a friend. Mr. Cax-Puluc, who had barely began to live his life, he died that day. It's not lost on the court, and probably yourself, that today an officer has fallen because you were a law enforcement officer entrusted with so many responsibilities."" Hunter and the defendant, who both worked at the Dekalb County Courthouse, knew each other, prosecutors have said. Yancey was convicted earlier this month of two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Cax-Puluc and Linda Yancey were shot multiple times in the Yanceys' home in Stone Mountain. The defendant told police that he shot Cax-Puluc in self-defense after the day laborer had shot his wife. Prosecutors argued that Yancey was the lone gunman and that he hired Cax-Puluc as part of an elaborate plan to kill his wife. Speaking on behalf of his family, Linda Yancey's brother, Eugene Thomas, addressed Derrick Yancey, a father of two, directly. ""You had just killed the mother of your two children. During the night, or during the hard times or dark days, who are they going to call on? Can they call on their mother? No. She's there lying in her grave. That's because of your actions, Derrick."" Relatives and friends of both sheriffs' deputies packed the courtroom during the sentencing. The prosecutor said Cax-Puluc's family was unable to attend. Two of the 12 jurors who convicted Yancey also attended the sentencing. One of them, Susan Rodgers, told reporters that Yancey's call to 911, testimony from a ballistics expert and the medical examiner helped convince the jury of the prosecution's case. The jurors deliberated for about 22 hours before reaching a verdict.","Derrick Yancey showed no emotion as judge imposed the sentence .

"(CNN) -- Sudan's second most powerful official -- who was the man who signed a 2005 peace deal ending the country's decades-long civil war -- has resigned, the African nation's president said Saturday, according to state media. First Vice President Ali Osman Taha is leaving his post as part of a reshuffle of President Omar al-Bashir's Cabinet, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. He is doing so ""voluntarily,"" according to al-Bashir. Taha has long been associated with, and been a fervent backer of, al-Bashir. He served as Sudan's chief negotiator during north-south peace talks in 2004 that culminated with his signing the agreement in Nairobi, Kenya, early the next year. Five years later, following a popular referendum, South Sudan officially became independent from Sudan. In 2008, Taha stood firmly behind al-Bashir after the International Criminal Court filed genocide charges against the Sudan president for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, calling this move an attempt to ""paralyze"" his country. Taha was Sudan's first vice president -- the second highest post in the east African nation -- from 1998 to 2005, became second vice president between 2005 and 2011, then returned to the previous position. No detailed explanation was given in the SUNA report as to why Taha was leaving office. Al-Bashir told a crowd in northern Kharthoum that there are no differences or conflicts regarding the formation of a new government, according to SUNA. Dozens died earlier this fall in a spate of anti-government protests following the decision to lift its gas subsidies -- a move that nearly doubled the price of gasoline. The demonstrations also prompted a crackdown on local and international media.","First Vice President Ali Osman Taha resigns, state media reports .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League Group D match at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night. City had looked dead and buried inside the first 15 minutes as Bayern raced into a 2-0 lead. Thomas Muller opened the scoring after five minutes sliding home a low left-foot shot past City keeper Joe Hart. Seven minutes later, Mario Gotze doubled the lead capitalizing on a dithering City defense to fire home from six yards following a corner kick. But the tide started to turn against a rampant Bayern just before the half-hour mark as David Silva slid in to score after James Milner had headed the ball into the six-yard area. The England international was involved again for City's equalizer when he was brought down by Dante in the penalty area in the 59th minute. The resulting spot kick was tucked away without fuss by Aleksander Kolarov who sent keeper Manuel Neuer the wrong way. Three minutes later, Milner capped a memorable night for City and himself with a low, side-foot drive past the despairing hands of Neuer. ""To go two down against that sort of side and come back and win shows how much character there is in the dressing room,"" Milner said afterwards. ""To come here and put in that performance gives us a lot of belief for the next round."" City's win takes them level on 15 points with Bayern but the German champions finish first on account of their superior goal difference. Nevertheless, City and manager Manuel Pellegrini can take massive credit for the win. Not only was this Pellegrini's first win in ten attempts against Pep Guardiola, it also ends Bayern's run of 10 wins in the Champions League and 18 consecutive wins at the Allianz Arena in all competitions. In Group D's other match Viktoria Plzen beat CSK Moscow 2-1 to finish third and seal a berth in the Europa League. In Group A, Manchester United recorded a 1-0 win over Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk at Old Trafford. Phil Jones' 67th minute goal sees The English champions finish top of the group with 14 points.

Neither players, nor fans will be feeling very festive after the abandonment of their crucial Group B match after 32 minutes following a snowstorm in Istanbul. The ground rapidly turned from green to white as blizzard conditions descended on the Turk Telekom Arena. As the pitch markings disappeared under a blanket of snow, Portuguese referee Pedro Proenca ordered both teams off to allow ground staff to clear the lines with shovels. But their efforts proved to no avail and the game was called off a short time later. The match will resume on Wednesday at 12pm GMT, UEFA said in a statement.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan said roadside bombs have doubled and kidnapping have increased over the last year in the war-torn country, but said the cultivation of opium poppies that is used to produce heroin has declined. Roadside bombings in Afghanistan doubled to 2,000 in 2008,  according to the U.S. ambassador in Kabul. William Wood, speaking to journalists at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, gave an assessment of trends over the last year in the country and expectations for the upcoming year. ""2008 was a good year but it was also a hard year,"" he said. He said there were 1,000 improvised explosive device blasts in 2007 and 2,000 this year. ""IEDs don't advance the terrorist cause at all. They don't win them any territory, they don't win them any friends,"" he said, ""all they do is prove the presence and brutality of the terrorists."" Also, he said there were 130 reported kidnappings in 2007 and 250 in 2008, but it is thought that there have been many unreported abductions. The increase in IEDs have occurred mostly in eastern and southern Afghanistan, where there been an uptick in attacks. President-elect Barack Obama has said that he will shift his focus to Afghanistan, where the Taliban militant movement has been resurgent and where international troop deaths have increased in recent months. Concerned over the increase in fighting, military officials have said up to 30,000 additional U.S. troops could be sent to Afghanistan next year, nearly doubling the level of American troops there. Wood pointed to progress in combating the narcotics trade, which helps fund militant activity. He said there has been a nearly 20 percent decline in processing and cultivation of opium, pointing out that the local and international entities helped bring about the drop. He said that the nascent democracy has been energized by upcoming elections, the improved performance of provincial governors, and the resilient backing of Afghanistan by the international community. He said there will be a focus on combating government corruption in 2009, underscoring President Hamid Karzai's determination to confront the problem. Wood said he anticipates ""free and fair"" upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, with three million voters already registered. The International Foundation for Election Systems, which helps countries run democratic elections, says there will be presidential elections in next year and parliamentary elections are expected in 2010. The ambassador notes that the Afghan National Army is growing by 2,500 soldiers a month and he expects it to double in size by 2012. He said the Afghan National Police is looking to add specialized elements, such as anti-kidnapping and counter-narcotics units. Wood said the United States is backing an initiative by Karzai to help villages without international or local armies to protect them, a move that would help Afghans protect themselves and develop the confidence to do so. But he emphasized that the United States has no intention to provide these communities with weaponry.","Roadside bombings doubled, kidnappings rose in Afghanistan in past year .

"(CNN) -- A late-night scuffle after the Denver Broncos-San Diego Chargers game, which left at least three people with stab wounds, appears to be over a parking space rather than a football rivalry, police said Friday. Police took three people into custody, and two have been released pending further investigation, Denver Police Sgt. Steve Warneke said Friday. Justin Manzanares, 29, is being held for investigation of three counts of aggravated assault. A fourth person also may have been injured in the Thursday incident in the parking lot next to Sports Authority Field at Mile High, but authorities have yet to find that victim, Warneke said. That person left without seeking treatment, according to authorities. The three victims are now in stable condition after suffering non-life-threatening injuries, he said. ""It doesn't appear that this was related to the outcome of the game. It doesn't appear that this was Broncos versus Chargers. It appears this stemmed from a traffic altercation in which the suspects were backing out of a parking space and nearly struck the victims' vehicle,"" Warneke said of the 10 p.m. (12 a.m. ET) incident. The Denver Broncos referred questions to Stadium Management Company, which runs the team's stadium. The company said it was aware of the incident and was working with authorities. This is second violent incident after a Broncos game this month. A 30-year-old man died after he fought another person in a parking lot near the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium on December 1. That incident happened after a game between the Chiefs and the Broncos. Fighting erupts in football stands .

"(CNN)  -- Eight government troops were killed and at least 28 soldiers were injured in Abyan province when suspected al Qaeda militants attacked the governmental military base for Brigade 211 in Dofas district, a security official in the district confirmed. The militants escaped unharmed after the attack, which took place at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, the official said. ""The militants attacked us at a time we were not prepared. That is the reason why the death and injury toll of the troops is high,"" the official said. Two tribal fighters in the district said the militants have been attacking the base for the past two weeks in attempts to seize it. They said at least six attacks have taken place near the base. In a different incident, pro-government tribal fighters said that six suspected al Qaeda fighters were killed in a government air raid in Arqoob district of Abyan province, eyewitnesses said. Eyewitnesses said the bodies of the six militants were still lying on the streets of Arqoob four hours after the attack. The government has attacked the district hourly since the militants seized it on Sunday. Pro-government forces have been trying to retake the district since militants entered it, tribal fighters said. The fighters told CNN that they succeeded in uprooting at least nine road bombs that the militants had planted in the district of Arqoob by suspected al Qaeda militants.","Eight government troops killed, at least 28 soldiers injured in Abyan province .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- It was decades in the making but the long-awaited film based on Nelson Mandela's autobiography is finally here. Starring British actor Idris Elba as the beloved South African icon, ""Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom"" had its South African premiere Sunday in a buzzing Johannesburg cinema. ""During the preparation for 'Mandela,' I was very nervous about my abilities, my capabilities as an actor,"" Elba told CNN. ""But then it came to me as I was playing a 70-year-old man (that) if you put your mind on something you can actually do it,"" added Elba, famous for his role as a drug kingpin in U.S. TV series ""The Wire."" Read this: How Mandela became a brand . Mandela, 95, did not attend the premiere as he remains in critical but stable condition in his Johannesburg home, where he is being looked after by a team of military doctors. Yet relatives, friends and former freedom fighters all joined the movie's cast and crew in what was an exciting and emotional gathering. ""It's going to evoke a lot of sad memories for me,"" Ndileka Mandela, the former President's granddaughter, said at the red carpet before the film's screening. ""His incarceration was not a good time for me as his grandchild and for the family as a whole."" Read this: Mandela posters mark 95th birthday . Based on Mandela's autobiography, also called ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" the biopic follows Mandela's life journey from his childhood growing up in a rural village, through the anti-apartheid struggle and prison years, to his inauguration as the first democratically elected president of South Africa. The film's producer, South African Anant Singh, says he first started corresponding with Mandela about the movie's rights when the iconic leader was still behind bars. ""It began almost 25 years ago to try and get this story and to bring it to the big screen,"" Singh told CNN earlier this year. ""I have letters in his handwriting modestly saying, 'will people actually want to see a film about my life?'"" Watch this: Turning Mandela's life into a blockbuster . Singh announced Tuesday that the film will be screened at the White House on November 7. ""It is an exceptional honor to have the film screening hosted by President Obama at the White House as it is the first for a South African film,"" said the movie producer. ""It is also of special significance as it connects Madiba and President Obama as statesmen who were responsible for major paradigm shifts in their respective countries and who have special places in the hearts of their people."" The movie is directed by Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" ""The First Grader"") and also features fellow Briton Naomie Harris (""Skyfall"") as Mandela's second wife, Winnie. ""This is the biggest film ever to be made in South Africa,"" added Singh. ""We have two foreign actors and the (other) 143 are all South African. What we've tried to do is make a South African film and make in a way that it can engage audiences everywhere.""

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- You know the type: He or she is gossipy, passive aggressive and always looking to stir up trouble. That's right: It's the office drama queen -- and there's one in every office. ""There is not one business that doesn't experience at least some drama on occasion. When there are human relationships there is potential for drama,"" says Marlene Chism, author of ""Stop Workplace Drama: Train Your Team to Have No Complaints, No Excuses and No Regrets."" ""Misunderstandings happen even between highly evolved people who have good intentions. No matter how great the hiring practices, we human beings create a lot of drama when we don't know how to master our energy or clear the fog to see the bigger picture."" CareerBuilder.com: 5 reasons not to take a job out of fear . But there's an important distinction to be made between dramatic personalities at work, says Chism. There's the ""Drama Queen,"" who has a victim orientation -- and the ""Queen Bee,"" the persecutor. Both use manipulation, or undermining ways to get what she wants -- she may even be so temperamental that your colleagues walk on egg shells in order to avoid 'upsetting' her, Chism says. But there are differences between the two. ""The Queen Bee uses her knowledge and power to bend the rules and get her way. Instead of whining, she is more of a bully. Often she is very skilled, knows the office politics and has built strategic relationships so that she can overrule the one who is supposed to be in charge,"" Chism says. ""The employees know who the Queen Bee is because she usually is 'in' with someone in authority, if not her own boss, then someone of even higher rank."" But what many people don't understand are the motives behind such potentially destructive behavior. ""She wants recognition, power or attention. The drama queen has more clarity about what she wants. She is the one navigating the ship and that ship is pointed toward an island that is for her personal gain instead of toward and in alignment with the company mission and vision,"" Chism says. But knowing all the reasons how and why there's workplace drama or an office drama queen won't do you any good if you don't know how to effectively deal with that personality. Here are five tips for dealing with the drama queen in your office: . 1. Get support from the top. ""If you are a manager and you have a drama queen that undermines your authority, you must be willing to talk to your boss and get his or her support,"" Chism says. But if your boss contributes to the problem by letting the drama queen get her way, gather the courage to talk to your boss. ""Let [him or her] know how the drama queen's problem contributes to lost revenue, team problems and customer service."" 2. Clarify the roles and responsibilities. If the drama queen is doing things she's not supposed to, hold a team meeting and clarity the roles and the due process, Chism says. ""Let your employees know that you have backing from the top executives for dealing with someone going out of due process. Give an example so your team is clear on what is changing and what consequences will result if due process is ignored,"" she says. ""Have your employees sign and date a document confirming that they understand the new rules and expectations."" 3. Initiate a difficult conversation. Whether it's with your boss, the drama queen or both, make sure your mindset is in the right place before meeting with anyone. Create an intention to replace drama with harmony and to help everyone grow. CareerBuilder.com: Help! My boss is flirting with me . ""When you speak about the problem, take responsibility for the part you played before asking for the new behavior. For example, 'I let this slide for too long and didn't' clarify the roles and responsibilities,' or 'I was trying to keep the peace, and now this has become a customer service problem,'"" she says. ""Once you have owned the part you have played, you are free to state the problem and ask for the needed change."" 4. Set a boundary. ""Make sure the person with whom you are having the difficult conversation knows what the boundary is. In other words, what is the consequence of ignoring your request? What measures can you put into place so that you get compliance and commitment?"" Chism says. ""For example, 'Marie, if this happens again, unfortunately I will have to write you up and send you home on suspension.'"" 5. Discipline appropriately. If you've addressed the situation, and held the difficult conversation, one of two things will happen: you will either have eliminated the drama, or you will be tested, Chism says. ""If your drama queen employee decides to test you, you cannot afford to ignore the situation. You must fulfill the promise you stated when you first set the boundary, even if doing so will make you the bad guy. If the discipline includes termination, good record-keeping of attempts to help the employee grow, and follow due process will come in handy.""

"(CNN) -- The evolving life, face and story of Aesha, disfigured by the Taliban and featured on the August 2010 cover of Time magazine, has captivated audiences around the world. CNN has been following her for close to two years and, earlier this week, updated readers on how she is doing both physically and emotionally. We shared exclusive photographs of what she looked like before her latest surgery. Monday's procedure, the fourth in a series to reconstruct her nose, lasted about 9Â½ hours and went smoothly, said Mati Arsala, who's become a father figure to Aesha Mohammadzai. Doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where she's being treated, will not discuss her case. The reactions to the latest story about Aesha poured in -- both in the story's comments section and by way of e-mail -- even as the world's eyes remained trained on Friday's mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. ""This girl has more courage than all the fanatics that hurt her will ever have,"" wrote akmac61. ""Aesha you are a beautiful woman, wishing you the best! A whole new great life is ahead just for you, better things are coming,"" said tr0j4n. ""I am speechless, no words can express the depth of my feeling for this beautiful lady. I salute your courage in the face of illiteracy and extremism,"" added ProsNCons. Some readers wrote with special offerings for Aesha and the family caring for her. An e-learning company in Canada wants to help with her education. The owner of a bed and breakfast in West Virginia would like to treat them to a weekend getaway. A woman in Texas encouraged Aesha to open a Web-store, perhaps on Etsy, to sell her jewelry. Many others wrote with promises of prayers and extensions of love . As is so often the case when CNN mentions Afghanistan or simply the Muslim world, there were inevitably readers who took this opportunity to attack that faith. But more readers pushed back, perhaps hinting at decreased tolerance for such prejudices. There was also a fresh perspective brought on by the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. ""I guess in the Taliban, everybody with a twisted opinion gets to play God,"" wrote onaturalia. ""and unfortunately some in the US,"" responded are122. ""Exactly, and they are not all Muslims,"" said Rollins. Further down in the comments, Tina Mantooth added, ""I agree 100%. Islam doesn't teach hate."" ""Then why do Muslims do so many inhumane things?"" asked swarm4. ""Was Adam Lanza a Muslim? No,"" answered Elhaba Wackadoodle. ""Inhumane things are inherent in all humans. Some just act on them while the rest of us don't."" Some, who wrote to me directly, shared that the story about Aesha was a salve for the sadness that had befallen the country. ""It was especially nice to read after the horrors of Newtown,"" wrote one person. ""It did my soul some good to read such a hopeful story and to learn about the Arsalas' kindness and good will at a time like this, when everything seems pretty dark in the U.S.,"" wrote another. ""In a time filled with tragedy and sorrow, thank you for an uplifting and positive article,"" wrote a third. A couple of readers seemed bent on offending Aesha, those who care for her and pretty much everyone else, by making comments directed at her looks -- as if she had any control over them. But plenty of readers stood up for her, including lxNay, who wrote, ""She will be beautiful again. The surgery will repair her mutilations, but nothing can repair the ugliness displayed by some posters here. Stupid can't be fixed."" Some readers wondered why the country would help her instead of others. ""Who is paying for the surgery? Don't you think there are enough disfugured (sic) citizens in this country who needs (sic) more attention?"" asked Jayjay. In response, iPostEyeAm wrote, ""You misspelled 'I need a heart implant.'"" A handful of readers latched onto information in the story about how Jamila Rasouli-Arsala, Aesha's mother figure and a former OB-GYN in Germany, is struggling to find her way in America's medical community. If she wants to practice medicine here, she must start over in a residency program -- and so far she's had no luck getting into one. If she can't, the whole family, Aesha included, may end up moving to Germany. ""Concerning Jamila's plight, one has to ask what is going on in the U.S. concerning attracting and keeping good doctors,"" wrote bob. ""From what I am hearing, the U.S. doesn't sound like a land of opportunity but instead a country representing endless bureaucratic roadblocks, dogma and special interests."" Answered FBreen: ""Until there is an international standard for medical education and training, I am happy that such requirements exist."" There were lessons that readers from across the globe took away from the piece. A reader in Poland, who previously had not felt connected to Aesha's story, wrote, ""It is the right thing to shout it to the world, to make clear there is no acceptance to barbarism and abuse."" Added a writer from Nigeria: ""Am very happy the way you Americans are helping people all over the world."" And then there was this one, from a young woman who saw in Aesha's story something she knows too well. ""This is Anika from miles away, Bangladesh. I read your story on Aesha early this morning on the CNN website and it overwhelmed me with emotions I usually try to bury. I am 22 too like her and part of a society that may not bruise my body but wounds my soul and self confidence everyday. Stories like Aesha's inspire us, girls, struggling to live a normal and deserved life."" Whether she knows it or not, whether she means to or not, Aesha is making a difference.","Aesha's face and story have captivated readers across the world .

"(CNN) -- The coaching changes just keep on coming in the tennis off-season. First, Maria Sharapova hired Sven Groeneveld.

"London (CNN) -- Whether you were riveted by the royal wedding frenzy or can't wait for the 2012 Olympics to start, there's no denying the host city's multifaceted appeal makes it one of the most exciting destinations in Europe. CNN.com asked Richard Quest and our CNN.com colleagues in London for their best local tips. Where can you get the best view of the city? Quest: Go to The Spaniards Inn on Hampstead Heath. It's an old-fashioned pub, and from there you can look out over the London skyline. CNN.com team: The seventh-floor bar at Tate Modern has great vistas over St Paul's Cathedral and the river Thames. It's particularly romantic (though particularly busy) at sunset. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? CNN.com team: Galvin at Windows in Mayfair has wonderful views -- though you'll pay for them. Andrew Edmunds in Soho serves up local, seasonal food with a quirky British twist -- it's cozy, cute and sweetly romantic. At Clos Maggiore in Covent Garden, book a table in the conservatory -- it's decked out with blossom and fairylights for a magical touch to your evening. Rome's best pizza and more . Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Quest: Go to the Savoy for a classic British tea and to see what a $350 million renovation can do for a hotel. CNN.com: If beer's your thing, have a pint of British ale. London Gold, by Young's, or London Pale Ale, by Meantime Brewery are popular local choices. Where is the best place to people watch? CNN.com: On a fine evening, it's definitely Soho, especially Old Compton Street, Frith Street and Greek Street. You'll see clubbers, couples, theater-goers, tourists and celebrities all mixed up together -- it's a colorful and eye-catching combination! What is your favorite neighborhood?   CNN.com: London is a melting pot full of contradictions, it's always changing and it's also a lot more friendly than people think. Brixton is a great neighborhood, because it sums up all of London's best and worst bits -- it's culturally vibrant, fashionably edgy and economically and socially diverse -- into one big, boisterous, rapidly developing city-within-a-city. San Fran moniker a rookie mistake . How do tourists stick out and what's the best way to blend in? CNN.com: Tourists and Londoners rarely occupy the same areas at the same time. So to blend in, stay away from Buckingham Palace and Green Park, Leicester Square and Oxford Street. Instead, put on some London-look clothes (pick them up at Topshop, Whistles or AllSaints) and go north to Camden or Islington, east to Shoreditch, Dalston or Hoxton, or south to Brixton. What's the biggest misconception about your city? CNN.com: That the food's bad and expensive. London has cuisines from all over the world, all of them great and many of them very reasonable. Markets are a great place to pick up great-value bites -- try the stands at Portobello Market, the foodie heaven that is Borough Market or the buzzy restaurants and cafes at Brixton, Greenwich or Exmouth markets. Where do you go to relax? CNN.com: Primrose Hill is a nice spot at the top of Regent's Park with a great view of London. Richmond Park is beautiful with views of the city and lots of deer. If the weather's poor, head to a local pub and find a cozy spot near the fire. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? CNN.com team: Take a walk through Soho to people-watch and grab some streetfood. If you can, squeeze in a show -- you'll be close to theaterland. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? CNN.com: Madame Tussauds is a major tourist trap and Leicester Square can get pretty horrible. But even Londoners like a stroll on the South Bank, a ride on the London Eye or a boat trip from Waterloo to Tower Bridge -- complete with typically cheeky British commentary. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? CNN.com: The area around Brick Lane is a fun area to go out, especially in the summer. People flit from bars to restaurants, just hanging out and enjoying themselves. It also has an impressive cluster of curry restaurants, but make sure you don't settle for the first one you see as they usually offer different deals and freebies. What is a good local souvenir? CNN.com: London's rightly famous for its music scene. There are currently lots of great female singer-songwriters based in the capital, so head to a record store (we love Sister Ray's) and pick up the backing track for your visit. Try Ellie Goulding's ""Lights"" for sparkling British pop or Anna Calvi's eponymous album for something altogether more dramatic. Quest: Buy one pair of knickers or underpants from Marks & Spencer. Then you'll truly be like a Brit!","Try the old-fashioned Spaniards Inn pub on Hampstead Heath for skyline views .

"(CNN) -- What began as an online protest over the controversial case of an alleged rape of a then-14-year-old girl became a street demonstration Tuesday night as hundreds of protesters gathered in a small Missouri town demanding ""Justice for Daisy."" It was the first physical protest since the case launched a social media fervor driven by online activist group Anonymous. A few relatives of the alleged victim cried as people gathered, telling CNN they were glad to see some people in Maryville, a town of 12,000 residents, finally supporting the girl. Daisy Coleman says a teenage boy raped her in 2012 when she was 14. Coleman's mother, Melinda, says that after her daughter's alleged assault, her children received threats. Melinda Coleman was also fired from her job as a veterinarian at a clinic. The Colemans have since moved from the town in northwest Missouri, about 100 miles north of Kansas City. In April, their house in Maryville -- which had been vacant and for sale -- burned. Some of the protesters who came to the rally on Tuesday were out-of-towners who were so moved by the case they drove several hours to attend. They said they were hopeful that the rally would inspire a wider conversation about rape and rape victims. Melinda Coleman, who was not at the rally, said she was heartened to hear so many people had gathered in support of her daughter. She held back tears of her own as she told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"": ""I think it's a wonderful sentiment and I'm really touched ... and happy."" She said she is ecstatic the case has been reopened after a special prosecutor was appointed Monday. ""I think that just the fact that we're being heard and we're getting a chance at justice is huge. All we've ever wanted was to have some justice,"" she said, adding that she has yet to meet with the new prosecutor. In an interview with Erin Burnett last week, Daisy Coleman described leaving her house during a sleepover and going with a boy who was later charged with sexual assault. The charges against Matthew Barnett, 17 at the time of the incident, were subsequently dropped. A lawyer for Barnett said last week that his client cooperated with authorities and admitted he had sex with Daisy. ""While many find Matt Barnett's behavior reprehensible, the legal issue was whether a crime was committed,"" Robert Sundell said in the statement. Daisy Coleman's friend, Paige -- who says she was raped by a different boy that same night -- had her case settled in juvenile court. CNN does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because Paige, Daisy and her mother have chosen to go public. CNN has agreed to identify Paige by just her first name. On Monday, a new special prosecutor promised to review the case ""without fear and without favor."" ""I know that this case has raised a variety of concerns in northwest Missouri, so please know this: This case will be thoroughly reviewed,"" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said. A judge appointed Baker as special prosecutor days after a different prosecutor, who dropped charges, said he'd request the move. The initial prosecutor, Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert L. Rice, has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the girl and her relatives refused to cooperate. ""There was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he said in a statement. A charge against the boy's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an iPhone was also discontinued. But the case got new life this month after The Kansas City Star featured it and CNN interviewed Daisy and her mother.

"(CNN) -- Trooper William Finn, a spokesman with the Washington State Patrol, was tweeting Wednesday under the handle @wspd5pio about an accident on Vancouver's Interstate 205. A car was traveling northbound when it crossed the grass median into the southbound lane, striking a pickup truck, head on. At 2:11 p.m. PT, Finn tweeted, ""Vancouver - SB 205 @ Padden - Fatality collision. WB Padden to SB 205 is closed. Right lane SB 205 also closed in area. Use alt route!"" About 10 minutes earlier, Caran Johnson, a local scanner aficionado and a follower of Finn's on Twitter, had learned about the accident. She turned to the micro-blogging site to post new details and to reach out to her community. ""this accident sounds horrible,"" she wrote in a tweet posted at 2:01 p.m. PT under the handle @ScanCouver. Finn was at the accident scene gathering information. Before him lay the wreckage of a 2005 silver four-door Hyundai Elantra. Inside, the driver was dead. At 2:17 p.m. PT, Johnson posted, ""I'm trying not to panic, but my husband left work early and he drives 205 to get home. he's not answering his phone."" Desperate to contact her husband, or at least rule out the possibility that he was involved in the crash, Johnson reached out to Finn, like she had done many times before when trying to gather information about an accident. Opinion: The new pandemic -- road deaths . ""I may tweet something and she may tweet back. One night we exchanged a recipe for a low carb pizza,"" said Finn, who has never met Johnson. At 2:20 p.m. PT, Johnson sent a tweet to Finn, ""@wspd5pio do you have descriptions of involved vehicles?"" ""@ScanCouver sorry. Not yet.,"" Finn replied. ""It was terrible,"" the spokesman told CNN later. ""Immediately, I went into overdrive mode and I stopped tweeting the whole thing. I didn't want someone to find out over Twitter that their husband passed away. I didn't want her to find out that way. That is a hard thing to go through,"" he said. Finn would normally tweet a photo of the crash scene. ""I didn't put a picture on Twitter just in case that was her husband,"" he said. At 3:50 p.m. PT, Johnson's tweet confirmed her fears. ""it's him. he died,"" she posted for the world to read. Johnson's husband, Craig, was the only fatality in the accident. The cause of the crash is under investigation. A woman driving a second car involved in the incident was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, a broken femur and a collapsed lung. ""I feel terrible. I still feel terrible,"" Finn said.

"(CNN) -- ""Obama did worse."" ""Christie's toast."" Those are the two main things media commentators, from the right and the left, said about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie this week. Together, they expose the carelessness of the way we talk and think about the people who aspire to the presidency. Start from this point: Many on Christie's staff are implicated in an abuse of power that inflicted harm upon tens of thousands of people. Perhaps the governor didn't know that his staffers had gleefully ordered a traffic disruption on the George Washington Bridge last year. There is no evidence that he did know. On the other hand, these were the people the governor had chosen. This was the culture of the office he led. Opinion: A Chris Christie prosecution would be political dynamite . The phrase ""the buck stops here"" -- used by the governor at his news conference last week -- doesn't just mean the boss makes the final decision. It means the boss accepts blame for things that go wrong, just as he gains credit from things that go right. It means that ""I didn't know"" is not an acceptable excuse. But now proceed to this point: Almost everybody who seeks the presidency has demons to slay on his or her way to the office. The long road to the highest office in the land is a contest not only against political rivals but against the flaws of a candidate's own character and temperament. We all have such flaws. In would-be presidents, they tend to be outsized and to carry outsized importance. What we are looking for in a president is not a person without such flaws but a person who has struggled with them and overcome them. When a politician gets into trouble, as Christie has done, pundits suddenly decide that it's their job to mimic crisis managers. They offer advice on what the politician should say, what gestures he should offer, so as to escape blame and deflect criticism. Opinion: Christie's bogus 'stages of grief' But what matters after an episode like the bridge story is not the show of contrition but the real lessons learned. Trouble now can even be a politician's friend, if it jolts him off a path leading to worse trouble later. What Christie faces in the bridge uproar is not a communications challenge but a personal growth challenge. Can this combative politician recruit and run a team that understands better what is acceptable in political combat -- and what is not? At his news conference after the damning bridge e-mails came to light, Christie repeatedly denounced the abuse of conduct as contrary to his personal standards. Can he enforce higher standards in the future? Christie has a style and sensibility that has brought him far as a politician. He's just received a sharp warning that this style and sensibility will take him no further. Conflict is intrinsic to politics -- but conflict governed by rules, written and unwritten. Opinion: Christie's choice -- Be seen as a crook or schnook? Christie's team broke the rules to score revenge against a political opponent. Would a Christie White House govern the country in the same score-settling way? Even people inclined to support Christie are now wondering. His future will depend on convincing people that he's learned his lesson and changed his ways, and the best way to convince people that you have learned a lesson is actually to learn that lesson and actually to change your ways. At the end of his own career, Richard Nixon delivered an eloquent self-assessment of his own failure as president: ""Always remember others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself."" Unlike Nixon, Christie can benefit from that wisdom at the beginning of a presidential career rather than at its tragic end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Chris Christie's team broke rules to gain revenge against opponent .
He says question for governor is whether he can learn from this episode .

"(CNN) -- A niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren was fined slightly more than $2,700 on Wednesday for her behavior during an air-rage incident that caused a trans-Atlantic flight to be diverted, an Irish court official said. Jennifer Lauren pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of ""being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable (possibility) that you might endanger yourself or other persons on board"" an aircraft, said Susan Dermody from the Ennis Court Office. Judge Patrick Durcan accepted her plea and fined her 2,000 euros (about $2,715), which was just short of the 2,500-euro bail that earlier had been set for her, according to Dermody. It was also well short of the costs of the $43,158 incurred as a result of the flight diversion and inconvenience it caused to passengers and crew -- as detailed during Wednesday's court hearing in Ennis -- state broadcaster RTE said. The court also took ""into consideration"" a charge that Jennifer Lauren engaged in ""threatening, abusive or insulting (behavior) with intent to cause a breach of the peace or being reckless,"" added Dermody, the Irish court official. The 41-year old was arrested Monday at Shannon Airport in western Ireland after a Delta Air Lines flight from Barcelona to New York was diverted, according to RTE. During her appearance at Ennis Courthouse, Lauren's attorney, Sharon Curley, said her client had a number of medical conditions and was extremely sorry about the trouble she had caused, RTE added. The judge said he accepted that her behavior was out of character, but he had to also recognize the upset and disruption it caused. Lauren made no comment as she left the court. A Delta spokesman said the diversion was due to ""an unruly customer."" The plane, carrying 216 passengers, resumed its flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport more than two hours after landing at Shannon Airport, which is about 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of Ennis and also in County Clare. Lauren runs a business in the United States called Jenny Lauren Jewelry, products from which are available at Ralph Lauren stores and various select stores in California, New York and Colorado. According her company's website, Lauren is a New York City native who developed a love for creating jewelry as a teenager. She is a graduate of Barnard College and the University of New Mexico, as well as an avid traveler having lived in places such as Brazil, Japan and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her 2004 memoir, ""Homesick: A Memoir of Family, Food and Finding Hope,"" describes her effort to overcome an eating disorder and related health problems during her teens and 20s.","NEW: Official: Lauren pleaded guilty to being so intoxicated that others could feel endangered .

"(CNN) -- With Cristiano Ronaldo misfiring in front of goal it was left to Real Madrid defender Pepe to grab the winner as Los Blancos took closer order in the La Liga title race Sunday. Portugal's Pepe rose unmarked to head home Luka Modric's free kick early in the second half to give his side a 1-0 win at Espanyol. ""He is having a very good season,"" coach Carlo Ancelotti said of the veteran defender after his team kept a third consecutive clean sheet. ""At first he was hesitant about staying and I told him that he was important for us. It is no coincidence that the team has done better defensively in recent matches. The defenders have improved a lot."" With Barcelona and Atletico Madrid drawing 0-0 Saturday, the victory drew Real to within three points of the leading duo in a three-way title race. Ronaldo may be hot favorite to be crowned as the world's best player at the Ballon d'Or awards in Zurich Monday, but for once his famed finishing deserted him in this vital match for his side. Espanyol might have taken an early lead when Cristian Stuani headed wide, but the visitors took command and Ronaldo wasted his first chance after being set up by Karim Benzema. France forward Benzema headed just wide from a Gareth Bale cross just before halftime and it was Pepe who finally found the net soon after the break. A second appeared inevitable when Ronaldo broke clear but he was left ruefully shaking his head as Espanyol goalkeeper Kiko Casilla made another superb save. Another opportunity to get on the score sheet also went begging with the goal at his mercy after Casilla had saved from Benzema. But in the end Carlo Ancelotti's men easily held out for the victory while Ronaldo will now be hoping he can get the better of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery of Bayern Munich in the battle to be crowned as top player on the planet. ""He's a born winner and, despite the win, he doesn't feel like he did everything that he could because he didn't score,"" teammate Sergio Ramos said of the 2008 world player of the year. ""He knows that it was a very important win for the team. If I had my way, I would give it to him. There are a lot of people who think so around the world. The statistics are there to see, and he has broken almost every record out there. Maybe this year he deserves it more than others."" Earlier Sunday, reigning Serie A champions Juventus claimed a club record 11th successive win to maintain an eight-point lead over Roma at the top. Fernando Llorente scored twice for Juve in the 4-1 win at Cagliari, who had taken the lead through Mauricio Pinilla after 21 minutes. Claudio Marchisio and Stephan Lichsteiner grabbed the other goals for the visitors. Manchester United manager David Moyes was among the crowd at the match, increasing speculation over his intentions in the latest transfer window.

"(CNN) -- Hawaii's Garden Isle, Kauai, may appear to run on a different clock than the rest of the world -- unless you happen to glance at those 24 timepieces lining the west wall of the island's Lihu'e Airport departure lobby in three neat rows. Then, for however many seconds you wish to suspend your whole notion of time, it's the exact same hour, minute and second everywhere on the planet. In Belfast and Bhopal. Rio de Janeiro and Reykjavik. Mogadishu and Santo Domingo. And according to several other location-specific clocks straying from the usual Tokyo-Paris-New York scheme. ""When you look at these clocks it's a little bit odd,"" says Parker Croft, a Kauai-based architect, farmer and the creator of ""Time for One World,"" an international art exhibit that aims to dispel, however momentarily, the whole divided (and delusive) notion of multiple times around the globe. Inspired by Einstein ... and Y2K . Launched at Vermont's Burlington International Airport, the exhibit was conceived by Croft while working as a college professor in New England. ""It was 1999, shortly before the millennium change, and I was fascinated by that whole Y2K furor going on,"" recalls Croft. ""It led me into researching what time is really all about and how -- as Einstein poignantly put it -- time is 'man's most pervasive illusion.'"" The world's time zones, notes Croft, are ""currently based on political borders and outdated views of travel, commerce and communications. Divisions that are often illogical."" To address the point, the architect designed an alternative artistic model of a single, shared 24-hour cycle worldwide, which ""challenges us to relax our preconceived notions of structures that are contrived and artificial."" One universe. One world. One time. In Croft's model, time would be re-calibrated biannually on the equinoxes (fall and spring). Leap Year adjustments would be replaced by a brief semi-annual time stoppage (about three hours), a ""free time"" recess dedicated to a worldwide celebration of humanity and relationships. Can you imagine that? Could John Lennon even imagine that? Wounded Knee, Hiroshima, Falkland Islands represented . The overall effect of 24 oddly labeled clocks evoking universal time ""can be unsettling for some -- even threatening,"" says Croft. In fact, the curious clocks of Kauai serve to achieve the opposite. To unite and embrace. ""We are a planet that is joined in the beat of a single heartbeat,"" says Croft. ""And that heartbeat is best appreciated when it's recognized and celebrated."" Travelers glancing at the distinctive Lihu'e Airport clocks, installed more than a decade ago (the installation is on long-term loan to the Lihu'e Airport, says Croft, but isn't necessarily permanent) have plenty to get their time-addled heads around before their flight departs. There are no numbers on the clocks, which are divided into 24-hour faces instead of twelve, with each clock displaying the exact same time in perfect sync. Then there are the 24 locations labeled below each clock -- selected from 24 separate 15-degree segments of the Earth's surface, and all associated with important historical events. Ross Ice Shelf. Falkland Islands. Bikini Atoll. Watts. Not your typical wall clock reference points. Auschwitz is written in Polish. Hiroshima in Japanese. Tiananmen Square in Mandarin. Non-Sioux speakers will wonder where the clock labeled Cankpe O (Wounded Knee) refers to -- which is just the point. Some references should be obvious enough (Chernobyl). Others, like San Francisco (Summer of Love?) or Ahmedhabad (hint: Gandhi) or Injinoo may require personal interpretation or the services of Google. Which is also the point. ""The inspiration for independent research is an important part of this mission,"" notes Croft. ""The viewer's participation is critical."" A world without leap year . In a world as troubled and triumphant as this one, sliced into manufactured time zones that accentuate distance over connection, the presence of 24 perfectly synchronized world clocks beating as one in a small South Pacific airport might, at the very least, give travelers a moment's pause. And beyond that? Are there fans of Croft's suggestion to just stop time for three hours in the spring and fall? ""I don't think anyone takes it that seriously as a proposal,"" says Croft with a laugh. ""But there are certainly fans of the art installation who take the notion of stopping to celebrate humanity quite seriously. ""Personally,"" he adds, ""I think it would be a big improvement over New Year's Eve.""","Kauai's Lihu'e Airport is home to a unique collection of world clocks .
Each clock shows the time in locations with historic significance .
The installation is brainchild of a former university professor and current architect ."
"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- Nestled among the lush forests of Bali, near the hill town of Ubud, is one of the island's most remarkable villages. It's not just that each of the 18 homes of Green Village is constructed almost entirely from bamboo, but the form they take. From vast spiral staircases to a river-spanning bridge leading to the door of the newest house, the designs are more akin to luxury mansions than jungle huts. The exclusive abodes are part of creative director Elora Hardy's masterplan for sustainable, luxury living. As the daughter of John Hardy -- who set up Bali's Green School to educate a new generation of environmentally responsible students -- she and her team of designers and architects are also committed to changing common perceptions of what sustainability means. ""The first step (for us) is to create sustainable luxury living and different a mindset,"" says Green Village architect Defit Wijaya. Read more: Why emeralds make some of us mad with desire . Centered around a communal area but separated by discreet gardens, the villas are open to the elements adding to each of the homes' sense of space and light and affording some beautiful views of the surrounding forests and rushing Ayung river below. While some families live in the village, some homes are luxury retreats and can cost between $500,000 and $2million. The latest and largest structure lies on the other side of the river with its five stories towering above the forest canopy. Lucky guests traverse a glass and bamboo bridge to reach the villa's front door, itself a revolving glass oval. Clever design and roll-down shutters help protect those inside from rainstorms, while banana paper for interior walls and some aluminum for roofing are generally the only concessions to non-bamboo materials. Simplicity then is a key design element but it hasn't restricted some non-organic basics, with electricity and high-end kitchen fittings standard throughout the buildings. Wijaya's next project is to build a house with a 15-meter roof span -- twice as big as the largest so far -- and without any central columns. Read more: Beauty from the crypt - mystery of Europe's jeweled skeletons . ""This is the future. It's pure architecture...to breathe fresh air and touch nature, that's everything."" Much like any other house anywhere, some running repairs have to be made on small non-structural pieces of the homes. But the largest structural bamboo logs could last a lifetime, says Mokoho Sumerta, the chief builder from the nearby bamboo factory. ""We treat each piece of bamboo with a mixture of water and boric acid to stop fungus and insects. Before doing this a bamboo structure would last only seven years, now we're not sure how long a building can last."" Around 200 farmers across the island are paid to grow bamboo on areas of their land not used for agriculture. Some of the largest logs are 25 meters long but only take 3 years to grow. The angle of the main structural logs is also important to minimize the impact of direct sun and rain, which can weaken them. But the magnificent designs show another side of bamboo that those connected to the project, like Operational Director Patrick How, hope will be a greater legacy. ""Many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings, but we're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used.""

"(CNN) -- A police helicopter crashed into the roof of a pub crowded with Friday-night revelers in the Scottish city of Glasgow, trapping a number people under the debris, rescuers and witnesses said. Urban search and rescue specialists were working to make The Clutha Bar safe to access so firefighters can pull victims out, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. People remained trapped inside the one-story building, and communication was established between those trapped in the debris and rescuers, said Lewis Ramsay of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. ""I can confirm there are a number of casualties but it is too early at this stage to provide further details,"" Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick of the Scotland Police said in a written statement. The helicopter, carrying two police officers and a civilian pilot, crashed on the roof of the pub at 10:25 p.m. local time, Scottish police said. ""Given an incident of this scale we must all prepare ourselves for the likelihood of fatalities,"" the head of the Scottish government, Alex Salmond, said in a post on his official Twitter account. The crash occurred as patrons listened to the self-styled ska band Esperanza, which had taken the stage at the pub a short time earlier. Jim Murphy, a member of the UK Parliament, said he arrived at the pub just moments after the crash and saw people trying to get out of the building. ""Most of the helicopter appeared to be inside the pub,"" said Murphy, who represents a portion of Glasgow. Murphy estimated he saw at least 10 people who were injured, including some who were struggling with consciousness and others who were bleeding from head wounds. ""Until the emergency services got there, everyone who was at the scene just tried to do their best to help all those who were trapped and injured,"" he said. Grace Maclean and a friend were inside the pub listening to the band when the crash occurred. ""We were watching the band and there was kind of like a (roof) panel fell, there was a whoosh of dust, then we laughed that the band said, 'We didn't think we were going to bring the roof down,'"" she said. ""...The roof didn't come down. ...It didn't come completely down anyway."" Maclean said she was sitting at the back of the bar next to an older man, who suffered a cut on his head from the debris when crash occurred. ""Everyone was really confused and scared,"" she said. ""No one had a clue. There was no explosion. No bang. It was really quiet. There is no fire,"" she said. The noise came after the crash, when people began calling out for friends. ""Everyone was yelling (for) their friends, but everyone seemed to find everyone,"" Maclean said. Christina O'Neill, who saw the crash from her apartment across the street, said she heard what sounded like a low-flying airplane. ""I thought that didn't sound right for a couple of seconds,"" O'Neill said. After the sound of impact, she saw smoke and people running from the pub. ""I know there were a lot of people lying on the ground kind of getting looked into,"" she said. On the Facebook page of the band Esperanza, a post indicates the band members all made it out of the club. ""It seems that the band are all OK. Not so sure about everyone else,"" it said. Hours after the crash, the helicopter -- bearing the word ""police"" on its damaged tail -- was still smoldering. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service told CNN that there were ""multiple ambulances and a special operations team on site."" Gordon Smart, editor of The Scottish Sun, took to Twitter after apparently witnessing the crash. ""Jesus. Think I just saw a helicopter crash in Glasgow,"" he tweeted. In another post, he said: ""This is genuinely horrible. Spare a thought for those involved. Terrifying experience. Thought it was going to land on me."" The Clutha's Facebook page contained numerous posts from people concerned about the incident. ""Stay with it everybody, now is the time to think of others,"" wrote one person. ""People need help."" British Prime Minister David Cameron also tweeted about the situation. ""My thoughts are with everyone affected by the helicopter crash in Glasgow -- and the emergency services working tonight,"" he said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Treating flu-stricken children with anti-viral medication including Tamiflu and Relenza could do more harm than good, a new report has warned. Researchers say not enough study has been done into the long-term effects of anti-virals on children. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that while the anti-virals reduced the duration of illness by up to one day and a half, they had ""little or no effect"" on the likelihood of the children developing complications. The researchers conceded that they didn't know the extent to which their report applied to the current swine flu pandemic, but said, ""based on current evidence, the effects of anti-virals on reducing the course of illness or preventing complications might be limited."" In compiling their report, published in the British Medical Journal, the Oxford University researchers searched the world for trials of Tamiflu and Relenza on children under 12. They found seven in total; four relating to flu treatment, and three to prevention. They say none offered a big enough study to determine whether anti-virals have any effect on the chances of children developing serious flu-related complications. ""We've got very little data to go on. These drugs have been used on tens of thousands, in fact millions of children worldwide, and we've found only four trials of treatments involving less than two thousand children,"" said the report's author, Dr Matthew Thompson, a senior clinical scientist at the Department of Primary Health Care, the University of Oxford. ""We didn't find any trials of children under one. And none of the trials was big enough to show if there's any effect on serious complications like pneumonia or being hospitalized,"" he said. The report found that while anti-virals reduced the duration of flu in children, they had little or no impact on the likelihood of the child developing ear infections or any other condition that may require antibiotics. A review of one study into the effect of anti-virals on asthmatic children, who are considered to have a higher risk of developing complications from the flu virus, found that they did not reduce the risk of the asthma attacks. The report said that one in 20 children who take Tamiflu suffer nausea and vomiting, as indicated in warnings from the drug's manufacturer. ""That obviously can be a particular problem in young children and infants where getting dehydrated is a complication of influenza,"" Thompson said. The three studies that focused on the use of anti-virals to prevent influenza taking hold, showed that their potential to stop the spread of flu was ""fairly small."" ""We'd need to treat 13 children with the preventive course of one of these drugs to prevent one of them from getting flu,"" Thompson said. The report's authors suggested governments were too quick to recommend anti-virals as the first defense against the spread of swine flu. In the United Kingdom, people who suspect they have the virus are urged to phone a government helpline. If enough symptoms match the operator's list, they're given an online voucher so a ""flu friend"" can collect a course of Tamiflu. ""We're not criticizing the current Department of Health policy, but we hope they'll inform perhaps a slight shift in policy in terms of use of these drugs,"" Thompson told CNN. The British Department of Health said the report was right to suggest bed rest and over the counter remedies for people with mild cases of flu, but added that it was potentially dangerous to deter people with severe cases of flu from taking Tamiflu, including children. In a statement, a spokesman said: ""Whilst there is doubt about how swine flu affects children, we believe a safety-first approach of offering anti-virals to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward. However, we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also adopted a cautious stance. The chairman of the BMA's general practitioner's committee, Dr Laurence Buckman, said doctors always have to balance the risk of major complications from swine flu with the potential side-effects of anti-virals. ""While we know they are safe, we do know that vomiting and diarrhea can occur in some children and adults who take them,"" he said, adding ""The more we learn about these drugs the more we will know how to treat patients with the most up-to-date clinical evidence.""","Researchers examined studies into effects of anti-virals on children .

"(CNN) -- One after the other, dozens of cars and trucks slammed into the back of a multicar crash in Massachusetts until about 70 vehicles had been wrecked and at least 35 people had been taken to hospitals, the Massachusetts State Police said Sunday. Two people were seriously injured, Sgt. Stephen Marsh told reporters. The accidents began before dawn on icy Highway 290, Marsh said, and didn't stop until the chaos stretched 500 yards. Marsh said that as cars came over a rise, drivers saw the accidents and tried to brake but were caught up in the chain of collisions. Other motorists were able to see the trouble in time only after so many cars were piled up that they stretched out over the incline, he said. There were four commercial trucks and about 65 passenger vehicles involved. One of the cars that was rear-ended was a state trooper's cruiser, which was stopped at the site of one of the early crashes. Marsh said some of the cars were wedged under the tractor-trailers that turned sideways, blocking the roadway. The road, near Worcester, was closed for about five hours. A bus was brought in to help transport some of the injured to hospitals. New York train derails, killing 4 and hindering commutes .","Two people were seriously hurt, Massachusetts State Police say .

"(CNN) -- So, let's say you're doing a Google search for ""Kings."" Did you mean the L.A. hockey team or the Sacramento basketball team? Maybe the TV show? Or maybe you actually wanted to know something about monarchs. Google on Wednesday announced Knowledge Graph, a significant change to how search results are delivered that the company believes will make their search engine think more like a human. ""The web pages we [currently] return for the search 'kings,' they're all good,"" Jack Menzel, director of product management at Google, told CNN in an interview. ""You, as a human, associate those words with their real-world meaning but, for a computer, they're just a random string of characters."" With Knowledge Graph, which will begin rolling out to some users immediately, results will be arranged according to categories with which the search term has been associated. So, in the above example, boxes will appear with separate results for the hockey team, basketball team and TV show. The user can then click on one of those boxes to only get results for the specific topic they were searching. ""It hones your search results right in on the task that you're after,"" Menzel said. More specific searches, say for the name of a celebrity, will render boxes with basic information, as well as links to what Google believes are possibly related searches. Menzel says the initial version of Knowledge Graph has information on 500 million people, places and things and uses 3.5 billion defining attributes and connections to create categories for them. The feature will begin rolling out as early as Wednesday afternoon for some users in the United States and eventually be available on desktop, mobile and tablet searches. It will first become available in English, then in other languages, Menzel said.","Google introduces Knowledge Graph, a revamped effort to make search more intuitive .

"Washington (CNN) -- In 1980, Nelson Mandela was sitting in a South African prison cell, serving a life sentence. On the other side of the world, a young college student named Barack Obama was riveted by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and the brewing crusade to free the renowned activist. Little did they know that nearly three decades later, the two would have something in common: They would be the first elected black presidents in their respective countries. U.S. President Barack Obama has made it no secret that he considers Nelson Mandela one of the greatest influences -- if not the greatest -- in his life and in the lives of countless others. Throughout his first five years in office, he has repeatedly referenced Mandela, either invoking quotes from the anti-apartheid icon or spreading his messages of freedom and equality. ""We have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth,"" the President said Thursday while marking Mandela's death. ""He no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages."" Left and right use Mandela's death as opportunity to bash their favorite bogeymen . Answering a 'call' At Occidental College in Los Angeles around 1980, Obama first forayed into political activism â€” a protest against apartheid. It was the beginning of what would become years of studying Mandela's speeches and writings. ""In the most modest of ways, I was one of those people who tried to answer his call,"" he wrote in the forward to Mandela's 2010 memoir ""Conversations with Myself."" Obama has acknowledged that none of the obstacles he faced growing up compared to those of the victims in South Africa, but Mandela's ""example helped awaken (Obama) to the wider world,"" he wrote in the forward. ""Through his choices, Mandela made it clear that we did not have to accept the world as it is -- that we could do our part to seek the world as it should be,"" he added. In his own book, ""Dreams of my Father,"" Obama recalls giving his first public speech, in which he made a plea for the trustees at Occidental to divest from South Africa. ""I really wanted to stay up there, to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause."" Following his involvement with the demonstrations, Obama began pursuing his interests in public policy, transferring to Columbia University where he dug deep into books and courses about race and social justice. After graduation, he became a community organizer in Chicago. Making history . When Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Obama was well into law school at Harvard and getting ready to start the next phase of his career. Mandela's funeral, farewell plans: a day by day breakdown . That same month, Obama made history of his own â€” though on a much smaller scale. He became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, a story big enough to elicit a headline in the New York Times. In his interview with the Times, Obama said, ''I personally am interested in pushing a strong minority perspective. I'm fairly opinionated about this,"" he said. ""But as president of the law review, I have a limited role as only first among equals.'' Four years after graduating law school, and not long after Mandela won a Nobel Peace Prize and was elected president, Obama published ""Dreams of my Father"" in 1995. In the memoir, he lumped Mandela in with a group of men whose attributes Obama aspired to emulate. ""It was into my father's image, a black man, son of Africa, that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela,"" he wrote. A year later, Obama was elected to the Illinois state Senate, a path that would set him on a fast-moving track that landed him a spot on the presidential ballot just 12 years later. 'A personal hero' As Obama made his way up the political ladder, Mandela was continuing to spread his influence, campaigning for justice and human rights around the world. He didn't seek reelection in 1999 -- keeping his promise to serve only one term -- and he became intimately involved with AIDS awareness, a disease that killed his son at the age of 55 in 2005. Obama met Mandela for the first time in 2005. Obama, a senator at the time, was riding to a Washington event when his office called; Mandela was in town and asked to see him. The two men met at the Four Seasons Hotel. Obama: Mandela was influential, courageous . After that, Obama and Mandela had occasional interactions and conversations, including a phone call from Mandela after Obama was elected president in 2008. Obama called Mandela in 2010 after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash. While Obama considered Mandela a champion, he frequently noted he was not alone in his views about the icon. ""He's a personal hero, but I don't think I'm unique in that regard,"" he said in Senegal. ""I think he's a hero for the world."" During his first year in the Oval Office, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize -- a decision that sparked controversy, considering that his career on the world stage was only at its infancy at that point. Obama was keenly aware of where he stood in line. ""Compared to some of the giants of the history who've received this prize, Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela, my accomplishments are slight,"" he said in his acceptance speech, also paying tribute to those who were suffering in their respective fights for freedom and justice around the world. ""I cannot argue with those who find these men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I."" 'That's what brings me back here' On a trip to Africa this summer, Obama and his family visited Mandela's cell on Robben Island, a spot Obama visited as a senator in 2006. But this time, he got to bring his two daughters, Sasha and Malia. Life under apartheid: demeaning, often brutal . ""For me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country ... that's a great privilege and a great honor,"" Obama told students at the University of Cape Town in June. With Mandela gravely ill, Obama did not get to visit him during his trip; he met with Mandela's family instead. While in South Africa, Obama noted the ""outpouring of love"" for Mandela, saying it spoke to ""the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country."" ""That's what Nelson Mandela represents,"" he said at a town hall-style meeting with young people in Soweto. ""That's what South Africa, at its best, can represent to the world, and that's what brings me back here.""

"(CNN) -- Nothing says you've made it in life or business quite like the glamor of a yacht or private jet. These extravagant toys of the rich and famous are perhaps the ultimate in status symbols, good for business and a comforting boost to the ego of their wealthy proprietors. The only problem is attaining one of these stylish items has traditionally required a shed-load of cash preceded by a healthy dose of success -- but that isn't necessarily the case anymore. An increasing number of people are pooling their resources to buy up and then share grandiose luxury products like yachts and private jets through fractional ownership initiatives. ""It's great to bring clients and business contacts on the boat because the boat is a place more small ... more intimate,"" yacht owner Dino Ballestra told CNN. Ballestra previously owned his vessel outright but recently sold off a 75% stake to other investors, keeping the remaining 25% for himself. ""Because the costs of running a boat are very high I'm looking to share the pleasure of the boat with a group,"" he explained. See also: Are piloteless jets within reach . Fractional ownership models like those employed by Ballestra work upon the basic principle that things you don't use all the time are worth splitting costs over. The concept was first introduced to the field of luxury travel in the 1980's by forward-thinking firms such as Netjets, who brought together buyers to purchase private jets using a time-share-like model. Today, internet savvy companies such as Flyvictor have constructed their own market-based version of the fractional ownership model. ""We're helping the industry to become more efficient by allowing owners to charter their aircraft through the victor platform and allowing people who want to charter a jet -- not own a jet -- and take all the benefits of flying private to and from destinations,"" explained Flyvictor founder, Clive Jackson. Flyvictor's website acts as a forum where owners or co-owners can advertise their jets for charter or hire. Those looking to fly solo or band together with fellow travelers meanwhile can browse to see what's on offer. Customers are never guaranteed to get exactly what they are after but if they're lucky they may be able to pick up a bargain. ""Everyone likes to do deals, particularly the ultra high-net-worths, so if they can find an empty aircraft flying back for $50,000 dollars then why not, and if they can't they'll book a full fare aircraft,"" said Jackson. See also: Luxury jet makers take the long view . These same principles of savings and efficiency are at the core of yachting company, Monocle, which aims to bring fractional ownership to the high seas. According to Monocle president, Loren Simkowitz, sharing guarantees the benefits of ownership without the hassle and expense of full management. ""It's the high cost ... that drives people out of yachting,"" he said. ""Most people use (a yacht they purchase) three to four weeks a year. The rest of the time it sits around as an idle asset depreciating. You spend more time managing the boat than your business,"" he added. With an increasing number of high-net-worth individuals looking to save money where they can, Simkowitz believes those opting for fractional ownership plans will only increase in the coming years. ""I think it's the wave of the future,"" he continued. ""People are much more fiscally prudent with their money. People don't want to be tied down to an asset they use infrequently. They're smarter than they were in 2000,"" he added.","Fractional ownership initiatives are making some expensive luxury items more affordable .

"(CNN) -- A man who pleaded guilty to perpetrating a hoax by saying his 6-year-old son was drifting over Colorado in a balloon began his jail sentence Monday. Richard Heene turned himself in Monday morning at the Larimer County Detention Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, said Dean Karges, a detention services specialist at the jail. Heene pleaded guilty in November to a felony count of attempting to influence a public servant. Prosecutors said he and his wife staged their son's disappearance to generate publicity for themselves because they wanted to star in a reality television show. A judge sentenced Heene to spend 90 days in custody. He will spend 30 days and nights in jail but is eligible for work release during the last 60 days of his sentence, said Linda Jensen, a spokeswoman for the district attorney. If he has a job during that time, he would get out of jail during the day and return to spend the night, she said. He also must serve four years on probation and complete 100 hours of community service each year. Heene told authorities in October that his son, Falcon, was drifting over eastern Colorado in a homemade balloon that had come loose from its moorings in the family's backyard. Authorities raced to track the balloon while puzzling over ways to rescue the boy inside. Their efforts received widespread news coverage that riveted people around the nation. ""This has gotten more media attention than any other case we've ever had here,"" Jensen said. When the balloon came to rest in a field, however, Heene's son was not inside. The boy later was found hiding in the family's house. That night, during an interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" the boy gave authorities what Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden called an ""Aha! moment."" ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" Falcon said in the interview after his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when he heard his parents calling for him. Later in the interview the Heenes said their son was simply confused. Authorities said Heene's wife, Mayumi, later admitted the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities. She was sentenced to 20 days in jail, but her term will begin after her husband's sentence ends so their children will have a parent able to care for them. Richard Heene recently maintained on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that the incident was not part of a plan for fame. Alderden said Heene's claim ""shocked"" him. ""The evidence against Mr. Heene and Mayumi at this point is really overwhelming,"" the sheriff said. ""There is no doubt in my mind that this thing was a hoax, and I really doubt that there's very few people in America who don't understand at this point that this was an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Richard and Mayumi.""","Richard Heene turns himself in at detention center in Fort Collins, Colorado, official says .
