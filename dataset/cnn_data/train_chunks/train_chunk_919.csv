"By . Wills Robinson . Jailed: Shaun Colclough, 40, lured women to his studio with the promise of free photos . A fashion photographer who previously raped an 85-year-old woman has been jailed for seven years for sexually assaulting two aspiring models. Shaun Colclough, 40, lured the women in their twenties to his studio in Hackney Wick, London, promising he would help them improve their portfolio for free if he was allowed to use the images. He had built a career as a legitimate photographer working with a range of fashion companies, but could not resist sexually humilating women. Colclough used industry website Model Mayhem to look for girls who were unable to pay for photographs and were willing to do nude work. During the photo shoots, which lasted for several hours, Colclough would ask the girls intimate questions, bully them into striking explicitly sexual poses and tell them to perform oral sex on him. He tried to hug and kiss them on their arrival, and asking them to pose in every outfit they bought with them before telling them to strip. When they refused to do open-leg shots he would try and force their legs apart, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. He refused to give the prints to another girl as agreed, and told her she would either have to pay £15 for a disk or give him oral sex to get the pictures for free. Colclough tried to force one woman's legs apart and touched her vagina through her clothes. It led to five women complaining to the police but Colclough was only convicted of sexually assaulting the two women. He asked the second woman her if he could kiss her intimately before pinning her down. At one point he stood on top of her and forced his toes through her underwear. Colclough was convicted of two counts of sexual assault but was acquitted of the other three charges. During the trial it emerged that Colclough had previously served a six-year sentence for raping an 85-year-old woman in her own home when he was aged just 22. He followed her home and attacked her in 1996, but was not caught until his DNA was matched to the crime in 2002. Attack: When the models arrived at his studio inside this building in Hackney Wick, London, he would try to hug and kiss them before bullying them into posing in sexually explicit positions . The photographer admitted that the DNA match proved he had committed the offence, but said he had been extremely drunk at the time and had no memory of the incident. Judge Sheelagh Canavan told him: 'You targeted these women on the basis that they were likely to be vulnerable and unlikely to stand up to you.' The judge added he had completed a sexual offenders course in prison, and a second one when he was released into the community. She said: 'You've had, if you were ever going to, the tools and opportunity to put your offending behind you. 'Your sexual gratification is, and I am sure always will be linked to the humiliation and degradation of women.' Sentenced: Jailing Colclough at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said his sexual gratification was linked to the 'humiliation and degradation of women' She added: 'Your victims will have to live with the memory of what you did to them.' She ordered that his hard drive, memory cards and tower unit be destroyed, but allowed him to keep his photography equipment. Three of the women who made allegations against him were present and one yelled at him as he was led out of the dock.","Shaun Colclough, 40, lured women to his studio in Hackney Wick, London .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A four-year-old boy has been mauled to death by a pack of dogs after wandering in to his father's backyard alone. Javon Dade, Jr. was reported missing from his dad's home in Miami-Dade, Florida, where he had been spending the night, around 10am on Wednesday and police found his body 20 minutes later. He was discovered in the overgrown grass behind the home, with his large stuffed bear just a few feet away. Six dogs - two female terrier-boxer mixes, a male pit bull and three terrier-boxer mixed puppies - were also found in the same backyard and seized by Animal Control. Scroll down for video . Victim: Javon Dade Jr. was found mauled to death in his father's backyard on Wednesday morning . Authorities have said they do not know how many - or which - of the dogs attacked the boy but say it is likely Javon was playing with the puppies when an older dog attacked, the Miami Herald reported. It is likely that at least one of the older dogs became protective over the litter, Local 10 reported. They will now be testing the dogs' DNA to determine which were responsible for the attack, and they are continuing to investigate how the boy got in to the backyard. On Wednesday, as the boy's tiny body lay beneath a sheet on the grass, his grandmother, Jocelyn Dade was seen wailing outside the home - barely able to stand. The boy's . father, Javon Dade, Sr., who had been at home at the time with his . girlfriend, also appeared in the street, inconsolable. Authorities . later interviewed the father to determine whether negligence was . involved in the death of his son. Police said any decision on charges . would come from the Miami-Dade state attorney. Heartbroken: His grandmother, Jocelyn Dade, was overcome with emotion as she walked close to the area where her four-year-old grandson was found killed in Miami-Dade on Wednesday . Shock: The boy's mother, Doreen Reyes (center), who is no longer with Javon's father, was supported as she walked towards the home. The boy had been staying with his dad for the night . Tragic: A yellow sheet was placed over the boy's body, close to where he dropped his stuffed bear . The property's landlord, Kenneth Narbin, told CBS 4 that he had warned his tenants to remove the dogs or face eviction last week. 'They snuck the the dogs on the property,' Narbin claimed. Owning a pit bull in Miami-Dade is against county ordinance and can carry a fine, but a Miami-Dade Animal Shelter official said it was unlikely anyone would face a fine. 'It's not going to accomplish anything,' Kathy Labrada said. Laws also state that homeowners are not . allowed to have more than four adult dogs living in a single-family home . on less than an acre, but because three of the dogs were puppies, this . does not apply. The dogs will remain at an Animal Control shelter until the police conclude their investigation, Labrada told the Miami Herald. Seized: Three adult dogs (top) and three puppies - aged between two and four months old - were seized . Devastated: Javon, pictured with his mother, who he lives with, had been staying the night at his father's . Killed: Authorities believe the little boy was playing with puppies when an older dog became protective . Neighbors said that Javon Sr. and his girlfriend had lived at the home for about three months, but they could not recall seeing the boy in the neighborhood before. Javon Jr. lived with his mother, Doreen Reyes, in Palmetto Bay. She was also seen arriving at the home, held up by friends. Relative Tomas Rodriguez said that Javon was a 'loving kid who would talk to anybody'. 'His life got robbed from him,' he said.

"By . Alexandra Williams . The bodies of six climbers reported missing in the French Alps have been found. The group was last seen leaving a mountain hut on Tuesday on route to summit L'Aiguille d'Argentière, near Chamonix. Mountain police launched a rescue operation but efforts were hampered by the heavy rain and snow. Five climbers from a party of six reported missing on the Mont Blanc range in eastern France were all found dead today (file photo) This morning they recovered five bodies before finding the sixth in a crevasse hours later. All six of the dead are believed to be French. The . group consisted of an experienced mountain guide and five members of . the UCPA, a non-profit French organization that sends people aged seven . to 39 on outdoor sports holidays. According to reports, the six people had been roped together. The . four men and one woman, aged between 27 and 45, and the 42-year-old . guide, a fully-qualified salaried guide for the UCPA, had set out at 4am . on Tuesday despite the bad weather warning. They fell 820 feet to their deaths, according to police. The group – on the second week of a two-week climbing course in Chamonix - had three ropes, each with two people. A rescue helicopter gets ready to set off for Mont Blanc, where the bodies of five French climbers have been found . Commander . Jean-Baptiste Estachy, from the Chamonix Mountain Police said: 'They . fell 250 metres. It would have been instant death. It was a violent . fall. 'We believe the accident happened in the middle of the day. 'We do not yet know the cause of the accident. 'Five bodies were found this morning and the sixth was located this afternoon in a crevasse. 'The . alert was given yesterday evening by the guardian of the refuge . (mountain hut) where the group had been staying. He said they had been . due to return to the hut between 2pm and 4pm. 'He knew the guide and he sensed things were not right so he alerted the police. 'Two . helicopter flights were made that evening to try and locate the group. There was a storm that night and the search was resumed again in the . morning.' Rescuers later found the body of the sixth member of the climbing group in a crevasse on the mountain (file picture) The group was believed to have been on their descent from the summit when tragedy struck. An inquiry has been opened into the accident. It . is the most serious accident in the Mont Blanc Massif since the 2012 . avalanche on Mont Maudit that claimed the lives of nine climbers, . including three Britons. The route to the summit is considered medium difficulty and involves a mixed terrain of snow and rock. L'Aiguille d'Argentière is a 12,800 feet summit in the Mont Blanc massif range between France and Switzerland. All had set off to scale the Aguile d'Argentiere with an experienced guide, but got into difficulty in poor weather conditions . The . first ascent was by a British party comprising Edward Whymper and . Anthony Adams Reilly with guides Michel Croz, Michel Payot and H. Charlet on 15 July 1864. The route they took was via the west flank and . the north-west ridge. It . has been a deadly period for Mont Blanc range. During the last two . weeks of July six climbers died – two from Ireland, two from Finland, . one from Germany and one from France. The . UCPA was formed in 1965.

"By . James Gordon . A little brown bear who injured her paws in a fire is being nursed back to health after being found in a driveway in Washington state. Steve Love who lives in Methow Valley heard his dog barking and even his horse was acting up, so he went to see what all the commotion was about. He spotted a helpless bear cub hobbling in his driveway. The six-month-old had been injured in a fire and severely burnt her paws. Scroll down for video... Exhausted: A severely wounded bear cub hobbled up the driveway of a Washington state homeowner and ended up riding an airplane to a California wildlife sanctuary . The care she needs: The 37-pound baby bear, nicknamed ""Cinder,"" was in agony, with third-degree burns on all four paws and badly scorched sections of her ears, face and body . Mr Love approached the bear to help it but was scared off by the menacing growling she was making. Eventually he threw pieces of fruit at the furry animal and even managed to give her some water. 'Later in the evening, she was lying down making pitiful whimpering noises,' Mr Love told KOMO. 'I got about six feet away, sat down and talked to it in a soothing way, telling it things would be okay. It seemed to make it feel better. It stopped making the noises.' Fish and Wildlife responded to the call and eventually captured the 35lb female. The little bear tried to escape when the officer used his catch pole but was unable due to her injuries. Her paws were scorched from walking across the burnt landscape of coals and hot ash and she had tried to alleviate the pain by crawling on her elbows. The blaze in the Methow Valley in north-central Washington is the largest wildfire in the state's history. It . has burned more than 250,000 acres and destroyed 300 homes, kiling one . person and countless animals. Bearing up? The cub had limped up a driveway and then took shelter under a horse trailer . Brave: With her feet bandaged up, Cinder, a badly burned, 35lb, female bear cub, is put into a crate before a flight from Pangborn Memorial Airport in East Wenatchee, Washington, to Lake Tahoe . Ouch: Washington State Fish and Wildlife bear and cougar specialist Rich Beausoleil holds the poor cub . The cub was then transferred to Wenatchee, Washington, where state biologist Rich Beausoleil became responsible for her welfare. She was aptly named, Cinder. 'All four paws were third degree burns. She has some burns to her face and arms and chest. Those were relatively minor and I think that will grow back. It's the four feet we're worried about,' Mr Beausoleil said. He gave the bear,some yogurt and dog food. Looking for a more permanent home for the brown bear he decide to take her to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, a place that helps burned bear cubs rehabilitate. Pilot Bill Inman of Seattle transported the cub in his small, private airplane. 'She is eating and drinking very normally and that's a great sign so we're optimistic that she'll make a recovery,' Mr Beausoleil said. What's in a name? The 6-month-old bear cub was named Cinder . Recuperating: The cub, pictured,  whose paws were badly burned in the state's largest wildfire .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Fernando Alonso believes Mercedes to be the surprise of the Formula One season - and now the benchmark for Ferrari to aspire to. Come the start of the campaign, rumours implied Mercedes had adapted more to the new regulations compared to fellow power-train suppliers Ferrari and Renault. But it is fair to assume no-one expected Mercedes to blow away their rivals as they have done this season and usurp Red Bull as the force to beat. Falling behind: Fernando Alonso has been left behind by Mercedes this season with Ferrari . Runner up: The Spaniard finished second in Hungary, and is yet to win a race yet this season . From the 11 grands prix's over the first period of the season, Mercedes team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton have claimed 10 poles and won nine races between them. With eight grand prix's to run once F1 returns from its summer break later this month, it is simply a question of when and not if Mercedes will win the constructors' championship and one of their drivers the main prize. 'Mercedes have surprised everybody,' said double world champion Alonso. 'Now we are getting used to seeing them dominate every weekend, but I remember when we were in Jerez and Bahrain testing these new cars with very complex technology. 'We were all struggling, but straight away they were okay, and now from 11 races they've won nine and nearly always been on the front row. 'I would say they have been the biggest surprise - a good surprise - this year.' Leading the way: Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton (left) of Mercedes have lead the way this season . Challengers: The team-mates and rivals have won nine of the 11 races so far this season . By contrast, Alonso has again driven beyond the capabilities of his car, hauling himself on to the podium twice in the 11 events. Consequently, both he and Ferrari have nothing much to play for other than being the best of the rest, albeit with the determination to one day soon be battling Mercedes for honours. 'Mercedes are motivation for us,' added Alonso. 'We know we can do a much better job as we haven't done a good one so far. 'We are making some progress, but the benchmark has changed - last year it was Red Bull, this year it's Mercedes. 'We simply have to get on top of our problems and try to arrive at their level.'","Mercedes are the surprise of the Formula One season, believes Alonso .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Kimi Raikkonen has firm belief that Ferrari can again turn him into a grand prix winner - just not this year. Raikkonen's return to Maranello this season has been a bitter disappointment as it was firmly expected he would provide team-mate Fernando Alonso with a run for his money. But the change in the regulations and the introduction of the new power unit has left Ferrari trailing, and Raikkonen with a car that for the most part he has not enjoyed driving. Improvements: Kimi Raikkonen recorded a season best sixth for Ferrari in Hungary last time out . Still got it: Raikkonen claims he still has the speed and can win races with Ferrari in the future . Of the 142 points Ferrari have accrued in the championship to date, Raikkonen has collected just 27 of them. Eight of those came from his best result of sixth in the last race in Hungary at the end of last month prior to the current summer break. To boot, it was from one of his worst grid positions of 16th due to a qualifying gaffe by the team that cost him a place in the second session. Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion with Ferrari, knows much still needs to be altered with the car and within the team before his situation changes drastically for the better. 'It's been a hard first part of the year,' said Raikkonen. 'I know I've not lost speed from last year, so it's been disappointing to fight against the issues and problems we've had. 'I hope the second part of the season will be much better than the first, but one slightly better day doesn't change an awful lot. In the shade: Despite finishing sixth, Raikkonen still trailed team-mate Fernando Alonso (left) in Hungary who came home in second behind race winner Daniel Ricciardo (centre) and ahead of Lewis Hamilton (right) Better times: Raikkonen rejoined Ferrari this season having last raced for them in 2009. The Finn won the world championship while with the Maranello outfit two years earlier . 'It doesn't take away the mistakes, the things we have to improve, to make us work much better as a team. 'There are a lot of things that need to be done to make sure we are where we should be.' Yet Raikkonen firmly believes the team are on the right track, even if progress is slow, which is why he has one eye on next year, not just the final eight races of this season to come. 'I believe in people and the team, that we can put ourselves where we should be, and there are some signs,' added Raikkonen. 'They've been putting people in the right areas, and I'm sure in the future it will pay off big time. 'We know where we are, what we have to do, but there's a long way to go to be where we want to be, as a team, as Ferrari. 'We have to make big steps for next year, to keep improving things, and I know we have good plans. 'We just have to go step by step to improve the issues we have and hopefully we can put things in the right order for me to be happy all the time with the car. 'That will then allow the team and myself to progress to where I feel we should be and to try to win races.'","Kimi Raikkonen claims he has seen signs of improvement at Ferrari .

"By . Sportsmail Reporter . Lewis Hamilton has vowed not to change his style as he seeks to avoid that 'if only' feeling come the end of the season. Following the team orders furore during the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, Hamilton remained defiant he had done nothing wrong. In ignoring instructions to let by Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg on lap 51 - given the two drivers were running different strategies - Hamilton put his own interests first ahead of the team. Third: Remarkably, Hamilton finished on the podium despite starting from the pit lane in Hungary . VIDEO Hamilton should have obeyed team orders - Rosberg . On the other hand, Hamilton is not there to hand Rosberg a free pass to this year's championship as he has no doubt he would have finished behind the German in Hungary if he had let him through. Instead, Hamilton grabbed a stunning third having started in the pit lane after a fire during qualifying wrecked his car, with Rosberg a place further back in fourth, to cut the gap between the two to 11 points. It was the second astonishing drive from Hamilton in a week, bearing in mind he started 20th in the German Grand Prix and again went on to finish third after a brake-disc failure in qualifying. Reflecting on his decision in Hungary once the adrenaline had abated, the 29-year-old said: 'It was not about questioning authority, and I don't think I was being ruthless. Problems: In both the Hungarian and German Grand Prix Hamilton had mechanical problems in qualifying . Strained: The relationship between Rosberg and Hamilton has become strained in recent months . 'I was not even being bloody minded. I was doing my job and got to the top. 'I am hired to race and bring in points for the team. I am also hired to be me and race my heart out. 'I did not start at the front of the pack. I started from the pit lane, so in my mind I could not afford to lose anything else. I have already given away too much. 'At the end of the year I could be looking back saying 'if only the car did not catch on fire', or 'if only the brakes didn't fail', 'if only I hadn't made a mistake in qualifying', 'if only the engine had not stopped in the race'...all these things. 'So it was just a case of not giving a single point away. I tried my hardest to be ahead and I don't feel as though I was being obligated to help.'","Lewis Hamilton finished third in Hungary after starting in pit lane .

"By . John Watson . John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Following the fall-out from the Hungarian Grand Prix, Watson dissects the situation at Mercedes following Lewis Hamilton’s team orders snub. Mercedes were in the worst sort of position ahead of Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix, with one driver in Nico Rosberg starting from pole position and their other driver, Lewis Hamilton, beginning the race from the pit lane. When both drivers are at the front of the grid, it is a relatively straightforward situation. But when you have a different scenario as they had in Germany with Hamilton at the back after his qualifying crash or in Hungary, following his fire, they are less adept at dealing with the more complex plots. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton should have obeyed team orders - Rosberg . Dress to impress: Lewis Hamilton shows off his childish side by wearing bright colours . Podium finish: Hamilton managed to claim third place in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday . Niki Lauda, Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe remind me of The Three Stooges. You have got Lauda, sitting in the garage, like Alfred Neubauer, the legendary Mercedes team manager of the 1950s. The only problem being is that Lauda isn’t the team boss. Then you have Wolff who is oilier than the Torrey Canyon, and Paddy Lowe who is a technician. His speciality is engineering. It is not making those big team decisions, and he is the one I feel sorry for. Lauda has come out and said Hamilton was right to move over for Rosberg and this is part of the problem. The bottom line is, whoever was the person who chose to put these three people in charge has made a major error of judgement. I refer back to the one man who should be controlling all of this, and that is Ross Brawn. Mercedes-Benz brought in Lauda, Lowe and Wolff but they allowed the person who could have managed this situation to leave the team. In 2012, Mercedes panicked because of poor results and internal pressures and what they offered Brawn was a job he didn’t want to continue in. He stood back from it and Mercedes brought in The Three Stooges. Sunday’s race was there to be won. Red Bull and Daniel Ricciardo did an incredible job, but they showed up the absolute ineptness of the management team at Mercedes-Benz. Finishing only 3rd and 4th with what they had was frankly very poor. Admittedly, the situation was a complicated one. They had one strategy for Rosberg and a different one for Hamilton, and the inclement weather and deployment of the Safety Car threw up a host of variables, but neither Lauda, Wolff or Lowe are capable of rationalising or thinking on their feet. Quick changeover: Hamilton makes a quick pit stop during the Hungarian Grand Pix . In my opinion, consensus team management does not work. Teams benefit from one team principal based on years of experience, and who is the guy that has all of that? Brawn. Mercedes can talk and talk about how they will review their team orders, but it doesn’t matter what they say or choose to do. It comes down to their ability to deal with any, and every occasion that might arise on the day. In Hungary they did the best they could, but they failed. With Hamilton, they have a driver who is psychologically fragile. Then they have another guy, in Rosberg, who is a more complete and rounded person. Hamilton is the most naturally gifted driver out there - he isn’t the best driver, Fernando Alonso is - but in terms of his person, he is an incomplete and immature man and he needs to be babied and loved. The conspiracy theories are absolutely getting to him because he is beginning to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy, which does not exist but in his own mind. In terms of performance and speed, Hamilton should win the world championship, but it isn’t just about that, it is about winning the most points and in Rosberg you have got a very smart, clever guy who is a million miles ahead of Hamilton in those areas. He is infinitely smarter and smart wins Formula One titles. He also accepts and acknowledges that Hamilton in a one-on-one situation is going to beat him, but there is more to it than that. Rosberg is using his strengths effectively and using that as the way to beat Hamilton whereas the Briton has only got one way of beating his team-mate and that is sheer speed. Psychologically he can’t beat him, and there are undoubtedly a lot of mind games going on. If I could advise Hamilton, I would tell him to dump his advisers because they are doing him no favours. Support: Hamilton needs some more help from his family if he is going to be number one . VIDEO Hamilton should have obeyed team orders - Rosberg . Admiration: John Watson is a keen admirer of Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg (left) He needs, as his father Anthony use to provide, some proper guidance. Since he was released from the shackles of McLaren, I feel he is over-compensating in his own personal life. He needs a lower threshold of lifestyle than he currently has, but I am not 19 Management. They aren’t a motor racing management team, they are a showbiz management team and he needs somebody there to support him psychologically and to focus on the elements that are important in his career; when the going gets tough, you have to focus. Of course it is not his fault that he suffered mechanical issues in Austrailia, Canada, Germany and in Hungary. He is a winning machine and ought to be the world champion this year. but there is something that is skewing it. I respect and admire the way Rosberg goes about his personal life and his racing because he does it in the manner I concur with. He got married last month, but it was a private affair with family and close friends. Indeed there were no glossy magazines there. If I was advising Hamilton, I would tell him to stop going down the route he is appearing to go down and focus on his ability and his strengths. The example his team-mate is giving him is the example that he should be following. ** John Watson was speaking to Phil Duncan .","Hamilton decided to reject Mercedes' plea to let Nico Rosberg to pass him .

"By . Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Honesty got the better of Mauricio Pochettino. First, he admitted that he had next to nothing to do with the signing of Eric Dier, Tottenham’s unlikely hero on the opening day of the season. ‘The deal was already on the table,’ said Pochettino, although he clearly did not try to veto the £4million transfer from Sporting Lisbon set up by chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini. So, how about the serendipity which saw Kyle Naughton sent off in the first half and Dier moved from centre half to right back at West Ham on Saturday, enabling him to later burst forward and win the game in stoppage time? Dier delight: A last gasp winner from Eric Dier ensured Tottenham won their opening Premier League match . There was only one game in the top flight in 2013-14 to see both sides reduced to 10 men (Norwich v Newcastle in January). ‘No, no, I was not surprised to see him score,’ said Pochettino, with a shake of his head, before his face cracked into a grin and he indicated with a finger that his nose was growing like Pinocchio’s. With his improving English, and his gift for mime, perhaps we will begin to understand more of Pochettino’s character this season. The Argentine can laugh after a win, but he is driven. When Dier ghosted behind West Ham’s defence to collect a pass from Harry Kane and slide the ball into the net, he pummelled the air with both fists. This win mattered. A winning start as Levy’s ninth Tottenham manager (or head coach, as they prefer) and proof that he might be the one to inject steel into a club too often seen as lacking resolve. On this point, he was happy to take some credit. ‘The team showed we are ambitious and we believe every time that we can win,’ said Pochettino. ‘It is important to build this mentality and spirit. This will give us confidence and trust in our style and more belief.’ Pointing the way:  Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino joked he was not surprised to see Dier find the net . At Southampton, his high-pressing tactics produced intense, attractive football, but also clean sheets. Saints conceded just once in their first seven Barclays Premier League games last season. Spurs rode their luck at Upton Park, but keeper Hugo Lloris was magnificent and the new boss was rewarded for bold strategic decisions: not to remove a striker when Naughton was dismissed and to start with 20-year-old Dier ahead of captain Michael Dawson. ‘We made our decisions based on information from training and pre-season. It was a good decision from the manager,’ said Pochettino. Again with a smile. The versatile Dier, eased from central defence to full back after Naughton’s red card, defended solidly and offered greater adventure once West Ham’s James Collins was sent off and the teams were reduced to 10 a side for the last 27 minutes. What a start: Dier is the opening day hero as he celebrates with Danny Rose (left) and Christian Eriksen (right) An England Under 21 international, Dier is the grandson of former FA secretary Ted Croker. Born in Cheltenham, he was raised in Portugal from the age of 10, when his mother’s job took the family overseas. While Pochettino was having problems controlling the length of his nose, Sam Allardyce’s woes were also growing. The heat is already on the Hammers boss after losing a derby which might have turned out differently had Mark Noble scored a first-half penalty. ‘The start is a trigger to the whole season,’ said Allardyce. ‘The perfect example is our first two seasons back in the Premier League. We took 14 points in the first eight games in the first, and only eight in the first eight last season — which was a struggle.’","Mauricio Pochettino got Tottenham reign off to winning start .

As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. BROWN IDEYE IN A NUTSHELL . West Brom have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since Romelu Lukaku's loan spell came to an end, and Ideye is there to fill the void. The forward is strong, fast-paced, particularly good in the air, and has international and Champions League experience, too. His paperwork stalled his start with West Brom, but Ideye took part in his first training session after securing his eagerly-anticipated work permit and looks raring to go. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW! There's £60,000 in prizes including £1,000 up for grabs EVERY WEEK... Ready? Brown Ideye would cost you just £8.1million for the season in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game . Going good: Ideye tweeted that training was going well after securing his work permit in England . BORN: Nigeria, October 10 1988 (age 25) 2006-2007: Ocean Boys (5 apps, 1 gl) 2008-2010: Neuchatel Xamax (55, 23) 2010-2011: Sochaux (52, 17) 2011-2014: Dynamo Kiev (74, 33) 2014-NOW: West Brom . 2010-NOW: Nigeria (23, 5) Statistics based on league appearances. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE IDEYE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM? Plenty of eyebrows were raised when Ideye was bought by West Brom for £10m, but there's a good reason  the Baggies splashed the cash. Most importantly, he's a goalscorer. Ideye proved it in Switzerland with Neuchatel Xamax, France with Sochaux, Ukraine with Dynamo Kiev, and will now try to keep up his record in England with West Brom. It's easier said than done, of course, but you can bet this talisman  will get his name on the score-sheet on more than the odd occasion this year. Lukaku's loan spell at West Brom saw him score 17 goals. Ideye, another handful of a striker, will look to prove just as worthy. And don't worry about the 25-year-old being a slow starter, either. Upon his move to Switzerland, Ideye admitted he struggled with the cold weather. However, his two years there saw him hot enough in front of goal for Neuchatel Xamax, scoring 23 in 55 league games. Bright starter: Ideye's debut season in England looks set to be decent and the striker may be worth backing . Neuchatel Xamax to Sochaux - £4m . Sochaux to Dynamo Kiev - £7m . Dynamo Kiev to West Brom - £10m . THE DOWNSIDE . The Premier League is a whole different kettle of fish to that of Ukraine, France and Switzerland. Yes, Ideye's risen in stock over the years from his records in front of goal, but bringing that to England may be too tough of an ask. After all, more expensive strikers have tried - and failed - over the years... Then again, he may prove certain critics wrong and have a strong start as he has done elsewhere. The question is, do you feel lucky? Proof required: Ideye should hit the ground running but there is always that risk in the Premier League . CLICK HERE to sign up for MailOnline Fantasy Football and start managing your team ahead of the new Premier League season, which begins on August 16. HOW HAS HE DEALT WITH BEING DELAYED? It's best to hear it from the frustrated man himself. Ideye, speaking about his delayed work permit to the Express & Star, said: 'I've already put what happened behind me. 'Right now, I'm here and it's all about working, working, working. I've met the manager and met my new team-mates. 'The rest of (Friday) was all about recovery - some swimming and some running on the treadmill.' Back: Ideye has met his manager and new team-mates, and says it is all about 'working, working, working' WHAT'VE YOU GOT TO LOSE? At £8.1m, Ideye looks a steal. That's cheaper than Papiss Cisse, Mauro Zarate, Enner Valencia, Shane Long, Joel Campbell, and plenty more. At that price, Ideye may be worth backing - even as your third-choice striker!

Mauricio Pochettino's side get their European campaign under way on the Mediterranean island on Thursday as they look to make it through to the group stages for the fourth year in a row. Spurs are overwhelming favourites to progress against AEL, with bookmakers pricing the Cypriot league runners-up as 15/2 to win at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca. Warning message: AEL Limassol manager Ivaylo Petev believes his side are fully prepared for the Spurs match . Buoyant mood: Petev will be hoping he is smiling after AEL Limassol's match against Tottenham on Thursday . They are odds that will no doubt amuse their manager Petev, especially given they started this campaign with a 1-0 home win against a Zenit St Petersburg side managed by former Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas. The Russians eventually progressed from the Champions League third qualifying round encounter 3-1 on aggregate, but their home performance has buoyed the Cypriots. 'I believe August 21 will be a very good day for AEL,' Petev told www.uefa.com. 'There is belief and it is vital that there is in the squad. 'We managed to beat a club like Zenit in our previous tie in Europe and were then unlucky to go out against them because we played with 10 men for some 70 minutes [in the second leg].

"By . Chris Wheeler for MailOnline . Enrique Garcia Martinez, otherwise known as Kike, paid off another slice of his £3million transfer fee as he fired Middlesbrough to victory at the Macron Stadium on Tuesday night. It was the Spanish striker’s third goal in four games in all competitions since moving to Teesside from Murcia this summer, and gave Aitor Karanka’s side a much-needed lift following Saturday’s last-minute defeat at Leeds. It looked as though Boro would have to settle for a point after captain Grant Leadbitter converted a penalty at the end of the first half to cancel out a spot-kick from Craig Davies in the 27th minute. Winner: Kike celebrates after scoring late in the game to snatch victory at the Reebok Stadium . Spot on: Bolton's Craig Davies scores his team's first goal against Middlesbrough from a penalty . Bolton: Bogdan; McNaughton (White 90+4), Ream, Wheater, Mills; Feeney, Trotter (Danns 83), Spearing, Lee; Mason, Davies (Beckford 83). Subs: Lonergan, Dervite, Pratley, Kamara.

But when substitute Adam Reach touched Lee Tomlin’s pass into Kike’s path 12 minutes from time, the 24-year-old stole in ahead of Adam Bogdan to lift it over the Bolton keeper and into the net. ‘Everyone knows how important Kike is for the team, said Karanka. ‘The other lads know that when we create one chance Kike is going to be there to score. ‘We have a better squad than last year, better players and with these kind of players we be at the top.’ There were boos from the home fans at the final whistle as Bolton were left waiting for their first league win of the season. This was their second defeat in three games and the second time in four days they surrendered the lead following Saturday’s draw at home to Nottingham Forest. It had looked a whole lot brighter for Bolton when Davies smashed his penalty past goalkeeper Tomas Mejias after he had been brought down by Seb Hines midway through the first half. Bolton boss Dougie Freedman was convinced that Hines should have been sent off, however. ‘That decision was a game-changer, simple as that,’ he said. Celebrations: Davies is congratulated by team-mate Joe Mason after converting his penalty . ‘I don’t like to talk about referees but sometimes I’ve got to stand up for my team. Simple rules tell you that if someone is straight through and he’s pulled down, there is no covering defender (it’s a red card). ‘It was a shocking decision. We go 1-0 up and they are down to 10 men – it gives us a chance to win the game.’ Leadbitter levelled from the spot in added time at the end of the half when Kike flicked on a freekick and the ball hit David Wheater on the arm, with Bolton’s protesting in vain that it had come off the big defender’s thigh first. Bolton’s misery was complete when substitute Jermaine Beckford had an effort ruled out for a push late on.

"By . Leon Watson . The BBC producers who first signed up Jimmy Savile to present Top of the Pops had doubts over whether he was suitable and thought he was 'dodgy', it was claimed last night. Savile's background as a club DJ and manager sparked initial concerns among the show's bosses in the early 1960s before the allegations of sex abuse that have now engulfed the BBC emerged. Paul Jackson, the producer of hits shows Red Dwarf and The Young Ones, . and a former head entertainment at both the BBC and ITV, said BBC entertainment producers initially . rejected Savile. Scroll down for video . 'Dodgy': BBC producers had doubts about employing Jimmy Savile in the early 60s for Top of The Pops. Here he is presenting the show in 1962 . Mr Jackson, 65, was a teenager at the . time and his father, T Leslie Jackson, was one of the BBC producers who . attended planning meetings for what became Top of the Pops. He told The Guardian that his father had . asked him as a teenager, who the top DJs were and he . suggested Savile, having seen him at a ballroom in the north-west. 'My dad had been rostered to go to a . group meeting at the BBC,' Mr Jackson said. 'They were . thinking of launching what became Top of the Pops. When he came back . from it, it was almost as if he was saying to me, ""you made me look . silly"", as if I had been suggesting a gangster. 'A few days later he said to me, ""he'll never work for the BBC"". I didn't know exactly why … these things get said. 'But . literally, a year or less after dad said that, Savile was the first DJ . on Top of the Pops, which started in 1964. When I queried this he said, ""things change"". But he was an obvious choice. He was the most prominent . DJ of the time, on Radio Luxembourg.' Savile . went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and . returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006.

Savile went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006 . Mr Jackson . said he believed the reason for the BBC's initial reluctance to use . Savile on Top of the Pops was because of his background in the club . scene. As well as DJing he was a club manager in the 1950s but, according to Mr Jackson, he was thought of as 'dodgy' and 'you didn't cross him'. A former Yorkshire committee member of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain has also revealed that he was strongly opposed to Savile having anything to do with the charity in the 1980s and 1990s, because of his background in clubs and 'reputation for entertaining young girls'. John Oldfield, who was on the Yorkshire committee of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain from 1981 to 1996, and its chairman in 1989, said he didn't let him near the charity. Mr Jackson witnessed at first hand the heady mix of frenzied fans and sexual freedom which characterised the broadcasting and music industries in the 1960s and said attitudes had clearly changed since then. 'I was around at the BBC during the 1960s because of my dad. It was a different time. It wasn't now. The commissioners were fighting to keep the girls out of the dressing rooms,' Jackson said. 'We had the Beatles, the Rolling Stones turning up at White City to do shows. There was buzz, then a scandal about payola. Mr Jackson joined the BBC as a production assistant in 1971 and worked on some editions of Top of the Pops in a junior role early in his career. His credits as a producer include The Two Ronnies, Three of a Kind and Saturday Live. After a varied career at the BBC, as an independent producer and managing director of ITV company Carlton, he became the corporation's controller of entertainment in 1997, several years after Savile had stopped working regularly for the organisation.

"By . Martin Robinson . Dropped: Peter Rippon shelved Newsnight's investigation into paedophile Jimmy Savile and it was alleged today he refused to reopn it because he was furious when his decision was leaked . Peter Rippon, the man who shelved the Newsnight investigation into decades of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile, refused to reopen it because he was apoplectic his decision had been leaked, BBC sources have said. His call last December sparked the greatest crisis the corporation has faced for 50 years, and he was accused of orchestrating a cover-up just because they had spent huge sums on tributes to the paedophile who died last year. The BBC has since been dragged through the mud and forced to set up an inquiry into why exactly Newsnight's investigation was stopped. Mr Rippon has said that the investigation was cancelled because the Crown Prosecution Service did not charge Savile, and he has always denied there was any cover-up. Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is being described as one of the most prolific sex offenders in UK history. He is thought to have abused at least 300 victims over four decades, and police are following more than 400 leads. A friend of Mr Rippon told The Times: 'Peter said he always intended to pursue it (Savile's abuse). He then got so angry over the leaks. He spent most of Christmas dealing with that. Another added: 'He felt the leak was being used to attack the BBC and that influenced his decision not to resume the investigation.' It took a ITV documentary to reveal that Savile had raped and abused hundreds of children. It then emerged that Newsnight had carried out its own investigation into the paedophile DJ - including an interview with the same victim in the ITV documentary - nearly a year before. A BBC team spent six weeks probing allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, speaking to at least four women who claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events. But the report was shelved at the last minute at the request of Mr Rippon. It was not until last month that the BBC aired its own investigation into the scandal, on Panorama. Beast: Jimmy Savile's abuse, which involved at least 300 victims, included some attacks on BBC premises . It covered both Savile's crimes and the Corporation's reaction. Mr Rippon stood aside from his role at Newsnight after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story was 'inaccurate or incomplete'. The corporation's director general George Entwistle was hauled before a select committee last month to explain why and how it happened. He denied that the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women. Yesterday police arrested Freddie Starr and released him on bail after being questioned by detectives investigating claims he molested a schoolgirl in Jimmy Savile's BBC dressing room. Arrested: Freddie Starr and Gary Glitter have both been questioned this week about alleged sexual offences . He denies claims by Karin Ward that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl. He is the second celebrity to be arrested after Gary Glitter, 68, was questioned for ten hours on Sunday on suspicion of committing sexual offences. Detectives warned Savile’s living accomplices last week that ‘we are coming for you’, and have drawn up a detailed list of people they plan to arrest. Pressure: New BBC Director General George Entwistle after his appearance in front of MPs having been quizzed about the corporation's handling of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . Last night Newsnight sensationally claimed that a 'leading politician from the Thatcher years' was embroiled in a widespread paedophile ring - and repeatedly raped boys from a children's home. Alleged victim Steven Messham told reporters he was raped 'more than a dozen times' by the man, described on the programme as a 'shadowy figure of high public standing'. But despite a string of damning allegations, Newsnight reporters said it didn't have 'enough evidence' to name the politician, sparking angry claims on Twitter that the Beeb 'bottled it'.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Whales are capable of swimming vast distances across oceans, but they are also expert divers. And now a study has revealed that the shy Cuvier’s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet. Scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal's dives, which was 9,816ft (2,992 metres) below the waves. A study has revealed that the shy Cuvier's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft (2,992metres) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven Empire State Buildings - and stays below for 138 minutes . And the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven Empire State Buildings on top of one another - for 138 minutes. The New York landmark measures 1,250ft (381 metres) in height, excluding its tip. It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects. Marine mammal biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California and followed them for several months as they dived for food. Individual Cuvier’s beaked whales have beached in the Mediterranean and around the Canary Islands and the Bahamas, National Geographic reported. It is thought they did this because of sonar activity from ships, but none of the species have beached in southern California – the site of a Navy sonar testing area – close to where the study took place, according to Greg Schorr, a research biologist with the Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington. Studying Cuvier’s beaked whales is incredibly difficult as they spend a lot of their time in deep waters far away from the shore. It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the Cuvier's beaked whale (pictured) has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar . Beaked whales also rarely approach boats, according to Randall Davis, a marine mammal biologist at Texas A&M University in Galveston who was not involved in the study. Some species are only known from specimens that have died and washed up on shore, Dr Schorr said in the study, which is published in the journal Plos One. Recent research is only just giving scientists a good idea of how the whales spend their time and the experts admitted they did not expect to see any of the creatures dive almost 10,000ft (3,000 metres). Dr Schorr was so shocked that he initially checked that the tag had not malfunctioned, by placing an identical one in a pressure chamber to check it could withstand comparable depths. Dr Davis described the deepest dive as ‘spectacular’ and hypothesised that such efforts must be worth it for the animals to keep on diving. Individual Cuvier's beaked whales have beached in the Mediterranean and around the Canary Islands and the Bahamas. It is thought they did this because of sonar activity from ships (pictured), but none of the species have beached in southern California - the site of a Navy sonar testing area - close to where the study took place . He presumes they are rewarded by finding food such as deep-sea squid, but diving so deep can cause lungs to collapse and can even trigger convulsions. It is thought that Cuvier’s beaked whales get around these problems because they have rib cages that can fold down so there is less air in the lungs. But scientists are unsure how they manage to avoid high-pressure nervous syndrome, which causes convulsions. The team of experts hope that their research might help solve this mystery in years to come but are currently focused on whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar.

Emails and phone messages between foul-mouthed Barclays traders in New York reveal how they bragged about rigging energy prices in America to make huge profits. Critics yesterday said the expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the ‘rotten culture of casino banking’ that built up under disgraced former boss Bob Diamond. The bank faces a £270million fine by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly manipulating the energy market across Western America between November 2006 and 2008. Emails and phone messages between foul-mouthed Barclays traders in New York reveal how they bragged about rigging energy prices in America to make huge profits . Four traders are accused of conspiring to sell electricity at a loss to drive prices down. This would enable simultaneous bets on falling energy prices to reap huge profits, leading to losses of £86million for other investors and pensions funds. It is alleged to have taken place at four electricity-trading hubs across the western US – Mid Columbia in Washington State, Palo Verde in Phoenix, Arizona, and South Path 15 and North Path 15 in California. These hubs are where electricity is channelled, stored and then distributed around the region. Barclays and other banks trade in complicated financial instruments which bet on electricity price movements at these hubs. The accused Barclays traders – Daniel Brin, Scott Connelly, Karen Levine and Ryan Smith – face penalties totalling £11million. The bank faces a £270million fine by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly manipulating the energy market across Western America between November 2006 and 2008 . Connelly was described as ‘the leader of the manipulative scheme’ and the highest paid. He faces a £9.3million fine. The bank was also ordered to pay back £22million in profits made from the alleged energy manipulation scam. But, in arguably a more devastating blow to Barclays, the US regulator published a series of emails and phone messages sent by the bank’s traders. In a series of messages dated November 3, 2006, Ryan Smith bragged to a colleague that he had managed to manipulate the energy markets. He said: ‘I totally f****** with the Palo market today,’ adding: ‘I just started lifting the p*** out of the palo.’ Smith continued: ‘was fun. Need to do that more often.’ In a separate exchange on December 7, 2006, he said: ‘I’m going to c*** on the NP light and it should drive the SP light lower.’ Critics said the crude messages reinforced the immoral, profit-crazed image that Barclays has desperately tried to shed since new chief executive Antony Jenkins took over in August. Critics say the expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the 'rotten culture of casino banking' that built up under disgraced former boss of Barclays, Bob Diamond, left . John Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee of MPs, said: ‘This just shows how the rotten culture of casino banking that was built up under Bob Diamond went all the way through Barclays. Traders were clearly programmed to do anything to make a profit.’ The emails sent by Barclays’ American traders have echoes of the brash messages sent by their counterparts in London who boasted about rigging key interest rates. These were published in June when Barclays was fined £290million by UK and US regulators over the scandal. This led to the departure of Diamond and several other top executives. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘The American authorities’ allegations of Enron-style rigging of electricity prices shows what a toxic trail Bob Diamond left behind him.’ All four traders accused of rigging the energy markets are thought to have left the bank, although none are understood to have been fired. Barclays has been given 30 days to appeal and said it intends to do so. It said it ‘strongly disagrees with the allegations’, adding: ‘We believe that our trading was legitimate and above board and intend to vigorously defend this matter.’ Barclays is likely to argue that it did not have big enough positions in the energy market to be able to manipulate prices.","Critics said the expletive-ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the 'rotten culture of casino banking' that built up under Bob Diamond .

"By . Damien Gayle . Laser weapons are a step closer to deployment on Earth's battlefields as a U.S. defence company gears up to test a new land-based device. Boeing has announced that it has successfully mounted a 10kw solid-state laser on an eight-wheeled, 500-horsepower truck that could be used alongside conventional Army forces. The High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD) is now ready for field testing and over the next year will have a chance to show off its ability to acquire, track and destroy targets. Scroll down for video . Almost there: The truck-mounted laser weapons the army hope will prove to be a game-changer on the battlefield . The U.S. military has long hoped to develop a land-based, laser weapon that could be used to shoot down enemy missiles at the speed of light, but progress on the project has been slow. It is hoped that the new weapon can be used to defend ground forces against rockets, artillery shells, missiles and unmanned drones by destroying threats with a beam of super-powered light energy. U.S. and allied troops currently have limited options to defend against rockets, artillery or mortars. The short-range projectiles are airborne for only seconds, providing little time to take cover. And using heavy gunfire might inadvertently hit friendly forces in the process. But HEL MD’s laser beam, moving at the speed of light - approximately 186,000 miles per second - will hit targets with unprecedented precision and swiftness. Light speed: This artist's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice . Mike Rinn, vice president of Boeing . Directed Energy Systems and director of the programme, said: 'The Boeing . HEL MD program is applying the best of solid-state laser technology to . ensure the Army has speed-of-light capability to defend against rockets, . artillery, mortars, and unmanned aerial threats - both today and into . the future. 'High power testing represents a critical step forward for this innovative directed energy system.' The . latest field tests as part of Boeing's contract with the U.S. Army . Space and Missile Defence Command. Blaine Beardsley, HEL MD program . manager for Boeing, said: 'Phase II will allow us to build on the great . work we have accomplished over the past several years with SMDC. 'Our team is eager to demonstrate that this revolutionary system is capable of saving lives and ready for the battlefield.' The U.S. military is seeking contractors to build it miniature 'suicide drones' that can be flown into targets up to six miles away. The little planes, which could look like the remote-controlled aircraft used in a more domestic setting, could be used for kamikaze-style attacks on vehicles or buildings - even individuals if necessary. The Army wants the weapons, known as the 'Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System' (LMAMS) into war by 2016, and describe the weapon as a 'portable, covert weapon with strike capability against stationary or moving individuals, with a very low risk of collateral damage'. The 'plane' will consist of a drone, warhead and launching device with a maximum weight of less than five pounds. The aim is to fit the entire plane in a backpack, and be able to fly it two minutes after a target is agreed on. At that point, the plane must be able to fly for 15 to 30 minutes across up to six miles of territory before hitting its target. The Pentagon has long been keen to develop laser weapons, and not just because of their ubiquity in science fiction. Proponents of laser guns claim they are capable of incredible speed and precision coupled with relatively low cost and a seemingly near-infinite supply of 'ammo' constrained only by the availability of electricity. However, developing weapons to the stage where they are ready for battlefield use has so far proved a challenge as researchers battle with problems like cooling, efficiency and miniaturisation. In recent years other defence contractors including Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have demonstrated ship-mounted lasers capable of shooting down aircraft and disabling small boats. The U.S. military has been experimenting with laser weapons since the Seventies but it is only in the past few years that a high-energy laser has properly functioned as a weapon. Early systems used large, chemical-based lasers which tended to produce dangerous waste gases. More recently, scientists have developed solid state lasers that combine large numbers of compact beam generators, similar to LEDs. The 10kw capacity of Boeing's latest effort is fairly modest compared with the power levels the Pentagon hopes to eventually achieve. The threshold for weapons-grade lasers is generally considered to be 100kw. Boeing said their system could 'subsequently' incorporate a more powerful laser.","Boeing's land-based laser weapon could be used for missile defence .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A drought emergency has been proclaimed in California after a wildfire that erupted early Thursday morning claimed 17 structures, including a guesthouse that was part of the Singer estate. At least 10 renters were left homeless when the fire destroyed the garage and rental rooms above it as well as the guesthouse on the historic grounds of a retreat that once was the summer home of the Singer sewing machine family. Statues of Jesus and Mary stood unharmed near the blackened ruins. However, the main mansion, built in 1924 and a designated Glendora Historic Landmark, was spared. Hellish fire: Fire fighters try to protect the main house as fire burns a section of Singer etsate located at Kregmont Drive in Glendora . Fighting: Firefighters fought to save the Singer mansion from the Colby fire that broke out near Glendora, north of Los Angeles . Smoke clearing: The remains of the guest house destroyed by the Colby Fire at the Singer mansion on Friday, January 17, in Glendora, California . Landmark: Firefighters try to protect main house as fire burns a section of Singer Mansion located at Kregmont Drive in Glendora . Governor Jerry Brown has formally proclaimed California in a drought Friday, . saying the state is in the midst of perhaps its worst dry spell in a . century and the conditions are putting residents and their property in 'extreme peril.' Brown made the announcement in San Francisco amid increasing pressure . from lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and as . firefighters chased flare-ups in the wildfire that has . kept thousands of people from their homes. The proclamation . allows California to request a broad emergency declaration from . President Barack Obama, which would expedite some water transfers, . provide financial assistance and suspend some state and federal . regulations. Destroyed: Tenants lived in rooms above the garage of the Singer mansion which were destroyed by fire . Historic site: The main house on the Singer estate was saved from fire but outbuildings and the guest house burned to the ground . The fire around Glendora has swept through about two-and-a-half square miles of tinder-dry chaparral and destroyed five homes. It is 30 per cent contained. 'It's really a miracle that our chapel, our main house is safe,' owner of the Singer estate Jeania Parayno said. Alex Larsen, 50, rented a room at the estate. The musician had lived there for about four years. 'All my possessions are toast, burned toast,' he told the Los Angeles Times. Another tenant, Rudy Rosas, told the Daily News that he didn’t have time to grab anything but his birth certificate, wallet and a spare shirt before running from the house. 'I lost everything,' Rosas said. 'My room is destroyed. It’s just a wall, my window, and everything behind it is just debris.' Firefighters were chasing early-morning flare-ups Friday in a damaging wildfire that was largely tamed but kept thousands of people from their homes in the foothill suburbs northeast of Los Angeles. Spots of open flames chewed through brush along hillsides, raining embers and ash onto communities abutting the San Gabriel Mountains as crews doused properties in the path of the fire. Firefighters working overnight lit controlled backfires to cut down on fuel for the blaze. Drought: Water levels for many of California's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977 . Fast-moving: A helicopter drops water as firefighters battle the so-called 'Colby Fire' in the hills of Glendora . An acrid smoggy haze descended across the Los Angeles basin all the way to the coast. The National Weather Service said a red-flag warning of extreme fire danger in effect much of the week would remain in place until Friday evening because of low humidity and the chance of the region's notorious Santa Ana winds gusting to 30 mph in the foothills and canyons. 'We build up a little bit of confidence,' Los Angeles County fire Deputy Chief John Tripp said, 'but we always still have a threat.' 'Fire season just didn't end this year,' Los Angeles County fire Inspector Scott Miller said. Some 3,700 people from Glendora and Azusa evacuated at the height of the fire, county emergency officials said. Glendora residents were allowed to return home Thursday evening, but homes in Azusa remained under evacuation orders. More than 2,000 people remained evacuated, according to KABC-TV. Fire engines would stay in all the endangered neighborhoods through the night and helicopters were available to fly after dark if it became necessary, Tripp said. Nighttime gusts brought a few flare-ups, but they remained within fire lines. Two firefighters had minor injuries and a woman trying to fight the blaze near her home suffered a minor burn, Tripp said. Lit up: A full moon rises over the flank of the Colby Fire off San Gabriel Canyon Road in Azusa, as thousands of people were under mandatory evacuation orders overnight . Aerial attack: A helicopter flies above the Angeles National Forest, north of Glendora wildfires in Los Angeles County . Seventeen structures were damaged, including homes, garages, barns and other buildings, he said. Three men in their 20s, including a homeless man, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting the blaze by tossing paper into a campfire in the Angeles National Forest, just north of Glendora. They could face state or federal charges. According to Fox LA, those arrested were Clifford E. Henry Jr., 22, of Glendora; Jonathan C. Jarrell, 23, of Irwindale; and Steven R. Aguirre, 21, a homeless man from Los Angeles. Glendora Chief Tim Staab said the men were trying to keep warm and the wildfire appears to have been an accident. 'One was very remorseful for starting this fire,' he said. The Angeles National Forest was under 'very high' fire danger restrictions, which bar campfires anywhere except in fire rings in designated campgrounds. The mountains rise thousands of feet above dense subdivisions crammed up against the scenic foothills. Large, expensive homes stand atop brush-choked canyons that offer sweeping views of the suburbs east of Los Angeles. Almost under control: Authorities say the fire is now 30 per cent contained . City haze: The governor of California has declared a drought as water reservoirs dip and dry conditions make many areas a fire hazard . Whipped by Santa Ana winds, the fire quickly spread into neighborhoods where residents were awakened before dawn and ordered to leave. 'They're a little nervous, but I'm keeping calm for them,' she said. 'I've been loading the car up with important papers and getting the kids dressed. We'll just take some essentials and get going if we have to.' However, other homeowners chose to stay, despite firefighters' orders to get out. Some wore masks against the ash and smoke as they wetted down their properties with garden hoses. Prevention: U.S. Forestry Service fire crews conduct a burnout operation as flames near homes in Azusa last night . The last catastrophic fire in the San Gabriel Mountains broke out in 2009 and burned for months, blackening 250 square miles, killing two firefighters and destroying more than 200 structures, including 89 homes. The new fire could have abundant fuel to consume. Vegetation above Glendora, an upper-middle-class suburb of about 50,000 people, had not burned since a 1968 fire that was followed by disastrous flooding in 1969. Robert Aguirre, 21 . Clifford Eugene Henry, 22 . Jonathon Carl Jarrell, 23 . Many homes are nestled in rugged canyons and ridges that made access difficult. More than 700 firefighters were on the scene, along with 70 engines and a fleet of helicopters and air tankers dropping water and retardant. The smoke was visible from space in satellite photos. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory and urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities in directly affected areas.","Governor Jerry Brown has formally proclaimed California in a drought emergency Friday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . Many buildings in Northridge, California have not been changed to prevent earthquake damage even as today marks the 20th anniversary of the disaster that struck the area of northern Los Angeles. While there has been progress to rebuild and shore up freeways and hospitals, there has been less attention paid to concrete buildings and housing with ground-floor parking. 'That remains a significant problem. We really have not come very far,' said Jonathan Stewart, an earthquake engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles. Sudden: Los Angeles police officer Wayne Dean, whose body is covered by a blanket as his colleagues as they investigate, was one of the victims in the 1994 quake which was a 6.7-magnitude disaster . Damage: The January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake was felt over a broad area of Southern California, causing widespread death and destruction . At 4.31am on January 17, 1994, the ground shuddered beneath the bedroom community of Northridge, due to a magnitude-6.7 earthquake. After the shaking stopped, sections of the city laid in fiery tatters. Several dozens died and 9,000 were injured. The quake caused $25billion in damage - the costliest U.S. natural disaster at the time. The largest cluster of deaths occurred at the Northridge Meadows complex where 16 people were killed when their first-floor apartments crashed onto the parking garage below. The city doesn't keep count of how many so-called soft-story buildings exist and doesn't require mandatory repairs even after 1994 because many such buildings survived the shaking. The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety recently proposed surveying 30,000 apartments built before 1978 to determine which might be compromised during violent shaking as a first step toward possible retrofitting. Preventative measures: The state has made strides in retrofitting freeways and hospitals, especially after what happened on the Santa Monica Freeway as seen here . Small victories: Because the earthquake happened at 4.31am, there were very few people on the highway . The department has yet to receive funding to start the work. After . Northridge, the city required fixes to some 200 steel-frame high-rise . buildings that unexpectedly suffered cracked welds and 2,750 concrete . tilt-up buildings - erected with concrete walls and lifted into place by . cranes - that were poorly designed. Both types of repairs were . relatively easy and did not bankrupt property owners. Even . so, computer simulations released this week by the California Institute . of Technology and U.S. Geological Survey found mid-rise steel buildings . performed differently depending on the type of welding. Other retrofits were voluntary including efforts to buttress concrete-frame buildings. There are about 1,500 such buildings in Los Angeles County and between 16,000 and 17,000 statewide. Only . about 10 to 15 per cent are considered dangerous, said Craig Comartin, . who led a study by the Concrete Coalition, a volunteer group of . scientists, engineers and governments. Earlier this week, the city announced . it would partner with the USGS to develop a plan to address seismic . safety, including ways to get privately-owned buildings to be more . quake-proof. 'We're as well . prepared as any city in America, which is to say we're unprepared,' Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview with The Associated Press. Tragic: A multimillion-dollar home in the Pacific Palisades fell off a cliff during the quake (left) and rescue workers were sent out to the Northridge Meadows apartments (right) where most of the casualties occurred . 'I don't think anybody in America is very well prepared ... There's always going to be an earthquake we can't be prepared for. ' At least 57 people died, according to the state. A 1995 study put the death toll at 72, including heart attacks. Despite . the lag in reinforcing potentially dangerous buildings, strides have . been made in beefing up state-owned freeways and bridges by wrapping . support columns with jackets of steel. Several . freeway bridges that collapsed or were heavily damaged had been . retrofitted decades earlier, but the efforts were limited to tying . structures together using restrainers at the bridge joints. Techniques . have since evolved. Since . Northridge, the California Department of Transportation spent more than . $1 billion to further brace 1,155 bridges identified as at-risk. Only . two projects remained - a freeway overpass in Oakland that's scheduled . to be completed this fall and the Schuyler Heim Bridge in Long Beach . that's due in 2017. Two . hospitals suffered major structural damage, prompting lawmakers to . require hospitals statewide to strengthen buildings so they can still . treat patients after a disaster. Out . of 1,313 hospital buildings deemed at risk for collapse, 69 percent . have been retrofitted, replaced or demolished. The work continues . despite extended deadlines. Fire and water: A ruptured supply line burned in the water on Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, which was just some of the $25billion-worth of damage . Northridge was the last deadly quake to strike a U.S. metropolitan area. Wendy Yost lived through it. A student and resident adviser at California State University, Northridge, Yost awoke to a messy dorm room and a waterlogged bathroom after the toilet came off its base. Though the school was on winter break, some students stayed behind. With a candle in hand, Yost dodged broken glass in the hallway, knocking on students' doors to get them to safety. 'This wasn't my first rodeo when Northridge happened,' said Yost, who also survived the Loma Prieta quake that rocked the San Francisco Bay area during the 1989 World Series. Those born after 1994 have never experienced a major temblor. And for many who lived through Northridge, 20 years of relative seismic calm may lull some into a false sense of security. 'People forget,' said Tom Jordan, who heads the Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of Southern California. 'It's been ungodly quiet from a seismic point of view since Northridge.' Far from a film set: The disaster happened on the north end of Los Angeles, where Al McNeill looks over the charred remains of his home . To prevent amnesia, scientists and emergency responders have held an annual preparedness drill since 2008 to educate Californians and residents in other quake-prone states to 'duck, cover and hold on' during shaking. Northridge exposed a hidden fault. Afterward, scientists scoured for similar geologic structures lurking around the Los Angeles basin. Five years later, they discovered the Puente Hills fault that runs underneath downtown Los Angeles that could cause far greater damage. Budget cuts through the years have slowed efforts to map potentially dangerous fault lines. By seismic standards, Northridge wasn't a monster in terms of its strength or the destruction it wrought. Northridge didn't cause mass casualties like the 2010 quake in Haiti did, but a future quake certainly could. If a segment of the 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault unzipped and unleashed the 'Big One' as scientists call it, it would cause far greater chaos to lives, properties and lifelines including roads, pipelines and telecommunication systems. Despite intense study, there's no magic bullet that allows scientists to predict when a quake would hit. 'We're chipping away at it,' UCLA's Stewart said of the retrofit process. 'We're not where we would like to be, but we are making progress toward hardening the system.'","The last deadly earthquake in America took place 20 years ago today .

The audio input - which is now implanted inside the back of his skull - allows him to receive the visual spectrum captured by his camera via bone vibrations . A wifi connector inside the chip allows him to hear images sent from a mobile phone - without even looking at them. The cyborg antenna - or 'eyeborg' - is composed of a camera on one end and an audio input on the other end. The audio input - which is now implanted inside the back of his skull - allows him to receive the visual spectrum captured by his camera via bone vibrations. Every colour has a different vibration, meaning different paintings, images or even faces have a different note or sound. This audio input was once worn on the outside of his head, but now it has been implanted inside his skull - much like a cochlear implant - he has a greater depth of colour perception. The new wi-fi and bluetooth connectors in the chip also means he will be the first person in the world to experience an image without actually seeing it for himself. Mr Harbisson had the implant inserted . during a series of operations in Barcelona between December and this . month, and will be demonstrating it for the first time tomorrow. He . said: 'This announcement is not the launch of a new product and it is . not the presentation of new technology - it is the presentation of a new . body part that will allow us to extend our senses in unimaginable . ways.' Every colour has a different vibration, meaning different paintings, images or even faces have a different note or sound . Project spokesperson Mariana Viada said: 'The other antenna was attached, but this one is inside. 'There is now more distinction between the colours - it is much wider and more definite. 'But the most important new thing is that he can now connect with other devices. 'He can now not only perceive the colours that are in front of him but also colours that other people are looking at on their phones. 'Potentially, this means, that he could also communicate skull to skull with other people who have the implant, but at the moment he is the only one. 'How this will exactly work and the details will be revealed by Neil during his presentation.' Mr Habisson recently used the colour sound system to conduct the world’s first 'colour choir'. To create the music, Harbisson recorded the colours taken from an image of the Palau de la Musica using an antenna fixed to his forehead. These tones were ordered to create a musical score. Harbisson taught the musicians which colours matched with which frequencies, using his Eyeborg app. When the phone's camera is held over a colour, the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image. Each member played, or sung, notes based only on the colours they saw on the tablet devices in front of them and the tablets were controlled by Harbisson. He first got the idea for the eyeborg when he heard a talk about cybernetics given by Adam Montandon at Dartington College of Arts in 2003. The pair created the device and Mr Harbisson memorised the frequencies which related to each colour and decided to permanently attach the eyeborg to his head. He has since been trying to find medics who would implant the device into his skull and last year convinced a doctor and an anaplastologist from Catalonia to perform the operations. Speaking at a conference in 2012, he said: 'For me the sky is always grey, flowers are always grey and television is black and white. 'But since the age of 21 instead of seeing colour I can hear colour. 'So I've been hearing colour all the time for eight years so I find it completely normal to hear it all the time. 'At the start is had to memorise the names you have for each colour and the notes but after some time all this information became a perception and I didn't have to think about the notes and after some time this became a feeling. 'I started to have favourite colours and I started to dream in colour. 'When I stared to dream in colour is when I felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dream it was my brain creating electronic sounds it was not the software and that's when I started to feel like a cyborg. 'It had become an extension of my senses.'","Neil Harbisson, 31, has been wearing external electronic eye for 10 years .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Four years after a trainer was drowned and dismembered by a killer whale at SeaWorld, employees are being made to wear safety vests. But critics believe the jackets still wouldn't save lives in a confrontation with one of the ocean predators. SeaWorld trainers started wearing the new inflatable safety vests on Monday, which marine park officials say took three years to develop. The slim jackets are inflatable and even include a small oxygen tank which can buy a trainer a few minutes of breathing if dragged underwater. The jackets are just one of many new safety measures instituted by the park after the February 24, 2020 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau. Scroll down for video . life saver: Starting Monday, SeaWorld is requiring orca trainers to wear new custom-designed safety vests while interacting with whales at their shows . Response: The new safety vests become inflatable and also have a small oxygen tank allowing for a few minutes of breathing underwater . Brancheau was performing with a killer . whale named Tilikum at the Shamu Stadium in Orlando when the orca . pulled her off the platform and into the pool - refusing to release her. Since . Brancheau's death, trainers have been unable to get into the water with . the killer whales amid calls for new safety measures. Kelly . Flaherty Clark, SeaWorld's curator of animal training, refused to . speculate on whether the new vests would have saved Brancheau's life, . but David Kirby, author of 'Death at SeaWorld', offered up his negative . opinion. He told WKMG that the vest 'would not have saved any of the trainers who . were killed by orcas. Dawn was rammed and dismember by Tilikum, A vest . and spare air would have been useless.' He . also points out that the vests are dangerous as well, and could give . trainers the bends if they were using the oxygen tank and suddenly . pushed to the surface by one of the whales. Tragedy: The new safety measures come four years after the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was dismembered after being dragged underwater by a killer whale named Tilikum . Other safety changes include remotely controlled pool gates, new walkways around Shamu Stadium and an additional raised platform in an orca pool that could be used to lift a whale out of the water should a trainer fall in. But the vests are probably the most visible change that park visitors will notice, she said. The start of using the vests had nothing to do with an appellate court's recent decision upholding a ruling that Sea World had violated a federal workplace safety law, Flaherty Clark added. Earlier this month, that appellate court in Washington upheld a regulatory safety finding against Sea World by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission following an investigation into Brancheau's drowning. The court said Sea World had exposed trainers to recognized hazards when working in close contact with killer whales during performances. Currently, trainers are not allowed in the water with the orcas, and must remain 18 inches away from the whales while standing and three feet while kneeling. Faherty-Clark says the new jackets aren't a part of a ploy to get trainers back into the pool for shows. 'Right now, that's not something we're even considering. This is just a piece of equipment to maybe make that environment a little bit safer,' Faherty-Clark told WESH. The dark side of SeaWorld: After Brancheau's death, Tilikum became the subject of an HBO documentary about deaths at the park. The film argues that killer whales in captivity become more aggressive to humans and each other . Known danger: The whale Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths when trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged underwater by him during a show . Tilikum subsequently became the focus of the 2013 documentary film 'Blackfish,' which explores what may have caused Tilikum to kill Brancheau. The documentary argues that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other.  Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. parks. 'The two things happened in completely different silos,' Flaherty Clark said of the ruling and the use of the vests. 'The team was close to complete before the ruling.'","Trainers at SeaWorld's marine parks started wearing the new custom-designed safety vests on Monday .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Virtual reality may seem like a niche activity reserved for gamers, but its potential is also proving worthwhile in the battlefield. The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch. Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.’ The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles, pictured. Soldiers can wear the headset, and use it drive the tank, above or below the hatch and it has been designed to protect them from gunfire and remove driving blindspots . The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology has created a system called Stella Maris, short for Stellar Marine Refractive Imaging Sensor. It works by digitally altering images from a camera mounted onto a submarine so the driver can see above the surface without a periscope. This protects submarines from revealing their position. The system can compensate for visual distortions caused by waves moving through the water's surface by using the position of the sun at a set time. The rays shine though underwater pinhole array onto a glass image plane. The successful tests were recently carried out in Rena, Norway and were filmed by TUTV. When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360-degree view of the road. By lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts, the driver can also use the system to parallel park 'with a precision of up to a centimetre', without the assistance of the vehicle commander. The system means soldiers can remain below the hatch and protected from gunfire for as long as possible, and means commanders can spend more time analysing the situation and potential risks, rather than guiding the driver through the terrain. It also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles. Hamar-based firm Making View developed the system with assistance from the Norwegian Army‘s Combat Lab. Cameras mounted on the vehicle, pictured, film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion the tank is 'transparent.' When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa.  By lowering their gaze, they can parallel park with a precision of up to a centimetre . The tests are conducted using commercial equipment, which is expected to be released for general deployment in Norwegian armoured vehicles in the near future. Norway's Combat Lab said the system could be operational in five years' time . The augmented reality software used in the Battlefield Management System is designed by Augmenti in Trondheim. This software also lets drivers see various other elements plotted on the visor such as weapons and minefields in the field or enemy troops, similar to how they appear on video games. Major Ola Petter Odden at Combat Lab told TUTV: ‘This is a very promising concept. ‘Normally you are more or less blind because there is armour all around you. With this system you can see just as well as if you were seeing out the hatch. Hamar-based firm Making View developed the system, pictured.

Combat Lab told TUTV the system could even be operational in five years’ time. ‘I can foresee that the system will be technologically mature in maybe two to three years. Then we will need a qualification period for the equipment to be ready for use in traffic. 'So maybe it will be ready in five years,’ continued Major Odden.","Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A networking evening can be a nerve-racking and intimidating event for a budding entrepreneur breaking into the world of work. So when Gesche Haas, from New York, secured a 20 minute sit-down with a successful businessman during an event in Berlin, she was hopeful it could lead to help in the future. But when she returned to her room afterwards, Ms Haas was in for a rather different proposition from the Czech Republic businessman, Pavel Curda. Instead of offering  advice, he demanded sex. 'Hey G,' the message read. 'I will not leave Berlin without having sex with you. Deal?' Haas, who works for a design sharing website and runs her own networking company for women, toldValleywag: 'I was so flustered. I couldn't sleep for an hour or two. What did I indicate to him?' Crude: Businessman Pavel Curda (left) sent an email to Gesche Haas (right) following a networking meeting saying: 'I like you a lot. I will not leave Berlin without having sex with you' Shock: When she returned to her room, she found an email waiting for her asking her for sex . But the next day, she discovered that another woman at the conference had received the same email from Mr Curda. She said: 'That eliminated the factor that I'd brought this on myself.' When she next saw Curda - who says on his website that he specializes in 'connecting talent with right investors' and 'providing tough love and tactical hands-on help with business strategy' - she told him his email was 'inappropriate' and never spoke to him again. He later claimed that his email account had been hacked. Haas works as Head of Growth for Conjure.io, which allows users to share designs and get feedback. She has been with the company just a month, according to her LinkedIn page. She is also the founder of her own business, Dreamers & Doers, which aims to connect entrepreneurs, investors and advisers, her LinkedIn page explains. Disturbed: Haas, pictured above, said she was so shocked by the messages, she could not sleep . Haas, pictured with a friend, decided to share the message to give support to other women it had happened to . On the company's Twitter page, it explains: 'Dreamers // Doers is a group of kickass entrepreneurial women who dream big and bust their butts to make them reality.' By sharing her story, she feared what reaction she would get as some people might think she was attention seeking. But she went public in the hope it would encourage other women to speak out. 'I believe that when women see what I posted, next time it happens, they'll call them out,' she explained. 'Opting to be too scared to associate my name to something like this just did not seem to be the right answer, or the type of example I'd like to set.' Since then, she has received numerous messages of support from both men and women. On Facebook, Seth Bannon said: 'It takes guts to fight the good fight like this, but if no one takes a risk and talks out, these things just keep happening. Proud of you!' Karoline Braten said: 'Wish more women would stand up for themselves like you have done! Let it be the start of a trend. Since sharing her story, Ms Haas has received many messages of support on her Facebook page . People on Facebook said she had shown courage for speaking out about what happened at the event . David Goldberg said: 'I hear that this can be looked upon as a negative in the ""industry"". As a VC (venture capitalist), I completely disagree. We focus on teams more than anything, and someone showing this type of courage should be applauded.' And on Twitter, she thanked people for the messages of support. She said: 'Can't thank you all enough for solidifying that speaking up was the right decision.' Mr Curda blamed the fact his Gmail was hacked for the emails he sent to Ms Haas. He said: 'Sorry, my Gmail was sending phishing emails to some of you this morning. Do not open the message. Sorry.' When the news broke that Ms Haas had shared her story, he followed it up by saying: 'Many of you witnessed in past weeks, that my Gmail was hacked. Sorry for weird messages you might have received. Do not open any attachments.' Curda describes himself online as an angel investor and a VC - venture capitalist - scout, an area dominated by men at Silicon Valley. Ms Haas thanked people for the support on Twitter and said it reassured her she was right to speak out . Businessman Pavel Curda blamed the fact his Gmail was hacked for the suggestive emails he sent Ms Haas . Despite the lip service Silicon Valley has given over the past couple of years to the need to recruit more women venture capitalists, at senior levels the industry’s gender balance hasn't budged, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Just four per cent of senior investing partners in U.S. venture capital are women, according to data from Pitchbook, a consulting firm. That is down slightly from five per cent in 2010, and about even with 2008. The numbers compare to 15 per cent of executive officers at Fortune 500 companies, 24 per cent of tenured faculty at U.S. business schools, and 20 per cent of the U.S. Senate - all areas that have shown gains for gender parity in recent years while venture capital has stalled. The issue matters because women venture capitalists have a direct effect on the success of companies other women launch, say female entrepreneurs, including serving as role models and being more likely to spy potential in businesses that target other women.","Gesche Haas, who works for a design startup, had an informal 20 minute chat with businessman Pavel Curda in Berlin last month .

"By . Sara Smyth . The figures show that some people in a position of trust including teachers and doctors are not being prosecuted for child sex offences . People in a position of trust, such as teachers, doctors and carers, are being let off with cautions for child sex offences, fresh data has shown. Two care workers were cautioned for sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder and four offenders in a position of trust were cautioned for sexual activity with a child, in a year. A total of nine offenders who were in a position of trust were cautioned for abuse between 2011 and 2012. Cautions were issued for a wide range of sexual offences including eight rapes, 15 rapes of a child under 13 and 254 cases of sexual activity with a child. The data revealed that one offender in a position of trust was cautioned for making a child watch a sexual act. The information was requested by George Howarth, . Labour MP for Knowsley, in Merseyside. Minister for Prisons and Rehabilitation Jeremy Wright said the Ministry of . Justice launched a review in April into the use of cautions, which will examine whether there are some offences for which . the use of cautions is inappropriate. He said: 'Court will always be the right place for serious and contested cases and those involving prolific offenders. 'The use of cautions is at its . lowest level for more than five years, as is the number of cautions . issued to those who have a previous criminal record. 'However, there will be a number of . difficult cases, including those where both victim and perpetrator are . children, or where victims and witnesses are reluctant to give evidence, . where the police may decide that administering a caution is a . preferable option to there being no record of the offence committed.' 12 offenders were cautioned for causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, while 34 were cautioned for causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity. The figures showed 116 offenders were cautioned for causing or inciting a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity, while 51 people were cautioned for causing or inciting prostitution for gain. MP George Howarth (left) requested the information and questioned when cautions are appropriate. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright (right) has launched an investigation into the use of cautions . The figures showed 10 offenders were . cautioned for meeting a child following sexual grooming, while 65 were . cautioned for sexual assault of a child under 13. Mr Howarth said: 'Whilst there are some examples where it would clearly be appropriate for a caution to be issued, others are clearly questionable. Of particular concern are those that involve people in positions of trust committing sex offences, of one kind or another, against children and rape offences' 'This matter needs to dealt with urgently to reassure the public that those who commit these offences are subjected to appropriate severe action. In many of these cases, a caution would not meet that test.""","Nine offenders in a position of trust were cautioned in a year .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Among a tomb of gold pins, pearls and a rare bronze mirror dating back to the early Dark Ages, researchers have discovered a heavily deformed human skull. It is thought the tomb and skull found in the Alsace region of France have lain undiscovered for almost 1,650 years and may belong to an aristocrat. The forehead of the woman’s skull has been flattened, forcing the rear of the skull to narrow and become cone-shaped, and this artificial cranial deformation was a common practice in certain parts of the world at that time. The cone-shaped skull was found in one of 18 tombs buried in Alsace. The tomb and skull is thought to be 1,650 years old when artificial cranial deformation was a common practice. Flattening the skull deliberately and forcing the rear of the head into almost a point was seen as a sign of wealth and status . Artificial cranial deformation, also . known as 'head flattening' or 'head binding', is a deliberate method of . deforming a person's skull. The skull could be flattened, elongated, rounded or moulded into a cone-like shape. The process usually began around a month after birth and continued for six . months, although it can also be practiced for years until the desired . shape was achieved. Practitioners used boards or thin strips of bandage to achieve the desired effect. Skull deformation was . a practice made popular by the Huns and spread to Europe during . the time of the Roman Empire. It was particularly popular in Germany. Early . examples of cranial deformation were found to date back to 45,000 B.C . and were even found in the skulls of neanderthals in southwest Asia. It still occurs today in a few places, like Vanuatu - an island in the south Pacific Ocean. Lead archaeologist Phillip Lefranc believes the graves were reserved for soldiers and their families from Asia who fought for the Roman Army. Other treasures found in the aristocrat’s tomb were chatelaines - decorative belt hooks and chains worn at the waist - and a stag antler comb. The mirror, as well as the chains, are thought to have originated in the Caucasis region of Asia and the tomb was one of 18 found buried in the Obernai region of Alsace. ‘The deformation of the skull with the help of bandages and small boards is a practice coming from central Asia,’ Lefranc told LiveScience.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Step aside Virgin, BT and Sky, we could soon be able to buy our internet from websites including Google and Facebook. The online giants have been gradually buying up miles of unused fibre optic cables in a bid to expand their networks and control how much traffic they can send. Reports in the Wall Street Journal also state that by owning private networks the companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to. Web giants Google and Facebook have been buying up miles of unused fibre optic cables in a bid to expand their networks and control how much traffic they send. Stock image of cabling pictured. By owning private networks, the companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to . During the late 1990s many companies laid more cable than they needed, meaning there were entire networks left unused. When fibre is used, it is ‘lit up’, meaning these unused cables are considered dark. In 2008, Google invested in a £300million cable project to connect California to Japan. It later bought up a further 6,000 miles of cable across Asian countries, including Singapore. Google now owns 100,000 miles of cable routes globally. In November it announced the Google Fiber project in Kansas City that connects home in the region to its 1 gigabit service for around $70 (£43) a month. In June, Facebook extended its European network and expanded its services to a data centre near the Arctic Circle. Both companies have also invested in submarine cables in waters around Asia. Legally, governments . can submit court orders to companies for information and data held on . their networks, whether its a private network or not. If . Google and other companies are leasing cable from a broadband provider, . the provider will be served the order and it will be their decision to . release information, for example. By . owning their own networks, web companies can be the gatekeeper for this . information and have greater control over what the government gets . access to. It can also give a better indication as to exactly how governments are monitoring them and their networks. Until recently, many of the cables laid under the ground, and in the sea known as submarine cables, were owned by network operators and broadband providerfs such as Virgin Media and BT in the UK and Sprint and AT&T in the U.S. According to the reports, Google now owns 100,000 miles of cable routes, and in November it announced the Google Fiber project which is currently only available in Kansas City. By comparison, this is more than double the amount of cable routes owned by U.S. operator Sprint, according to WSJ. The enormous quantity of cables means that Google is beginning to rival some of the telecom companies that have up until now considered them as clients. The Google Fiber project means houses in the area can swap their internet service provider for Google's service, which the company claims is 100 times faster than average speeds. Until recently, many of the cables, pictured, were owned by network operators and broadband providers. By owning the cables themselves, web companies can reduce costs. They can also serve as much traffic as they want, meaning that videos don't buffer and pages load quicker at peak times, for example . Google Fiber costs $70 (£43) a month for 1GB or $120(£74) with a TV subscription. In June, Facebook extended its European network and expanded its services to a data centre near the Arctic Circle. Both companies have also invested in submarine cables in waters around Asia. Previously, websites could either rent cables from these providers, or pay a fee to use them. These providers could then control how much traffic was sent over the network, and at certain times could even ‘throttle’ the traffic to avoid the network from crashing when a lot of people tried to access it. By owning the cables themselves, companies can reduce costs and increase investment into making the services faster.

Facebook and Twitter, features pictures of puppies that have been . billed as wolves, an earthworm as a snake and a guinea pig as a panda, . with the slogan ‘let your imagination run wild’. The joke came after holidaymakers in . Essex claimed to have spotted a big cat on Sunday, prompting a 20-hour . manhunt including armed officers, two police helicopters using . heat-seeking equipment and zoo workers in St Osyth, Essex over the Bank . Holiday weekend. While residents were warned to stay . indoors and holidaymakers at a nearby caravan park evacuated, it emerged . that the wild animal was actually a large domestic cat called Teddy . Bear. The blunder, which made headlines, sparked many online spoof pictures and comments on Twitter. Questions have been raised over why . experts from Colchester Zoo and police believed the blurry photographs . which sparked a costly search. Mocking zoo's animal spotting: The spoof adverts pokes fun at the zoo's animal spotting capabilities with puppies as wolves and a kitten for a tiger . 'Imagination run wild': Blue tits for parrots and a black and white guinea pig as a panda . An earth worm as a snake and a ginger cat as a lion . Colchester Zoo director Anthony Tropeano welcomed the tongue-in-cheek advert but defended his staff’s involvement in the case. He . said: ‘It’s all a bit of fun and games and I think it was bound to . happen after all the media coverage the Essex lion received. ‘I was amazed at just how big a story it became as it really was a storm in a teacup. ‘We were shown a very grainy image of the “Essex lion” on Sunday evening and I told police I couldn’t really tell what it was. 'Wild animal' on the loose: This is the blurry photo taken by holidaymakers that prompted a 20-hour manhunt by police, police helicopters and zoo workers . Teddy Bear: The lion on the loose turned out to be domestic cat Teddy Bear . Community in terror of pet: Teddy Bear's owner Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, where she was away and immediately had her suspicions . ‘Later that night we were given a clearer image and told police it was not the right shape to be a lion. ‘Unfortunately the police were in a position where they were damned if they do and damned if they don’t as you cannot risk public safety if there is any suspicion a dangerous animal is on the loose.’ Teddy Bear’s owner Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, where she was away and immediately had her suspicions about the blurry images. Colchester Zoo is a popular South East tourist attraction and boasts more than 260 rare species including lions. Mr Tropeano said: ‘As the only zoo in the county we can officially say we are the only ones to allow visitors a chance to see lions in Essex. ‘Instead of grainy images, visitors can get up close and personal with our animals and can.” Some of the other spoofs about the Essex lion include the iconic scene from Disney classic the Lion King in which a young Simba looks out across the wasteland. The caption reads: ‘What is that shadowy place? “It’s Essex, Simba. You must never go there”.’ Like Disney classic: A Twitter user has thought of their own amusing caption to go with a picture of a still from The Lion King . Internet humour: There were many spoofs after the manhunt blunder made headlines including this one featuring Mo Farah superimposed onto a picture of a lion looking frightened and running away from the beast .

"By . Associated Press . The Salvadoran man who says he spent more than a year drifting across the Pacific Ocean before making landfall in the Marshall Islands is too weak to travel and will remain in the island nation for a while, an official said Saturday. Diego Dalton, an official with El Salvador's embassy in Tokyo, said Jose Salvador Alvarenga's health was 'very frail' and that he would not return home until he was able to make the journey. Alvarenga, 37, washed ashore late last month. He was taken last week to the Marshall Islands' capital, Majuro, where he has been resting at a hotel. Scroll down for video .

'At this moment, there are no travel plans or definite itinerary,' Dalton told reporters Saturday. ""His return will depend of when his health allows the long journey back.' Dalton did not comment further on Alvarenga's condition. Alvarenga's spritely appearance Monday while greeting hundreds of well-wishers in Majuro had many questioning his story. He earlier told officials he left Mexico in late 2012 with another fisherman, who later died, for a day of shark fishing when a storm threw them off course and they began drifting.

"By . Sam Webb . Aged just 18, Status Quo frontman Francis Rossi waited nervously before the band played on Top of the Pops in 1968. The band's single Pictures of Matchstick Men had gone to number seven and the broadcast would be their first big break into TV - but as he stood there, he was approached by the presenter Jimmy Savile, who has since been exposed as a serial sex abuser. To his shock, Savile invited him to his dressing room, saying: 'Come and see me tarts.' Frances Rossi was just 18 when Savile invited him to join a sex party after a broadcast in 1968 . 'Dodgy': BBC producers had doubts about employing Jimmy Savile in the early 60s for Top of The Pops. Here he is presenting the show in 1962 . Rossi told the Mirror of the shock and revulsion he felt at the DJ's proposal. The pervert continued: 'Come here later on because there's going to be something. Come and see me tarts, some f****** tarts we have got in.' Rossi, who had recently married, said he told Savile to 'get out of it'. Status Quo appeared on the show a number of times with hits including Rocking All Over The World and Whatever You Want, but the band kept their distance from the presenter because he was 'very odd' and there were rumours about his behaviour even then. Parents would drop their daughters off at Top of the Pops studio, added Rossi, pointing out that 'the world was very different back then'. Rossi believes there is more scandal to emerge as the numerous investigations continue. The frontman added: 'I keep hearing ""how did he cover it up for so long?"" I heard he paid a lot of people off. Still rocking: Rick Parfitt (left) and Francis Rossi of Status Quo performing during the 2009 Glastonbury Festival Mr Rossi no longer indulges in the rock lifestyle . Status Quo performed their single Pictures of Matchstick Men on Top Of The Pops in 1968 . 'But where did he get the money? I think . there is a lot to come out about it... Everybody heard stuff about him . but nobody saw anything.' There were also rumours about the 'Leeds Mafia', who would intimidate anyone who spoke out about his vile deeds. Rossi said he recently received a text from fellow rock star Roy Wood saying it was 'about time they got that b******.' The grandfather of three admits in the interview that his party lifestyle has been replaced . by the cosiness of a log fire in his new house and falling asleep in . front of the TV. More detail has been emerging over Savile's disgusting behaviour during his years at the BBC, and the seedy goings-on in his dressing room. Comedian Freddie Starr was arrested over claims he molested a schoolgirl in Savile's BBC dressing room. Starr denied the allegations, saying he had once rescued two 14-year-old girls after finding them in a room with a man in his late 40s, who he knew liked girls below the age of consent. Club background: Sir Jimmy Savile with his former girlfriend Sue Hyams in Leeds in 1969 . Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was . also arrested and questioned over allegations he and Savile pursued . their sordid fantasies together. A video has emerged of a moment when Savile got away with groping a petrified teenager live on Top of the Pops. Sylvia Edwards can be seen sitting next to Savile as . he announces the next song to viewers, surrounded by teenage girls. Then a horrified Sylvia leaps off her seat, shrieks and tries  to move . away from smirking Savile, who calmly talks into the camera. The presenter grins as he puts his hand up her skirt, tries to grab her . bottom and fondles her as she looks distressed  and attempts to wriggle . free. Savile went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006 . Paul Jackson, producer of hit shows Red Dwarf and The Young Ones, said BBC entertainment producers initially rejected Savile for the Top of the Pops jobs because he was 'dodgy'. Savile's background as a club DJ and manager sparked initial concerns among the show's bosses in the early 1960s, but he went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years. Mr Jackson witnessed at first hand the heady mix of frenzied fans and sexual freedom which characterised the broadcasting and music industries in the 1960s and said attitudes had clearly changed since then. 'I was around at the BBC during the 1960s because of my dad. It was a different time. It wasn't now. The commissioners were fighting to keep the girls out of the dressing rooms,' Jackson said. A former Yorkshire committee member of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain has also revealed that he was strongly opposed to Savile having anything to do with the charity in the 1980s and 1990s, because of his background in clubs and 'reputation for entertaining young girls'.

"By . Rob Preece . Mystery: Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981 . The family of a little girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago have spoken of their devastation after David Cameron ruled out any further investigation of the mystery. Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. Her parents believe military police made mistakes in the early stages of their investigation into her disappearance - but the Prime Minister has resisted calls to reopen the inquiry. Katrice's father, Richard Lee, 62, today appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family to explain why the case will not be taken forward. Mr Lee, who lives in Hartlepool, County Durham, said: 'I want to meet up with the Prime Minister and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why he isn't looking into the case any further. 'He said he was going to and then he met up with the military police, but why hasn't he asked to meet up with us and get our side?' Mr Cameron promised to look into the case last month when Tory MP Caroline Dinenage raised it during Prime Minister's Questions. Waiting for answers: Katrice's father, Richard Lee, has appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family and explain why the case will not be taken forward . But Ms Dinenage, the local MP for Katrice's mother, Sharon, of Gosport, Hampshire, received a letter from Mr Cameron stating that the case would not be reinvestigated. Refusal: Mr Cameron was urged to look into the case by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage . Mr Cameron wrote that he had reached the decision following a meeting with military police. It is another blow for Katrice's family, who have campaigned for three decades for police to release their files on the case. They claim military police have been uncooperative over the years and that mistakes were made in the hours after Katrice was reported missing. Mr Lee said: 'Things weren't done that should have been done 30 years ago and now the people who are working in the office with the Prime Minister are people who were never there in the beginning. 'Who better to speak to than us, Katrice's family?' Mr Lee has been working with Hartlepool MP Iain Wright to push for progress in the case. He said: 'I'm not going to let this issue go away. I won't give up.'","Katrice Lee went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Beads discovered on a necklace that was first excavated in 1911 have finally been confirmed as being made from space rock. Researchers from the University College London's Petrie Museum conducted detailed analysis of the necklace using gamma rays and have been able to prove that the beads, originally believed to be made from iron, were in fact created using fragments of meteorites. The analysis is also the first time scientists have been able to assess how the beads were formed and it is thought that the Egyptians used the technique of smithing and rolling, which involved hammering the rock several times until it could be flattened and then rolled to form the bead-shaped tubes. Researchers from the University College London's Petrie Museum conducted detailed analysis of beads and necklaces, pictured, first uncovered in 1911. They used gamma ray scans to prove that the beads, originally believed to be made from iron, were in fact created using fragments of meteorites . The analysis is the first time scientists have been able to assess how the beads were formed and it is thought that the Egyptians used the technique of smithing and rolling, which involved hammering the rock several times until it could be flattened and then rolled to form the bead-shaped tubes . Egyptologists from the Open University first scanned beads found in a pre-dynastic cemetery near the village of el-Gerzeh, in Lower Egypt in May, using scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography. The nickel content of this original metal was found to be high, suggesting that it could have come from a meteorite. The researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a Widmanstätten pattern. This structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely . slowly inside their parent asteroids as the solar system was forming. They . found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away, providing what . has been described as 'little windows' to the preserved metal beneath. Researchers from UCL's Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology then used non-invasive neutrons and gamma rays to detect the exact level of nickel and phosphorous in these Egyptian beads. Lead author of the Journal of Archaeological Science study, Professor Thilo Rehren said that the beads were created by 'multiple cycles of hammering' and not by the traditional carving or drilling stone techniques that were used on other beads found in the same tomb. Open and Manchester Universities first discovered that the beads contained nickel in May. This image shows a series of scans taken of the iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient Egyptians. It also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion . He told Culture24: 'The really exciting . outcome of this research is that we were for the first time able to . demonstrate conclusively that there are typical trace elements such as . cobalt and germanium present in these beads, at levels that only occur . in meteoritic iron.' It is also the first time researchers . have been able to study the internal structure of the beads to reveal . how they were created - showing an advanced knowledge and skill of metal . work. The discovery . additionally unearths a glimpse of the genesis of the . ancient Egyptians' religion and the divine attributes they attached to . meteorites. 'The . sky was very important to the ancient Egyptians,' said Joyce Tyldesley, . an Egyptologist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a co-author of . the paper on the discovery. 'Something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods.' Dating from 3350 to 3600 BC, . thousands of years before Egypt’s Iron Age, the bead analysed was . originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of . nickel-rich iron. But this hypothesis . was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the . early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of . meteorite-origin were actually early smelting attempts. The ancient Egyptians would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods and this suggests the jewellery may have been created as gifts for royalty or people of high standing . Philip Withers, Professor of Materials . Science at The University of Manchester, added: 'Meteorites have a . unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly . slowly as they travelled through space. 'It was really interesting to . find that fingerprint turn up in Egyptian artefacts.' Meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient Egyptians, both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts. Dr Tyldesley added: 'Today, we see iron first and foremost as a practical, rather dull metal. To the ancient Egyptians, however, it was a rare and beautiful material which, as it fell from the sky, surely had some magical/religious properties. 'They therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves.'","Egyptians created beads by hammering meteorites into thin sheets .
These sheets where then rolled into tubes to create 'beads'
Meteorite beads predated the discovery of iron ore by 2,000 years .

"By . James  Nye . Brought together: Connor Rabinowitz and his girlfriend Erin Roberts were brought together when Connor was transplanted with the donor heart of Erin's brother Kellen . Connor Rabinowitz fell in love at first sight with the sister of the man whose heart was now beating inside his chest. Lucky to get the donor heart of Kellen Roberts after his health collapsed because of a genetic heart condition, Rabinowitz was bowled over when he met Erin - just over a year after his transplant. Although he was only 17-years-old at the time and she was 26 when they first met in 2004, the electric chemistry between the pair persisted until they got together in 2010 - with both feeling that deceased Kellen helped them to become lovers. 'We had an instant connection – we both feel that Kellen bought us together,' Connor said to the UK's Daily Mirror. Connor was a fit teenager when he began to suffer flu-like symptoms in November of 2004. One morning he woke in cold sweats to actually see his enlarged heart beating up through his chest and was rushed to hospital. Doctors told the Minnesota teen that he would need a heart transplant or he would die and so he began the terrifying wait to see if a donor organ would become available. Sadly for the Roberts family, but luckily for Connor, Kellen passed away after he suffered head injuries during a drunken fight in his home state of South Dakota. Instant connection: The two first met when Connor was 18 and she was 26- but waited six-years before they started their relationship . The heart was moved to be transplanted to Connor, who had mixed feelings about his predicament. 'It was the best day of my life but I knew someone had died for me,' he said to the Daily Mirror. 'I felt undeserving, that I had something to do with this person’s death. I struggled with that for a while.' Tragic: Kellen Roberts died after a drunken fracas at a party in 2004 - and his heart now beats inside Connor Rabinowitz - who is dating his sister Erin . During his recovery, Connor decided that he wanted to write a letter to the family of the donor - who were protected by anonymity. 'Kellen’s mother Nancy got in touch immediately and a few months later my mum flew to meet her. Six months after that I was well enough to visit too. 'It was an emotional meeting and as Nancy put her hand on my chest to feel Kellen’s heart beating inside me, I saw Erin for the first time. 'We locked eyes – and I was smitten. Erin felt the connection too but she tried to dismiss it, thinking I was too young. 'She took me sightseeing for the weekend and we felt so comfortable together, like we’d known each other our entire lives. I visited twice more and felt the same, but we were both dating other people.' While school assistant Erin thought that Connor was too young and had a teenage crush on her, the two lost contact for five-years - but got back in touch using Facebook in 2010. 'We were both single for the first time and everything just fell into place,' said Connor. Now 34, Erin said that the shared connection that the two felt was undeniable. 'He was still very young and I thought he might have a teenage crush,' she said to the Daily Mirror. 'I tried to dismiss my confused feelings. But I couldn’t stop thinking about Connor – he made me feel happy. Happy: The couple were brought together when Connor began to suffer heart failure as he suffered a genetic condition . 'After we reconnected via Facebook in 2010 everything changed. He came to visit and for the first time I felt really nervous around him. 'When he left, I couldn’t stop thinking about him, my heart was just racing.' While Connor was training to be a cardiovascular ultrasound technician in Minneapolis, Erin was living in Seattle - so the two began a long-distance relationship. For Erin's family, the beginning of her relationship was difficult - especially for her mother and her 14-year-old son, Christian. However, once they all witnessed Erin and Connor together, they all came to realize that maybe it was Kellen who had played some part in their relationship. 'I know he brought us together and I know he is watching over us,' said Connor, who moved to be with Erin and is now a medical technician at a Seattle hospital. Thankful: The happy couple believe that is is Kellen who has helped them to find happiness with each other - almost ten years on from his death . 'All of the family tell me stories about Kellen. He is always in my thoughts – and obviously in my heart. He was a great guy – he always looked out for people. Through him, I hope I can do the same. If I was to meet him today, it would be like meeting my other half.' 'I was now forever connected with this young man who sacrificed his life and chose to save mine,' Connor told the West Seattle Herald. 'He is my hero, my guardian angel and I will be forever grateful for his decision to donate his organs.' Kellen died after becoming involved in an argument at a party with 20-year-old Cody Faber. While Cody was charged with second degree manslaughter after Kellen fell and hit his head on the concrete driveway - the judge in his case decided that Faber was not directly responsible for his death. Kellen Roberts tragically died iafter a freak accident in 2005, aged just 22 . The lockets made after the transplant were inscribed with 'Connor', 'Kellen' and the number 552, referring to the 552nd heart transplant made at the University of Minnesota Hospital . He was sentenced to 10-days in prison after pleading guilty to assault - a verdict which Kellen's mother, Nancy and his family, including Erin agreed with. 'That’s the verdict we wanted. It became clear to us that Cody was telling the truth – as clear as you could be with alcohol and all the chaos,' said Nancy. According to the Star Tribune, whenever Erin really misses her brother, she rests her head on Connor’s chest. 'It’s a strong beat,' Erin said. The couple added that they believe Kellen bonded them together, both through sadness at his departure but also through huge celebration of his life. '[Connor] understands on a level other people can’t. We’re aware of the sacrifice that had to be made,' Erin told the Star Tribune. 'I feel my brother chose him for me … as a last gift.'

"By . Richard Shears . A holy man uttering a special chant succeeded today in calming a group of snarling tigers that had chased five men up a tree, leaving them trapped there for nearly five days. As the holy man uttered his mantra - a mind-calming chant that originates in ancient India - the tigers turned tail and slipped back into the Indonesian jungle, allowing the desperate men to come down from their precarious perch in the branches. During the long days and nights they had been trapped there, the tigers, which had already killed and eaten a sixth member of their group, prowled around the base of the tree waiting for a chance to grab one or more of the men. A Sumatran tiger attacked and killed a sixth member of the party after they accidentally killed a cub . While tigers can climb trees, it is believed the terrified men, from a village in Aceh province on the island of Sumatra, had lodged themselves onto slender branches that would not have borne the wait of a tiger. But as the hours and the days went by they became weak from hunger and lack of sleep, each of them fearing they would fall and become another victim of the tigers. The animals had chased the men - who had gone into the jungle in the Mount Leuser National Park early last week to look for a special wood that is used to make incense - after they had unwittingly killed a tiger cub in a trap that had been set to catch deer. Finding the cub dying from its injuries, the pack of tigers gave chase after the men and caught one, named only as David. He was quickly torn apart and half his body consumed. They are trapped up a tree in Gunung Leuser National Park, north Sumatra, Indonesia . The men, from Simpang Kiri village in . Aceh, northern Sumatra, had gone into the dense forest in search of . agar wood, which is very rare, expensive and used in the production of . incense and aromatic oils. Just . 1lb of agar wood can fetch up to £175, resulting in villagers risking . their lives to enter the jungles of the Gunung Leuser National Park . where tigers and dangerous elephants roam. Yesterday  Police Chief Dicky . Sondani explained why officers had been powerless to intervene. 'We can't go rushing in to rescue the . men in the tree because of the remoteness and because of the tigers . still being there at the base of the tree,' he said. He told the Jakarta Globe that villagers enter the jungle to look for the pricey wood but they were risking their lives doing so. 'The group were attacked by tigers on Thursday after they caught and killed a tiger cub in a snare meant to catch a deer. 'Nearby tigers drawn to the scene of the fatally injured cub pounced on the men and killed 28-year-old David as the five others climbed a tree to safety.' Just 1lb of agar wood can fetch up to £175, resulting in villagers risking their lives to enter the jungles of the Gunung Leuser National Park where tigers and dangerous elephants roam (stock image) Resident of Simpang Kiri village . learned of the men's fate because not only were they carrying mobile . phones, they had also managed to get a signal, enabling them to call for . help. But as rescuers from the village neared the tree they saw David's partially eaten remains and four large tigers - and fled. But police said they had little choice but to plan the rescue carefully and that would take some time. The tigers would have to be shot with anaesthetising darts due to their endangered numbers. Conservationists said they had no doubt that the tigers chased the men seeking revenge for killing the cub. More than 100 Sumatran tigers are believed to roam the forests of the Gunung Leuser National Park. But there are fears their numbers will dramatically drop as the rainforest shrinks and palm oil plantations take their place. Looking for food, tigers are more frequently entering villages and there have been a number of attacks on humans.","Five men have been trapped up a tree by prowling Sumatran tigers .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's newborn son will 'suck the blood' of Russia in the mid-21st century and should therefore not be celebrated, a controversial Russian politician declared today. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the nationalist Liberal Democrat Party, declared 'I don't care about the heir' before accusing the British monarchy of 'destroying our state'. The outspoken politician made his attention-grabbing comments in an interview with the state-run newspaper Rio Novosti. Not happy: Outspoken politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 67, says the new baby will 'suck Russia's blood' Quoted in the International Business Times, he said : 'The British monarchy... destroyed our state.  Today, our opposition activists are there, so that's why there's no joy. 'That is why the birth of another British monarch, who will suck our blood somewhere in the mid-21st century, cannot bring us any kind of happiness.' However Russian's official response was more positive, with the Kremlin congratulating the Queen and welcoming her new great-grandson. The British and Russian royal families are linked via King George V, who was first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II, whom some blame for the downfall of the Romanov dynasty in 1917. Tsar Nicholas II was ill-prepared to rule when he inherited the crown from his father and eventually abdicated in favour of his brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The Provisional Government then took over, effectively ending the Romanov dynasty's rule over Russia. Zhirinovsky, seen second from right, is known for fiery nationalism and seen as a showman in Russian politics .","Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 67, says he is not happy about the Cambridges' baby .

"By . Rob Cooper . Former Newcastle United footballer Nile Ranger raped a woman in a hotel room after sending her a string of messages on WhatsApp, a court heard today. The woman was attacked while drunk days after telling the 22-year-old striker that she just wanted to be friends, the jury was told. Ranger - who now plays for League One side Swindon Town - claims that the woman consented to sex. Accused: Nile Ranger, 22, who now plays football for Swindon Town, is seen arriving at Newcastle Crown Court today with a female companion . Trial: Jurors were told by the judge to ignore Nile Ranger's 'celebrity status' when considering the evidence . The court heard the woman was so drunk that she remembers nothing of the alleged attack and only discovered what had happened when she woke up naked next to him the following morning. The pair spent the evening drinking together in Newcastle on the night of the alleged attack before going back to a hotel room in the Jesmond area of the city. Christine Egerton, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: 'They met up by arrangement and went socialising together. As far as she was concerned they were friends, as far as he was concerned he wanted more. It went further than that as he was pestering her. 'She was so intoxicated either through drink or something unknown she found it difficult to walk and she has no memory whatsoever of what occurred. 'When she woke up in the morning she found she was naked in bed with the defendant who was also naked. 'She had no idea where she was. She asked the defendant where they were and if they had had sex. He said they had and she should take the morning after pill. 'She was upset and ran to the bathroom. She found out she was in the Carlton Hotel in Jesmond. 'She left the hotel, she didn't even know how to get out. She used her phone to ring a taxi and she got in the taxi and went home. Trial: Ranger denies rape and claims that his alleged victim consented to sex . Charged: Ranger, 22, denies a single count of rape . 'In the days leading up to the allegation they had been communicating by text and WhatsApp.' The jury was told that the woman later told a friend what had happened who urged her to go and see her GP.  The next day she reported the incident to police. The jury was played a video of her first interview with police in which she said she had made clear to the footballer that she just wanted to be friends with him. 'I woke up and I didn't have a clue where I was,' she said. 'I had no recollection of going back to the hotel room. I saw some menus and I turned around and I saw Nile lying next to me. 'I remember feeling really sick. I have never felt like that before. His body made me feel physically sick I couldn't move. I knew something had happened when I woke up with no clothes on.' She said she only discovered which nightclub she had been in when she saw a stamp on her arm. In the interview, she added: 'I told him from day one I did not want to be anything but friends with him. I told him that.' Court case: Nile Ranger, 22, pictured here playing for Newcastle United, now plays for Swindon Town in League One . 'He was interviewed and asked by police to give his version of events,' she added. 'He agreed that he had been with the victim that night and that they had been in a hotel room. He said that they had sex twice that night. He said she was consenting.' The jury were shown CCTV footage of Ranger and the victim getting out of a taxi. The victim could not stand straight as she got out of the taxi and had to be helped into the hotel by the defendant. Christine Egerton said: 'The CCTV footage clearly demonstrates the state she was in at the time. She fell out of the taxi.' Earlier Judge John Evans told the jurors that they should ignore the footballer's 'celebrity status' when considering the evidence. Judge . John Evans told the jury: 'The defendant is a man who some time ago . played football for Newcastle United. He is no longer at that club, he . is at another club. 'At the . time he played at Newcastle United inevitably in the minds of some he . acquired a celebrity status amongst the media and many members of the . public.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Sativex, a mouth spray designed to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, will be available on the NHS in Wales . A cannabis-based drug designed to alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is to be made available on prescription in Wales, health officials have confirmed. Sativex, an oral spray made from two chemical extracts from cannabis plants, has been approved for used by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. Wales' Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped the spray would help ease the suffering of those who have to live with the reality of MS. The decision was welcomed by the Multiple Sclerosis Trust, which said it hoped the decision would prompt England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to follow suit. Charity director Amy Bowen, said: 'We are extremely pleased that people with MS in Wales will finally have better access to Sativex. 'As a charity we have campaigned over a long period for Sativex to be widely available because of the significant impact that MS spasticity can have on daily activities. 'We just hope that this recommendation will now lead to Sativex being more easily accessible in the rest of the UK.' Sativex is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK and contains delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) Passing Sativex to someone else, unless that person is lawfully entitled to possess the drug, is a criminal offence. A statement about the drug on the MS Trust's website says: 'As Sativex is derived from cannabis, there were initial concerns that it might cause drug dependence, be psychoactive or cause withdrawal symptoms. 'However, studies into long-term use of Sativex in people with MS showed that sudden discontinuation of treatment did not result in any significant withdrawal-like symptoms although some people reported temporary changes in their sleeping patterns, mood or appetite following discontinuation. Sativex is based on two extracts from cannabis plants and is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licenced anywhere in the UK . 'The lack of withdrawal symptoms suggests that dependence on the treatment is highly unlikely. In addition, Sativex did not affect cognition (thinking or memory) or induce any mental health problems at the doses used.' Wales Health Minister Professor Drakeford said: 'Following the appraisal of Sativex by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group, I am pleased to announce we will be making the medicine available on the Welsh NHS to those who need it. 'I hope this decision will help ease the suffering of some of those who have to live with the reality of MS every day.'","Sativex is mouth spray based on two extracts from cannabis plants .

"By . Lucy Osborne . When bailiffs turned up to evict a cancer sufferer from his home, they had not counted on one thing – the kindness of strangers. In a heartwarming show of support, around 200 people flocked to stop the eviction taking place after owner Tom Crawford posted a video online begging for help. The 63-year-old promised well-wishers a ‘lovely cup of tea’ if they joined his peaceful protest against the loss of the bungalow where he has lived with his wife Susan for 25 years. Scroll down for video . People power: Moved by Tom Crawford's video plea for help, more than 200 strangers stopped the eviction . Mr Crawford, 63, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011, insists he has paid off his mortgage . Mr Crawford and his wife, Susan, 54, appeared overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers at their home . Within hours, the video had been shared more than 7,500 times. And in scenes reminiscent of the 1946 classic film It's A Wonderful Life!, supporters from as far afield as Glasgow descended on his three-bedroom home in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, to help him keep his home. After a tense 90-minute stand-off, the bailiffs left empty-handed. Mr Crawford, who is battling prostate cancer, claims he has paid off his mortgage, which he took out with the now defunct Bradford and Bingley in 1988. But UK Asset Resolution Limited, charged with winding down Bradford and Bingley mortgages, claims he still owes £43,000. Earlier this year a judge ruled against the couple and ordered them to pay off the mortgage or face eviction. But the Crawfords claim that these arrears exist due to an error committed by the bank. They say they believed they were paying off their mortgage when in fact they were paying only interest. In a desperate bid to keep his home, the retired flooring specialist made a heartfelt video explaining his predicament and posted it on YouTube. Mr and Mrs Crawford bought their three-bedroom bungalow for £41,800  in 1988 and raised their family there . In the 11-minute clip, the father-of-three said: ‘Please come and help us. There will be a lovely cup of tea waiting for you. But don’t use violence. They are the ones who use violence. This is a war for the people. ‘It may only be a small bungalow, but it is my bungalow, my land, my home.’ Yesterday, the grandfather-of-two said: ‘This has been a huge battle for me and at times I’ve felt like no one wanted to help us. 'But this shows there are people out there who feel the same way and it has been very emotional to talk to all the people who have come to show support.’ Mr Crawford, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011, and his wife, 54, took out an endowment mortgage to buy the bungalow for £41,800 25 years ago. They expected to own the property outright when the mortgage came to an end last year. Mr Crawford's struggle has echoes of the 1946 film starring James Stewart as a man who faces financial ruin . But Mr Crawford claims the bank told him in 2007 that he would never pay off the loan because there was no record of him taking out the endowment, a type of savings plan designed to repay the mortgage debt. He then claims a bank manager assured him this was incorrect and even sent his wife flowers and champagne to apologise. But soon afterwards he became embroiled in a court battle over the mortgage. Mr Crawford added: ‘They are putting us through hell and something needs to be done about it. They can’t keep getting away with this.’ Bradford and Bingley was nationalised in 2008 during the financial crisis, with the main banking section sold to Abbey National while existing mortgages stayed in public control. They are now collected by UK Asset Resolution Limited, which was set up by the Government. Yesterday, the company confirmed the eviction was called off due to safety concerns.

"By . David Derbyshire . In the dog eat dog world of beauty contests, bitchy behaviour is commonplace. But for these three well groomed models, any such disobedience could see their career bite the dust. They are the finalists in a contest to find the country’s coolest canine - and on Wednesday night one of them will be crowned Top Dog Model. Scroll down for video . Bid for coolest canine: Lucky the chihuahua is one of three finalists in ITV2 contest Top Dog Model, winning hearts in a series of modelling tasks including posing for greeting cards (right) But who will be left howling with joy and who will be going home with their tail between their legs? All three are undoubtedly pedigree contenders, but the favourite is Lucky the Chihuahua. What the two-year-old lacks in stature (at 10in he is by far the least leggy of the finalists) he makes up for in confidence. 'Grizzly bear': Another finalist Simba the leonburger poses for her greeting card . Giant softie: Owner Dan Carrick says Simba is 'the stereotypical gentle giant' who weighs 60kg and eats 1kg of raw meat every day . Misunderstood: The third finalist is Scarlet the rottweiler who was entered to disprove that the breed is aggressive . Dancing and dressing up are a walk in the park for him - and he has spent the competition bossing around rivals 20 times his weight. Owner Isa Randle, a dancer and choreographer, who bought Lucky as a 12 week old puppy from a drag artist, said: ‘He loves glitz and glamour and has a good sense of humour. ‘People have a misconception that Chihuahuas are yappy, handbag dogs but they are not like that.' Miss Randle, 28, of Westbourne Green, West London, prepared Lucky for stardom by taking him to a weekly dancing class for dogs and hopes he may follow in the paw-prints of Pudsey and Ashleigh, winners of Britain’s Got Talent.

But while Lucky found most of the . challenges simple, he struggled with one task that dogs usually have no . problems with - getting on a sofa. ‘He . had to leap on to a leather sofa and sit next to a model. It was four . or five times taller than he was and he couldn’t jump up so we had to . have a step,’ she said. At . the other extreme is Simba, a Leonberger who resembles, says Dan . Carrick, 25, ‘a cross between a lion and a grizzly bear’. Aged 15 . months, she weighs 60kg and eats 1kg of raw meat every day. ‘She is the stereotypical gentle giant . -as soft as they come,’ said Mr Carrick, of Accrington, Lancashire, who . works at a day school for children with behavioural difficulties.

Their latest assignment is a seaside photo shoot before the judges - singer Stacy Solomon, fashion model Lilah Parsons and Hollywood dog agent Addison Witt - make their decision. Scarlett sported a hanky on her head as she sat on a deckchair for her beach shoot, while Lucky took a fairground ride and Simba sat on a slide. The show had 2,500 applicants.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . A black box inside your car will tell insurers when you've crashed and also alert the emergency services (file picture) All new cars are to be fitted with a ‘black box’ that could tell your insurer the moment you are involved in a crash. The devices will also alert the emergency services to the accident – but data protection campaigners fear it could lead to ‘Big Brother surveillance’ of millions of motorists. They fear drivers will have their habits and destinations recorded and potentially sold on for commercial gain. Insurance firms already offer cut-price cover for drivers willing to have their every move recorded on a memory card under the dashboard to prove they are safe drivers. But EU legislation will make it compulsory for every new car to have an electronic ‘SOS’ black box system linked to satellite tracking that will alert the authorities to a crash. Some systems can tell how many people are in the car thanks to sensors in the seats, or even allow the police to slow a car down remotely if it is stolen. Web-based Insurethebox.com, which has 350,000 drivers who already use black boxes, said: ‘The data is used to assess driving safety, as well as to assist claims handling. ‘Our service centre receives an alert whenever the data suggests a car may have been involved in an accident. 'The box also works as a tracking device, so we can help police to locate the car in the event of a theft.’ Insurethebox said data collected from its customers was never sold on to third parties.

But Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch said: ‘There is a risk that drivers will lose control over who has access to their data and how they will use it. It is easy to imagine government departments and commercial companies, including the insurance industry, will be clamouring to get hold of drivers’ information.’","New cars will be fitted with the black box device to tell insurers of a crash .

"By . Louise Eccles . Victim: The unnamed woman says she was raped by Jimmy Savile when she was a 16-year-old virgin . A woman has told how she became pregnant after Jimmy Savile lured her to a hotel room and raped her when she was a 16-year-old virgin. Now 65, she recalled the ‘shame’ of being taken to a doctor by her mother to have an illegal abortion, without painkillers, and spent two years paying back her grandmother for the cost of the procedure. She met Savile in 1963 when she was invited to speak on Radio Luxembourg, for which he was a DJ, about her Elvis Presley fan club. He told her he was going to meet Elvis the following month and asked her to give him a photograph of herself that he could show The King. The teenager obliged and was delighted when, upon his return, Savile phoned her home to invite her to his London hotel because he had a gift to give her ‘from Elvis’. The junior secretary walked to his Russell Square hotel after work, feeling ‘as if I had died and gone to heaven because I was about to speak to a man who had met Elvis’. Breaking a 50-year silence, she said: ‘You can’t imagine how excited I was to find out what Elvis had said to him. ‘His room was on the ground floor right next to the reception, and when I knocked on the door, he answered in his pyjamas. ‘The only man I had ever seen in his pyjamas was my father so I was quite surprised. ‘As soon as I got inside he pinned me against the wall and started kissing me hard. ‘I said “stop, stop”. He was trying to encourage me not to struggle and saying, “you’re an angel”. ‘I wanted to shout but I was too embarrassed. I didn’t want anyone to know what was happening.’ She described how he forced her on to the bed and raped her. The pretty blonde teenager weighed just six-and-a-half stone. She said: ‘I couldn’t stop him. I was telling him it hurt. I was holding my body so tight to try to stop him, but he was so heavy, he was too strong. ‘Afterwards he said to me “you’re all right now”, as if he had done me a favour.’ Savile . got dressed and, shortly after, a male friend of the star knocked on . the door. He opened it and the man looked straight at her, lying in the . bed frozen with terror. ‘He . asked Jimmy if he was ready to go for dinner and Jimmy turned and asked . me if I wanted to join them. I shook my head and he left,’ she said. Tricked: The woman, pictured at another photoshoot aged 17, says she was lured to Jimmy Savile's hotel room by the prospect of gifts from her idol Elvis . Savile left three badges on the dressing table for her, apparently from Elvis. They said ‘I’m a kissin’ cousin’, a reference to the film he appeared in. She still has them today. ‘I had to get the train home and I was worried people could tell,’ she said. ‘I was late home for tea, but I had to pretend everything was normal.’ She missed her next two periods and, suspecting she was pregnant, took the day off work and tried to induce a miscarriage. Her parents realised something was wrong and her mother asked whether she was pregnant. ‘I told her I thought I was,’ she said. ‘They knew it was Jimmy because he called the house the same week to speak to me. My mum told him I was pregnant and he said “it’s not possible”. Those were his words. He didn’t call again.’ The woman recalls her father, a plumber, ‘crying in the front room’ during this time. ‘For his daughter to have gone through that, it was hard for him,’ she said. ‘My mum was raised by strict Victorian parents and she was less emotional and more practical about it.’ She took her daughter to their local . GP on a Sunday morning when the surgery was usually closed. The doctor . was known to carry out abortions illegally for women in the area. The . Abortion Act was not passed until four years later, in 1967, allowing . terminations to be carried out by registered practitioners. The doctor was paid £150 by the family – the equivalent of £2,200 today. She was given no painkillers and describes gripping the sides of the bed in agony during the procedure. Painful debt: She was forced to have an abortion, borrowing £150 from her grandmother. Despite this horrific incident, however, she went on to have a modelling career - and later married and has three children . ‘The worst bit was that we couldn’t afford the abortion so my nan had to lend us the money. I paid it back in instalments for the next two years out of my secretary wages,’ she said. ‘We were a close family and I had had the most lovely, innocent childhood, so it was hard for my parents. ‘I never even thought to report it. We were a little family from Essex. He was Jimmy Savile. After the abortion, we never spoke about it again.’ Her parents have since passed away. A year later, aged 17, she was scouted by a modelling agency  and began to do catalogue work, including for Marks & Spencer and Gillette razors. By chance, when she was 23, she met her attacker again when she was picked by a modelling agency to dance and stand behind the DJs presenting Top Of The Pops. She said: ‘I was excited to be on the show and wore black satin hot pants. I thought it would be good for my modelling career. But when I got there and they told me it was Jimmy Savile, I felt sick. On screen with Savile: The victim appeared as a dancer Top Of The Pops seven years after the attack and said she 'felt sick' when she found out who was presenting . ‘I told myself he wouldn’t recognise me, but he turned around and noticed me. But then he said, “It’s you, it’s angel”. I didn’t say anything. He looked a bit taken aback and I was pleased by that. I was older and he couldn’t hurt me.’ The woman has since married and has three children and several grandchildren. She has bravely agreed to release photographs of herself as a teenager, to show how she looked when Savile assaulted her – but she wishes to remain anonymous because she has never told her children what happened. Tragically, she suffered several miscarriages in her 20s and ‘always wondered if it was because of what they did to me when I had the abortion’. She says she was also faced with seeing and hearing her attacker wherever she went – on the television, on the radio and in print. Savile’s career peaked in the 1970s and he fronted several prime-time shows. She said: ‘I couldn’t watch him when he came on the television. I had to leave the room. It wasn’t Jimmy Savile to me, it was the man who had forced himself on me and it brought it all back when I saw his face.’ When he died, she said she was ‘sickened’ by all the tributes. ‘I was angry that everyone kept saying how great he was.’ Now, she says she wants to see him stripped of his knighthood posthumously. She said: ‘When it started to come out that he had attacked other girls I felt relieved. You think it is just you and something you did to make it happen. ‘I want people to know what he was really like. I want justice to be done and for people to know the truth.’ She married her husband in the 1980s and has three children. She continued to work as a secretary for several years before becoming a full-time mother and housewife. The woman, who lives in a smart detached house, confided in her husband about the rape, but kept it from friends and family. She said: ‘I tried to bury it in my mind, but it was always there.’ KATRINA ROSE . Katrina Rose, now 51, said she was attacked in Savile's flat aged 14. BEBE ROBERTS . Bebe Roberts, now 62, claimed the ‘sleazy’ presenter regularly sneaked into bedrooms and once assaulted her when she was 15. DEBORAH COGGER . Deborah . Cogger, a 52-year-old mother-of-two, claimed she was aged 14 when . Savile allegedly kissed and groped her at a residential school. DEE COLES .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Updated: . 08:12 EST, 27 March 2012 . A mystery disease is turning an increasing number of children in east Africa into zombies. The condition, known by locals as the 'nodding disease', drastically alters children's personalities by making them withdrawn and confused. One of the first symptoms of the illness, affecting children in northern Uganda, Sudan and Tanzania, is that children appear to be falling asleep - their eyes close and head droops, even though they may not be tired. Many children suffering from the nodding disease die from malnutrition because they won't eat . Children suffering from the condition are withdrawn and have no interest in eating . The condition gets progressively worse . and can cause affected children, generally aged between five and 15, to . fall and injure themselves . Many die by losing consciousness and have horrific accidents, like falling into a cooking fire or drowning. Other symptoms include losing cognitive ability and experiencing stunted growth. Some suffer epilepsy-like seizures and struggle to eat - becoming shells of their former selves. Others die of infections because they are weak or malnourished. Some children with nodding disease are abandoned by their families because they are too difficult to look after . In northern Uganda alone, 3,000 children have the illness, but numerous cases have also been reported in Sudan and Tanzania . One mother in northern Uganda, Grace Lagat, where 3,000 children have the illness, told CNN how her two children have been affected by the nodding disease. She said they suffer from seizures and after each attack are less like the children she remembers. Speaking about her 13-year-old daughter Pauline, she told CNN: 'Her personality has changed greatly from before. 'She was normal when she was born. Now she just moves around and serves no purpose.' The . seizures are triggered in strange ways, say community members, such as . when unfamiliar food is brought to the children or when the weather . changes. Pauline Oto, who has the nodding disease, still wears her faded yellow and green school dress but hasn't been to school for years because she can no longer write or understand what goes on in her lessons . Grace Lagat, from northern Uganda, is forced to tie her two children up whenever she leaves her home to stop them wandering off . There are other bizarre symptoms with the children often wandering off by themselves and getting lost in the bush. Other children have started fires, according to parents and medics in the field, while some appear confused and traumatized.

That is the question that officials in New Jersey were trying to answer after a dead 15-foot-whale that washed up in Atlantic City was found Thursday morning spray-painted purple. Police say the markings are not gang-related and appear to be Greek letters. The symbols were Tau Epsilon Phi - the name of a fraternity that has chapters at several area schools - followed by what looked like '94.' Marine mural: Bob Schoelkopf, right, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, looks over a minke whale covered in graffiti that washed up along with a common dolphin, in foreground, in Atlantic City . Belly up: The purple symbols spray-painted on the mammal's underbelly appeared to be Tau Epsilon Phi . Clue: Tau Epsilon Phi is a national fraternity that has chapters at several area schools . Bob Schoelkopf, of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, told The Press of Atlantic City the whale appeared to have been dead for several days and washed up during a strong storm. It had no sign of trauma. A state pathologist will try to determine the cause of death. Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the deceased marine mammal was discovered at around 8am under the Central Pier with its white underbelly covered in purple markings linking the tagged ocean critter to Tau Epsilon Phi. The century-old fraternity has 14 active chapters, including at Rowan University, University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers Camden. MailOnline reached out to the national offices of Tau Epsilon Phi for comment Friday afternoon, but have yet to receive a response. Deceased: The whale appeared to have been dead for several days and ended up under Atlantic City's Central Pier after a recent storm . Final resting place: The tagged whale, pictured alongside a common dolphin that also washed up on the beach, was eventually dragged to the Boardwalk for burial . After several chunks of the dead whale's carcass were carved up for examination, the mammal was dragged with chains and heavy machinery from the pier for burial. The defaced whale was laid to rest in eight feet of sand near the Boardwalk, raising concerns among some local business owners that the decomposing remains would spread foul odor in the summer heat. A common dolphin also washed up dead along the beach seven blocks away from the whale. Minke whales are common in the North Atlantic. Their weight could reach up to 20,000lbs, and adult animals could grow to be 35feet in length. Some whales live to be 50 years old. Majestic creature: Minke whales are common in the North Atlantic.

A BBC tennis commentator said sorry to former GB Davis Cup captain David Lloyd after suggesting he could be prevented from leading the Lawn Tennis Association because of alleged 'personal problems' Andrew Castle was forced into the official apology after his comments during a rain delay chat with Sue Barker at the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club in Kensington, London. He has agreed to pay undisclosed damages to Mr Lloyd. Tennis commentator Andrew Castle, 49, has apologised to former player David Lloyd, 65, right, after suggesting alleged 'personal problems' could rule him out of becoming chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association . Mr Castle made the remarks during the AEGON tennis championships at London's Queen's Club on June 12 . Interest around succession at the LTA . has been heightened by the widespread disbelief at recent revelations . that current chief executive Roger Draper was earning £640,000 a year. He is due to stand down in September and leaves what is regarded as a generally under-performing organisation. A statement published on the BBC website said: 'BBC commentator Andrew Castle suggested there were issues in the personal life of David Lloyd which made him unsuitable to be considered for the role of CEO of the LTA. 'Mr Castle would wish to make clear that his comments were without foundation and apologises to Mr Lloyd for any embarrassment or distress caused.' It is understood businessman Mr Lloyd was alerted about the disparaging remark by his brother John, a BBC tennis pundit who will be working alongside Mr Castle at Wimbledon. A joint statement release by the men today, seen by The Guardian, said: 'The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs. Andrew Castle's apology to former tennis champion Mr Lloyd was put on the broadcaster's website . Sue Barker, left, and Andrew Castle, right with French player Jo-Wilfied Tsonga, cover Wimbledon for the BBC . 'However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate. 'Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.' Mr Castle's gaffes didn't end there. He was accused of causing ructions by announcing at Queen’s that Andy Murray was donating his winnings to the Rally Against Cancer charity fund when the Scot wanted to keep it private. Murray said: ‘I haven’t spoken to anyone about it.' Roger Draper will stand down from his £640,000-a-year job at the LTA in September . Andrew Castle was speculating over the future head of the Lawn Tennis Association, based in Roehampton . Mr Castle was a professional tennis player for six years from 1986 and was a regular member of the British Davis Cup team.  He represented England in the Olympics twice, and reached the third round in the 1987 US Open, losing to Boris Becker. He became a television presenter after retiring from tennis in 1992, and hosted GMTV for a decade.  He has commentated on tennis for 10 years, working alongside Tim Henman, Boris Becker, Sue Barker and John Lloyd. David Lloyd, who was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was one of the most successful British tennis players of the 1970s and 1980s, alongside his younger brother, John. He captained the British Davis Cup team, and went on to found a successful chain of eponymous health and leisure clubs.  He has coached Tim Henman, and is a keen art collector.","Castle, 49, made comments during rain delay with colleague Sue Barker, 57 .

It turned out the boys were football players at William Patterson High School, and stopped by the shop during a break in practice. Thomas James, Kelle Gallimore, Jelani Bruce and Anthony Biondi are all playing their first year of Division III football for the school, and were running some errands before practice on Sunday. They were in need of an audio cable for a set of dorm room speakers and some batteries, and didn't have any luck at Rite Aid, so they walked into Buddy's where the door was open and a few lights were still on. The teens told the station that they didn't believe they did anything special and that they were surprised by the attention.

"By . John Stevens . A woodland beauty spot is to be turned into a purpose-built New Age travellers’ camp using £1.1million of taxpayer’s money. The picturesque site at Haldon Hill, near Exeter, Devon, has been used illegally for 12 years. But now the existing ramshackle camp will be transformed into a permanent site with 15 official plots for ‘new travellers’ under the plans approved by Teignbridge Council. Plotting plots: Plans have been approved to spend £1.1m of taxpayers' money on this illegal site to turned into a permanent travellers camp . The purpose-built site, which is thought to be the first travellers’ camp of its kind in Britain, will include communal allotments, a children’s play area and composting bins. The hard-standing pitches will be fitted with amenities such as electricity, water, showers and toliets. A community building will be added, along with site roads and visiting parking. There will also be a site manager to deal with any problems. The travellers arrived in August 2001 and since then the camp has grown into a collection of caravans, old buses, huts and shelters that house up to 50 people. Opponents of the council's decision believe the present camp should be cleared and the residents moved on. Picturesque? A sign revelling in the death of Lady Thatcher is seen at the illegal site which is set to be Britain's first official purpose built camp for travellers . Claims: Despite the site being on council grounds, the travellers, who have been living there since 2001, only welcome visitors who have 'appointments' Clean-up: The site is currently littered with debris but after the million pound project is over the site will sport communal allotments, a children's play area, and composting bins . But the council said it has granted planning permission for the permanent site as it believes it will be a smaller and tidier alternative to the current camp. Philip Vogel, Teignbridge District Council executive spokesperson for housing and planning said: ‘This decision is to be welcomed. ‘The site could not stay as it was. Residents did not have access to suitable sanitation, the encampment was unauthorised and it was having a negative impact on the surrounding environment and the wider Haldon community. ‘Like authorities up and down the country, we need to provide sites that are suitable for gypsy and travellers. This site will go some way towards addressing that need.’ The Department for Communities and Local Government announced last January that it was making £60million available to help build new sites for travellers. Invasion: The woodland site at Haldon Hill off the A38 near Exeter in Devon, has been used illegally for 12 years . New site in sight: The new camp will have 15 official plots which Teignbridge District Council claims are 'needed' to cater to local gypsy and travellers . The Homes and Communities Agency, which is distributing the funding, confirmed that it will fund the project in Haldon Hill as a site to be allocated to New Age travellers. Mike Hanrahan, chief executive of Teign Housing, which will manage the development, said: ‘This site, for new travellers, will be the first of its kind and has a unique opportunity to act as a model for similar opportunities within the district and across the country. ‘There are lots of different opinions about this project, but we now have the chance to lead by example and build a better understanding and more tolerance of each other’s lifestyle choices.’ Travellers living on the existing site will be allowed to remain there until the new plots have been constructed. Those currently at the site will have the chance to be housed on the redeveloped plots. Anyone living there would have to pay a fee, which would include a service charge and the pitches would also be subject to council tax. Travellers who are not allocated a pitch will be helped by the council to find ‘alternative suitable accommodation’. The council said enforcement action will be taken against any travellers then remaining on the land.","Exeter council spend £1.1million to transform illegal site into 'new age camp'

"By . Associated Press . A Russian student who went missing in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming has been found dead. The body of 20-year-old Aleksandr 'Sasha' Sagiev was found in the park Friday. The student from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, was reported missing Monday after going for a hike. After a three-day search, Sagiev's body was discovered below a steep traverse, known as Cache Couloir, in Glacier Gulch. His body was found at an elevation of about 9,400 feet, and was removed via helicopter long-line. Body found: Aleksandr Sagiev, 23, was last seen at a pizza restaurant three days before his body was found . The National Park Service said Friday that his body has been taken to nearby Jackson, Wyoming. Sagiev was a seasonal employee at Dornan's Pizza & Pasta Restaurant, a shop near the park. He was last seen using his cellphone at the bar of the restaurant, park spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said, and the alarm was raised when he did not turn up for his next shift. 'It's concerning because he's a very responsible person,' Skaggs said at the time. About 60 searchers had been looking for him since he was last seen at work Sunday. Sagiev had spent a lot of time walking and hiking in the park since arriving in June, and rangers had talked to his friends to find out what his routes and habits were, Skaggs said. Co-worker Nicole Nicklas said Sagiev recently talked about planning a day trip to nearby Yellowstone National Park. On Wednesday, searchers used dogs and boats along the Snake River near the resort but found no trace of Sagiev. On Thursday, searchers said Sagiev may have been hiking Taggart, Bradley or Delta lakes. The search was complicated by heavy rain and thick clouds near Taggart Lake Trailhead, where authorities believed Sagiev started his hike. Authorities say that when Sagiev was found, he was wearing the metallic blue 'Sochi' jacket that he was last seen wearing. The jacket helped in locating his body in the rocky terrain, the park service reported. There was no immediate word on the cause of death. An investigation is planned. It is unclear where in Russia Sagiev is from. His Facebook page says he's studying at the Higher School of Economics, which has its main campus in Moscow.

Claire Stewart, 37, from Kincorth, Aberdeen caught sight of the strange-looking out over her back garden at 9.30am. She said: 'I was just looking out from my home in Kincorth when I saw the cloud. 'It looked like a UFO and I had to double take before I realised it was actually a cloud.' Strange sighting: It was likely that the odd cloud in Aberdeenshire sky was formed in the Cairngorms mountains . 'I've never seen anything like it before, but apparently they're called lenticular clouds. 'It's very weird.' A number of Aberdonians took to social networking sites to say they had seen the UFO-shaped cloud as well. Norma Lawson said: 'I also got a photo of this when I was at Garthdee at 10am...amazing.' Shona Gibson added: 'Beam me up Scotty.' Spooky: The sight Claire Stewart saw  in her back garden in Kincorth this morning . Lenticular clouds form when stable moist air flows over a range of mountains. The clouds have been mistaken for UFOs in the past because of their smooth saucer-like shape. A Met Office spokeswoman said the cloud was likely to have been formed over the Cairngorms. She said: 'These photos show an excellent example of a cloud called Altocumuls Lenticularis. 'Lenticular clouds can form at heights between 6,500 and 16,500 ft, and are called lenticular because of their lens shape . Confusion: Lenticular clouds like these are thought to account for many of false UFO sightings around the world . 'The clouds can be seen as far as 60 miles downwind of the hills or mountains that led to their formation and they are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO sightings across the world. 'They can be seen at any time of year as long as the atmospheric condition are right. 'Both the clouds and the high temperatures are a result of the way the wind was blowing on Monday morning - from west to east - this means the western side of Scotland is seeing cloud and rain, but as the air moves over the mountains it becomes dry and cloud free allowing the temperatures to rise.'","One resident said they did a 'double take' before realising it what it was .

Police have made several large-scale busts involving Lego thefts in recent weeks, as criminals have become increasingly aware of the ease and speed at which the Danish toy can be sold online. The toys also quickly increase in value, and like Uncut Diamonds, are difficult to trace. Police are regularly uncovering large-scale Lego thefts as criminals increasingly become aware of the ease in which the toy can be on-sold, their increasing value and the fact they are largely untraceable; the above picture is of 18-pallets of Lego seized during a recent raid on the Arizona, U.S home of Troy Koehler . Nathan Francis, who legally sells sets of Lego on BrickLink in his spare time, said it makes 'total sense' that thieves would turn to the toy to make easy money . Gloria Haas, 53, was this week charged with grand larceny after allegedly snatching 800 sets of the toy - worth £35,000 - from a Long Island, New York, collector before trying to sell them on eBay, Vocativ.com reported. Less than 48-hours later, in Phoenix, Arizona, police arrested four people in connection with £24,000 worth of Lego stolen from toy stores. They also found £120,000 of Lego merchandise - 18 pallets worth - in one of the suspects' homes and in a storage facility. In Phoenix, earlier this month, police arrested Garry Fairbee, 35, Tarah Dailey, 33, and Melissa Dailey, 34, who were allegedly stealing the most valuable Lego sets they could find, before passing them on to Troy Koehler, 40, who is believed to have sold them online. In a more elaborate example of the crime, last . year police arrested Thomas Lagenbach who made his own bar codes which he then placed on Lego sets so he could buy them at a cheaper price. Tarah Dailey, 33 . Melissa Dailey, 34 . Troy Koehler, 40 . Police found hundreds of sets of stolen Lego in the Silicon . Valley tech executives home. Earlier this year thieves in Australia used angle grinders and crowbars to steal a haul of the toy from four separate retailers, and in England thieves have struck Lego trucks before the toy could even reach stores. In almost every case, the stolen Lego is sold online, where limited edition sets - like those linked to movies - can fetch several thousand pounds. Nathan Francis, who legally sells sets of Lego on BrickLink in his spare time, told the website it makes 'total sense' that thieves would turn to the toy to make easy money.","During a bust police found 18-pellets of Lego at one alleged thief's home .

'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone . remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery. 'Out of respect to public opinion, to those who are buried there, and to . those who tend their graves and visit there, we have decided to remove . it.'

The Manchester musician and funnyman, who scored an unlikely hit with The Rochdale Cowboy, was given the bullet from his weekly programme after 15 years. Mike, right, said: 'Jimmy Savile interfered with kids on the BBC's premises and got away with it. Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand joked about having sex with Andrew Sachs' grandaughter on the BBC and got away with it. 'I present a folk show for 15 years, build the audience from 70,000 to 860,000, and get the sack - and it's me that's supposed to be the comedian."" Mike, 67, will make way for Manchester City fanatic Mark Radcliffe. He added: 'I got a two-minute phone call from the controller of Radio 2 [Bob Shennan] which is the first time I have heard from the bosses in 15 years . 'I'm in the dark and have no idea why they have done it. You get sacked from the BBC for two reasons. One, financial - and it can't be that because I've not had a rise in 15 years. And two, declining audience figures - and mine haven't. They have sold the folk world down the river.' Mike, who lives in Manchester city centre, said Mr Shennan had refused to go into details about reasons behind the decision. He said: 'He [Mr Shennan] said I wasn't ""live"" - I wasn't aware I was dead. I am not bitter I just don't understand it. It's a specialist folk music show and I am a specialist in folk music.' Mr Shennan said: 'I'd like to thank Mike Harding, who has spent 15 years at the top of his game, delighting fans with his expertise and rooting out the very best folk music.

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . A new bike lane has been dubbed 'suicide alley' by cyclists who say it takes them towards the middle of a road and past hazards including parking bays. Transport chiefs in Reading, Berkshire, say the layout of the newly-painted cycle lane ‘meets design guidance and is aimed at accommodating all road users’. However, neighbours living nearby have complained that the lane takes cyclists dangerously close to oncoming traffic, and that cars passing in the road have no option but to cross into the cycle lane. Dangerous? A new bike lane has been dubbed 'suicide alley' by cyclists who say it takes them towards the middle of a road and past hazards including parking bays . Design: Transport chiefs in Reading, Berkshire, say the layout of the newly-painted cycle lane 'meets design guidance and is aimed at accommodating all road users' They have also expressed fears that anyone opening the door of a parked car, without checking their mirrors first, could knock a rider into the path of oncoming cars, lorries and buses. Adrian Lawson, chairman of the Reading Cycle Campaign, said the new lane is potentially deadly. 'It . is disgraceful. Government notes say you shouldn’t put in a cycle lane . if it is going to make matters more dangerous,' he said. 'There . is no buffer zone which means if someone opens a door of a parked car . the cyclist is knocked off, so riders are forced to stay outside the . cycle lane which is going to upset following motorists.' Mr . Lawson suggested a wide grass verge could be converted to allow for . more off-road car parking, and improve the area for cyclists. One motorist, Caroline Downs, said: 'Reading road planners seem to have very little thought for cyclists these days and even less for the motorists. Route: Cyclists say there is no room for two vehicles to pass on the road without crossing into the cycle lane . Fear: Neighbours living nearby have complained that the lane takes cyclists dangerously close to oncoming traffic . 'The law says you cannot drive in a cycle way, but with cycle paths on both sides of this road, one almost in the middle of the road, there is hardly room for two cars without driving in the said cycle path. 'God knows what will happen if two larger vehicles come towards each other. It’s an accident waiting to happen.” Another driver said: 'This new cycle lane has been painted on the northbound side to join the one that was already there on the Reading-bound side. 'The absence of centre lane markings and a narrow section near the traffic lights means Henley and Reading-bound traffic is now vying for the same bit of road.' A string of comments have also been left on the Caversham Gossip Girls Facebook page with one member complaining she was almost hit by another car driving on her side of the road, while one cyclist said they would be using the pavement because it is safer. Guidance: A council spokesman said the lanes were there for 'guidance', and that road users should be aware of others around them . Worry: Fears have been raised that anyone opening the door of a parked car, without checking their mirrors first, could knock a rider into the path of oncoming cars, lorries and buses . Council spokesman Anna Fowler defended the layout. 'The omission of centre lines from urban roads is encouraged by central government as it has a positive impact on reducing vehicle speed,' she said. 'The overall width of Lower Henley Road has not been reduced, but a cycle lane has been added to accommodate cyclists travelling up the hill. 'It is an advisory cycle lane, which means it is there for guidance only. It does not mean road users - whether cyclists or motorists - should stop being aware of each other as they travel along Lower Henley Road. 'The width of the Lower Henley Road - with the added cycle lane - meets the design guidance if the council were building a new road. 'Apart from playing an important role in drainage, the grass verge to the side of the road is banked in parts which means it could not all be removed to accommodate a cycle lane. 'We would also always ask drivers opening car doors to check for cyclists in their wing mirrors, as required by the Highway Code. 'The parking bay along the road was provided following local surveys. The layout will be monitored and reviewed over time however and alterations could be considered in the future.'","Lane in Reading, Berkshire, has been criticised by cyclists and drivers .

"By . Martin Robinson . New probe: Six police officers are being investigated by the IPCC, who are considering whether they could have stopped paedophile singer Ian Watkins earlier . Six more police officers are being investigated over claims they could have stopped paedophile rock singer Ian Watkins before he abused two babies. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is probing whether staff at three police forces failed to act because the ex-Lostprophets frontman was famous. The watchdog has served gross misconduct notices on three South Yorkshire Police officers, two Bedfordshire Police officers and a South Wales police officer as part of its ongoing inquiries. One officer from South Wales Police was issued with the same warning last year, taking the total now under investigation to seven. Singer Watkins is currently serving a 35-year prison term for a string of child sex offences. Described as a 'committed' paedophile, he used his fame to seduce young fans who allowed him to abuse their babies. After his trial it emerged that police were allegedly warned of his child porn obsession four years before he was jailed. Three independent IPCC investigations are ongoing into the on the response of South Wales Police, Bedfordshire Police and South Yorkshire Police to allegations that Watkins was abusing children. The commission is investigating complaints around the handling of three reports made to South Yorkshire Police between March and May 2012 which contained allegations against Watkins with potential evidence. A sergeant and two constables from this force have now been served with notices advising them that their conduct is subject to investigation. The IPCC said it is also investigating Bedfordshire Police's handling of information from a member of the public who reported an allegation of child abuse against Watkins in October 2012. A sergeant and a constable have also been served with the notices. The South Wales Police detective constable, who was attached to the Child Protection Unit, is the second officer from the force to be investigated. Criminal: Watkins was 'a determined and committed paedophile' but questions remain over whether police were warned about him before his trial . IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'We are making good progress with our three independent investigations and as result of our inquiries IPCC investigators have served notices on six further officers as part of the ongoing investigation - three from South Yorkshire Police, two from Bedfordshire Police and a second from South Wales Police. 'Arrangements are being made to interview the officers in the coming weeks. 'We have now conducted two interviews with a detective sergeant from South Wales Police about his actions in relation to information about Ian Watkins. We anticipate he will be interviewed again in the near future. 'We are continuing to gather and analyse information in all three investigations in order to establish what steps were taken by police in response to the allegations made against Ian Watkins, whether he could have been brought to justice sooner and whether his celebrity status had any impact on those investigations.' The commission said it has received a substantial amount of documentation from the three forces which is being analysed by investigators.","The police officers are from three forces across England and Wales .

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Stephen Wright . Prolific abuser: Simon Wood at a fundraising event in a BA uniform . Victims of a paedophile British Airways pilot claim that a colleague at the airline helped him to abuse vulnerable children in at least three countries in Africa. They say Simon Wood was helped and protected by a network of associates, including a male airline colleague, another British man and a female manager at one of Nairobi’s orphanages. The trio are not believed to have been directly involved in sexual abuse against children, but lawyers are probing claims they helped the 54-year-old, who killed himself last month, to access his victims and to cover up his crimes. Up to 50 alleged victims of First Officer Wood are now considering legal action against BA over the paedophile pilot’s crimes, details of which were revealed in yesterday’s Daily Mail. They say they were molested by the £100,000-a-year pilot during his stopovers and charity work in Kenya. It is feared Wood – now suspected of abusing hundreds of orphans and slum children in Kenya – also targeted youngsters in Uganda and Tanzania. The suggestion that Wood was aided by a colleague will be of enormous concern to BA. Martyn Day, a partner at UK law firm Leigh Day, said it was in contact with 40 to 50 families who believed their young daughters were molested by Wood. Twelve have so far given interviews to lawyers about their ordeal and some have named a second British Airways employee and another British man. Mr Day said his firm was working with British police to investigate the claims, and was considering launching legal action on their behalf against Wood’s estate and BA. He said: ‘One man we are looking  at is a British Airways staff employee and there’s another who is British but not a BA employee. ‘There are allegations they were involved in some way in facilitating Wood’s activities, but not in the abuse itself. Target: Inside the Tulia Kidzonwe orphanage in Nairobi . ‘There is a big question about British Airways and the extent to which they had a vicarious responsibility.’ Scotland Yard declined to comment on claims a second BA employee helped Wood. Officials at the Tulia Kidzone orphanage in Nairobi say one of their managers was dismissed in January this year after she was found to have allowed Wood access to vulnerable children. In return, it is claimed the BA pilot bought her a car, helped her to get a mortgage and enrolled her own child in a charity ‘sponsorship’ programme. Accountants were called into the orphanage earlier this year and were said to have uncovered a ‘myriad of financial issues’ in Wood’s handling of charitable donations to the centre. Managers said it was still unclear whether Wood used his own money to pay off his network of associates. Nyumbani Children's Home for kids infected with HIV in Kenya had a connection with Wood - but managers said they have received no complaints of abuse against any of their children . They contacted Leigh Day earlier this year to beg them to investigate, after official complaints about Wood in Kenya appeared to have stalled. Wood, who claimed he was carrying out charity work for BA, was stopped only after he was charged over separate child sex offences in the UK last month. The pilot threw himself under a train near his home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, last month, just days after appearing in a court in London accused of the offences. Vulnerable: Wood at theTulia Kidzone Centre, where he is playing the accordion to the children . Wood first came to the attention of British police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl. He met her while volunteering for Diabetes UK at a summer camp in North Yorkshire in 2000. Wood was investigated over the sex attack the following year, but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him. He then stepped up his charity work overseas. Wangui Mbatia, from the children’s rights group Organising For Kenya, revealed someone had sent an anonymous note to BA earlier this year, telling them Wood had molested children in Kenya. Three BA officials visited a children’s centre in July to discuss the claims. ‘They wanted us to understand that BA wasn’t involved,’ she said. ‘BA came to tell us they had nothing to do with it but we think they had everything to do with it. Now BA are missing in action. ‘We told them a pilot had gone bad and they told us to be quiet. They should be here to help us.’ BA insists it has never tried to cover up the scandal. Asked about claims a second BA employee might have helped Wood, the airline said last night: ‘We continue to give the Met our fullest cooperation on this investigation.’ In a statement, the CPS said there was originally ‘insufficient evidence’ to charge Wood over the sex attack in North Yorkshire. But new evidence prompted them to authorise police to charge him over the allegation and child porn offences last month. A Diabetes UK spokesman said they were continuing to support police inquiries, adding: ‘Our thoughts are with all those affected and we have offered our support to the family of the complainant.’ Wood’s mother Christine, 77, refused to comment at her home in Cumbria yesterday.

"By . Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail . Dr Elena Martellozzo of Middlesex University tracked the home address of 15 children with just their names using their parents' Facebook updates . Parents are putting children at risk of abuse by posting too much personal information online, a criminologist has warned. Elena Martellozzo carried out a trial and just knowing a name is enough to find the home addresses, personal details and pictures of most youngsters. The expert, who advises Scotland Yard on sex offenders’ use of the internet, said children tend to be more savvy than adults. More often than not it was information posted on sites such as Facebook by naive parents that made it so easy to identify their offspring. Dr Martellozzo said parents ‘want to say how wonderful their children are but they are not aware of how much they are putting them at risk’. She urged them to keep their children safe by not posting their address, the name of their school or details about birthdays. For her project, Dr Martellozzo, of Middlesex University, was given the names of 15 children in Manchester whom she had never met or seen. She said: ‘I could easily get to their homes just through some easy research and it was because their parents kept posting info about them.’ Many teachers feel parents rely on them to help pupils use the web safely but Dr Martellozzo said this was a family responsibility.

"By . Stephen Wright . and Vanessa Allen . Predator: Simon Wood at a fundraising event for BA's charity work in Africa . A British Airways pilot used his position to abuse hundreds of vulnerable children in African schools and orphanages, the Daily Mail can reveal. First Officer Simon Wood, 54, claimed he was carrying out charity work for the airline while molesting scores of young girls during his stopovers in Africa. Dressed in a bogus captain’s uniform, he would use the airline’s good name – and even BA branded toys and colouring books – to lure children out on day trips and to five-star hotels used by the airline, where he would abuse them. British Airways is now facing a hugely damaging lawsuit brought by his victims, who say the company failed to protect them from his horrific abuse. After abusing children for 15 years, the £100,000-a-year pilot was finally stopped when he was charged with separate child sex offences in the UK. Days after appearing in a court in London last month charged with the offences, Wood threw himself under a train. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: ‘The prosecution say that Mr Wood was a deeply depraved and corrupt individual who had used his ability to fly to other parts of the world to commit sexual offences against children.’ Officials in Kenya have identified at least 15 children, all believed to be girls aged five to 11, that Wood abused – and say they fear there are hundreds more. As British Airways launched an international investigation into the ‘shocking’ claims, questions were asked over why the pilot – who was arrested after indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl in 2000 – was ever allowed to work near children.' Prosecution sources said they feared the pilot could prove to have been among Britain’s most prolific sex offenders. Vulnerable: Wood at a Kenyan children's home (left) and with a child at the Nyumbani Children's Home for kids infected with HIV (right) During his 16-year career with British Airways, Wood chose unpopular routes in and out of East Africa, using his stays there to prey on vulnerable children in the slums. Wood’s first known contact with children in Africa came in 2001 when he began visiting the Nyumbani orphanage in the Karen area of Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. It was the first centre of its kind in Kenya to accept only children infected with HIV, and managers said they had received no complaints of abuse against any of their children. At Easter 2002, he was among 20 crew members from two BA flights who volunteered to spend the holiday period with the Kenyan youngsters, showering the orphanage with presents, medicines and donations raised at home. He told the UK news agency the Press Association, which covered the trip: ‘We play, sing, organise activities and generally entertain them. We become very close to the children.’ Horror: Simon Wood kills himself after being accused of molesting young girls at an orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya. Picture shows the dormitory inside the Tulia Kidzone Centre, an orphanage in Eastleigh, Nairobi. In fact Wood was using the prestige of his pilot’s uniform to gain access to children for the purposes of abusing them. Much of the most recent abuse happened during stopovers in Uganda, his normal flying destination, from where he would cross the border to Kenya to target slum children and orphans. Officials in Kenya say, he claimed he was a member of ‘BA’s community relations programme’ when approaching orphanages and schools. If managers complained about his behaviour, Wood made official complaints to the police that the staff involved were stealing from the children’s homes, and at least two managers were arrested over his allegations. Wood first came to the attention of police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl. He met the girl while volunteering for Diabetes UK, escorting young children on a trip to North Yorkshire in 2000. Nyumbani Children's Home for kids infected with HIV in Kenya had a connection with Wood - but managers said they have received no complaints of abuse against any of their children . Wood was arrested over the sex attack, but – in an echo of the Jimmy Savile scandal – the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him. He was allowed to keep his job at BA and, in an indictment of the vetting system, continued his charity work with children. The mother of one young victim told the Mail her daughter was abused at a five-star hotel used by BA crew in Nairobi. She said that after loaning her money Wood duped her into letting him take the five-year-old girl to the Nairobi Intercontinental. ‘I trusted him completely because he seemed so good and so kind. I trusted him with everything, even with my daughter,’ she said. A picture of Wood, taken in Nairobi Central Park. A child has used a pen to disfigure the face . The girl, now 14, is struggling at school and has become tearful and withdrawn. She has threatened suicide to escape the shame and misery Wood inflicted. When suspicions arose about Wood in Kenya, one local school contacted a British law firm, whose staff travelled to Kenya with a view to beginning legal action against both Wood and British Airways. But when they realised the extent of Wood’s sexual offences against the children they passed the matter onto British police. Following a tip-off, UK officers re-arrested him on July 18 in the BA staff car park at Heathrow over the child sex allegations. When they searched his laptops, they found explicit images of African youngsters. During a police search of Wood’s car several school uniforms were found, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told. Prosecutor Mr Zinner said: ‘His computer was seized and evidence was obtained to show that he had visited various paedophile websites.’ Wood appeared at the court  on August 16 charged with possessing indecent images and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old schoolgirl. He was granted bail on the condition he surrender his passport but two days later he threw himself under a train near his home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. Prosecutors announced last Wednesday that as a result of his death, they were halting the case. Jennifer Swiddon, representing Wood, said that her client intended to deny all offences against him prior to his death. It was revealed in court that police suspected Wood had abused more than 100 African children. A well-placed legal source said it was now feared that Wood had targeted hundreds of girls during his BA career. Before his death, Wood had transferred £64,000 to his legal representatives in Africa. Detectives suspect he was planning to use it as ‘hush money’ to buy off his victims or to open an orphanage in Uganda where more youngsters could be targeted. The families of Wood’s brothers Nicholas, 52, and Anthony, 51, said it was ‘a difficult time for the whole family’ and declined to comment. UK-based law firm Leigh Day have confirmed that they are acting for the alleged child abuse victims of the late Simon Wood in Kenya and are working with the police to determine quite how many children were abused and the extent to which this extended to victims in the UK as well as Kenya and Uganda. Martyn Day from Leigh Day said: 'We are currently investigating how Mr Wood was allowed to have such access to these Kenyan children and also the extent of the allegations against Mr Wood in relation to his actions in the UK.'

"By . Lydia Warren . Abby Hernandez, the New Hampshire teen who vanished for nine months before returning home, has said she is 'feeling a lot better every day'. The 15-year-old, who vanished on October 9 as she left her high school, also revealed that she often saw her local newspaper during her time in captivity - and she felt hope when she saw its box noting the number of days she had been missing because she knew people were still looking for her. She spoke to the media in person for the first time on Thursday morning as she visited the offices of the newspaper, The Conway Daily Sun, to express her thanks for their commitment to the case. 'I'm taking it a little at a time but I'm feeling a lot better every day,' she told staff. 'I'd just like to be treated like a normal person.' Scroll down for video . Standing strong: Abby Hernandez, center, is pictured with her mother Zenya, left, and family friend Amanda Smith, right, who led the 'Bring Abby Home' campaign. They are pictured at newspaper offices on Thursday . She was joined by her mother Zenya, who said that she had also seen the boxes counting the days her daughter had been missing - but for her, it was tough to see. 'As . sad as it was to see the days growing and increasing, we truly thank . you,' she said. 'Abby saw that off and on. She didn't see it every . day. It gave her hope that people were looking.' Abby returned home on July 20 but the circumstances of her disappearance, where she was held and how she ended back home have not been released by authorities. But it is widely believed that the teenager was held captive in a storage container on the property of alleged kidnapper, Nathaniel Kibby, 34, from Gorham.

But while many of Kibby's neighbors have described him as 'scary' they said there was no indication he was hiding a teenage girl on his property. Kibby, who is being held on $1 million bail, will next appear in court for a probable cause hearing on August 12, when additional charges against him are expected.","The New Hampshire teen said that she was given hope whenever she saw the paper because she knew people were still looking for her .

"By . Will Payne In North Conway, New Hampshire . Investigators have started dismantling the container where Nathaniel Kibby allegedly held 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez captive for nine months – as it emerged the structure may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms. FBI officers and State Troopers have been working on the crime scene 24 hours a day, since Kibby’s dramatic arrest at his home in Gorham, New Hampshire on Monday afternoon. And on Wednesday, they stepped up their search for evidence and seemed to be using some kind of mechanical saw to cut into the shipping container, located behind the 34-year-old’s trailer. What did they find? Police seen Wednesday cataloging evidence from inside a shipping container on Nathaniel Kibby's property in Gorham, New Hampshire. He was arraigned Tuesday on charges of kidnapping Abigail Hernandez in October . Documenting: An investigator takes pictures at Kibby's property on Wednesday with bio-hazard boxes seen in the background . Prison cell: A law enforcement source told a local news station that they believe the shipping container was used to keep Abby hostage during the nine months she was missing . Safety: Investigators later donned bomb disposal gearr. Another police officer pictured on the suspect's property today . At one point, around 2pm, officers suddenly kitted up in what appeared to be bomb disposal, protective uniform, before searching the crime scene. Full evidence boxes marked with biohazard symbols were also visible as FBI technicians worked intensely packing away material to be taken off for analysis. MailOnline can also reveal FBI agents have been asking Kibby’s neighbors a string of baffling questions, including whether they had ever seen him burn or bury anything and whether he was often spotted digging. Courage: Abigail (left) attended Kibby's (right) arraignment yesterday, bravely sitting in the first row of court as he was ordered held on $1billion bail . Outing: Abigail's appearance in court came as a surprise since family friends said she wouldn't show. It was her first public appearance since mysteriously reappearing in her hometown on July 20 . One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a tunnel from his trailer to the container. The resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The FBI have been asking lots of different questions and they all seem to come back to the same couple of things. Have we ever seen him burning anything, or digging. ‘They asked me about digging and burying twice and they specifically asked whether he would have been able to dig a tunnel from the container to the trailer. ‘It seems very strange and makes you wonder what they think he was doing in there. I knew the guy and unfortunately I sometimes saw him on social occasions, but I tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was a strange man. Investigation: Kibby's shipping container pictured Tuesday, just a few hours before his arraignment . ‘I know people who have been in that container and they say it was split into three rooms. He did a lot of work back there. It was sound proofed as far as I know. ‘I have heard he kept Abby in there for the whole winter. It would not surprise me. There is a lot of noise round here, with kids screaming and shouting, so it is possible no one would have heard anything, especially if it was sound proofed. He was always going back there. No one thought anything of it. ‘Still people are shocked about all of this. We all thought he would end up blowing something up, or going out in a blaze of glory, not something like this. ‘He was a gun nut, who hated anyone in authority. When I saw the officers putting their protective equipment on, I thought maybe he had set up a booby trap or something like that.’ Another neighbor, Glen Alden, told MailOnline that he saw Kibby burning something in his yard towards the end of February. He thought it was strange to be having a fire at that time of year, so he decided to record it on video. After a couple of months, nothing further came of the incident, so he deleted the footage. But he has told State Troopers since Kibby’s arrest. Investigators were also seen looking through Kibby's mobile home . Suspicious: One neighbor says he say Kibby burning something in his yard at the end of February and filmed it, but deleted it a couple months later when nothing came of the incident.

"By . Stephen Johns for The Daily Mail . Traditional British dog breeds such as deerhounds, otterhounds, Lancashire heelers and Welsh terriers risk becoming extinct as they are forced out by trendy canines like bulldogs and pugs. The Kennel Club has 25 native breeds on its ‘vulnerable’ list, including many breeds of countryside dogs. Their original roles in agriculture are no longer needed while the popularity of small ‘handbag’ dogs has soared. Out of fashion: Dogs like deerhounds (left) are being pushed aside for 'fashionable' bulldogs (right) The vulnerable status covers breeds with fewer than 300 puppy registrations in a year. No otterhound puppies at all were listed in the first quarter of 2014 and the figure for Lancashire heelers, which were used to nip at cattle’s feet during herding, was only 32. There were 31 Clumber spaniel puppies listed, 16 Sealyham terriers, 96 Welsh terriers and 68 deerhounds. In contrast, there were 2,119 French bulldogs registered, up nearly half on 2013. Famous owners of this breed include the Beckhams, Millie Mackintosh and Hugh Jackman. Handbag dogs: Pugs are also  on the list of popular canines as dogs used for agriculture are no longer needed . The figure for pugs was 1,921, up a tenth on 2013, while 1,565 long and smooth coat Chihuahuas pups were registered. Dr Bruce Fogle, father of TV presenter Ben and a vet in London, urged the Kennel Club to relax its rules to let dogs not registered as a breed to mate with those which are. Secretary Caroline Kisko said the Kennel Club was working to increase awareness of historic breeds and to bring in dogs from abroad if this was beneficial.","Deerhounds, otterhounds, Lancashire heelers are now 'out of fashion'

Elderly residents of Notting Hill were invited to apply for a place on a seaside trip to Eastbourne to avoid the chaos of the colourful carnival this weekend . Last year an estimated 1million people descended on Notting Hill to attend the carnival. While Sunday is thought of as a family day, hundreds were arrested last year for a range of offences . Police carried out a series of pre-carnival raids this week in a bid to preempt crime. More than £90,000 in cash was seized alongside a haul of drugs and weapons . Police have issued guidelines for those attending the event instructing them to stay with the group they arrived with and arrange a meeting place in case they are separated .

The fronts of houses have been boarded up with tall wooden fences by residents in anticipation of the carnival's chaos, as Transport for London makes arrangements for crowd control . The festivities kick off on Saturday night at 7pm with Panorama - an open air parade of steel bands. On Sunday, described as the family friendly day, visitors are invited to the carnival from 6am to watch J'Ouvert, a parade of dancers, musicians and people in fancy dress. At 10am the children's day parade is due to begin. The party will continue until 11pm, when revellers will be shepherded away from the main streets. Monday is the carnival's main event - with a procession of floats, drummers, dancers, singers and party-goers expected to stream through the area all day. DJs and bands are schedule to perform throughout the day and into the night. Transport for London have arranged for additional buses to serve the area throughout the weekend though officials warn public transport will be extremely busy. Ladbroke Grove tube station will be closed on Sunday and Monday, with Notting Hill Gate Station operating on an exit-only basis between midday and 7pm on Sunday and all day on Bank Holiday Monday.

The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council has organised for a selected group of older residents to enjoy a seaside break over the bank holiday weekend while the carnival rages their streets. Limited places for the trip to Eastbourne were advertised on its website earlier this month, with guests taken to a hotel on Saturday and brought back to their homes following the clear up on Tuesday. Earlier this week a teenager was stabbed at an illegal pre-carnival rave in Finsbury Park, north London. Hundreds of youths gathered in Seven Sisters Road on Wednesday as a warm up to the event this weekend. Finsbury Park tube station was closed early to avoid swarming crowds after violence spread among the crowds. A 19-year-old was stabbed in the leg after being caught in a brawl between two groups. A police helicopter was scrambled and four riot vans were sent to the scene where one officer was hit in the face, a spokesman said. Metropolitan Police revealed 155 people had been arrested in pre-carnival raids, with officers seizing £93,000 in cash and a plethora of firearms. Kensington and Chelsea Council issued 60,000 leaflets advising residents on how to prepare for the festival.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Henry VIII was a famous jockey, Jane Austen wrote Oliver Twist and St David is the patron saint for England – these are just some of the hilarious responses to the ‘Britishness’ test from young people who are already citizens. More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds failed the test, which is usually taken by immigrants as part of their application for residency in the UK. But the research carried out by YouGov revealed that older Britons found the 45 minute test a breeze, with 92 per cent of those over 60 and almost 80 per cent of 40 to 59-year-olds passing. 51 per cent of young people failed practice 'Life in the UK' test usually taken by those seeking British residency . Applicants in the real test must answer 75 per cent of the 24 questions correctly to be officially classed as British citizen. However some of those quizzed in the sample test from the latest official handbook either incorrectly guessed or didn’t know the answers to some of the questions on history, society and culture. Five per cent believed Henry VIII was best known for having five sons while one percent thought he was famous for being a jockey. 10 per cent could not name the classic Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility in the multiple-choice task – with two per cent reckoning she had written Oliver Twist. When asked where the National Assembly for Wales was located, four per cent said it was in Newport rather than Cardiff, and one percent thought it was in Glasgow or London. Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave was wrongly thought of as a British author by five per cent of participants while 21 per cent believed factory pioneer Richard Arkwright developed new farming methods in the UK. One per cent believed Henry VIII (left) was famous for being a jockey and 10 per cent could not name the classic novel by Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility, with two percent believing she had written Oliver Twist . The test asked which two services were funded by National Insurance and one per cent answered local taxi services and another per cent said supermarket home deliveries. A handful of those questioned thought Hawaii belonged to the UK while some didn’t know that Remembrance Day and Bonfire Night are always held in November. Six per cent thought Florence Nightingale was famous for her work on children's education in the 19th century and on per cent said Nelson’s Column and Windsor Castle were built in the Stone Age. Meanwhile seven per cent thought St David was the patron saint for England and not Wales. Scotland was the region that scored the worst on the test overall with 20 per cent of the 1,426 sample failing and the south of England (excluding London) coming out top with a 78 per cent pass rate. Applicants in real test must answer 75 per cent correctly to be officially classed as British and get a passport . Q: In 1348 a third of the populations of England, Wales and Scotland died as a result of which plague? A: The Black Plague.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Chris Greenwood . and Inderdeep Bains . PR guru Max Clifford was arrested Thursday on suspicion of sexual offences by police investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal. The noted publicist spent all day being questioned as police teams searched his £3million mansion in Surrey and his London office. Leaving Belgravia police station in central London last night, he said: 'These allegations are damaging and totally untrue. On a personal level they are very distressing for myself, my wife, my family and loved ones. Scroll down for video . 'Damaging and totally untrue': Max Clifford speaks outside Belgravia police station in central London on Thursday evening . Max Clifford, pictured with his second wife Jo Westwood, was arrested and then released on bail on Thursday in connection with the ongoing Operation Yewtree . 'Anyone who really knew me all those years ago and those who have known me since will have no doubt that I would never act in the way that I have today been accused. I have nothing more to add.' Asked when the allegations dated from, he replied: '1977, 35 years.’ He later confirmed there were two allegations, although it is not known whether they relate to two different people. Sources close to Clifford, 69, said he was confident he had nothing to worry about. He is the fifth suspect to be arrested – and sixth person to be questioned – in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after late Top Of The Pops presenter Savile was exposed as a serial abuser. There are three strands to the Yewtree operation – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford falls into this third category, meaning he was not being questioned about anything connected to Savile. Held on suspicion of sexual offences, Clifford said the allegations date back to 1977 . British publicist Max Clifford walks out of a police station in central London on Thursday evening after being released on bail . He was arrested in a low-key operation at 7.40am, when two unmarked police cars and two white transit vans arrived at his three-storey home on an exclusive gated estate in the Surrey stockbroker belt. Later, officers could be seen putting black bags believed to contain items from his house into the back of the vans, while flashes at the large windows suggested officers were taking photographs inside. A neighbour who saw the cars arrive said: ‘The arrest has come as a massive shock, as he is well respected in the community. The allegations are totally out of character.’ Clifford has been a vocal commentator on the Savile scandal, and last month said a lot of old stars were worried about being dragged into the investigation because they had appeared on Top Of The Pops or Jim’ll Fix It and had merely posed for photographs with girls and Savile.

"By . James Salmon for the Daily Mail . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Almost 300 customers are deserting the Co-op Bank every working day due to a ‘hurricane of bad publicity’, its boss admitted yesterday. The bank’s near-collapse and a sex and drugs scandal involving former chairman Paul Flowers have proved the final straw for tens of thousands of savers. In the first half of the year, 37,921 people switched their current accounts away from the Co-op, which attracted just 9,722 new customers. Drought: The loss of 300 customers a day is thought to be the biggest in the bank's 141-year history . The loss is thought to be the biggest in the bank’s 141-year history. Chief executive Niall Booker described the loss of each customer as a ‘mortal wound’, but said he had expected even more to defect after the bank’s ‘hurricane of negative publicity’. He pointed out that the desertions still accounted for less than 2 per cent of their current account customers. The comments came as the bank revealed it made a £76million loss in the first half of the year, much less severe than the £845million loss incurred in the same period last year. This was largely due to a drop in losses from bad loans, and a smaller bill for wrongdoing. Scandal: It comes after the bank's near-collapse and the expose of Paul Flowers' sex and drugs scandal . But they went on to reveal that the bank would still be vulnerable if there was ‘an unusually high level of withdrawals’ as it is so reliant on deposits from customers. James Daley, a consumer campaigner and founder of website Fairer Finance, said: ‘The results suggest the business is a complete basket case and give very little cause for optimism. 'I cannot see any good reason why a customer would want to move their account to the Co-op.’ However in an appeal to customers, Mr Booker claimed the Co-op is an ‘ethical’ bank. He said: ‘The Co-operative has a valuable role to play providing customers with a different choice, set apart as it is by the values and ethics that remain a key reason why customers choose to bank with us.’","Bank's near-collapse provided final straw for tens of thousands of savers .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Bedford has been crowned the UK's most generous town, according to data gathered by  JustGiving. The donation site compiled its list based on the number of givers and the amount donated in relation to populations. Of those 79,150 people with a 'Bedford postcode', more than half (41,631) gave a total of £1,145,967 to charity appeals on the site in the year to May 2014. Bedford, in Bedfordshire, has been named Britain's most generous town, according to the donation website JustGiving. Pictured here is the Victorian footbridge over the Great Ouse . Cambridge and Reading were denied top spot by Bedford, with Brentwood, Woking, Aberdeen (the only non-English representative), Cheltenham, High Wycombe, Watford and Bristol making up the top 10 ranked towns. This was determined by calculating how much a town had donated via the site - adjusted to account for the number of donors relative to the population size. The Mayor of Bedford Borough, Dave Hodgson, said: 'It's fantastic to hear that Bedford has come out on top as the most generous town in the country, but it's no surprise. 'I know how generously people give not only their hard-earned money but also their time and energy both to national and to the many excellent local charities. Cambridge (pictured) and Reading were denied top spot by Bedford in the generosity table . 'Charities and individual fundraisers do incredible things in aid of charitable causes locally, and they are clearly very well supported by the generous, warm-hearted people of Bedford Borough.' The data only reflects donations made via JustGiving, the UK's largest charity fundraising website which is widely used for people undertaking sponsored events to raise money for good causes. It does not take into account other charity donations made by people such as putting cash in collections, making payments via direct debits and standing orders, or through other online services. 1.

"By . Aladair Glennie . British television is being bought wholesale by greedy American corporations, the head of Channel 4 has warned. The channel's chief executive David Abraham said billionaire media tycoons and production companies want to invest in this country to avoid tax in the US. ITV could one day be owned entirely by shareholders based across the Atlantic while our favourite shows could be produced by internet giants such as Netflix and Google, he said. Giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, Mr Abraham called on politicians to do more to protect the UK television industry from overseas interference. Channel 4's chief executive David Abraham has warned British television is being bought wholesale by greedy American corporations . In a swipe at Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey, who gave the same lecture last year, he said: 'In recent years we've seen a parade of Americans standing up here at the MacTaggart telling us how things ought to be done. 'But how do you explain the number of US entities queuing up to buy our producers and now our broadcasters? 'Doesn't this suggest that maybe as with our gun laws and health system it's us who are showing them how it ought to be done?' Mr Abraham said the UK's public service broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - have 'created the best conditions for creative programme-making on the planet'. Using the BBC's 1990 political thriller House of Cards – which has recently been remade by Spacey – as an example, he said: 'Would Netflix, for example, have bought a show about a murderous politician who broke the fourth wall of drama if the BBC hadn't taken that risky decision, decades before?' Mr Abraham warned that US investors are buying up our channels and production companies in a modern equivalent of the 19th century 'gold rush'. He cited the U.S. remake of the political thriller House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey as an example . Earlier this year, American media giant Viacom bought Channel 5 for £450million from Richard Desmond, and Liberty Global – owned by billionaire mogul John Malone – bought a 6.4 per cent stake in ITV. Mr Abraham said: '[Malone is] understood to be the largest landowner in America, was nicknamed 'Darth Vader' by Al Gore, currently holds a net debt of $41billion and famously, hates to pay tax.' He added: 'US media companies [are] eager to stay ahead of each other by internationalising their revenues…and shielding their tax exposure.' Mr Abraham warned that American companies such as Google – which has started producing set-top boxes – may not have the interests of UK viewers at heart. He said: 'What level of accountability and responsibility are we prepared to expect from platforms that operate across technical and geographical boundaries? 'And how could we expect people whose idea of a good time is a 24-hour code-athon, to relate to the needs of the UK television audience?'","David Abraham said ITV could be owned entirely by US shareholders .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Forget Google Glass, smartwatches and even the biohacker who inserted a microchip under his skin, Motorola is hoping to trump them all with its microphone tattoo. According to a patent filed by the Google-owned phone maker, the tattoo would be placed onto a person’s throat and pick sounds created by their voice. If the user is making a phone call, the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone and the caller. According to a patent submitted by Google-owned Motorola, the firm also has plans for electronic tattoos, illustration pictured, that could be used to read fluctuations of muscle or tissue in the throat and register what the wearer was saying. These plans could be a step towards microchips in brains . The tattoo’s built-in . microphone would pick up the sounds made by a person’s voice by reading . vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox. If the user is making a phone call, the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone, and the caller. Motorola said the tattoo would either . contain a battery that ‘may or may not be rechargeable’, or . alternatively, could be powered by an NFC or Bluetooth charging device. The patent added: ‘it is contemplated  the electronic tattoo can also be applied to an animal.’ The patent is called ‘Coupling an electronic skin tattoo to a mobile communication device’ and was originally filed in May last year. Throughout the patent, Motorola calls the device ‘electronic tattoo 110’ and said it would ‘comprise audio circuitry that enables reception of acoustic signals from a person's throat’. Put simply, the tattoo’s built-in microphone could pick up the sounds made by a person’s voice by reading vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox. It continues that the tattoo would either contain a battery that ‘may or may not be rechargeable’, or alternatively, could be powered by an NFC or Bluetooth charging device. The patent addedsaid: ‘it is contemplated that the electronic tattoo 110 can also be applied to an animal as well.’ Motorola is set to release its new Moto G handset on 13 November, a leaked image of the phone is pictured, and some analysts believe the software may be updated to work with devices such as the neck tattoo. A release date for the tattoo has not been announced . Explaining the reason behind the plans, Motorola said: 'Mobile communication devices are often operated in noisy environments. 'Large stadiums, busy streets, restaurants, and emergency . situations can be extremely loud and include varying frequencies of . acoustic noise. 'Communication can reasonably be improved and even . enhanced with a method and system for reducing the acoustic noise in . such environments and contexts.' Motorola is set to release its new Moto G handset on 13 November and some analysts believe the software may be updated to work with devices such as the neck tattoo, yet a release date for the tattoo has not been announced. As with all patents, the submission doesn't guarantee the technology will ever be available. Motorola announced in May this year it was looking to replace traditional passwords with electronic tattoos or authentication pills that people swallow. The neck tattoo isn't the first time Motorola has discussed the wearable technology. Motorola's senior vice president of advance research Regina Dugan, showed off an electronic tattoo at the D11 conference in May, pictured, designed as an alternative to traditional passwords . Speaking at the D11 conference, . Motorola's senior vice president of advance research Regina Dugan . showed off a tattoo, developed by Massachusetts-based engineering firm . MC10, that contains flexible electronic circuits attached to . the wearer's skin. She claimed these circuits, . which also contain antennae and built-in sensors, could be adapted to . work with mobile phones and tablets. The mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner's identity and log them in to accounts automatically. This would prevent thieves and other . people from being able to access a phone, or individual apps on the . device, if it is stolen or lost. Another password-alternative presented by Motorola at the Wall Street Journal's D11 conference was the 'vitamin authentication pill'. It contains a computer chip that creates an 18-bit signal when swallowed. Motorola is testing whether this signal can 'talk' to mobile phones and be used to authenticate a wearer's identity . Another idea presented during the keynote talk at the Wall Street Journal conference was a swallowable pill. The Proteus Digital Health pill has . already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and was given European regulatory approval in 2010. It contains a computer chip that can be powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer's stomach. Once swallowed the 'vitamin authentication pill' creates an 18-bit ECG-like signal inside the wearer's body that can be picked up by mobile devices and authentication hardware outside. This could be used verify the wearer is the correct owner of the device or account.","Tattoo picks up sounds caused by changes in throat muscles when talking .

"By . Larisa Brown . Frank Bruno has claimed Jimmy Savile forced him to shake hands with the Yorkshire Ripper at Broadmoor. The former boxing champion said he had no idea he was meeting the serial killer until after the picture of their hand shake had been taken and if he had known it was Peter Sutcliffe he would have tried to 'get out of it.' After being introduced to Sutcliffe at the secure psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, Savile then sneered: 'You'll never guess who that was'. The 50-year-old boxer says he has been haunted by the photograph ever since the meeting in 1991. Former boxer Frank Bruno, right, pictured at Broadmoor in 1991 shaking hands with Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe as Savile stands in the background. Frank says he was tricked into shaking hands with the murderer . The unsuspecting boxer recalled the events after discovering his old friend of 20 years and mentor Savile was a predatory paedophile. He said Savile introduced him to the Ripper while they were doing a walkabout of the hospital where he had just opened a gym. Frank recalled Savile telling him, 'I want you to meet this gentleman', and said of the event, 'I didn't know who he was', and 'thought nothing of it'. He told the Sun: 'Savile . planned it. It was not a nice thing to do to me. If I had known it was . the Ripper, I'd have tried to get out of it.' The news comes after it was revealed sick pair Savile and Sutcliffe appeared to have formed a disturbing friendship, with the BBC star . visiting the killer in jail and describing him as a 'mate' after later . trips to see him in Broadmoor Hospital. And a former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper last week made the shocking claim that Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes. Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Frank Bruno, left, said he 'didn't know' Peter Sutcliffe, right, was the Ripper who murdered 13 women . Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West . Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to . catch Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active . one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy . Savile, strange as it may seem. 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' It also emerged a dentist made a cast of Savile's teeth to check against the bite-marks found on the bodies of the Yorkshire Ripper's victims. It was made clear that detectives went to some lengths to find out if Savile was connected to the shocking serial killing spree in the 1970s. Savile, pictured, appeared to have formed a disturbing relationship with the Yorkshire Ripper . His teeth were examined in 1980, a year before Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to kill seven others. Two prostitutes thought to have been killed by Sutcliffe had bites on their breasts. He denied killing one of them, but detectives at the time thought he was lying to cover for an accomplice. Two of the Ripper's victims were found near Savile's home in Leeds, and Sutcliffe even named Savile in police interviews. Sutcliffe was asked why he placed a victim's boots over her legs before he left the park. He said: 'For two reasons. One, because I could hear voices from I don’t know where and a car had just driven into an entrance just behind the building — that was the block of flats I found out later where Jimmy Savile lived. 'Secondly I was surprised to see how luminous she appeared in the dark.' Boxer Frank met Savile in the late 1980s as the began attending the same charity events. They remained friends for at least 20 years. Last month, Frank, of Bedfordshire, who has, in the past, been forcibly sectioned under the Mental Health Act, said battling his mental health issues 'may well be the toughest fight of my life'. He is now fighting fit and dating hairdresser Nina Colletta — his first serious relationship since divorcing wife Laura in 2001.","Former boxing champion says he had no idea man he greeted was Ripper .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Ancient weather folklore says that if it rains on St Swithun's Day - July 15 - then there will be downpours for the next 40 days. But the 14th century rhyme says if the weather stays fair then it will remain dry instead. And as legend would have it Hillesley in Gloucestershire reportedly followed suit for the majority of the month, after a hot sunny St Swithun's Day this year. The village of Hillesley in Gloucestershire, showing the war memorial, stayed almost rain-free for most of July and August after a hot St Swithun's Day on July 15 this year . This picture was taken on July 16 - the day after St Swithun's Day - which started off bright and sunny with highs of 22C but towards the evening there was a downpour . The centre of Hillesley (pictured on August 8). The weather was mostly cloudy, with slightly cooler temperatures and winds of up to 10mph in the evening . A photographer, who lives in the village, took a picture of the same scene in the village every day between July 15 and August 23, recording the weather conditions. 21-year-old Alistair Johnstone’s photographs show the war memorial in Hillesley and a view of the village looking out to the River Severn. He said: 'It did rain but they were only passing showers and didn't even last long enough for me to get my camera out. 'I remember that St Swithun's Day was really hot this year because I'd be sent out to take pictures for work.' He was able to get the photographs by making a mark on the ground and taking a picture before he went out each day. 'St Swithin's Day, if it does rain . Full forty days, it will remain . St Swithin's Day, if it be fair . For forty days, t'will rain no more.' 'You can see in some of them that the ground is slightly wet from when there had a shower but the majority of the month was really dry and sunny'. Statistical data from the nearest weather station recorded a downpour at midnight in the area on July 15 but after that it remained bright with a top temperature of 22C. The folklore’s roots are disputed but the legend is believed to have stemmed from St Swithun (or Swithin), the Bishop of Winchester who died in 862 AD. By his own request he was buried in the churchyard of the Old Minister Cathedral at Winchester in a place where ‘the sweet rain from heaven might wet his grave’. But a century later he was made patron saint of Winchester Cathedral and so his body was dug up and moved to a new indoor shrine. It was said that his spirit was so outraged that it rained for the next 40 days and so the fable was born. However the myth is not entirely backed up by the fact and none of the early accounts of the reburial mention a drop of rain. The view across the River Severn from village of Hillesley in Gloucestershire taken everyday for the last 40 days after the photographer tried to prove the ancient legend . The rolling hills of the village on July 27 was variably cloudy but it didn't rain at all. The photographer Alistair Johnstone was trying to prove the St Swithun's legend . Pictured on August 18, which was another full 24 hour period without a drop of rain - which possibly follows the legend of St Swithun's 40 day period . Meteorologists at the Met Office say that there are no historical statistics that support the idea either. And the Royal Meteorological Society agree, saying that not a single 40-day drought has occurred anywhere in the UK during the summer months since records began. It says: ‘There has been not one instance at any time of the year of 40 consecutive days of rainfall. Sunshine on St Swithun's Day in Miami may well auger 40 days of unbroken sunshine, but in Blackpool it most assuredly does not.’ However experts from the society believe there is some sense to the rhyme adding that the middle of July tends to be around the time that the jet stream settles into a relatively consistent pattern. ‘If the jet stream lies north of the UK throughout the summer, continental high pressure is able to move in, bringing warmth and sunshine. If it sticks further south, Arctic air and Atlantic weather systems are likely to predominate, bringing colder, wetter weather.’","Ancient weather folklore says that if it rains on St Swithun's Day (July 15) then it will rain for the next 40 days .

"It came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after allegations of historic child abuse at the home . By . Emily Allen . A photo has emerged which shows paedophile Jimmy Savile surrounded by children at a Jersey care home where 192 youngsters allegedly suffered abuse. The Jim'll Fix It star is pictured in the grounds of Haut de la Garenne, posing comfortably on the grass with about 30 children of a variety of ages . The Jersey home came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after police took statements from 192 alleged victims of historic child abuse at the home. The star (front) in the grounds of Haut de la Garenne, with about 30 children. Police believe there is 'no reason to doubt' that Savile assaulted girls there. It is not suggested that any of the children pictured were victims . One hundred and fifty one alleged abusers were identified following the three year probe and seven were successfully prosecuted. Savile has always denied he was a regular visitor at the home and when The Sun published this photograph in 2008 his lawyers tried to put a block on it, the newspaper said. The photo is believed to have been taken in the late 1960s. Last week, the former head of the . Jersey child abuse investigation Lenny Harper said there was 'no reason . to doubt' that Savile indecently assaulted girls there. Harper, the Jersey police . detective who led a three-year probe, said that Savile's . name came up in the initial police inquiry four years ago. Implicated: Sir Jimmy Savile relaxing at his flat in Leeds. Since his death he has been linked to the notorious children's home scandal in Jersey . However, he added that there were no specific allegations of abuse against the BBC presenter at the time and not enough evidence to proceed. Mr Harper, who has since retired from . the force, added: 'There definitely wasn't enough even to question him . at the time, but in light of all the evidence that has come out then I'm . not surprised because it fits perfectly the profile of what was going . on.' A solicitor who acted for victims . said that some former Haut de la Garenne residents, both women and men, . now claim they were assaulted by Savile in the 1970s. Alan Collins said 'a handful' of former residents had now made abuse allegations about Savile. One man this week said he was abused by the entertainer at the home aged 10.

"By . Leon Watson . The former Portuguese police chief accused of libelling Madeleine McCann's parents is planning to sue them back, it emerged today. Goncalo Amaral, who was axed from the investigation into the missing three-year-old, accused Kate and Gerry McCann of causing him 'enormous damage' and the effect was 'moral, professional and financial'. Writing on Facebook, Amaral, 55, said: 'The time to judicially react to those who put my privacy, intimacy, freedom of expression and opinion and survival at stake is approaching. The former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral  arrives at the courthouse for the trial in which he is accused of libel by the British couple Gerry and Kate McCann. He is now believed to be suing them back . Kate McCann (left) and her husband Gerry McCann (right), parents of missing British youngster Madeleine McCann, talk to the press after delivering statements at the court house . 'They have tried to assassinate me civilly. But due to the support and solidarity of all of you, they were not successful.' Amaral has been on trial at Lisbon's Palace of Justice after claiming Kate and Gerry McCann faked their daughter's abduction. Now he is believed to be launching a counter case against the couple claiming they breached his right to 'privacy and freedom of expression'. Amaral made the claims in a book about their role in the disappearance of their daughter from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007. Madeleine McCann, who  disappeared on the evening of Thursday, May 3, 2007, from her bed in an apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal. She was on holiday there  with her parents . The book, The Truth of the Lie, was published a year later. Amaral also ridiculed the McCanns' claims of feeling socially isolated by pointing out they spoke in Parliament and were quizzed by TV's Oprah Winfrey, The Sun on Sunday reported today. Madeleine disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. The McCanns are suing for libel over claims made in Mr Amaral's 2008 book, including suggestions that they hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident and faked an abduction. They say the allegations damaged the hunt for their daughter and exacerbated their anguish. Mr McCann also told the court in Lisbon that one group distributed a leaflet called 60 Reasons Why Madeleine McCann Was Not Abducted to their neighbours in Leicestershire. If successful, the family stand to gain around £1million in damages. A judgment is not expected in the trial until later this year.

"By . Ben Endley . A pregnant woman who sexually abused a nine-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl to please a man she had never met has been jailed for six years. Marie Raison, 25, sent disturbing images of her touching the two young children sexually to Paul Dent, 29, a paedophile she met online. The pair met on an internet dating site and their conversations quickly turned to sex. Marie Raison sexually abused a nine-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl in order to please a paedophile she met online . Paul Dent, who has a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child, actively encouraged Raison to molest the young children . Dent, who has a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child, actively encouraged Raison to molest the young children so he could satisfy his own desires, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard yesterday. Raison, a former school cleaner and nursery nurse, was pregnant with another man’s child at the time of the offences between May and July last year. When she was arrested Raison tried to blame her sister for taking the photos while Dent told officers he was angry that not enough women were being jailed for child sex offences. Jailing Dent for seven years and Raison for six years Judge Martin Zeidman QC, said: ‘Ms Raison, this was the most horrific of offences. ‘It is important to note that this was not just a plan, it was a conspiracy that was implemented and undertaken on a number of occasions. ‘You, Dent, did not of course physically carry out the assaults but you pressed vigorously for more and more images and showed great irritation when they did not come as quickly as you wanted. The pair were sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London yesterday . ‘And to make it worse you have a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a child. ‘Of course it was you Raison who actually did the physical acts but it was you Dent who enthusiastically pressed her to do so. ‘That said, there was nothing to prevent you Raison from discontinuing the internet conversation - he was not with you or in your home - you could have just stopped all communication but you wanted it to continue. ‘I have reached the conclusion that you are both as bad as each other. ‘I make it absolutely clear that I totally reject the suggestion your sister played a part in creating or sending these images.' Raison and Dent showed no emotion as they were jailed. A series of messages and pictures were found on Raison's phone both sent to and received from Dent . Prosecutor Charlotte Newell said: ‘They met on the internet and it quickly progressed into Dent asking Raison to sexually abuse the children. ‘Suffice to say he indicated he would like to visit her which she encouraged - he had made it plain that his own sexual fantasies with the children included sexual intercourse. ‘It was only discovered when a friend found the messages on her phone being exchanged. ‘They were arrested in their respective parts of the country and their computers, laptops and phones were searched.’ A series of messages and pictures were found on Raison’s phone both sent to and received from Dent. In interview Raison said she had only had Dent’s number because her sister had told her to contact him. She also said she had met her sister every day that week but prosecutor Ms Newell described Raison’s excuses as ‘a pack of lies.’ Dent told police he had received a random text from Raison and the last time he had spoken to her he had asked her to stop sending the pictures. He also told police he was angry about the ratio of men to women that had been convicted of child sex offences and so he had amassed the messages to see how far she would go. Both children are in foster care and have suffered no apparent physical or psychological harm. Ms Newell added: ‘It can only be speculation at this stage but both children haven’t shown any signs of physical or psychological harm.’ Dent has since expressed a desire to under-go sexual offences prevention treatment. Raison, of Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, and Dent of Washington, Tyne and Wear, admitted two counts of conspiracy to commit sexual activity with a child and one of conspiracy to take indecent photos of a child. Three counts of encouraging and assisting in the commission of an offence, two of sexual activity with a child and eight of possession of indecent photographs of a child were all left to lie on the court file.","Nursery nurse Marie Raison met paedophile Paul Dent on dating website .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Adam Barker, son of Ronnie Barker, has sold the house where he hoarded thousands of pictures of child pornography, reports suggest . The paedophile son of Ronnie Barker has sold the house where he hoarded child pornography for £550,000, reports today suggest. Adam Barker, 45, was first arrested in June 2003 at the property in Ealing, West London. 1,675 images and videos depicting child pornography were discovered by officers. Barker, who went on the run for eight years following his arrest, has now sold the property for £550,000 - making a profit of £450,000, The Sun reports today. According to the newspaper, Barker bought the house in 1991 for £100,000. It is believed to have been sold two weeks ago. The six-figure profit is in addition to the £1.4million inheritance Barker received from his late father Ronnie, who passed away in October 2005 aged 76. When his father passed away, he left £275,000 to be split between his three children - with the rest going to his wife Joy. Barker is thought to have never received the £91,000 he was left as he nobody knew where he was living. When Joy died in 2011,  each of her three children received a split of her £6.5million estate - roughly £1.4million. Barker also earns money from a company called Handles for Forks Ltd, which manages and distributes his father's work. According to financial documents, the company has in the region of £1.3million total assets. It was co-created in 2012 by Barker and his two siblings actress Charlotte, 50, and advertising executive Laurence, 53. Last year, experts predicted Ronnie's family could be earning up to £300,000 per year through the business. Barker was arrested in 2003 during a dawn raid on his home as part of Operation Ore after officers traced credit card payments he made for some of the images stored on his home computer. At the time, he is believed to have said a detective examining the computer:  ‘You’d better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.’ An artist's impression of Barker at hearing at Uxbridge Magistrates court in 2012. It has been reported today that Barker sold the property for £550,000, having bought it for £100,000 . Barker with his father and mother in 1997. The man, who missed both of his parent's funerals while on the run, turned himself in to a west London police station to face justice . Barker then went on the run for eight . years - during which time both his father and mother died - and was . reportedly living in Hungary. He reportedly left a note which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my computer. I was arrested. ‘I must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some time.’ The whereabouts of the part-time actor, who appeared in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice, handing himself in to a police station in west London. During his trial, Isleworth Crown court was told of the . 1,675 images and videos found at the actor's home, two were graded level . five - the highest possible category. Barker, the youngest son of comedian Ronnie, right, also co-owns Handles for Forks Ltd - which distributes his late father's work and has in the region of £1.3million assets . A further 24 were graded level four - . which often includes footage of child rape. He was jailed in October 2012 after admitting 20 counts of making indecent images of children, 17 of which were of pre-teen boys. Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’ Speaking about a letter written by Barker’s sister to the court, the judge added his decision to flee ‘caused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience. 'But for the court’s processes it means you prevented justice taking its course’. He was released on January 22 after 13 weeks in jail.","Adam Barker 'has sold Ealing, West London, home for £550,000'

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Victim: Sarah Wright, who died aged 39 in November last year, was abused over a ten-year period by former chief superintendent, Alec Alexander . A woman who was raped as a child by her police chief father died from fear that he was about to be released from prison, it has been claimed. Sarah Wright, who died aged 39 in November last year, was abused over a ten-year period by former chief superintendent, Alec Alexander, at their home in Hull, East Yorkshire. He started to assault her on her seventh birthday, before raping her in 1992 when she was 17. Alexander, who worked for Humberside Police, was jailed for ten years, aged 61, in 2008 after being found guilty of raping and indecently assaulting his daughter. But last year, Mrs Wright was told that her father could be released from jail this summer - after serving just six years - on the grounds of 'good behaviour'. The mother-of-three was found dead in her bathroom on November 22 by her husband, Scott Wright, after suffering from severe asthma and pneumothorax. Today, her relatives claimed her death - which came just days before the birth of her first grandchild, India - was linked to her panic at the prospect of Alexander being freed from prison. 'She lived in mortal fear of Alec - she was absolutely terrified and petrified,' said Mr Wright, who had lived separately from his wife of 11 years. 'They [the police] . are going to let us know when he is coming out. He has wrecked . everything for Sarah and her family. He has wrecked it for me and my . children and that lovely little grandchild. It is very cruel.'

Mrs Wright's mother-in-law Eileen Wright, . 63, said that Alexander's abuse of his daughter was 'to blame' for her death. 'I blame him for her death,' she said. 'If she hadn’t had that worry, her . asthma would not have been so bad. She wouldn’t have had that anxiety. 'There . were possible sightings [of Alexander] around Hessle, but that wasn’t true. I think it . had worried her because she thought he might be getting parole this . year. Tragic: Mrs Wright was found dead in her bathroom on November 22 after suffering from severe asthma and pneumothorax. Today, her relatives claimed her death was linked to Alexander's potential release from prison . 'She was really . scared, she was in fear and I knew she was. He is going to be out living . his life and she can’t.' Mrs Wright only told her husband about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father following their marriage at Hull Register Office on November 6, 1992. 'She hid multiple things, but opened up to me . when we were married,' said Mr Wright. 'It was like she was trying to climb over a hill in one big step. It knocked her but she got over it. Case: The mother-of-three waived her anonymity during a trial at Hull Crown Court (pictured) in 2008, where her father was found guilty of rape, two counts of indecent assault and one count of taking an indecent picture .

Mrs Wright waived her anonymity during a trial at Hull Crown Court in 2008, where her father was found guilty of rape, two counts of indecent assault and one count of taking an indecent picture. Alexander was also convicted of downloading almost 66,000 indecent pictures of children - many of which contained images of incest.

"By . Steve Nolan . Teachers are said to be uploading information on their pupils up to six times a day onto a council database (file picture) A huge 'Big Brother' style database containing details of around eight million schoolchildren is being compiled without the knowledge of their parents. IT systems specialists are creating the database - including such information as a child's age, sex, and academic records - which can be shared among officials from other agencies such as the police, NHS and charities. Teachers are uploading information on pupils as often as six times a day to the database, created by Capita, one of the UK's largest contractors to both central and local government. The database is said to be already being used by as many as 100 local authorities, according to The Sunday Times, with 22,000 schools nationwide uploading to the service to provide a 'thread' of data that is accessible to all those working with children. It is thought that youth offending teams, which include police officers, will also be offered access to the information. As well as basic details such as the child's address and attendance records, information about special needs and behavioural records are also included. The majority of parents are not informed that the data is being gathered and can be held on file indefinitely. Director of civil liberties and privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, Nick Pickles, said: 'Parents will be shocked that they are being kept in the dark about how their child's information is being gathered and exactly what it is used for.' Although the firm has provided information management systems to schools for many years, teachers could now upload files to the central One database. Local councils then collate the information and can add information from other authorities to the file. Although councils upload the information, they do not use the children's pictures. Under the Capita One system information about children held on a council database could potentially be shared with other local authorities such as the NHS, police and youth offending services (file picture) A separate software program called API can allow external officials such as social workers to access a child's information. Swindon Borough Council already shares the details of more than 48,000 pupils on its database with youth offending teams and NHS Swindon. The authority said that the data is held within data protection laws and only provided to those who need to see it. But the Information Commissioners Office has confirmed that it will investigate whether use of the One system falls within data protection guidelines. Capita confirmed that local authorities using the system take data protection laws seriously and confirmed that only a few councils were using the software that allows external agencies to view children's information. A spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'Each local authority holds and manages permission and access to its own information held in its Capita One database. 'Capita One is not a centralised database for the whole country.' According to the Department for Education there are currently no plans to centralise the information available through the Capita One scheme.","The databases contain information such as the child's age, sex and academic and behavioural records .

"By . Rob Cooper . A former consultant at the hospital where Jimmy Savile had an office was last night charged with carrying out five sex attacks. Dr Michael Salmon, who worked at the world-renowned Stoke Mandeville Hospital is accused of rape and four counts of indecent assault. The 78-year-old is alleged to have carried out the attacks in hospitals across Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, over a 13-year period between 1972 and 1983. Accused: Dr Michael Salmon, 78, who is charged with rape and four counts of indecent assault . A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the charges stemmed from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree - the investigation into the Jimmy Saville abuse scandal. Salmon, from Woodgreen, Hampshire, was arrested by detectives yesterday and then later charged. He has been bailed to appear at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court on December 17. The doctor was praised in 1987 by Princess Diana for arranging a trip to Disney World in Florida for 300 disabled children. A . police spokesman said: 'We have charged a 78-year-old man with one . count of rape and four counts of indecent assault following advice from . the Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service. 'Michael Salmon, from Woodgreen, was arrested on November 20 and charged the same day. Operation Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made against the disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile. Scotland .

DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high . profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following . Operation Yewtree. They all deny wrongdoing. Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged. Paul Gambaccini last week admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal. Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him. Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his arrest. Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree. Police confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the investigation. Both men have been bailed to a date in early January. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Michael Salmon charged with rape and four counts of indecent assault .

"By . Lucy Osborne . and Nick Fagge . Police have been given the names of doctors who are accused of being in league with Jimmy Savile. One doctor allegedly ‘collaborated’ with the BBC star in selecting child patients to rape at Leeds General Infirmary. Two others worked at Stoke Mandeville, the Buckinghamshire hospital where nurses warned children to ‘pretend to be asleep’ when Savile toured the wards. Savile's Highlands cottage at Glencoe has been vandalised, with the words 'Jimmy the beast' daubed in large black lettering on the walls and windows . Yesterday a child-abusing retired Stoke Mandeville consultant, Dr Michael Salmon, was in hiding after a woman reported him to police for allegedly groping her in 1982. The woman, now 42, told the Mail that Dr Salmon, who displayed a Jim’ll Fix It picture in his office, squeezed her breast while pretending to check her heartbeat to treat her migraines. She said: ‘I was only 12 but quite well endowed. I was so shocked.’ Eight years later, in 1990, the paediatrician was jailed for indecently assaulting three other girls, two aged 13 and one of 17. He served three years in prison and now lives in retirement with his wife Mary, 70, in a £750,000 cottage in the heart of the New Forest in Hampshire. A woman told yesterday how she was raped by Savile at Stoke Mandeville where he wore a T-shirt that read: 'Sex Instructor, first lesson free' Salmon, 77, was ‘unavailable’ for comment, said his wife, adding: ‘He is not here. He has gone away.’ A neighbour said Salmon had been keeping a low profile recently, adding: ‘He has been trying to avoid journalists for the past couple of weeks.’ Dr Raymond Brown, who worked as a consultant paediatrician with Salmon, said the doctor would have known Savile because everyone at Stoke Mandeville knew him. The hospital has refused to answer a long list of questions put by the Mail, including whether the £40million Savile raised for it made him ‘untouchable’. At Leeds General Infirmary, two former women patients have come forward to name a doctor. He is accused of ‘brutal rape’. The National Association for  People . Abused in Childhood charity said: ‘One of the victims has  said Jimmy . and this doctor used to collaborate in choosing girls and taking them . somewhere else to abuse them.’ Leeds . General Infirmary said it had ‘not been passed any information about a . specific allegation or the name of an individual, so understandably we . cannot say any more about this.’ Stoke . Mandeville said it was ‘shocked and saddened to hear of the very . serious allegations’ and was co-operating with police inquiries. A . woman told yesterday how  she was raped by Savile at Stoke Mandeville . while he wore a T-shirt that read: ‘Sex Instructor, first  lesson free.’ Saville pictured with his then PA, Janet Cope, at Stoke Mandeville hospital . Now 51, the woman said she was a 20-year-old volunteer at the hospital when Savile lured her into his room and attacked her. She said: ‘I counted him as a friend as we had worked together at the hospital for a long time and I trusted him. ‘He was very strong and forceful when he realised I was resisting him. After it happened he told me not to tell anyone because he said no one would believe me.’ Following publication of this article, Dr . Salmon contacted the PCC to say that although he worked at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, he was based at a separate campus to Savile. We are also happy to clarify that Dr Salmon never met or had dealings with Savile.","One allegedly 'collaborated' with star at Leeds General Infirmary .

"By . Chris Paine . and Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek has revealed her leader and 'friend' Bill Shorten has had a 'pretty bad week' following historical rape allegations levelled against him. Ms Plibersek opened an address to 400 Queensland Party members at a Brisbane conference on Saturday, where she admitted Mr Shorten's revelations had played a toll on him. The Labor leader said on Thursday he was the subject of an investigation into rape claims stemming from a Young Labor camp he attended near Geelong in 1986. Scroll down for video . Mr Shorten fronted the media this afternoon to address the claims stemming from a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986 . Bill Shorten revealed the matter had been investigated by police and dropped . Bill Shorten and his wife Chloe Bryce, pictured here attending the funeral of Mr Shorten's mother in April this year . Addressing the Queensland Australian Labor Party's 51st state conference in Brisbane, Ms Plibersek said: 'My friend Bill Shorten would have loved to have been here with you today.' 'Bill's had a pretty bad week but he's had a wonderful year.' Aside from this week's allegations Mr Shorten had to deal with the death of his mother Ann in April but has performed well in the opinion polls, especially in light of an unpopular budget. A police investigation cleared the Labor leader who called the rape allegations 'untrue and abhorrent.' Tanya Plibersek told Labor Party members in Queesnland ALP leader Bill Shoten has had a tough week . Mrs Plibersek's comments come after Mr Shorten addressed the media on Friday to confirm Victorian Police had investigated claims made by a woman on Facebook last year. Mr Shorten today released a brief statement in Melbourne which confirmed police had dropped their investigation into claims he described as 'untrue and abhorrent'. 'I will not go into the details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent,' Mr Shorten said at a press conference. Mr Shorten revealed the investigation had been difficult for he and his wife Chloe Bryce, the daughter of former Governor-General Quentin Bryce. 'This has been deeply distressing for my family,' he added. 'I'm thankful for the love and support of Chloe and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.' The alleged victim made claims on Facebook last year that they were assaulted at a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986. 'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions, which advised there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,' read a statement from Victoria Police. 'All parties have been notified that Victoria Police will not be proceeding with criminal charges.' According to Mr Shorten's lawyer, the claims 'go back about 30 years to when he was a teenager' Richard Marles, the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and a longtime friend of Mr Shorten, told 2GB on Thursday afternoon that it had been 'one of the worst moments of Bill's life'. 'I first met Bill in 1987 and I have been a close friend of Bill since that time. I know that these allegations are not true, because the person I've known is simply not capable of undertaking the allegations that have been made against him,' he told Ben Fordham on his radio program on 2GB. 'I have no idea what the motivations are behind the allegations that have been made. 'There's just no way that any of this was possible. These allegations surface almost immediately upon Bill becoming the leader of the Labor Party. 'It's been a really difficult time for Bill. I think this has been one of the worst moments of Bill's life. I think with this being dealt with in the background shows how tough a guy he is.' Mr Shorten's longtime friend Richard Marles said this afternoon it had been 'one of the worst moments of Bill's life' Earlier Mr Shorten's lawyer issued a statement earlier, saying the claims were 'unsubstantiated'. 'My client has maintained from the outset that the claim, which goes back about 30 years to when he was a teenager, was untrue and that he would be cleared,' he said. 'I fully cooperated to clear my name and that is what I’ve done. I freely answered all the questions that the police asked of me,' he added. 'The easy option would be to say nothing, but that is not who I am. I want to address this myself directly.' The woman was reported to be a nurse who now lives in NSW after she made a formal complaint to police last year. 'The police have conducted an investigation they have vigorously and thoroughly investigated it and the matter is now closed,' Mr Shorten added. 'The decision speaks for itself I have no intention after this statement to talk about it any further.' Late last year I learned that a claim had been made about me, going back to when I was nineteen. It was made on social media, when I was elected Opposition Leader. I will not go into details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent. The allegation was made by someone I knew briefly at that time. There is absolutely no basis for the claim. The claim has now been thoroughly and rigorously investigated by police, as is entirely proper. I fully cooperated to clear my name. And that is what I have done. I freely answered all questions the police asked of me. Now the police investigation has concluded, I can make this statement. This has been deeply distressing for my family. I am thankful for the love and support of Chloe, and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues. Others who were aware of the investigation have acted with the utmost integrity by leaving the police to do their job. The police have now concluded the investigation. The decision speaks for itself. It is over. I have no intention of making any further comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tanya Plibersek said Bill Shorten has had a 'pretty bad week'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Peaceful death': Lord McAlpine's family announced that he had died at home . Lord McAlpine, the former Tory deputy chairman who won libel damages from Sally Bercow over false allegations of child sex abuse, died yesterday – three months after settling with the Speaker’s wife. The peer, who passed away aged 71 at his home in Italy, was instrumental in Baroness Thatcher’s Election successes, raising millions for the party as its treasurer. But his final years were overshadowed by a BBC Newsnight report in 2012 that wrongly implicated him in allegations of sex abuse at  the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the programme did not name the politician, during widespread speculation about his identity Mrs Bercow wrote on Twitter: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ The peer accepted £185,000 from the BBC and a six-figure sum from ITV for following up the story. However, Mrs Bercow held out until last October, when she finally apologised for causing him ‘great distress and embarrassment’ and agreed to pay £15,000 damages. She also shut down her Twitter account, which had previously hosted dozens of messages a day – many of them politically partisan and embarrassing to her husband. After the case, Lord McAlpine’s lawyer said the peer had tried to  settle the case earlier ‘to avoid the detrimental effect of litigation on his health’, but Mrs Bercow had refused. He complained that ‘political positioning’ had prevailed over ‘common sense’. The furore also forced the BBC’s . director general at the time, George Entwistle, to quit less than two . months after taking up the role, saying that as editor-in chief he had . to take ‘ultimate responsibility’ for the bungled investigation. Senior Conservative: Lord McAlpine, pictured left in 1998 and right in 1979, rose to the rank of deputy party chairman . Remembrance: David Cameron tweeted in response to the news . Lord . McAlpine struggled with dyslexia at Stowe public school, leaving at 16 . to join the building company founded by his great grandfather, Sir . Robert McAlpine. He showed such a flair for business that within five . years he was appointed a director of the firm. Mrs . Thatcher named him as joint treasurer of the Conservative Party in . 1975, adding the deputy chairmanship in the wake of her 1979 General . Election victory. He was . famed for throwing  ‘champagne and lobster’ parties, hosted in his . trademark corduroy suits, and was credited with bringing in tens of . millions in donations by the time he became Lord McAlpine of West Green . in 1984. A staunch . Eurosceptic, he grew disenchanted with John Major –  at one stage . accusing the former Prime Minister of ‘stuffing up a great party’ and . being ‘distasteful’. He . defected to James Goldsmith’s Referendum Party in 1996, becoming its . leader in 1997 before later rejoining the Conservatives. The . property developer, who was also an author, zookeeper and explorer, . stood down from the House of Lords in 2010 for tax reasons and retreated . to the converted  convent he ran as a bed and breakfast with his third . wife, Athena, in Puglia.

Tweet: Sally Bercow was ordered to pay £15,000, which was donated to charity, after posted the above tweet . He . was previously married to Sarah Baron, with whom he had two daughters, . and Romilly Hobbs, his former secretary with whom he had another . daughter. At one stage he . said of his marriages: ‘I keep changing my life, houses and . relationships. I reinvent myself every few years. My first marriage . lasted 15 years and this one [to Ms Hobbs] 20. ‘It’s . hardly into bed and out the other side. There was a great deal  of . love. But there comes a point when life is just a habit, and I’m rather . against habits.’ David . Cameron paid tribute to him on Twitter yesterday, saying: ‘My thoughts . are with Lord McAlpine’s family – he was a dedicated supporter of . Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party.’ Former . party chairman Lord Parkinson, who worked closely with Lord McAlpine, . described him as an ‘outstanding’ treasurer. ‘He was a most unusual, . intriguing, interesting character with a fantastic range of interests,’ he said. Another ex-chairman, Lord Tebbit, said: ‘He was a joy to be with because he always had something interesting to say.’ Yesterday, . one Twitter user posted on the social networking site: ‘Where’s . #SallyBercow? The dreadful woman is strangely silent. RIP, Lord . McAlpine.’ Colourful: Lord McAlpine pictured in 1994 . In his political days Lord McAlpine was famous for throwing lavish parties on behalf of the Conservative party, and bringing in as much as £100million in donations. Inner circle Tories would be presented with champagne and lobster at grand events during party conferences during Margaret Thatcher’s time as leader. He was remembered for appearing in shabby corduroy suits and a salmon-and-cucumber-coloured Garrick Club tie, welcoming his guests. But the loyal former Thatcher aide changed his tune after she was ousted by her party, to be replaced with John Major. He accused the new Prime Minister of ‘stuffing up a great party’, of running away from every issue and living in a fantasy world. He also called him ‘distasteful’. But Mr Major shrugged off the barbs, once pointedly telling the Commons: ‘I understand that Lord McAlpine is promoting a book which is a work of fiction.’ Lord McAlpine stunned Westminster in 1996 by defecting to the Referendum Party, although he later returned to the Tories. In 2010 he stood down from the House of Lords to preserve his non-dom tax status. Robert Alistair McAlpine, who had three daughters, spent his final years living in Italy with third wife Athena, whether they ran a bed and breakfast in a converted convent near Puglia. He was a member of the family controlling the giant McAlpine building company. He left Stowe public school at 16 with three O levels and worked for the family firm on building sites, spending his evenings drinking Guinness with Irish labourers. He joined the board of McAlpine before leaving to earn money for himself from property deals in Australia and selling antiques. He was also, in his time, a zoo-keeper, ornithologist, explorer and jewellery maker.","Lord McAlpine of West Green died peacefully last night, his family said .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . Northern Territory  Minister Dave Tollner resigned as Deputy Chief the day after he made homophobic slurs against the son of one of his colleagues. The Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refused to attend all meetings after Mr Tollner called his son Joshua Higgins – a staffer of Minister Bess Price – a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' after a draft speech about the issues of gay marriage was presented to cabinet ministers on Thursday, according to the ABC. Despite Chief Minister Adam Giles telling media that the matter had been resolved with an apology, NT News reported that Joshua remained angered by Mr Tollner’s comments. However a statement released by Joshua’s father also claims that the matter had been resolved. Scroll down for video . NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' 'My son and I accepted an apology from Mr Tollner for his comments that he did not intend to cause harm or offence,' Mr Higgins wrote. 'I now understand that I may have misinterpreted some comments by Deputy Chief Minister David Tollner and acknowledge he has apologised to my son. Dave Tollner and my son are friends and colleagues.' He ended the statement by writing: 'Deputy Chief Minister Tollner is a competent part of the Northern Territory Government, and has my support.' Mr Tollner, who has been moved to the backbench, confirmed that he has no intention to stand down and maintains the comments were made during a 'personal conversation'. In an interview on Mix1049, Mr Tollner claimed he has 'no issue with gay people at all' and revealed that his mother has been in a long-term relationship with another woman since he was a child, the ABC reported. Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings . Mr Tollner's gay nephew Dale Kelly, also approached the ABC to say that his uncle does not discriminated against gay people and supports his relationship. 'Never in my time knowing David has he offended me or discriminated against same-sex relationships.' 'He knows myself and my partner and his mother is in a same-sex relationship, so it's something he's been exposed to and never had an issue with.' During his brief interview at the Darwin radio station, Mr Tollner also revealed he would not be making a public apology. 'I can't see what I am to publicly apologise for. I've been called 10,000 things worse than this, but you accept them in the good humour in which they're delivered,' he said. Despite ongoing pressure from opposition members such as Labor Leader Delia Lawrie, who have demanded Mr Tollner be sacked, Mr Giles called Mr Tollner a ‘valued staff member’ and clarified that they would just move on from the incident.","Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner made the alleged homophobic slurs against the son of his colleague, Gary Higgins .

Complaining of a 'dodgy back' all week, Magnussen credited his rival with the win after pushing through for gutsy Bronze. 'This time a week ago, I had all but ruled myself out,' Magnussen said. 'I was in hospital getting an epidural and a couple of cortisone's - I wasn't in a good way. 'I thought they only gave epidurals to women who had babies. 'So I was really worried when they gave me that one.' He said the opportunity to swim at the elite level against such a formidable lineup was what willed him on to compete. 'You only get a few times in your lifetime to represent your country so I was pretty determined to swim tonight,' he said. 'I put it on the line tonight - it was all I had.'

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Cardinal George Pell has compared the Catholic Church's responsibility for child sexual abuse to that of a trucking company if one of the drivers committed an offense. The senior church member made the comparison while appearing at the royal commission via video link from the Vatican in Rome on Thursday night. 'If a driver sexually assaulted a passenger they picked up along the way I don't think it appropriate for the ... leadership of that company be held responsible,' he said. Victim Paul Hersback's lawyer, Sean Cash, said the the trucking company analogy doesn't stand up because the Catholic Church is meant to be an organisation of the 'highest integrity'. Scroll down for video . Cardinal George Pell, seen here appearing at the Victorian Government inquiry into child abuse in Melbourne on May 27, 2013, compared priests to truck drivers . 'If every precaution has been taken, no warning has been given, it is, I think, not appropriate for legal culpability to be foisted on the authority figure. 'If in fact the authority figure has been remiss through bad preparation, bad procedures or been warned and done nothing or insufficient, then certainly the church official would be responsible,' the cardinal reasoned. Cardinal Pell defended the Melbourne Response, which he established when he was Archbishop of the Melbourne Archdiocese in 1996. Under the scheme a free counselling and support service known as Carelink was created and compensation was also available. But if victims reported their abuse to the police they were no longer eligible for compensation. 'We were among the front-runners in Melbourne in addressing these scandals and I would suggest to you that that is entirely consistent with Catholic tradition and the teachings of Christ,' Cardinal Pell said. Cardinal Pell did however apologise to parents Christine and Anthony Foster, whose children Emma and Katie were sexually abused by Father Kevin O'Donnell. When the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a Royal Commission in late 2012 into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, Cardinal Pell also caused controversy when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession. 'If that is done outside the confessional (it can be reported to the police).... (But) the Seal of Confession is inviolable. If the priest knows beforehand about such a situation, the priest should refuse to hear the confession... That would be my advice, and I would never hear the confession of a priest who is suspected of such a thing,' he said. On Thursday the Vatican also refused to hand over the files of Australian priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission. He appeared at the Royal Comission via video link from the Vatican in Rome on Thursday night . Cardinal Pell also caused controversy when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession . The Vatican said the commission's request for documents on each allegation involving an Australian cleric was 'neither possible nor appropriate'. Reasons included ongoing church investigations, and that internal working documents were the sovereign property of the Holy See. Cardinal Pell, now working in Rome, was asked if he sought an assurance from the Vatican that any document the royal commission needed would be provided. 'That is correct,' Cardinal Pell told the commission. 'I suppose in retrospect there would be some discussion over what any document' meant. 'Cardinal Pell said specific requests about cases would be more likely to succeed than what he described as an 'ambit claim' for large numbers of documents. The Vatican has refused to hand over the files of Australian priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission . A letter from the royal commission to the Vatican said it needed access to documents if it was to fulfil its terms of references. 'It is essential that the royal commission understand the nature and extent of the communications between those congregations and the Holy See in relation to child sexual abuse complaints about Australian clerics,' the letter said. Cardinal Pell said the Vatican had provided 5000 pages of documents in relation to specific requests. 'But in following international convention they will not provide internal working documents of another sovereign state,' he said. Cardinal Pell said he thought the royal commission's request for documents relating to each case was 'unreasonable'. 'Overwhelmingly every document that is held in Rome exists here ... I am not aware of exceptions - overwhelmingly they are available in Australia,' he said. A letter from the Vatican's Secretariat of State said finding every file on accused Australian priests would be a substantial burden, 'inconsistent with international practice'.","Cardinal Pell spoke at the royal commission via a video link from the Vatican in Rome on Thursday .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . More than 100 suburbs across Australia have joined the million-dollar property club in the last 12 months. There are now 417 suburbs nationally with a median value of $1 million dollars, a 33 per cent increase from the 312 suburbs this time last year. While only showing a small growth, units have also recorded an increase in areas where the median value has tipped over the million dollar mark, rising by five suburbs nationally. Scroll down for video . The number of Australian suburbs with an average property value of $1 million or more has increased by 105 since 2013, bringing the national total to 417. Point Piper, Sydney (pictured) remains the most expensive suburb in Australia . Surprisingly, South Australia led the growth with a 44 per cent  increase in the number of suburbs surpassing $1 million in their properties' median value. New South Wales also recorded a high growth rate of 42 per cent. The figures were released by RP Data this week, with data research analyst Cameron Kusher saying the figures reflected the strong home values in the last 12 months.

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . A man warned he would die if he attempted to climb Mount Everest has told how he defied medical advice because of a promise he made to himself when he was just 13 and confined to a wheelchair. That one day he would reach 'the top of the world'. Three months ago Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Bobby Bajram, 47, returned from the Everest Region of Nepal. Back home in Melbourne after his incredible expedition to Everest, which was thwarted by a huge avalanche, he is in pain and in and out of hospital having lost the use of his left eye and his legs. But Bobby's current pain is nothing he hasn’t felt before. At the age of 13 he became the youngest Australian male to be diagnosed with MS. He spent fifteen years in a wheelchair and five years completely blind. MS sufferer Bobby Bajram decided to climb 5550 metres to the peak of Everest's neighbouring mountain, Kala Patthar, after an avalanche stopped him from going to Everest in April . Bobby, 47, returned from the Everest Region of Nepal after going against his doctor's orders . He still suffers excruciating pain every day and during MS attacks half of his body often becomes paralysed. ‘It feels like a hangover, times 100,’ Bobby told Daily Mail Australia. 'Every day you are weighed down like you are walking through mud, that’s how I train and that’s how I have lived for 34 years,' he explained. Bobby feels lucky that he ‘was born with a jovial positive attitude’, which he credits for allowing him to continue and pursue his Everest dreams despite his all too often health setbacks. ‘It’s just random. I don’t know when it’s going to happen. My body just goes bang.’ When he was first diagnosed with the debilitating disease he promised himself he would ‘walk to the top of world and see blue sky’ and now that’s exactly what he’s doing. Four years ago Bobby began intense training for his Everest mission. Bobby lives in Melbourne and has a five-year-old daughter named Annie . Bobby was diagnosed with severe MS at the age of 13 and spent 15 years in a wheelchair. This (right) is one of the only photos Bobby has of the years that he was wheelchair bound and blind as he told his mother he did not want any reminders of that time, he is pictured at his friend's wedding in the 1980s . With the help of one of his many sponsors, gym chain Fitness First, Bobby transformed his body to that of an athlete’s. He exercised for a staggering five-hours a day and went from weighing 148kg to 83kg. ‘I was in the gym for two hours doing squats and leg presses. Then I'd go to a climbing room and walk for 15k in a climate that mimicked being at about 15,000 feet,’ he explained. He continued to train despite his doctor Helmut Butzkueven writing in a letter on 31 May 2013: ‘I am extremely concerned about his and his trainer's health climbing Mt Everest and the likely fatal outcome of such a venture.’ ‘The doctor said ‘you are too sick, you are the sickest guy in the world with MS’. He said ‘what are you are you doing? You will die in Everest’, Bobby said. Because of his doctor’s letter nobody would ensure him to go on the trip. That was until he met the chairman of Aon insurance who Bobby said believed in his fundraising mission and sponsored him for half a million dollars. Bobby transformed his body to that of an athlete's. He exercised for a staggering five-hours a day and went from weighing 148kg to 83kg . Bobby began intense training for his Everest mission four years ago, determined to fulfill a promise he set himself when he was 13 . When Bobby set off for his first attempt at the life-changing Mount Everest climb on 22 April this year recent tragic events on the mountain made the climb impossible. ‘16 mountain Sherpas were killed ahead of the upcoming climbing season,’ he said. On 18 April 2014, an avalanche on Mount Everest near Everest Base Camp killed sixteen Nepalese guides. Thirteen bodies were recovered but the search for the three remaining bodies was called off due to the difficulty and risk of retrieving them. On 22 April, the Sherpas announced they would not work on Everest for the remainder of 2014 as a mark of respect for the victims. Instead of returning home, Bobby and his team decided to climb 5550 metres to the peak of the neighbouring mountain, Kala Patthar. Bobby's doctor wrote a letter warning of a 'likely fatal outcome' if he climbed Mount Everest . Bobby is in pain and in and out of hospital since returning from Nepal but has vowed to go back and climb Everest . While he was in the Himalayas Bobby visited schools, hospitals and donated money to a little girl with a brain tumour to help save her life. ‘That’s what I’m about,’ Bobby said matter-of-factly. But what Bobby’s pictures from the expedition don’t show is the pain he was in or the fact that he fell over 119 times. ‘The problem with me is when I get sick, I get sick for a long time. I take one step forward and two steps back. I really have to push it to do it,’ he said. Bobby was hospitalised while in the Himalayas but continued to Trek as soon as he could walk again. ‘I wasn't well but I walked out the hospital there because I said “I am here to peak Kala Patthar. If I can't physically move then we will abandon the trek but as long as I can drag my feet around I am carrying on”.’ Bobby feels lucky that he 'was born with a jovial positive attitude', which he credits for allowing him to continue and pursue his Everest dreams despite his all too often health setbacks . In the Himalayas Bobby visited schools, hospitals and donated money to a little girl with a brain tumour . Asked whether people treat him differently when he looks healthy from when he is wheelchair bound, Bobby said: ‘I get a lot of people who are very sympathetic to me when I am with my wheelchair or sticks but when I look healthy I don't get the same treatment.’ Despite the fact he is in pain and in and out of hospital since his return from the Himalayas in May, Bobby is determined to go back and climb Everest. ‘I am going to Mera Peak in November, which is next to Everest and about six and a half thousand metres,’ he said. ‘My trainer said “let’s have a look at that and see how you up there and then if you smash that we will go to Everest in 2015”.’ People may wonder why Bobby, who has a five-year-old daughter, continues to strive towards climbing Everest. A mountain where 200 people have died since mountaineers first began to scale it in 1921. ‘I'm an ambassador people with disabilities... I'm the only guy in the world in this situation and no one has done this… I want to raise 100,000 million dollars for people with disabilities around the world,’ Bobby said. To him, nothing is impossible. 'The doctors say for some unknown reason I just keep going.'

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . Conchita Wurst is no stranger to the fashion industry. The  Eurovision winner has already taken to the catwalk, modelling in the autumn/winter 2014 Jean Paul Gaultier show in July, and now the 25-year-old is branching out with a racy editorial shoot. In pictures for the Fall issue of CR Fashion Book Conchita appears in lace lingerie accompanied by pregnant model Ashleigh Good and legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld. Scroll down for video . Karl Lagerfeld has photographed Conchita Wurst for the latest edition of CR Fashion Book . Chanel designer Karl was the photographer on the shoot, while androgynous model Casey Legler interviewed the Austrian singing star. In the interview Conchita (who  goes by the name Tom Neuwirth when not in character) opens up about her childhood and how she struggled to get where she is today. She tells Casey that Conchita has always been a part of her life. 'Conchita is the story of my life. I grew up in a small Austrian village, a quite conservative one, and I was the weird little boy always dressing as a girl.' Conchita says that her big break came as a bit of a fluke after she fell into the burlesque scene. Conchita poses in Givenchy lingerie alongside pregnant model, Ashleigh Good . 'I'd done drag since I was 14, for special occasions, and in 2010 a friend of mine with her own burlesque group was looking for a host. 'During a party I was just fooling around, taking the microphone, saying stupid, funny things, and she asked me afterward if I wanted to host her burlesque show every Saturday. 'That was the point when I started to do drag regularly. It was overwhelming for me, because besides having fun and dressing up every weekend, I got to learn from such great artists, people who are allowed to do whatever they want. It opened my eyes to a totally new world.' Karl Lagerfeld, known for trying to challenge conformity says that this is exactly what he admired in the famous drag queen. Karl Lagerfeld says he admires Conchita because she does something 'that's never been done before' 'I like Conchita because not only does she really have a voice but she has done something that's never been done before. 'We have all heard of ""bearded ladies"" but no one has ever seen a bearded man posing as a lady.....This brings new meaning to the term ""drag""' The designer says that pairing the two unlikely models together created a great juxtaposition. 'I photographed him for CR with my pregnant bride for the couture, Ashleigh... A skinny musician next to a pregnant top model, it was a game of volumes!' The feature was styled with risque Givenchy clothing  by former editor of Vogue Paris, and CR founder, Carine Roitfeld. Carine says that having such unsusual models made it quite a difficult shoot to style. 'It wasn't as easy as I had imagined… it was a sensitive subject, but Karl's talent in photographing with a classical style gave more strength to Conchita's character!'

"By . Mail Foreign Service . 'Suspicious' behaviour: A police profile of a suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance had a violent past, reported a Portuguese newspaper . The ex-Ocean Club worker being investigated over Madeleine McCann's disappearance was an immigrant who received a presidential pardon after being convicted of theft, it was reported in a Portuguese newspaper. The daily Correio da Manha said the unnamed suspect was from Cape Verde off the coast of Africa. He died in a tractor accident in 2009, reports said. A relative, who is already said to have been questioned by Portuguese police, told the paper: ‘They are looking for a suspect that can't defend himself. ‘Peoples' lives can't be exposed this way.’ Correio da Manha said he should have been expelled from Portugal in 1996 - but was allowed to remain in the country after receiving a pardon from then-President Jorge Sampaio. The 40-year-old was a former employee at the Ocean Club holiday resort where the McCann family was staying and might have snatched Maddie in revenge after being sacked, Correio da Manha reported. Police identified him as their main suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when Maddie disappeared on May 3 2007, the paper claimed. The flat is a 15-minute drive from the town of Lagos where the unnamed suspect was living after he stopped working at the Ocean Club. A source told Correio da Manha that police believe he may have killed the youngster to ‘shut her up’ when he saw the huge media response to the disappearance - and are now trying to find her body. Motive: The man was reportedly a former employee of the Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz, pictured, where Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007 . Portugal’s Attorney-General gave the . go-ahead for the investigation into the  girl’s disappearance to be . reopened last week at the request of the local police, the Policia . Judiciaria – more than five years after the original inquiry was . shelved. Correio da Manha claimed: ‘Police suspicions about the former . Ocean Club employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a . PJ team from Porto. ‘This was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened. ‘The . man, who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009, was not on the . list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation . by the Ocean Club because at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance he . was not working there.’ It . described his departure from the Ocean Club as ‘frictious’ and said: . ‘The motives that could have caused the ex-employee to kidnap the . youngster are still being investigated.’ Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive . It . suggests that he may ‘have committed the kidnap as a form of . retaliation against the Ocean Club. His aim could have been to call into . question the security of the holiday club but something went wrong and . the youngster disappeared.’ Portuguese police and a spokesman for the McCanns declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday. It . was written by three journalists including a senior reporter who gave . evidence recently at the ongoing libel case brought by Kate and Gerry . McCann against Goncalo Amaral, the officer in charge of the original . investigation, over a book he wrote that accuses them of faking . Madeleine’s abduction to cover up her death. It emerged over the weekend that police were planning to reinterview several Ocean Club employees. More . than 130 workers were questioned during the initial inquiry, including . two men who fixed a blind in the McCanns’ apartment two days before . Madeleine disappeared. Portuguese . police are thought to have returned to the Praia da Luz area about a . month ago to carry out mobile phone tracking work. Last . week it emerged that Kate and Gerry McCann are to apply under . Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ and may now be able to . influence the course of the investigation and any prosecution. Their . status as ‘assistentes’ will allow their legal team to work alongside . state prosecutors, keeping the McCanns informed of all new developments . in the case. They could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over Maddie’s disappearance. A . secrecy order put on the case by Portugal’s Attorney General could also . be lifted just for them, giving access to all case files.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . 'Suspicious' behaviour: A police profile of a suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance had a violent past, reported a Portuguese newspaper . A police profile drawn up of a new Madeleine McCann suspect has exposed his violent past and ‘suspicious behaviour with children,’ it was claimed today. Leading Portuguese daily Correio da Manha said the profile had heightened police suspicions about a dead immigrant thief said to have been put in the frame over the youngster's disappearance. The Portuguese paper has identified an ex worker at the Ocean Club, the Algarve holiday club where Madeleine disappeared from, as the man police believe may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer. Detectives are investigating the possibility he killed her after seeing the huge backlash the crime generated, reports say. The father-of-one, who emigrated to Portugal from his native Cape Verde off west Africa, was convicted of theft in 1996 and told he was being sent home as punishment. Portugal's then President Jorge Sampaio let him stay after granting him a pardon but he died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009. He is reported to have been sacked from the Ocean Club before Madeleine disappeared on May 3 in 2007. Portuguese detectives are investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance again following a decision last month by the country's Attorney General to reopen the case, more than five years after it was shelved. Correio da Manha claimed today: . ‘Portuguese police inspectors, who studied the case and asked for its . recent reopening, put together a profile of the suspect who died aged 40 . in 2009, and concluded the character traits they identified . strengthened the possibility he could have been the author of the . crime.’ The paper said the . man, who it has not named, had a past ‘marked by some episodes of . violence’ and had ‘suspicious behaviour with children’ but offered no . more details of their claims. Motive: The man was reportedly a former employee of the Ocean Club (pictured) where Madeleine disappeared in May 2007. Police believe he may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer . It also insisted the man's family had refused to help police who are now trying to identify locations where Madeline's body could be buried. Portuguese police have made no official comment on the reports although a highly-placed source has denied detectives are searching for Madeleine's body. The family of the latest suspect, who has been named in the UK press, are threatening to sue the Portuguese state over the leaks and are insisting he is innocent. His brother-in-law spoke out to defend him and insisted Portuguese police had not been in contact. Speaking outside his country home at the end of a dirt track a short drive from Praia da Luz where Madeleine disappeared, he said: ‘We do not know what the police think because they haven't been in touch. ‘He has a mother and father and a brother and detectives may have contacted them but I do not know if that is the case. ‘It was a shock to us all when we read the police suspected my late brother-in-law of kidnapping and killing Madeleine. ‘He wasn't named in the newspaper reports but we knew immediately who they were talking about. New leads: The investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine, pictured, was reopened following a review of the case . Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive . ‘My sister does not want to speak about it. She has a young child she is trying to protect and she is obviously worried about the effect on him if it gets talked about at school. ‘My brother-in-law was sacked from the Ocean Club and I can understand why the police would want to have a look at him, especially if they then discover he has a criminal conviction. But I strongly believe that if the police do consider he is a suspect in the Madeleine McCann case, they are looking at the wrong man. ‘The idea he did it to get revenge on the Ocean Club makes no sense at all. It wasn't as if what happened there with him losing his job destroyed his life. ‘He got work elsewhere soon after. He . was working at the time he died. He is not around to defend his . reputation so others have to do it for him. Our concern is making sure . this doesn't get any bigger. ‘The police will do what they have to do but we don't want to say any more about it.’ A . police source told weekly Portuguese newspaper 'O Crime' today that the . theory of the ex-Ocean Club worker's involvement in Madeleine's . disappearance was ‘worthy of note’. Looking for graves: One source claimed that police are now searching for possible locations where Madeline's body could be buried . But insisting nothing had been discounted, he added: ‘All leads, including those the British least like, are being considered. The McCanns' Portuguese lawyer Rogerio Alves insisted last month Gerry and Kate McCann had been told the new lines of inquiry being probed by Portuguese police discounted them as suspects. Portuguese police have made no official comment. The couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, were made suspects after Madeleine disappeared but had their status as ‘arguidos’ removed before the case was shelved. They are now expected to apply to become ‘assistantes’ - or private prosecutors - in the case so they can assist state prosecutors coordinating the reopened investigation.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A child sex offender has claimed Britain's justice system is too lenient on sexual predators as they are 'just chucked out' of prison without undergoing any treatment, leaving them free to attack again. The 28-year-old child abuser, who gives his name only as Frank, was freed after serving just half of his 30-month prison sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. He said that because his behaviour was not addressed while he was in HMP Moorland, after he left prison he 'thought about reoffending a few times' and added: 'I do pose a risk'. 'Frank', the 28-year-old convicted child abuser, says he received no treatment for his behaviour while in prison (file image) Speaking days after it was revealed that sexual predators are being released back into the community without treatment to prevent them reoffending, because of a shortage of places on sex offender treatment programmes, Frank criticised the lack of treatment available. And he gave an astonishing insight into the thoughts of a convicted paedophile, telling BBC Radio 5 Live how he blamed his young victim for what he did to her.  And he said that while he hoped never to reoffend, 'you can never say never'. And he blamed the judge for not giving him a tougher sentence to prevent him reoffending, saying: 'He recommended that I did a course but he didn't attach that to the sentence.' Frank said he was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, of which he spent 15 months in prison before being released on temporary licence. He said: 'I was literally just chucked out - that's the end of you, go out into the community and be good. 'And I don't think I had the tools to do that.  In fact, I did think about reoffending a few times. 'Obviously I never [did], but the thoughts were there and that's the problem.  Unless you can control the thought process... there's no help for people that are not as strong-willed as others.' Prison: The paedophile was imprisoned at HMP Moorland near Doncaster in Yorkshire, where a third of the inmates are sex offenders . Frank has been assessed by the NSPCC, whose experts concluded that he may present a risk to children and say that he should not have unsupervised access to children. He admitted: 'When I first committed the offence, I completely put the blame totally on my victim.' He said that the judge didn't make his attending a behaviour treatment course part of the sentence, but merely 'recommended' that he do a course. He said: 'He obviously gave me my sentence of 30 months and recommended that I attend some kind of treatment programme.' But the convicted paedophile, who has since worked with the NSPCC and his probation team and now realises he was to blame for his crime, says places on such courses were in short supply in his Yorkshire prison where around a third of the inmates are sex offenders. He said he was on a wing of about 150 sex offenders, and estimated that while he was there, there were only two courses for 25 people each. 'I spoke to my probation officer in prison on a number of occasions, asking if there's any help that I can get for me.  And basically the answer I got was, well, no, there's just not enough time, there's not enough places'. Frank said there was a hierarchy in prison where those who'd committed the worst offences were most respected . 'They said maybe you could get it when you're released but unfortunately that was the same situation.' He said that in the wing there was a perverse hierarchy where the worse the sex crime committed, the higher the offender was in the 'bragging network'. Frank said: 'People used to boast about what they'd done and kind of create a hierarchy... 'For the major reported crimes it was kind of, they was like the king of the wing, and they'd earned the most respect points which is absolutely ridiculous, but that's how it works.' He said sex offenders 'don't realise the actual hurt they cause to the victims', and added: 'How is one person supposed to better themselves if the opportunity is not being given?' Frank said: 'I would say in my honest opinion I do pose a risk and I will do until I get the full help that I need. 'Obviously I think I'm strong enough in myself not to reoffend, but you can never say never' 'Frank', 28, convicted child abuser who was freed without his behaviour being addressed . 'Obviously I think I'm strong enough in myself to not reoffend, but you can never say never.' Earlier this week it emerged that a report by the National Audit Office said the number of inmates on sex offender treatment programmes was down. Prisons including HMP Moorland, near Doncaster, HMP Wakefield and HMP Shrewsbury were criticised for having no formal treatment programmes at all, and others, including HMP Parc, HMP Whatton and HMP Maidstone, were criticised for not having enough places on such courses for the number of sex offenders. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'We make no apology for holding more sex offenders in prison than ever before. 'It is untrue to say that funding for sex offender treatment programmes has been cut - in fact we are increasing the availability of programmes. 'We provide a range of programmes for this highly complex group of offenders. These are tailored to address an individual's risk and need, and can also include substance misuse, anger management and violence reduction. 'Sex offender treatment programmes are not suitable for every prisoner, in each case a thorough assessment will be carried out.'

"By . Mark Duell . Rolf Harris's daughter was told of her father's alleged abuse by one of his victims after revealing her fears that he was having an affair with their housekeeper, a court has heard. The claim about what Harris’s daughter Bindi said in the 1990s was made on the opening day of the 84-year-old veteran entertainer’s trial on sex charges at London's Southwark Crown Court on Friday. The alleged victim ‘remembers Bindi being upset because she suspected that her father was having an affair with their housekeeper’, according to Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting. Family: Rolf Harris, 84, arrives at court with his wife Alwen Hughes (right), and daughter Bindi (left) on Friday . Bindi then asked her friend: ‘Why have you got a downer on my dad?’ She asked if Harris had touched her and was told that he had. Ms Wass said: ‘Bindi said that she blamed herself and that she had not looked after her friend.’ On Friday the court also heard that Harris was a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character whose fame allowed him to carry out a string of alleged indecent assaults on under-age girls. He was even known at an Australian TV channel as ‘the octopus’ because of the way he put his hands all over women, the court was told. Opening the case against the star, who denies 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986, Ms Wass said Harris's alleged victims were ‘overawed’ by him, saying: ‘Mr Harris was too famous, too powerful and his reputation made him untouchable.’ Addressing a packed courtroom, Ms Wass said Harris was ‘an immensely talented man’ but his fame and reputation meant he was able to carry out ‘brazen’ sexual assaults, often when other people were present or nearby. Ms Wass said: ‘The prosecution does not, for a minute, suggest that there is not a good, talented and kind side to Mr Harris. Proceedings: Harris listens to Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting, at Southwark Crown Court during his trial . ‘But, concealed behind this charming and amicable children's entertainer, lay a man who exploited the very children who were drawn to him. ‘There is a Jekyll and Hyde nature to Rolf Harris and this dark side of Rolf Harris was obviously not apparent to all of the other people he met during the course of his work, and it was not apparent to those who may want to testify to his good character.’ The prosecutor said it was ‘a side of . him which is sexually attracted to children and under-age girls’ and ‘a . side which gave him the confidence to molest girls knowing that they . could not object and, even if they did, nobody would believe them’. 'Bindi said that she blamed herself and that she had not looked after her friend' Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting . She said: ‘You will hear from a make-up . artist from Channel 7 in Australia that Rolf Harris's reputation was . such that he was known as the octopus because of the way that he would . put his hands all over women.’ Harris, sitting in the dock wearing a grey suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie, listened intently to the proceedings through a hearing loop as the prosecution case was outlined. His wife Alwen and other members of his family – including Bindi - sat in the public gallery alongside dozens of UK and international journalists. Ms Wass told the court that a number of alleged victims will give evidence, four of whom are the subject of charges on the indictment, and others who are supporting witnesses. ‘The chances of so many people making up similar false allegations are just ludicrous,’ she told the jurors. Father and daughter: The claim about what Bindi (pictured with Harris) said in the 1990s was made on the opening day of 84-year-old veteran entertainer's trial on sex charges . Allegations made by a string of women were outlined to the jury, including one woman - with whom Harris admits he had an affair when she was an adult - who claims she was abused from the age of 13 for 15 years. The woman, who it is claimed was groomed like ‘a young puppy who had been trained to obey’ is subject of seven of the counts Harris is facing, and alleged she was first abused while on holiday in Hawaii in 1978. Ms Wass said: ‘You will hear during the course of this case other instances where Mr Harris touched children and women alike in quite brazen circumstances. ‘It may be that that was part of the excitement, knowing that he could do that and get away with it.’ She said the girl's parents trusted Harris, adding: ‘Rolf Harris was a pillar of society, a well-respected man and somebody who was well-known for being fond of children’. Eventually the woman - who became an alcoholic - told her parents, prompting her father to write a letter to Harris. In a reply, sent in March 1997, the artist confessed to having a sexual relationship with the woman, but denied it started when she was 13. In the letter, he described being in a state of ‘self loathing’ and feeling ‘sickened’ by himself for the misery he had caused her. ‘You can't go back and change things that you have done in this life - I wish to god I could,’ he wrote. ‘I know that what I did was wrong but we are, all of us, fallible and oh how I deluded myself. Please forgive me, love Rolf.’ Evidence: On Friday the court also heard that Harris was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character whose fame allowed him to carry out a string of alleged indecent assaults on under-age girls . In a police interview in August 2013 Harris claimed in a prepared statement that the woman had asked him for £25,000 to set up an animal sanctuary, or her brother would go to the press. In the statement he said: ‘I refused to make any payment to her. Although nothing appeared in the press at the time, I feared that it was only a matter of time until she would make our affair public.’ One charge relates to a woman who claims . Harris groped her when she was seven or eight years old as she went to . get his autograph at a community centre in Portsmouth in 1969, twice . putting his hands between her legs in an ‘intrusive way’. 'Concealed behind this charming and amicable children's entertainer, lay a man who exploited the very children who were drawn to him' Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting . The court also heard details of other women who claim they were groped by Harris, but their complaints are not part of the charges on the indictment because they happened abroad before the law changed in 1997 to allow such claims to be prosecuted in the UK. The first woman was aged 11 or 12 in 1969 when she claims Harris told her: ‘Come here, I want to be the first one to give you a tongue kiss.’ He then ran his hand up and down her back and ‘stuck his tongue in her mouth’, it is claimed. Ms Wass said: ‘She froze. She described the experience as vile and it made her gag.’ A second woman claims she was groped after Harris asked her to dance at an event in New Zealand in 1970. The jury heard that Harris ‘knew that whatever he did, he would be able to get away with it’. Ms Wass said: ‘He was targeting people who were in awe of him and he pushed the boundaries, even in a public place, a dance floor. He knew he could get away with it.’ A third woman was on holiday in Malta with her boyfriend when she was 18 when she claimed Harris pushed her against a door and started to kiss her, ‘slobbering around her face and neck’ and groping her. Claims: Addressing a packed courtroom, the prosecutor said Harris (pictured in 2002) was 'an immensely talented man' but his fame and reputation meant he was able to carry out 'brazen' sexual assaults . Another alleged victim, to whom one charge of indecent assault relates, claimed that she was working as a waitress at an event in Cambridge when she was 14 in the 1970s, when Harris groped her. Ms Wass asked the jury: ‘Would these girls, unknown to each other, make it up? Or is the reality they are telling the truth and they are all describing the dark side of Mr Harris, the Mr Hyde character that lurks within?’ The alleged victim in the final three counts on the indictment was part of an Australian theatre company which visited the UK in 1986. She claims that the group met Harris at a dinner, when he assaulted her. The court heard that ‘the great Rolf Harris’ had taken advantage of her. The jury was told that her boyfriend persuaded her to go to the media, and she employed a PR agent and received 60,000 dollars to appear on an Australian television programme called A Current Affair and give an interview to a magazine called Woman's Day. In another alleged incident, the court heard that a woman and her 15-year-old daughter met Harris at a paint shop in New Zealand, and he groped both of them in turn. He allegedly told the mother: ‘She liked it’, suggesting he was talking about her daughter. Concluding her prosecution opening, Ms Wass said: ‘What you have before you is a persistent pattern of sexual offending by Rolf Harris over a 25-year period.’ She added: ‘Just because a case is historic it doesn't mean you should dismiss it.’ The trial, at Southwark Crown Court, was adjourned on Friday to tomorrow morning, when the first witness is expected to give evidence.

"By . Alex Gore . 'Betrayal of trust': Stephen Benson, 50, gained the befriended the families of his victims before abusing them . A games teacher befriended the parents of three teenage girls before abusing and raping them while on holiday with their families. Stephen Benson, 50, gained the trust of the families and 'groomed' their young daughters for his own 'sexual gratification' over a period of more than 20 years. At Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, he was convicted of nine rape charges, six indecent assaults and two counts of sexual activity with a child in what the court described as a 'gross betrayal of trust.' Benson, of Ipswich, Suffolk, was also found not guilty of two rape offences. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on April 29. He taught PE at Copleston High in . Ipswich, Suffolk since 1986, but the offences related to his position at Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club, with the offences carried out between 1989 and 2011. During the trial, a jury heard how the coach was regularly invited into the homes of his victims and was seen as part of the family. He would be a regular for family meals at some of the girls' houses, later carrying out sexual assaults in their bedrooms while practicing 'massage'. Benson was even invited on family holidays where he continued the abuse. Coach Benson - at the time of his arrest - told cops he admitted to sexual relations with one of the girls, but only when she was over the age of consent. The victims claim they had not complained to anyone about what was happening because they were either too embarrassed or did not think anyone would believe them. The court heard how the school girls submitted to his demands until they were old enough to know better and managed to break away. Awaiting sentencing: Benson was found guilty of nine rape charges at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday . Riel Karmy-Jones, prosecuting, told the jury the defendant was a respected coach who had recruited the youngsters to the athletics club and had been 'manipulative and controlling'. She said: 'He wormed his way into their lives and was initially charming and expressed interest in their daughters' talents. 'He controlled their eating, sleeping and social lives, they submitted to his sexual advances until they were old enough to know better. 'He stole the last part of their childhoods by drawing them into sexual relationships with him.' Miss Karmy-Jones said the sexual behaviour was 'wrong on any moral compass' given the girls' ages and his position of authority. She added: 'Mr Benson denied the allegations when interviewed by police and said one of the girls 'idolised him'. Coach: The offences related to Benson's position at Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club from 1989 to 2011 . After the verdicts, the Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS East of England, Andrea Reynolds, said the parents had trusted Benson believing he had their children's best interests at heart. She said: 'This was a gross betrayal of trust by a man who used his position as a sports coach with Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club to groom three young girls so he could rape two of them and sexually assault all three. 'Parents who trusted their daughters to him were manipulated by Benson into thinking he had the girls' best interests at heart. 'They believed he would make the girls successful athletes - when in fact he had other motives in mind. Position of trust: Benson worked as a teacher at a school in Ipswich . 'I would like to thank the victims and witnesses in this case who assisted police, and particular thanks are due to Detective Constable Wendy Leah, who worked tirelessly on the investigation. 'Without the victim's support for the case, Benson would not have been brought to justice. I hope the victims are now able to move on positively with their lives knowing justice has been done.' Chairman of Ipswich Harriers, yesterday said: 'Protecting children and vulnerable adults from any kind of harm is a priority for Ipswich Harriers and we have thorough and comprehensive safeguarding arrangements in place. 'As soon as these allegations were brought to our and UK Athletics' attention, Stephen Benson's UK Athletics coaching licence was suspended with immediate effect. 'From that point forward he had no more contact with children involved in the club.' One victim previously told the court in February how she was raped by her athletics coach when she was a teenager. She said Benson had sex with her after a training session. She told how they had gone for a run together and he had later suggested they had sex. The woman claimed Benson . started having sex with her when she was 15 and alleged it took place on . between six and eight occasions without her consent. The victim said: 'I wasn't a strong . person at that point. My parents did everything for me. I wasn't . confident enough and I was scared.' The witness denied a suggestion from . Mrs Perry that her parents had known about her relationship with Benson . and had been happy about it.","Stephen Benson gained the trust of the families as an athletics coach .

"By . Sam Adams . Two men have been jailed for a total of 15 years after plying a 14-year-old girl with alcohol and drugs in return for sex. Raja Khan, 23, raped the victim while Adeeb Sultan, 27, abused her and passed her to another man who sexually assaulted her during a five day ordeal in Birmingham. On one occasion the men tried to force the girl to perform a sex act on a taxi driver in a bid to get a lower fare. Abusers: Raja Khan, 23, (right) raped the victim while Adeeb Sultan, 27, (left) sexually abused her. The pair were jailed today for ten and five years respectively . Last month Khan was found guilty of rape and actual bodily harm while Sultan was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child and causing or inciting sexual activity with a child. Today Khan, of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, was jailed for 10 years while Sultan, of Alum Rock, Birmingham, was jailed for five years. During the seven-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury heard Sultan targeted the teenager after he saw her walking down the street with a friend in July 2011. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Amy Bates, from West Midlands Police Public Protection Department, said: 'Sultan offered the girls, who were missing from home, the chance to hang out with him and his friends. 'The pair went with him and began drinking vodka on the nearby canal towpath. Some time later, she was twice raped by a man on the Dudderston Mill Road canal with Sultan facilitating the attack.' Over the course of five days, Sultan, who called himself 'Dibbs', plied the girl with alcohol and drugs. In return, she was raped by Khan, and abused by other unidentified men. Sentence: Sultan and Khan were jailed for a total of 15 years at Birmimgham Crown Court . In one frenzied attack, in which she was punched in the face, Khan said that if she refused to have sex, her friend would be raped instead. Despite suffering horrific injuries, the victim managed to run away. A passing motorist picked her up and took her to Stechford police station. After being treated for her injuries, the girl identified Khan as her attacker. He was also captured on CCTV in the area at the time of the original attack on July 10, 2011. When interviewed, he claimed to have been on the phone to his girlfriend, watching TV and playing on his PlayStation at the time of the offences. But the jury dismissed his claims after Sultan's DNA was found on his victim's body. DC Bates said after the case: 'Sultan and Khan's crimes are truly despicable. The pair deliberately targeted a vulnerable child and sought to exploit her for their own sexual gratification and criminal gain. 'Their offences were truly sickening and have left an indelible mark on their victim. Despite her own personal trauma, the girl had the courage to report the matter to the police. 'She put her fears to one side to provide a comprehensive statement, pick her attackers out in an identification parade and then go on to provide detailed evidence in court. 'Her strength of character is to be commended - particularly for someone so young. I wish her well on her road to recovery.' Sultan was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years and Khan was ordered to sign the register for life. Both were also made the subject of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order for 10 years - preventing them from having contact with girls under the age of 16, and were disqualified from working with children.","Raja Khan, 23, punched and raped victim while .

"By . Sara Malm . Jailed: Teacher Simon Knowles filmed school children in the changing room and shared thew video and pictures online . A teacher who filmed young children as they undressed in shower cubicles and dormitories and spreading the images online has been jailed. Simon Knowles, 52, made hundreds of videos and possessed nearly 20,000 indecent images of children, some of which were as young as three. Knowles was jailed for four-and-a-half-years after admitted 13 counts of making and distributing images of children being abused, as well as 11 charges of voyeurism. Knowles, who gave his address as a caravan park in Leeds, used covert cameras to capture school children getting changed for swimming lessons, York Crown Court heard today. The charges against the teacher included making indecent images of children, possessing indecent images of children, distributing indecent images of children and recording a person doing a private act. Officers investigating the case found 19,541 indecent photographs of children on Knowles' computer along with 174 indecent videos. They also found evidence that he had distributed 147 indecent photographs of children. Knowles' committed his vile offences from 2009 up until his arrest in April 2012. The school he worked at cannot be named for legal reasons. Detective Sergeant Mark Jackson, of North Yorkshire Police, said: ‘On the face of it, Simon Knowles was a well-liked teacher who had the respect of his colleagues and aspired to be an assistant head teacher. 'In reality, he was a calculating and deceitful man who completely abused his position of trust for his own sexual gratification. ‘The level of betrayal, falseness and dishonesty he has displayed over a number of years is rarely seen. ‘He . filmed innocent children while they were getting changed, using covert . methods which highlights the lengths he was prepared to go to indulge . his twisted fantasies.' York Crown court heard Paul Rishworth, 27, committed the attacks 'without justification and without provocation' ‘The fact that he was also sharing images on the internet, some of them at the highest level of seriousness, shows that Knowles is a sick and depraved man who I am extremely glad that we have caught. ‘He betrayed his family, his colleagues, his profession and, ultimately, the children he was entrusted to educate and their parents. ‘He has shown no remorse for his actions throughout the investigation which was a long and difficult process for the officers involved, everyone connected with the school and, of course, his victims. ‘Simon Knowles is an intelligent man which makes his conduct all the more abhorrent and quite frankly prison is the best place for him.’ In a statement North Yorkshire County Council said: ‘The school and the local authority have fully cooperated with the police throughout the investigation, and the school has supported parents throughout this terrible ordeal. ‘Child protection remains the highest priority for the county and all proper child protection procedures and safeguards are followed by the local authority when employing staff to work with children.’","Simon Knowles made videos of children at his school sharing them online .

"By . Amanda Williams . The most dangerous criminals will be tracked via satellites orbiting the earth. The system is already being used to monitor immigration cases such as Abu Qatada . New GPS tags set to be introduced in April will mean paedophiles can be banned from areas where children gather. The system, which monitors the most dangerous criminals via satellites orbiting the earth, will set off an alarm if the sex offenders go too near a school. Satellite tagging, which has already been tested on a number of high profile criminals, and immigrations cases including Muslim hate preacher Abu Qatada, will allow officials to track offenders around the clock for the first time. Probation chiefs say it will be used on the most high-risk offenders freed early from jail or given a community sentence, and has already been trialled on high-risk offenders in Hertfordshire and Wales. Officials will be able to track offenders by following dots across a map on their computer screens. It will detail exactly where they have been, how fast they are travelling, and whether they are in a vehicle or on foot. Authorities will also be able to set 'exclusion zones' for each offender. It means paedophiles could be barred from school areas, with the tag alerting officials by setting off an alarm if they go too close. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Satellite tagging will allow us to keep a much closer watch on high risk and persistent offenders, who cause so much harm. 'Monitoring the movements of dangerous and repeat offenders will be vital in cutting crime, creating a safer society with fewer victims and ultimately offering greater protection and reassurance to the public.' Britain's current tags, introduced in 1999, are used to ensure offenders obey a night-time curfew. But they cannot track a person's daytime movements. Cost issues and technical difficulties saw a similar idea abandoned in 2007, as it was found that criminals could block the GPS signal by standing near tall buildings or even trees. The technology was also trialed by the NHS on medium and high-risk patients during a pilot scheme in 2010. It is hoped extending the scheme to criminals would help ease the pressure on Britain's overflowing prisons. Officials will be able to track offenders by following dots across a map on their computer screens. It will detail exactly where they have been, how fast they are travelling, and whether they are in a vehicle or on foot . There are around 22,500 offenders electronically monitored at any one time. During the financial year 2010/11, 116,000 subjects were tagged - nine per cent more than the previous financial year. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the cost of the contract was still being negotiated but last year electronic monitoring cost £117m. He added: 'This is one of the largest electronic monitoring schemes in the world, and is regarded as delivering a successful and high quality service. 'New contracts for electronic monitoring services  due to be awarded in spring 2013 will allow us to improve delivery and introduce the most sophisticated and advanced technology in the world. 'They will also represent better value for taxpayers. Properly administered, new generation tagging can promote improved behaviour and give victims greater reassurance. 'The new contracts will be awarded in spring 2013 and this will be followed by a mobilisation period in which the GPS tags will be introduced.'","The same device is being used to monitor movements of immigration cases - such as Abu Qatada .

"By . Sarah Gordon . it is Britain's biggest annual family holiday and involves more than 100 relatives gathering together from all over the world. But the yearly Gigg family reunion is now under threat because air fares are too high. The Giggs have gathered every year the Devon camp site of Westward Ho! for 45 years to continue a tradition started in 1969 by patriarch George Gigg, who died in 2009. Together again: The Gigg family travels from far and wide to spend every summer together and has done since the tradition was started in 1969 . More than 100 of them, including partners of family members, made the annual pilgrimage this week for their holiday at the north Devon resort but they said it could be the last of its kind. Eighty five of Mr Gigg’s direct descendants are there including five of his children, 27 grandchildren, 50 great grandchildren and three great, great grandchildren. Family members have travelled from England, France, America, Mozambique, Dubai and Thailand to gather at Braddicks holiday centre. A world away: More than 100 relatives from as far away as the US, Thailand and Dubai, spend time together at the Westard Ho! camp site . Now and then: The family gathering was started by patriarch George Gigg, who died in 1009, and has grown every year as the family expanded . But Mr Gigg’s granddaughter Christine Greenfield, 60, from Tunbridge Wells said in future the gatherings could drastically shrink. She said: 'A lot of them may not make it in future because air fares are expensive. 'Especially those who live in America,' she added. 'They may not come again.' Man with a plan: George Gigg started the annual family trip in 1969 but sadly passed away in 2009 . Mrs Greenfield explained: 'We’ve been gathering for 45 years since 1969. 'It started as a way for Granddad to see his extended family - and it just grew. 'Now it’s become a chance to catch up and keep in touch with everybody.' She added that like most families there were occasional tiffs but mostly things were very harmonious. Through the ages: The family holiday has grown in size since it was started by George Gigg and his daughters . Sunshine break: The Devon camp site has been welcoming the growing family for nearly half a century, but there are fears that high air fares could prevent future meet-ups . 'We all get along with each other,' she said. 'There’s no obligation to go at all. 'But generally everybody enjoys it. 'The younger children love playing with each other - they see their cousins of course. 'It’s like one long party for them.' The tradition of a family get together began 45 years ago when George Gigg’s daughters got together to find a suitable holiday camp to accommodate the family and it has continued ever since. Family fun: The young cousins love playing with each other the the holiday is 'one long party' according to Christine Greenfield . Retro photo: The pictures through the ages show haw the Gigg family has grown . Speaking in 2004 Mr Gigg’s son-in-law Peter Greenfiled explained: 'My wife and her sister found the holiday camp way back in 1969, when their mother, Stella, was terminally ill and they were looking for a place where she could be visited by her relatives, and it just went on from there. 'There are quite long gaps during a year when we don’t see some members of the family, and this is one occasion when we can get together and spend some quality time with each other. 'We have to book a year in advance and usually take the first week of the school summer holidays,' he said.","Tradition stared in 1969 and has continued for 45 years .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . It is the modern phenomenon that makes us the star of our travel snaps - the unavoidable selfie. But there is a time and a place for a quick self-referencing moment of camera fun. And when you're being chased by an angry bovine in the middle of a bull run, it is not the most sensible moment to stop and take a snap. But that's exactly what this amateaur 'matador' decided to do, while running down the streets away from the rampaging animal in the French city of Bayonne. Turning his back to snap the selfie in the video, every viewer can see what is going to happen next - except the tourist. As he stops to take the photo, the angry bull comes running down the alleyway and charges straight into him. Setting up the shot: The man readies himself for his moment of glory . He's behind you: The unsuspecting photographer doesn't seem to see his assailant closing in . Wrong time, wrong place: The man is about to pick up an unexpected souvenir of his trip . And as if being flung into the air - narrowly missing being gored - is not enough, once the bull has charged once, it quickly turns around for a second go, just as the photographer is getting to his feet. Luckily, the man appears to walk away from his clash with the bull unhurt - but one would imagine his pride hasn't escaped unscathed. Spain is not the only country where the dubious art of bull-running takes place during the summer months – as Bayonne, which sits near to the Atlantic coast in the south-west of the country – was demonstrating on Sunday. And that's what happens: The man is knocked over as the bull charges forward . Now you have my attention: The man abandons his photographic plans as the bull continues to chase him . To . his credit, at least the bull runner was wearing an all-white outfit of t-shirt and . shorts – rather than a red ensemble which might have been more . eye-catching for the rampaging bovine. But turning his back on the bull as he tried to take his selfie was never likely to be a good idea – as the bull proved by ramming his head into the unobservant tourist’s bare legs.","Tourist attempts to take selfie during a bull run in the French city of Bayonne .

"By . Henry Jones . Paris is known as many things – a city of romance, fine restaurants, epic landmarks and grand architecture. But it all comes at a price, boasting some of the most expensive accommodation in the world. However, one hotel is hoping to change all that, by allowing holidaymakers to pay what they believe is a reasonable rate for their stay this summer. City of high prices: Paris is famed for its expensive accommodation . Hotelier Aldric Duval . has launched the enterprising ‘Payez ce que vous voulez’ (‘Pay what you . want’) promotion in a bid to draw extra guests to Tour d-Auvergne, his . three-star hotel in the central Opera district of the city. The idea is simple. A visitor can pay exactly what they want to stay the night. Normally, . double rooms at the hotel would cost at least €190 (£150) – but should . they decide that it is an appropriate amount, visitors can pay as little . as €1 (80p). The promotion runs until August 10. A leap into the unknown: Aldric Duval hopes his 'pay what you want' scheme will be a mould-breaker . Obviously, Mr Duval hopes that guests will not pay as small a sum as €1. The point of the scheme, he says, is to give customers a little financial freedom in a city of notoriously high costs. ‘If the client wants to pay €1, there is nothing I can do,’ Mr Duval told CNN. ‘But people will know this is not a good deal. We will explain it’s not fair if they pay one euro.’ The experiment will also give the hotel useful information about the sums people are prepared to pay for accommodation as Europe struggles back out of recession. Familiar scenes: Paris is known for its landmarks and its restaurants - but rarely as a place for bargain deals . He hopes that visitors to the city will treat the scheme as a good deal, but not abuse it. ‘We could have run a promotion offering . free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our website – . but we’ve decided to do this instead,’ he explained. The scheme has proved sufficiently inspiring that Mr Duval has had enquiries from other hoteliers in Paris – and further afield in Nice and Cannes – as to how it works. If the idea takes off, Paris may soon be known as the city of great room rates. Or as the city of bankrupt hoteliers.","Brave hotelier will let guests pay as little as €1 per night to stay at his hotel .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Horrific footage has emerged of a cannibal eating the leg of a Muslim slaughtered by a rampaging Christian mob in the Central African Republic. The victim was hauled from a bus, battered and then stabbed before being set on fire in the capital city Bangui, according to the BBC. In the aftermath of the incident, one of his attackers Ouandja Magloire - who also calls himself ‘Mad Dog’ -  grabbed hold of his leg and then began to devour it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Magloire told a BBC reporter that his action was . revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her . baby. He claimed that Muslims were responsible and he was angry with them.

I ate his leg, right down the white bone.' Witnesses did not intervene but recorded the footage on mobile phones, including the act of cannibalism. A video shows his cheeks bulging as he consumes the flesh. Witness . Jean-Sylvestre Tchya told news agency AFP: 'One of the individuals took . hold of an arm and went and bought some bread and starting chewing on . the flesh, along with his bread. 'The scene made many people vomit, and some cried out in horror.' Another witness, Alain Gbabobou, said he watched a man wrap the head up and proclaim that he would 'feast on it'. Violence: People throw stones at a car transporting two children of an ex-Seleka colonel at the 'UN crossroad' on Sunday in Bangui . Men brandish machets and knives to threaten Muslim people in Bangui . According . to The Sunday Telegraph, this may not have been an isolated incident, . with a source speaking of more than one person being eaten. An aid worker told the paper: 'They were taking machetes to people and burning the bodies and eating . them.' Sectarian violence in the Central African Republic (CAR) has been rife in the past month and flared up again following the resignation on Friday of president Michel Djotodia, the first Muslim to rule the Christian-majority nation. Shocking: A man ate the leg of a Muslim in the Central African Republic's capital, Bengui (pictured), in revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her baby . So far it has claimed around 1,000 lives, with the reports of cannibalism bringing to mind the macabre tales associated with Jean Bedel Bokassa, who ruled the CAR with an iron fist between 1966 and 1979. He was regarded by many as a brutal dictator and was accused of eating human flesh, incorporating it in meals for visiting officials and feeding slain opponents to animals. He died in 1996 and received a posthumous pardon in 2010. Some Christian fighters believe that human flesh makes them invincible and put chunks inside amulets that they wear.","The victim was attacked by a militia of around 20 machete-wielding men .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . Police were today accused of failing the public after it emerged seven out of every ten robbery investigations is 'dropped' without any action. Figures for Britain's biggest police force show 70 per cent of the 29,662 robberies reported to the Met in 2013 ended in no further action. Officers stopped investigating because they claimed there was insufficient evidence. The figures - which come at a time of increased scrutiny of the Met - will fuel concern that police are not taking seriously crimes which are harder to solve. New figures: 70 per cent of the 29,662 robberies reported to the Met in 2013 ended in no further action, it was revealed today . Half of the 29,576 thefts reported in London between June and December 2013 were also dropped. The remaining incidents are still being investigated. Some 45 per cent of the 87,480 burglaries reported to the Met last year were dropped. Only one per cent of burglaries resulted in a custodial sentence being handed out. Half of the 29,576 thefts reported to Bernard Hogan-Howe's force between June and December 2013 were also dropped . Meanwhile, 43 per cent of 36,614 incidents of shoplifting were dropped in 2013. Overall, just 1.9 per cent of all property crime incidents resulted in a custodial sentence. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said: 'These figures are truly shocking. 'The fact that no action was taken on nearly half of all incidents last year is unacceptable. 'We need to fundamentally reorder our policing priorities, free the police from responding to so many non-criminal incidents and allow them to focus on doing their job and catching criminals. 'Nothing could be more important for rebuilding public confidence in the police.' Public confidence in the police - and the Met in particular - has been battered by a string of recent scandals. These include Plebgate and the revelations of mass destruction of documents relating to the Stephen Lawrence case. Policy Exchange has asked the Labour MP David Lammy to help expose the harmful effects of property crime and what new measures could be implemented to tackle the problem. Mr Lammy, MP for Tottenham, said: 'Victims of property crime must be reassured that the police are doing everything possible to catch and convict those responsible. Burglary or robbery doesn't simply result in financial loss. It can have long lasting emotional effects. 'As a society we have developed a much too relaxed attitude about fighting property crime. Politicians, the courts and the police need to step up to the plate and tackle the problem head on.' Earlier this week, it was revealed how police have marked more than 100,000 crimes as solved in the past three years, despite only handing them over to be 'taken into consideration' by the courts. The high number of cases marked as 'solved' has sparked fears that police could be using the tactic as a way of boosting the number of 'detected' crimes or crimes cleared up by forces. The Met requested the highest number of TICs - 15,500 in two years. Last night, the force insisted robberies, mobile phone thefts, bicycle thefts and residential burglaries. A spokesman said: 'The MPS investigates every single allegation of crime that it receives and conducts secondary investigations on more than 60 per cent of allegations of crime - substantially above the national average of 45 per cent.'","Seven out of ten robberies reported to Met in 2013 were never solved .

"Traders at Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have been suspended over fixing claims. City watchdogs are probing reports of fixing of currency markets as part of a global investigation. Up to eight traders have reportedly become caught up in the inquiry to the currency market which is worth £3 trillion-a-day globally. As many as six traders at Barclays have reportedly been suspended in connection with claims of currency market fixing . Barclays is said to have suspended as many as six foreign exchange traders and while RBS has put two of its traders on suspension. Both banks have declined to comment on the reports but confirmed they have been drawn into the investigations. RBS said in its third quarter results today it had been contacted by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other authorities. It added: ‘The group is reviewing communications and procedures relating to certain currency exchange benchmark rates as well as foreign exchange trading activity and is cooperating with these investigations. ‘At this stage, the group cannot estimate reliably what effect, if any, the outcome of the investigation may have on the group.’ Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, refused to comment on the case, but said it will ‘come down very severely on anyone we discover has been breaking the rules’. Meanwhile Barclays said it was also co-operating with inquiries from various authorities. It is reviewing its foreign exchange trading activities, over a period of several years to August this year. RBS boss Ross McEwan said it will 'come down very severely on anyone we discover has been breaking the rules' Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS are also thought to have been contacted as part of the probe involving regulators in Britain, Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong. The FCA revealed last month it had launched its own investigation into the foreign exchange market, which is worth £3 trillion a day globally. It said it first sent out letters to firms in April, before launching a formal investigation later. Regulators are looking into whether currency traders shared information about their positions and knowledge of client orders through instant messages to rig the foreign exchange market in their favour. Currency exchange rates are set on a daily basis by analysing actual trading volumes at leading banks during a short time window. It is thought that traders could potentially influence exchange rates by pushing through large orders during the 60-second window to make a profit. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS are also thought to have been contacted as part of the probe involving regulators in Britain, Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong . Even a small movement in exchange rates could affect the value of investments worldwide, including pension funds. It threatens to engulf the industry in yet another embarrassing scandal at a time when many financial firms are still battling to restore their reputations following the Libor rigging revelations. Barclays and RBS were both fined for their part in the Libor scandal, paying penalties of £290 million and £391 million respectively. According to the Bank for International Settlements, global foreign exchange activity rose to 5.3 trillion dollars (£3.3 trillion) a day this year, from four trillion dollars (£2.5 trillion) in 2010. London accounts for the bulk of currency trading, with 41 per cent of global turnover in the market, followed by the United States, which has a 19 per cent share, Singapore with 5.7 per cent, Japan with 5.6 per cent and Hong Kong with 4.1 per cent.","Six Barclays traders and two from RBS have been suspended .

The Victorian Government will introduce Australia's first ever sexting laws to parliament this week, which would see people who send explicit pictures of others without their consent charged by police. The new legislation would also protect people under 18 who send sexts from being convicted of child pornography offences and placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

The government will make it an offence to intentionally distribute, or threaten to distribute, an intimate image of another person without their consent. 'This new law will respond specifically to the issue of sexting to ensure that appropriate penalties apply to those who misuse this technology,' Attorney-General Robert Clark said. 'This will continue to make clear that such behaviour is unacceptable and illegal.' Also under the new laws, people under 18 will not be convicted of a child pornography offence if they create, possess or distribute a sext of themselves or of a child less than two years younger than them, The Age reported. But this exemption would not apply to teenagers if the images depict a sexual assault or to adults. Currently, all sexts that capture a person under 18 are considered child pornography, and young people who distribute such images are treated as child pornographers. Also under the new laws, people under 18 will not be convicted of a child pornography offence if they create, possess or distribute a sext of themselves or of a child less than two years younger than them .","Victoria will introduce Australia's first ever sexting laws to parliament .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . According to research, one in three of us now regularly take part in 'digital' sexual encounters over text, webcam or videophone. Stock image pictured . Have you ever sent an explicit text, photo or video to someone? According to a recent study, one in three of us now regularly take part in ‘digital’ sexual encounters. Over the past year, 34 per cent of men and women admitted to sending sexts, explicit photos on Snapchat or in chatrooms, or using webcams and videophones to have cyber sex. The study also found almost 60 per cent had taken part in online sex, or had a sexual encounter with someone they weren’t in a relationship with. The study was conducted by CyberCompare.net as part of research into the digital habits of people in the UK. It focused specifically on the everyday activities people rely on technology and gadgets for. A total of 1,612 men and women aged over 18 took part, and all classed themselves as ‘regularly sexually active.’ The most popular form of digital sex was sexting, at 37 per cent. Videophone sex came second at 30 per cent, while webcam sex was third with 26 per cent. Almost a fifth of people in long-distance relationships said they used digital encounters to keep the passion alive, and 14 per cent of people in couples said it was necessary because work schedules kept them apart. A small number, 6 per cent, said they interacted digitally with someone who wasn’t their current partner, and online sexual encounters were the only way they could see and speak to each other.

Explicit encounters on Snapchat were . had by 15 per cent of participants, and 7 per cent had experienced . digital sex in a chatroom. More than a fifth said they preferred ‘digital’ sex because it was less embarrassing than traditional sex. One in ten admitted they didn’t enjoy physical sex, but enjoyed the ‘thrill and fantasy of digital encounters.’ The most common place for digital sexual encounters was at home (71 per cent), although 8 per cent said they’d done so at work. Almost 60 per cent admitted to have digital sexual encounters with people they weren't in a relationship with. Stock image pictured . Lead researcher at CyberCompare.net, Kimberley Shapley, said: ‘Technology is infiltrating pretty much every element of everyday life now, even our sex lives it seems! ‘To see that one in three sexual encounters are now digital was surprising, and perhaps a little telling about how people approach sex nowadays. No longer do we have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as someone to have a ‘sexual encounter’ with them- there are apps to do that for us!’ Recent research from McAfee found just over half of adults who have exchanged intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three do not even have the most basic password protection on their smartphones. Of those that do have protection, just over 40 per cent use the same details for multiple internet connected devices, increasing the likelihood these devices will be hacked. Shockingly, the U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 per cent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger. Meanwhile, a YouGov poll commissioned by the Huffington Post found 85 per cent of men and women consider sexting to be a form of cheating. In a YouGov poll of 1,000 U.S. adults commissioned by the Huffington Post, 85 per cent of female respondents deemed the non-physical act dishonest, as did 74 per cent of men. The study was conducted by CyberCompare.net. A total of 1,612 men and women aged over 18 took part. The most popular form of digital sex was sexting at 37 per cent. Videophone sex came second at 30 per cent, while webcam sex was third with 26 per cent . A study released before Christmas suggests that many racy photos and messages, known as sexts, are sent out of obligation to a partner, instead of for fun. Young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, according to a study. U.S. scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘requisexts’. The research by Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne reveals that just as some couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument, the same is true of e-sex and sexts. It found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner. The numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘compliant sexual activity’ which revealed that 55 per cent of U.S. women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they weren’t feeling like it. Facebooking a former flame and forming a close bond with someone via text or email were also outed as adulterous acts. A sex simulator was unveiled in Tokyo last year that provides a fully immersive 3D experience using the Oculus Rift visor. One developer, known only as ‘Ressentiment’, created the sex robot by combining an Oculus Rift with a controller that triggers sensations on the body, called a Novint Falcon.

"By . Francesca Chambers . The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said several months after Bowe Bergdahl disappeared that he knew the then-infantryman had deserted, a former platoon mate of Bergdahl's revealed Monday. 'The joint chief of staff, Admiral [Michael] Mullen at the time. He came out to our unit and had Thanksgiving dinner, and he said, ""Yeah he walked off, everybody knows he walked off, I don’t know why they’re trying to"" 'act like he didn't, former Army Specialist Cody Full said in an interview released yesterday by The Daily Caller. Full's admission that the top-ranking military official knew Berghdal intended to abandon his post in Afghanistan on June, 30, 2009 comes on the eve of the Army's first formal interview with Sgt Bergdahl for it's investigation into charges of desertion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This undated image of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was taken before he was captured in Afghanistan. Bergdahl is currently under investigation on charges that he deserted the Army. A former platoon mate of Bergdahl's, Cody Full, claims the military has known for years that Berghdal knowingly abandoned his post . Tomorrow Major General Kenneth Pow will question Bergdahl at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, the New York Daily News reports. Bergdhal returned to active duty at the military base several weeks ago. Full, a 25-year-old former . infantryman who now lives in Houston, Texas, has been one of Bergdahl's most outspoken critics since the former prisoner of war was exchanged in late May for five Taliban commanders. A few days after Bergdahl's release, Full told MailOnline his former roommate is 'a deserter at best, and a traitor at worst.' 'He wasn't . out on some patrol one day and got captured by the Taliban, and nobody . smuggled him off of the base,'  Full said. 'This . soldier knew what he was doing. He left us. He willingly . and premeditatedly deserted his comrades. 'And he put his team, his . squad, his platoon, his company, and thousands of other American . soldiers in Afghanistan at a very high risk trying to find him,' Full charged. Full told Fox News in an interview the same week that Bergdahl did not serve the United State with honor.' At a congressional hearing in mid-June, Full sad Bergdahl should be hauled before a military court and slapped with eight separate criminal charges, including desertion, insubordination and disobeying orders. Full, left, told Fox News after Bergdahl's release that he 'did not serve the United States with honor' Regardless of the circumstances of Bergdahl's disappearance, the United States has a responsibility to rescue American soldiers who go missing overseas, President Barack Obama said in response to accusations that Bergdahl deserted. Current chairman of the Joint Chiefs Army General Martin . Dempsey said the Taliban trade was . 'likely our last, best opportunity' to rescue Bergdahl. The government had tried to negotiate Bergdahl's release in the past but could not come to an agreement with the terrorist organization. As part of the eventual deal, five Taliban fighters were released to Qatar on the condition that they . stay there for the next year. The Qatari government is responsible for tracking their movements during that time. Lawmakers have voiced concerns . that the five men - whom they say were among the most dangerous prisoners at the terrorist holding facility in Guantanamo Bay - will return to Afghanistan upon their release and take up . arms again. Army Col. Mark Mitchell, a Green Beret who helped bring in one of the terrorists, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, told the Washington Times today that Fazl is a 'psychopath, and he’s probably a danger to fellow Afghans' but he's not likely a threat to Americans. Lawmakers are concerned that Mullah Mohammad Fazl, pictured here, and the four other Taliban fighters the White House swapped with Bergdahl will take up arms against the U.S. when they are released from Qatar next year . Fazl and the other four men 'have been off the battlefield for 12 years. In that time, Afghanistan . has changed, the Taliban has changed and other leaders have risen . through the ranks while he’s been enjoying a comfortable, if highly . structured, life at Guantanamo Bay,' Mitchell said. 'So, it won’t be as simple as simply walking back through the door and picking up where he left off,' he explained. 'There’s lots of Afghans, probably even a few Talibs, that have no desire to see him back in Afghanistan, much less in any kind of position of authority.' Republicans on the House Armed Services committee said last week that they continue to feel uneasy about the circumstances of Bergdahl's release and the terror trade, however, and voted in favor of a resolution formally reprimanding Obama for his actions. 'There are serious questions related to the circumstances of which he became a prisoner of the Taliban and the Haqqani network,' Republican Rep. Scott Rigell, a sponsor of the legislation, told The Daily Caller last week. The committee's Republican members and two Democrats voted to pass a non-binding resolution condemning Obama for failing to notify Congress of the swap 30 days prior, as required to by law, and failing to properly consider the 'repercussions of negotiating with terrorists.' The resolution will be considered by the full House of Representatives when Congress returns from recess next month and has a strong chance of passing in the Republican-led legislative body.","Former Army Specialist Cody Full says former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Michael Mullen made the admission five months after Bergdahl left .

The 28-year-old's attorney said he was 'ready to move on' as a civilian if he is given an honorable discharge by the investigation into his capture. The inquiry, led by Major General Kenneth R Dahl, had been due to report back by this week, but it was announced today that this would now be delayed until next month. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl spent five years as a Taliban prisoner after vanishing from his post in 2009 . Sgt Bergdahl disappeared from his post in Paktika, Afghanistan, on June 30, 2009, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, which is based at Fort Richardson, Alaska. In a scenario widely compared to the storyline of TV series Homeland, he then spent almost five years in Taliban captivity before he was released on May 31 this year in a controversial exchange for five prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. Since Sgt Bergdahl's release, several soldiers who served alongside him have claimed that he left his post voluntarily, prompting calls for him to be charged with desertion. It has also been claimed that several troops were killed or wounded in searches for him. Sgt Bergdahl would be eligible for college funding under the GI Bill if he received an honorable discharge.

According to the Business Insider, Mr Fidell played down the delay to Maj Gen Dahl's probe, claiming 'it is no big thing' and that the investigator was just 'tying up loose ends'. Mr Fidell added: 'We're just hoping all the facts come out.' A US Army statement on the delay said: 'As the investigating officer works through this final stage, it is possible that he will have to follow up on issues that may require additional witness interviews.' Once Maj Gen Dahl's report is complete, it will be subject to a legal review that could further delay a decision on Sgt Bergdahl's fate. Upon his release, Sgt Bergdahl was initially flown to Germany before being taken to the Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas for medical tests. He has since been assigned administrative duties at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. He was questioned by Maj Gen Dahl for two days earlier this month. In the hit TV series Homeland, a US Marines sniper played by Damian Lewis returns home to the US after spending eight years as an Al Qaeda prisoner in Iraq.","'Homeland' prisoner ready to move to civilian life if discharged, says lawyer .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A millionaire real estate heir who was acquitted of murdering his neighbor ten years ago has appeared in court after he allegedly urinated on candy in a Texas CVS. Robert Durst, who was acquitted of the murder in 2003 after claiming self defense, was arrested in July for allegedly urinating over . $100 worth of candy - Skittles - at the register in a Houston store. On Friday, the 71-year-old appeared before a Harris County judge charged with criminal mischief. His court appearance was reset for September 16 and he remains free on a $5,000 bond. The bizarre incident unfolded when he walked in to the store to collect a prescription in July. Back to court: Robert Durst is pictured leaving a Houston courtroom on Friday, where he faced charges of crimincal mischief for urinating on candy at a CVS. It is just his latest brush with the law . Accused: Durst allegedly urinated on $100 worth of candy in July after getting in to an argument with staff . 'He picked . up his prescription, and he then exposes himself and pees all over the . cash register and candy at the register and then walks out and walks . down the street,' Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva told The New York Post at the time. 'He wasn't arguing with anybody and he didn't seem agitated. He just peed on the candy. Skittles, I think.' But Durst has been making headlines for years - first over his wife's mysterious disappearance and then over the murder of his elderly neighbor in 2001. His father, Seymour, was a New York real estate mogul who amassed billions . of dollars worth of commercial property in Manhattan. Robert, a . well-connected socialite, worked for his father's Durst . Organization for years as a developer. But he was estranged from his . family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company . leadership in favour of his brother Douglas. The . Houston Chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $65 million . court settlement from his family, restoring a piece of his family . fortune. Questions: Durst, with his wife Kathleen Durst, was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance . Ten years earlier, Durst had gained infamy in New York . due to the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathie, and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it. He was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged.

Black, Durst's next-door neighbor in the boarding house where he was . living, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in . Galveston, Texas. A trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman, . Dorothy Ciner - who was actually Durst in a dress. It emerged that Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife. Killer: Durst is pictured left in a police booking photo in 2001 after he was arrested for the murder of neighbor Morris Black, right. At the time of the killing, he had been crossdressing to conceal his real identity . Acquitted: He admitted to shooting and dismembering Black but claimed he had acted in self-defense after they argued over a gun. He was acquitted and served a year for tampering with evidence . After . spending a month on the run, Durst tried to steal a chicken . salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in . Philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested.

But he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted. But he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of the body and was sentenced to five years in prison, but served just one. Despite his run-ins with the law, he still has access to his $43 million trust fund, which he has used to buy and develop real estate in New York. Last month, it was reported that Durst sold two Brooklyn buildings for $21.15 million, after buying them for $8.65 million in 2011.","Robert Durst, 71, 'got into an altercation with staff at a store in Houston and urinated over $100 worth of candy at the register in July'

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . Six years of construction of the One World Trade Center has been condensed into a fascinating two-minute timelapse video. Brooklyn based photographer Benjamin Rosamond took around 30,000 photographs of the 104-storey building from the day construction began in 2006 to the day when the final beam was laid in 2012. He painstakingly compressed 1,100 photos to create the two-minute timelapse video which shows the 541 metre skyscraper emerging from the Manhattan skyline as the years pass. The New York building, which dominates the skyline and is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, can be seen from miles around. One of the most visible, politicised and high profile buildings in the world, the One World Trade Center, which was built after the September 11 terrorist attack , lies on Ground Zero. For years the site lay abandoned as authorities and victims' families argued over the design. Eventually, a compromise was forged  and the building was designed part memorial, part commercial centre and part transportation hub. The construction of the One World Trade Center in New York was captured by photographer Benjamin Rosamond who took 30,000 images and compressed 1,100 of them into a two-minute time lapse video . Benjamin Rosamond's camera clicked away both day and night as he collected images of the One World Trade Center to package into a tiny two-minute video showing its construction over six years . Once plans were agreed and politics put aside, the construction of the building, which is known colloquially as The Freedom Tower, stepped up. In the final two years of construction, a new floor went up every week. And with it, came a robust security measures designed to withstand a terrorist attack on a building which has already been targeted twice in the past. The One World Trade Centre can be seen mid way through construction. Building took six years while the authorities and families of the victims decided what the purpose of the skyscraper should be . The emerging One World Trade Center is mid construction and sits level with the Empire State Building on the Manhattan skyline . The first 20 storeys of the tower are a windowless concrete block strong enough to withstand the blast of a truck bomb, taking into account the 1993 bombing where Ramzi Yousef drove a truck filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the underground garage of the North Tower. The blast opened a 30 metre hole in the building and six people were killed, while 50,000 workers took hours to evacuate the building. Meanwhile the glass which smashed and fell to the ground like knives during the September 11 attack is now shatter-proof. Stairs and elevator shafts have their own ventilations systems and one staircase has been reserved for the emergency services only. All of this was captured in Mr Rosamund's two minute video, highlighting the astonishing amount of time and energy that has gone into building one of the world's most recognisable buildings. The One World Trade Center officially opened in 2014 and houses the likes of Conde Nast Publications .","Brooklyn photographer Benjamin Rosamond took 30,000 photographs .

"By . Chris Pleasance . From the surface there is nothing special about the hilly countryside around the city of Cankiri in Turkey. However 1,300ft below ground is a stunning salt mine which was first dug by primitive humans around 5,000 years ago. Despite its incredible age the mine is still in use today and produces more then 500 tonnes of salt each year which is used in cooking and for a range of souvenirs. This is the salt mine outside of Cankiri in Turkey which began being mined in 300BC and is still in use today . The original miners were Hittites, an ancient race of people who had an . empire in the Middle East and used primitive tools and their hands to . extract the salt . The pictures were taken by Melih Sular, 32, as part of the 2013 National geographic photography cometition . According to a 1971-79 survey there is still more than 1billion tonnes of ore left in the mine, which is extracted using machines and underground blasting. These pictures were taken by Melih Sular, 32, who was guided through the caves by Murat Danaci as part of the National Geographic photography contest. He said: 'When I first entered the salt cave I was afraid. I thought to myself: ""What happens if it collapses?"" The mine produces about 500 tonnes of salt every day which is sold on for use in cooking and as souvenirs . While temperatures on the surface regularly reach 91F (33C) they rarely stray above 59F (15C) in the caves . At its deepest point the mine extends down more than 1,300ft (400m) below the ground . 'The cave is cool and scentless, which is because it is a very old salt cave. The walls are all made of rock salt and the texture is varied because of the digging machines used.' The ore extracted from the mine often comes in at 90 per cent purity . He added: 'I've never seen anything like it before. The most striking part of the caves is the old gallery, which were dug by Hittites. 'It's interesting because they dug this gallery with simple tools and their own hands, unlike today's methods.' While temperatures in the city . regularly reach 92 Fahrenheit (33C), the mercury never strays much above . 59 degrees (15C) inside the ancient caves. The Hitties were an ancient . race who built an empire in the Middle East which covered most of . modern-day central Turkey, northern Syria and Iraq and flourished . between 1,400 and 1,200BC. They were famous for their skill in building and making chariots and wrote in a hieroglyphic-type language called cuneiform. They were eventually destroyed after . several costly wars, particularly a defeat to the army of Ramses II, . pharaoh of the Egyptians. Competition for succession of the throne also . drained their resources. Today the mine has 16 workers and contains a small canteen, a mosque, repair room, workshop and a first aid room. All the ore extracted from the mine, which measures in at around 90 per cent purity, is taken by diggers to nearby railway tracks where it is transported to a factory for processing. There is so much salt contained in the ground around the mine that it appears around the edge of a nearby lake after being dissolved into the water. The Hittites who first mined here in 3000BC, had an empire which reached from Turkey into Syria and Iraq . The 16-strong workforce use digging machines and dynamite blasts to extract the salt from the clay soil . Despite its age a survey in 1979 showed the mine had more than 1billion tonnes of ore still left .","Salt mine is located outside of Cankiri city in northern Turkey .

"By . Simon  Parry . and Michael Thomas . An elite team of British medics in the Philippines typhoon disaster zone were yesterday launching a rescue mission to remote islands cut off from aid for nine days. The 12-strong taskforce of specialist doctors, anaesthetists and nurses will set off as early as today to help isolated communities at the request of the Philippines government and the World Health Organisation. They will be carrying two tons of medical equipment from the UK. Desperation: Filipino typhoon victims rush to get relief goods from a U.S. Navy Sea Hawk in Salcedo . The development came as: . Donations by the British public to the Typhoon Haiyan charity appeal also reached £33 million yesterday. And David Cameron announced that the Government is to give an extra £30 million in aid to the Philippines, bringing the total to £50 million. The Mail on Sunday joined the medical taskforce as it touched down on Cebu and travelled with leader Professor Tony Redmond and two of his colleagues to the northern tip of the island devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. Anguish: A young victim weeps in Bogo General Hospital in the Philippines . They drove through villages flattened by the storm and visited hospitals in Bogo City and Daanbantayan where storm casualties are being treated. Children held up pitiful signs begging for food and water along the route where, in some villages, 90 per cent of homes were ruined. More than 100 people with sick children and relatives lined up outside the general hospital in Bogo City, now a field hospital treating storm victims with similar injuries to those the British team expects to find. As well as storm injuries, the hospital has had to cope with a rash of premature births after traumatised women went into labour early. Professor Redmond, who heads the University of Manchester’s Humanitarian Conflict Response Unit, said many of the injuries treated at the hospital were caused after tin roofs were blasted away in the storm. The British team will try to help in remote areas which have had no medical aid since one of the fiercest typhoons ever. Prof Redmond said: ‘We will be assisting people who have untreated injuries and untreated illnesses who will need urgent help. ‘Any untreated wound will be infected and any untreated illness will be worse. We will give them what care we can and arrange for them to be airlifted or sent by ship to a hospital were they can be given appropriate treatment.’ Speaking as he gave his team their final briefings last night, Professor Redmond said: ‘The mood in the team is very positive. They have trained for this. This is what they want to do. They have seen the images and read the reports and they want to help.’ The mission is the first major test for an International Rescue-style network of doctors set up by the British Government last year called the UK International Emergency Trauma Register. It is funded by the Department for International Development. It is part of a multi-million- pound relief effort by Britain which includes an airlift of emergency supplies and the deployment of destroyer HMS Daring – due to arrive in the Philippines today – and helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious to help deliver supplies.","Elite team of 12 medics dispatched to the disaster zone .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A mother-of-four is planning a public protest after she was banned from breastfeeding her baby at a swimming pool. Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. Ms Barnett - who has been taking her children to the Newport Pagnell pool for nine years - said she then had to take her other children out of the pool so she could go to the changing rooms and breastfeed. Scroll down for video . Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told she was not allowed to breastfeed her daughter Olive, five months, at the Middleton Pool in her home town . She told MailOnline she was sitting on a bench on the poolside, about 2ft away from where her children were playing in the water, when she asked the lifeguard whether she could feed Olive 'discreetly'. She said: 'I do not know why, but I asked the lifeguard if I could feed Olive. I said I would cover it up with a towel. When he said no, I was in shock. 'I could not believe what I was hearing. I was in too much shock to get angry - I just got really upset and started welling up. 'It's 2014 and yet people still have an issue with breastfeeding in a public place.' Ms Barnett was with her son Dominic, four, who was sat on the pool . steps, her nine-year-old daughter Millie and one of Millie's friends . when the incident took place. She told MKWeb that she had to get the children out of  the pool and take them to the changing room so she could continue to feed  Olive.

'We have been in contact with Natasha and after explaining our reasons behind suggesting she breastfed out of the pool hall were purely down to our concerns for the health and safety of her other young child who required adult supervision in the pool, Natasha accepted that our actions were a sensible and practical solution for ensuring the baby could be fed, both mother and baby would be comfortable and the slightly older child remained safe under mum’s supervision.'

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A rising number of women are complaining of 'mummy's thumb', a form of tendonitis linked to lifting babies . Women being 'weaker than they used to be' is to blame for a growing number of new mothers experiencing an injury known as 'mummy thumb'. Older generations of women would regularly make their own bread, kneeding the dough, they would hand wash the clothes and perform other grueling daily chores. But in a world where bread makers and washing machines are a staple in the kitchen, women are suffering. Chartered physiotherapist Sammy Margo told MailOnline a more sedentary lifestyle means women are 'generally weaker than they used to be'. That, she says, is the reason for an increasing number of women complaining of 'mummy thumb', known by its medical term de Quervain's tenosynovitis. It is a painful condition affecting the tendons in the thumb, that run down the side to the wrist. Women suffering 'mummy's thumb', commonly complain of pain every time they turn their wrist, go to grasp objects or make a fist. Ms Margo said repeatedly lifting a baby can cause the condition to develop. She said: 'When you have a baby the ligaments in the body relax, and then all of a sudden, with weaker ligaments and floppy tendons you have to effectively weight lift all day. 'Statistically on average a new mother will lift their baby 25 to 30 times a day. 'Years ago we used to treat a lot of cases of washer women's knee, when women would hand wash clothes regularly. 'But as the times have changed, we no longer see that injury. Instead we are seeing more cases of ""mummy's thumb"" because historically women used to be stronger and so more prepared for the task of lifting a heavy baby all day.' While it is a common injury, Ms Margo said as a physiotherapist she only sees the most severe of cases. 'I am treating several mums with 'mummy thumb' at the moment,' she told MailOnline. 'But most mothers, busy with their babies, will put off going to seek treatment, instead researching the condition online. 'Being a new mum is a very special time so only those that are really suffering will find time to come and get treatment.' Though referred to as 'mummy' thumb', the condition is not a new one. Physiotherapist Sammy Margo said one of the reasons behind the rise in the injury, treated using a splint, is the fact women are 'not as strong as they used to be'. A more sedentary lifestyle has resulted in women not building up the strength needed to 'effectively weight lift all day', after giving birth, Ms Margo told MailOnline . 'Mummy's thumb' known by its medical name, de Quervain's tenosynovitis is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. People suffering de Quervain's tenosynovitis, will probably feel pain every time they turn their wrist, grasp anything or make a fist. Although the exact cause is not known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement - such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports or lifting your baby - can make it worse. Symptoms of de Quervain's tenosynovitis include: . Pinching, grasping and other movements of the thumb and wrist aggravate the pain. Chronic overuse of the wrist is commonly associated with the condition. People between the ages of 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing de Quervain's tenosynovitis. The condition is more common in women than in men, and it may be associated with pregnancy. Baby care, which involves using your thumbs as leverage to lift your child hundreds of times a day, may also be associated with the condition.Source: Mayo Clinic . Ms Margo said it has been around for years, and in recent years was known as 'texting thumb injury'. 'As mobile phones started to get smaller, we started to see cases of what became known as 'texting thumb injury',' she said. 'It is the same condition, a form of tendonitis. Different lifestyle factors mean we see it coming to the forefront.' Ms Margo said new mothers can help reduce the risk of suffering 'mummy's thumb' by regularly using aids, including feeding pillows to bring the baby closer, without lifting. She added: 'For some mothers the condition will just burn out and ease off. 'The condition is particularly prevalent when mothers are breast feeding. 'When you breast feed the body releases a hormone called relaxin, which causes the collagen in the body to become more soft, leaving the joints more lax. 'When mothers stop breast feeding, generally the condition will ease off in three to four months. 'In more severe cases the condition needs hands-on manual therapy and in some cases hand splints.' She said women can take action before they fall pregnant, to build their strength and be mindful of the task ahead. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic, in the U.S. say people aged between 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing de Quervain's tenosynovitis. They note the injury is 'more common in women than in men, and it may be associated with pregnancy'. 'Baby care, which involves using your thumbs as leverage to lift your child hundreds of times a day, may also be associated with the condition,' their website states.","A rising number of mothers are complaining of 'mummy's thumb' experts say .

"By . Daniel Mills . The sister of a man shot dead during a botched Gold Coast robbery has taken pitty on her brother's killer, security guard Wayne Heneker, saying he 'was just doing his job'. Nasreen Rahman, the elder sister of Shameem Rahman, 46, who was killed on Monday while trying to rob a security from a firm he was laid off at, said it must be a distressing time for the 47-year-old guard who shot her brother three times. In the days since Sharmeem Raheem's death, an outpouring of support has been directed towards Mr Heneker, including from the most unlikey of places, the dead man's family. 'I feel sorry for him:' Nasreen Rahman, The sister of slain robber, Shameem, said she does not begrudge the security guard who shot her brother in a botched armed hold-up . Shot and killed: Shameem Rahman died after attempted to carry out the armed robbery on a former colleague . Police said Mr Heneker acted on instinct, and Ms Rahman agreed. She told the Courier Mail she did not begrudge the guard for doing what he did, declaring she 'felt very sorry for him.' 'It wasn’t his fault. There’s nothing to forgive — he was doing his job.' She has even made a plea to Mr Heneker that if he would ever like to meet with her, to help put her brother's death behind them, she would be happy too. 'Our sympathy goes out to him because he has to live with this for the rest of his life.' Ms Rahman said her brother was a loving father, devoted husband and a good cook who was not, to her knowledge, in any financial trouble at the time of his death. But she didn't shy away from the fact that he was plagued by a series of past misdemeanors and battled a history of crime linked to issues with drugs and violence. He also battled a severe bout of depression following the death of his mother and father. Ms Rahman said it was a combination of all of these factors which brought out his self-destructive side. 'Traumatic situation': A security guard is consoled by police after opening fire and shooting a former colleague dead during a robbery attempt on the Gold Coast on Monday . 'I loved my brother anyway – he was a good man, trying to provide for his family but unfortunately the other stuff in his life was almost like self-destruction,” she said. Meanwhile, the family is still to decide whether Mr Rahman, a Muslim, will be buried here, in Sydney or back in Bangladesh. Mr Heneker, a 27-year surf lifesaving veteran, said he was grateful for the community support he had received since the shooting, which had left him shaken. His lawyer Jason Jacobson said on Tuesday that his client was very emotionally and physically injured from the incident. 'He's still in a very bad way today,' Mr Jacobson told MailOnline.

'We are able to report that whilst our guard was visibly upset and traumatised by yesterday’s incident, he has our full and unconditional support and is receiving counselling and assistance to get through this difficult time,' Ms Walsh said in a statement on Tuesday. Witnesses speak with reporters after hearing shouting and gun shots outside the pub early on Monday morning . 'Border Security continues to assist police with the investigation and as such, we are unable to comment any further on the incident.' One witness said he heard 'three gun shots' and a 'couple of shouts' while he was walking nearby. Streets were earlier shut down and the doors locked on a childcare centre with up to 30 children housed inside. Neighbours who first raised the alarm said they saw a man run out of the tavern yelling 'Call the police' and then saw a security guard 'standing there pointing a gun at the bush'.","Nasreen Rahman said Gold Coast guard was just doing his job when he shot her brother .

"By . Eluned Price . Now that Jennifer in The Archers has successfully coerced husband Brian into funding a new kitchen for Home Farm  - by refusing to cook for him until he did - she is splurging on all manner of trendy appliances and materials. The crucial question is, how far should Jennifer go? Does she really need a boiling/sparkling/still water tap and a steam oven? Does an uber-modern kitchen sit well in an 18th Century farmhouse? Would it add to the property's value should they have to sell? If she were in London, she should have little fear in splashing out on the kitchen, argues Jonathan Hewlett, head of Savills London Region, Residential. COUNTRY CHIC: Anne Salisbury relaxes in her elegantly subdued new kitchen . 'In today's world, the kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house - the most important, if it's a combined kitchen/dining/living room.' That holds true, he says, even in the poshest areas. 'I went to a six-storey house in Chelsea recently where they had moved the kitchen from the basement up to the more formal floor to make it into a family room because, as the owners said, ""We live in the kitchen."" 'Very formal houses will have catering kitchens but in a £1 million family home, it's worth spending £15,000 to £30,000 on the kitchen, and, say, £50,000 on a £2 million property.' While cautioning against over-specifying . everything, Hewlett says: 'Don't be shy in spending good money. If it's . suitably exquisite relative to the overall value of the house, it's . worth it.' But the story is different in the country. Guy Shaw manages the Oxford office of estate agents John D. Wood covering the entire county. 'Kitchens have saleability,' he says. 'But while ultra-modern and trendy retro kitchens are mushrooming in the city, the ""London effect"" has yet to reach the countryside. Some see them as out of character in a period country house. CHECK MATE: A retro 1950s style kitchen complete with monochrome tiles . 'The key . to a new kitchen is purpose. If you are ""turning"" the property - doing . it up to sell on - you want one that will be desirable, but you need . prudence. Keep it proportionate and bear cost margins in mind. If the . property is for you to live in, do what you want. But refurbishing the . kitchen alone will not add value: that has to be reflected in the whole . house.' Shaw's . motto is 'style and functionality' - and he points out that he's seen . 'solid, 25-year-old kitchens that still look immaculate'. Anne Salisbury's kitchen in her last house was a case in point. Fifteen years ago, she installed a traditional, hand-painted kitchen in her 350-year-old thatched country cottage in Oxfordshire - and when she sold the property last year, it was still as good as new. The formula worked so well for her that she employed the same company, John Lewis of Hungerford, to build a kitchen for her new house, which is 'probably Tudor'. The property, also in Oxfordshire, needed a year's renovation when Anne bought it. 'The kitchen itself was tiny,' she recalls. 'It was a wonderful opportunity to start afresh and build an entirely new room.' The result is an elegant 540 sq ft kitchen/dining room that, while looking contemporary, is sympathetic to Anne's antique furniture. At the working end is a black electric Aga with a large rectangular island with a walnut top opposite, while the muted tones of the cupboards and drawers make the rest of the kitchen recede into the background. The kitchen cost about £25,000, not including building work on the extension. SAVE IT FOR THE CITY: A glossy modern kitchen from the John Lewis of Hungerford range . Although John Lewis of Hungerford make a range of kitchens, manager Graham Jones believes classical ones last longer than hard-edged, modish ones. 'They out-perform in looks and durability,' he says. His company has been making the same 'artisan' kitchen for more than 20 years. All external panels and doors are factory-painted MDF 'which has the toughest wear-rating of any surface'. Customised colours and work surfaces make each kitchen individual. 'Choose appliances that do what you want, not because they have 300 different programmes,' he says. 'Remember, wood surfaces can dent and get scratched and will always need oiling. Marble is unsuitable for kitchen flooring as it is an alkali stone. Even when sealed it is not impervious to acids such as vinegar, red wine or citrus.' Jane Martin discovered this, to her cost, in her brand-new, five-bedroom house in North Oxford. Her high-end German kitchen with two double ovens and integrated everything had a marble floor. 'My daughter spilt some lemon juice. It immediately took the surface off, and got greyer by the day.' Graham Jones says porcelain tiled floors, indistinguishable from real polished stone, are a better option. 'Real limestone, for example, is both porous and pitted. It will stain easily and grind in any dirt.' This is not good news for Jennifer on The Archers, since she has chosen Umbrian limestone tiles. If Rory spills blackcurrant juice all over it, her wail will be heard all the way to Felpersham.","Jonathan Hewlett of Savills Residential says kitchen is most important .

"By . Chris Pleasance For Mailonline . A manor house built by author Henry Williamson on land he bought for £125 in the 1920s has gone on sale for £900,000 . Williamson, who wrote Tarka The Otter, built the magnificent five-bed manor house on 1.5 acres of land he bought after winning a literature competition for his best-selling book, published in 1927. The esteemed author spent most of his life living in a tiny writing hut in the sprawling grounds of Ox’s Cross, near Braunton, North Devon. Scroll down for video . Author Henry Williamson bought this land near Georgeham in Devon for just £125 in the late 1920s before building a manor house there in the mid 1970s . The five-bedroom manor, which has a staircase covered with carvings of some of Williamson's most beloved characters, has now gone on sale for £900,000 . The land was bought by Williamson using £25 he had saved and another £100 he won from a writing competition with his first book Tarka The Otter . But he spent his final years in the manor house which boasts stunning views of Exmoor, Dartmoor and the sea. The whole estate - complete with vegetable plots, greenhouses and ponds - has been put on the market for £900,000. Colin Thorne, manager at estate agents Webber’s Fine and Country, said: 'How the house came about is a lovely little story. 'Henry Williamson had various traumas through the First World War and came back with an idea generated during the war - the need to find peace and solitude and tranquillity. Williamson only lived in the house during his final years. He spent most of his working life living in a small writing cottage in the grounds of Ox’s Cross, North Devon . As well as building the house (left), Williamson (right), also built a small writing hut on a nearby piece of land which sold for £125,000 during an auction in May . The house comes  a formal garden, a large vegetable garden, and views of the sea during the winter months when the leaves have fallen off the trees . 'He wanted somewhere to go where quietness would inspire and give then the chance to work. 'He found this land and the farmer wanted £125. He only had £25. But he published Tarka The Otter and won £100 in the Hawthornden Prize. He had the money he needed.' Williamson first built a writing hut on a now-separate piece of land near the home in 1929, which sold for more then £125,000 at auction in May. But in the mid 1970s he built the main Ox’s Cross home, designed in beautiful 1950’s Arts and Crafts Movement style, where he lived until he died in 1977. Mr Throne added: 'It really is spookily therapeutic. The grounds are just idyllic, with views of Exmoor and Dartmoor on a clear day, and in the winter when the leaves aren’t on the trees you can see the sea.' The house also comes with a fenced paddock which is currently used to house goats, as well as views over Exmoor and Dartmoor . The house also has views over the the Estuary of the Taw and River Torridge, two waterways where character Tarka supposedly lived . Ox’s Cross sits high above the popular North Devon village of Georgeham, with views across to the Estuary of the Taw and Torridge - the two rivers where the character of Tarka supposedly lived. The land is divided into a formal garden, a large vegetable garden, mature trees and a fenced paddock which is currently home to goats. The main house has four bedrooms plus an attic room, a study, a principal sitting room with a galleried landing, a feature Minster style fireplace with wood burning stove, and a staircase with carvings of Henry Williamson’s best loved characters. Downstairs there is a snug with a wood burner, a south facing dining room overlooking the garden and a kitchen with an Aga.","Henry Williamson bought land in Devon using money he won from literary competition with book Tarka The Otter .

"By . Nick Fagge . Dating: Katherine Jenkins with boyfriend Adam Bidwell at Royal Ascot . Katherine Jenkins is dating a friend of Prince Harry who joined the royal on his notorious Las Vegas holiday. The Welsh mezzo-soprano, 33, and Adam Bidwell have been an item since February after being introduced by friends. Mr Bidwell, 37, enjoyed a pool party with Harry and a group of girls during the prince’s ‘lads’ holiday’ to Las Vegas last August. On the same holiday Harry was pictured cavorting with a girl as they played ‘naked billiards’ in his hotel suite. Cambridge graduate Mr Bidwell is a former Wasps and London Welsh rugby player turned stockbroker. He and Miss Jenkins – who formerly dated TV presenter Gethin Jones – were pictured together last  month at Ascot and the Glastonbury Festival. A friend of the pair said: ‘They were introduced through a mutual friend and remained friends for quite a few months before they realised they had lots in common. Adam’s a very nice chap. He’s a good catch. ‘Everybody likes Adam especially because he is successful in his own right and not interested in Katherine’s spotlight.’ He looked relaxed when Miss Jenkins sat confidently on his knee backstage at the Glastonbury Festival last month. The second son of solicitor Christopher Bidwell, Adam was born into a happy middle class family from West Sussex and attended St Christopher preparatory school in Hove before becoming a day boy at £31,000-a-year Brighton College. Always a keen sportsman Mr Bidwell was also an able and hard-working student and won a place at Cambridge University. After graduating he played rugby first for London Welsh and later Wasps as well as working in the City of London. He is now a senior account manager at City stockbrokers Investec. And it was rugby – and his best friend former England fly-half Alex King - that led him into the celebrity circles where he mixes today. A friend told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s through Alex that he’s been introduced to celebrities and people like that in London. ‘He’s . been a semi-professional rugby player since the early 1990s and he was . part of that Brighton and Hove upper-middle class set growing up. Royal connections: The Welsh singer performed for the Queen at the Coronation Festival this week . ‘He’s a very likeable person and has always been popular with the girls. He’s always been a gentlemen and very nice chap. He’s always well turned out and smartly dressed. ‘He has a wealthy background but he doesn’t flaunt his wealth - he never has. ‘He’s a typical, competitive blokey bloke, which is definitely something that transcends into his professional life. He’s a high achiever who doesn’t settle for second best.’ Last year Miss Jenkins revealed she received death threats over false rumours that she had an affair with David Beckham. The singer took to Twitter in August to tell more than 228,000 followers around the world that she ‘absolute denied’ the ‘hurtful and untrue’ claims of a relationship with the married footballer. Many fans pointed out that such a public statement only attracted more attention to the allegations - but Miss Jenkins has now revealed she felt she had to take a stand because of ‘constant’ online abuse.","Adam Bidwell, 37, has been with the Welsh mezzo-soprano since February .

"By . Associated Press . The attorney for a woman who nearly died after unknowingly drinking toxic iced tea at a Utah restaurant says an employee at the eatery burned herself a month earlier on the same chemical cleaning compound. Lawyer Paxton Guymon said Thursday the former Dickey's Barbecue employee burned her tongue July 5. He says she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to see if it contained any of the chemical cleaner. Guymon says he's appalled that the South Jordan restaurant didn't get rid of the sugar container mixed with the chemical lye before it ended up in the tea that Jan Harding drank August 10. Another victim: Jan Harding's attorney Paxton Guyman says his client wasn't the only person to drink lye-laced tea at a Dickey's Barbecue in Utah . Injuries: Jan Harding (left), a mother of three, suffered deep burns to her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after drinking the tea. Her husband Jim spoke Thursday and said he's grateful she's finally getting better after being on the brink of death . On Thursday, Harding's husband Jim announced that she is recovering well.  He says he's not upset and doesn't want retribution for what happened. 'I’m just grateful for each day,' he said. 'I’m grateful that she’s getting better. I’m grateful that she has a voice. I’m grateful that the life and death thing has been taken off the table. I’m just grateful for where we are. I bring you a good word today, an encouraging word.' Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the customer's injuries were an isolated incident. Jan Harding, 67, is listed in good condition at a Salt Lake City hospital as she continues to improve, said University of Utah Health Care spokeswoman Kathy Wilets. The mother-of-three suffered deep burns in her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after taking a single sip of the tea that contained an industrial cleaning solution. Mrs Harding, a married mother of three, drank the lye-laced tea at this South Jordan restaurant on August 10 . She has been steadily improving this week and can now breathe on her own and talk a bit, family attorney Paxton Guyton has said. Getting better: Harding's husband announced Thursday that she is recovering and able to speak again after drinking the toxic tea . Authorities say a worker at Dickey’s Barbecue in South Jordan unintentionally put the chemical cleaning compound in a sugar bag last month. The substance ended up in Harding’s glass of iced tea after an employee mixed it into a beverage dispenser. The police agency looking into the incident has finished its investigation. Rather than making arrests and recommending charges, South Jordan police have asked prosecutors to determine if anyone should be charged because several people possibly played a role. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said it will likely take several more days to review evidence and interviews and make a decision. The Hardings, who live in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, went to the restaurant after church to meet friends for lunch. They had not even ordered yet when she took a sip of the tea. The cleaning product in the drink was meant for degreasing deep fryers and contained the odorless chemical lye, the active ingredient in drain cleaners. Overall, this Dickey’s has maintained a better-than-average health rating since opening in 2012, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp this week. County officials issued seven violations following a January inspection, including for improper food labeling, county records show. The year before, the restaurant had six violations. Dickey’s Barbecue Restaurants Inc. issued a statement last week that it was an isolated incident and nothing like it had happened in the 73 years the Dallas-based chain has operated. Consequences: Prosecutors are currently deciding whether to bring up charges against the Utah restaurant for poisoning the customer .","Jan Harding, 67, is recovering at the hospital after drinking poisoned tea at a South Jordan, Utah barbecue restaurant .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . After spending $184,000 on a new motor, most people would - at the very least - expect the car to have working doors. But if the model in question is the rarest Mini ever made - one of just of 15 and a personal favourite of the Queen - perhaps you could make an exception. The 1962 Austin Mini Beach Car, built without doors or side-pillars, fetched more than double its estimated value of $70,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week. Only 15 models of the Austin Mini Beach Car were made by British Motor Corporation in 1962 . The car, built without doors or side-pillars, was bought for $184,000 at Bonhams' Quail Lodge sale in California this week . The car, which has a tiny 849cc engine producing a modest 34bhp, was built 52 years ago by British Motor Corporation - with all but one being made as left-hand drives with the intention of being shipped over to the USA. The one right-hand drive that was produced was loaned to the Royal Family and it is thought that the Queen enjoyed driving the golf-buggy-like motor around Windsor Castle. At the time, the Daily Express wrote: 'The Queen, a knowledgeable motorist, doubtless enjoys travelling in this unconventional little vehicle as much as she does in her Rolls.' Despite being 52-years-old, the car has had just three owners since it was first shipped to San Francisco and has covered only 12,000 miles - an average of 4.4 miles per week. At $184,000, it is a world record price paid for a Mini at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962. Despite being 52 years old, the vehicle has done just 12,000 miles, having been kept in a showroom in California for most of its existence .

At $184,000, it is a world record price paid for a Mini at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962 . The car also cost the frivolous buyer $157,000 more than the cheapest Mini currently made by BMW is worth. David Swig, motorcar specialist at Bonhams, said: 'This powder blue, beach-going Mini - also known as the Riviera Buggy - is the rarest Mini variant. 'Built by hand, the car is a quirky, fun, early example from the iconic British Mini brand, perfect for beach lovers.'","Rarest Mini ever made - sold for 200 times its original 1962 price .

Watching on: A leaked police memo revealed French authorities are 'alarmed' by the soaring number of migrants arriving in the country . Making their way from Italy: Some 61,591 migrants landed in Italy in the first six months of this year . Police response: Hundreds of desperate refugees from Africa and the Middle East have set up the squalid new Jungle 2 camp . Close to Britain: While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan . Mohammed Atasi, 31, has spent eight weeks at the camp and has been stopped five times by border officials trying to board lorries. His family - including wife Nadia, 30, and their three young children - have already fled war-torn Homs in Syria, and made it to England in April. Mr Atasi told Russell Myers of the Daily Mirror: ‘I don’t know when I will see them again. We are living like animals here. ‘Why does no one care? I used to work as a chef at a five-star hotel. Now I am living in borrowed clothes.’ Cleaning: Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town . On guard: Migrants flowing into Europe by boat from Africa this year are expected to exceed 100,000 by mid-August, officials have said . Food: The number of arrivals has spiked in recent months following the breakdown of borders in Libya after Colonel Muammmar Gadaffi's fall in 2011 . Nourishment: Migrants fleeing poverty and war in Africa and the Middle East arrive in Calais with hopes of crossing the Channel on a ferry or on trucks laden with cargo . Tomatoes in hand: Their numbers in the Channel port have swelled to up to 2,000, overwhelming the city, aid agencies and police . New arrivals: Deputy Mayor Philippe Mignonet recently said Calais 'has been taken hostage' Hopeful: Britain is seen by many migrants as Europe's Shangri-La, with a more humane treatment of migrants than continental neighbors like France . Last week the Daily Mail reported how migrants in Calais clashed in a turf war as tensions in the illegal camp spilled over into violence. Riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to contain the hundreds of men as they fought running battles early last Tuesday morning. The rival groups from Sudan and Eritrea are battling for control of an area of land which is the best location for attempting to get into UK-bound lorries. It comes as a leaked police memo revealed French authorities are ‘alarmed’ by the soaring number of migrants arriving in the country. Giving them food: A spokesman for aid group Secours Catholique in Calais, said there is 'lots more tension' at the camp at the moment . Shaving in the open: Mayor Mignonet has blamed in part a Franco-British cooperation accord that he says puts the brunt of the burden on Calais . Awful conditions: A woman sits with food and drink provisions (left), while men get water at the camp site in Calais (right) Flooded area: Bottles were left on a concrete slab next to a source of water at the camp . Rising figures: In the first six months of last year 7,913 migrants arrived in Italy, and the number was 4,301 in 2012 . Working together: The migrants want outsmart scanners, CO2 detectors and other technology used on trucks and planted through the Channel Tunnel . Most have made their way from Italy after escaping East Africa. Some 61,591 migrants landed in Italy in the first six months of this year. The trouble in the camp has been rumbling on since last Sunday night after groups of the young men clashed at a soup kitchen for supplies. While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town.","No running water, clashes at soup kitchens for supplies and accommodation in form of hole-ridden tents .

"By . Rachel Rickard Straus . To the untrained eye, this property may look like a garage. But according to estate agent Winkworth, it’s a ‘one-bedroom studio’ – and it’s on the market for £250,000. The former garage in Highgate in north London is going for same price as a six-bedroom detached house in Barnsley or a four-bedroom villa with pool in Alicante. Des res: The former garage is nestled in North London's Highgate Village . It boasts a kitchenette – which appears . to be a sink and hob atop a small fridge and one cupboard – as well as a . small bathroom. The property, which measures 224sq ft is also available to rent at £300 a week and can be used as an office. Winkworth estate agents said that the owner does not want any publicity for the property and has removed the listing 'in order to clarify and make clear of the usage rights', a spokesman said. For those still unconvinced that London is on its way to a property bubble, a converted garage is arguably a tell-tale sign. it is situated in a mews off Highgate High Street, where just down the road a six bedroom house will set you back £25million. Light and airy: The room has been fitted out with a little window and skylights . In another strong sign that the property . market is strengthening, new research released today revealed that the . number of properties available for sale that have been discounted has . fallen sharply over the past 12 months. The proportion of properties on the market with an asking price that has been reduced at least once has fallen from 37 per cent last year to 32 per cent today, according to research from Zoopla. Buyers are even less likely to bag a discount in London. The capital continues to have the lowest proportion of discounted properties on the market with less than a quarter (22.8 per cent) seeing their asking price reduced once they are listed for sale. Meanwhile properties in Barnsley are most likely to be reduced – 42.7 per cent are currently on sale for lower than their original price. Conversion: The space has been fitted out with a shower and toilet . The average asking price of a home in England and Wales has jumped by around £20,000 since the beginning of the year, a report revealed yesterday. A typical home advertised for sale in an estate agent’s window now has a price tag of £250,000. The sharp increase comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble. At the beginning of January the average . asking price was £228,989. Today it is £249,199, a jump of £20,210, . according to the report from Rightmove. In London, the affordability crisis . facing anybody wanting to get onto the housing ladder, or move to a . larger home, is even more acute. On the market: For the same price you could buy this six-bedroom detached house in Barnsley . Or this...: This four-bedroom villa with pool in Alicante, Spain, costs just over five grand more at £255,673 . The average asking price in London hit £501,067 this month, compared to £454,875 in the same month last year, according to Rightmove. The garage-turned-home may be expensive but it's cheaper than a Hyde Park parking space. A parking space was put on the market two weeks ago for a record-breaking £300,000 - almost twice the price of the average UK home. The spot in London's exclusive Hyde Park Gardens measures just 11ft x 12ft, but its price tag is almost double the £162,000 paid for the average house sold in England and Wales last month. Estate agents Kay & Co, who last year sold two nearby parking spaces for £250,000 each, said several people had already expressed an interest in snapping up the six-figure spot. The agent said parking spaces are in hot demand in Hyde Park Gardens, where houses cost up to £15million. Its buyer will be paying £1,299 per square foot for the privilege of owning a central space in Westminster.","Former garage costs the same as a six-bedroom detached house in Barnsley .

"By . Tamara Cohen for Daily Mail . Thousands of migrants working in the UK as cleaners, labourers or bar staff would have to pay tax for the first time, under Treasury proposals. All those who work in the UK currently receive the first £10,000 of their income tax-free, which has meant the lowest earners pay no tax at all. But under plans drawn up by George Osborne’s department, migrant workers who are not full-time residents in this country would be stripped of this ‘generous’ allowance and pay 20 per cent tax on all of their income. Scroll down for video . No perks? New proposals would strip migrants of the perk that gives all workers their first £10,000 tax-free . The Treasury say that this brings the UK into line with other European countries such as Germany and Holland, and the US and Canada which also offer income tax perks only to residents. The policy could save the Exchequer £400million a year, and is expected to put some migrants off coming to the UK. There are up to 250,000 European migrants working temporarily in this country, and the rule would apply only to those who live here for less than six months a year. But some 175,000 British expatriates who have an income from homes they rent out in the UK would also lose their tax-free allowance under the plans. It would also affect some 100,000 high-earning international professionals who spend part of the year working in Britain – but they would be able to claim a tax credit in their home country. Tightening: George Osborne claims the measures will bring the UK in line with Germany, Holland, the US and Canada, which only offer perks to residents . The consultation says that there is a case for migrants on very low incomes to be allowed a tax-free sum, but that a threshold would be very difficult to implement and would create a ‘cliff edge’ beyond which tax would suddenly increase significantly. Tax experts said the move would also create more administration for employers of temporary migrants as they are likely to have to place them on the payroll for the first time. The plans to deny the personal allowance to people who are non-resident for tax purposes were first revealed in the Chancellor’s Budget in March, but more details of the options were released yesterday. It follows a series of comments from David Cameron about the need to clamp down on benefits for migrants. Under plans announced last month, migrants will not be entitled to claim Jobseeker’s Allowance until they have made six months of national insurance contributions – up from three months currently. At present, an EU migrant in Britain temporarily working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage would earn £6,760 in six months, and keep it all under the personal tax allowance. Withdrawing the personal allowance, and imposing tax at 20 per cent would cut those earnings by £1,352. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The increases the government has made to the personal allowance support hardworking people by helping them to keep more of the money they earn and, as a result, is one of the most generous in the world. ‘At the same time, we believe that it is reasonable to consider whether non-residents who receive income from the UK are paying a fair share of tax on that income, in this country. ‘The Government is seeking views on whether it would be appropriate to restrict the personal allowance to those resident in the UK, or people who have most of their economic connections in the UK, as is the case in many other countries including most of the European Union.’","All UK workers currently receive first £10,000 of their income tax-free .

"By . James  Nye . and Reuters Reporter . Never before seen video has been released by the Attorney General's office that shows Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev smirking with his friend the day after the deadly attacks. The FBI testified that the surveillance video of a smiling and laughing Tsarnaev is from his dormitory at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on April 16, 2013, - one day after three people died and 264 others were injured at the marathon finishing line. The video was released on the last day of the trial of Tsarnaev's friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, who is accused of  removing a backpack containing altered fireworks from Tsarnaev's dorm room several days after the devastating bombings. Not so serious: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walks along the corridor in his dormitory laughing and joking with his friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, the day after the April, 2013, Boston Bombings . The prosecution rested their case after FBI agent John Walker gave his testimony, of which the video was an integral part. The defense also rested without calling Tazhayakov to the stand and US District Judge Douglas Woodlock told the jurors that this was irrelevant. He said they still had to decide whether the government had met the necessary burden of proof. Azamat Tazhayakov is the first of three friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to face trial on charges of interfering with the investigation into the blasts by removing a laptop and the backpack, which contained empty fireworks casings, from Tsarnaev's room three days after the April 15, 2013, attacks that killed three people and injured 264. FBI Special Agent John Walker interviewed Tazhayakov, his roommate and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev and a woman described as Kadyrbayev's girlfriend in the days after the attacks, at one point recovering a baseball cap and ash tray taken from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. On April 20, the second day of interviewing the friends, Walker told the pair that the FBI was trying to find the backpack. 'They told me simultaneously that the backpack had been placed in the dumpster and that a refuse truck had removed the dumpster from the location the previous day,' he said. Watch Video Here: . Relaxed: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his friend Azamat Tazhayakov come to the gym attached to the dormitory at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on April 16 - one day after three people died and 264 others were injured at the marathon finishing line . Walker acknowledged that Tazhayakov had not said that he had thrown the backpack into the dumpster, and that it was Kadyrbayev who described the dumpster and its location on the grounds of the apartment complex in New Bedford, Massachusetts, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Boston. Other FBI agents recovered the backpack at a landfill several days later. It contained fireworks with the gunpowder removed, a spiral notebook, a jar of Vaseline - which an FBI forensic examiner has testified can be used to make an explosive device - and a homework assignment from an ethics class in which Tsarnaev was enrolled. Prosecutors rested their case following Walker's testimony on Monday, the defense presented no witnesses and U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock set closing arguments for Wednesday. FBI agent Farbod Azad testified last week that Tazhayakov told him he and Kadyrbayev and a third man, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, had removed the backpack and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room. Friends: Azamat Tazhayakov and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pictured here in a photo prior to April 2013 . Exit: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his friend Azamat Tazhayakov leave the gym on April 16 - one day after the Boston bombings . Deadly: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race in this photo taken as the second of two devices detonated on April 15, 2013 . Tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injured more than 260. His trial is scheduled for November . Tazhayakov's attorneys say their client never touched the backpack or the fireworks, and that it was Kadyrbayev who threw them out. Kadyrbayev's girlfriend, Bayan Kumiskali, said in a videotaped deposition shown in court that she became upset when she learned of the backpack and asked her boyfriend to 'get it out of the apartment.' The attorneys argued before the trial that Tazhayakov's statements during an initial FBI interview, which began April 19 and ran into the next morning, should not be admitted at trial because he had not believed he was free to go at the time. Tazhayakov could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. Kadyrbayev faces the same charges. Phillipos is accused of the lesser charge of lying to investigators. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on terrorism charges.","Video released on the final day of testimony in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friend .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . UKIP leader attended a dinner hosted by Elton John . Nigel Farage has been rebuffed by music star Sir Elton John after hinting that he could publicly back UKIP. The UKIP leader yesterday revealed he had been invited to a dinner party thrown at the pop star’s home. Mr Farage claimed the pair had ‘got on very well indeed’ and had chatted about politics. Speaking about the dinner, Mr Farage yesterday said: ‘Maybe I’ve got a big announcement to make. You never know.’ But a spokesman for the singer dismissed the suggestion that inviting Mr Farage for dinner meant Sir Elton would be supporting UKIP. The spokesman told Pink News: ‘Elton will not be favouring any party.’ Mr Farage attended Sir Elton’s house as a guest of Lord Black of Crossharbour, the former media baron who served three years in a US jail for fraud. The UKIP leader said that he had been invited by Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish to a dinner six or seven weeks ago. Speaking to the internet radio station Fubar, he said: ‘It was a private dinner but, yeah, we talked about politics and current affairs and these things. I got on very well with Elton John indeed.’ He added: ‘He really truly understands — as a guy that comes from an ordinary background — that the gap between rich and poor is getting wider and wider and that lots of working-class lads are not being given the chance these days to achieve their best.’ Asked if the star understood ‘the European question’, Mr Farage said: ‘Oh, I don’t want to speak for him but I think that . . . he’s no idiot. He knows what’s going on in the world.’ Later in the interview, Mr Farage accepted it was unlikely the singer was about to become a UKIP member. He said: ‘No. This speculation often runs away with itself. ‘But I tell you what — he does host a very good dinner. The food was magnificent and the wine — the wine! — the wine, it was even better.’ Mr Farage hinted that Sir Elton might be considering supporting UKIP. But a spokesman for the singer-songwriter dismissed the suggestion . In 2008 Sir Elton and Mr Furnish each donated £10,000 to the Liberal Democrats to support Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, to become London mayor. He has also revealed that Gordon Brown is a friend but would not say whether he would vote Labour.","Singer-songwriter hosted a dinner attended by the UKIP leader .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . House prices surged by 10.2 per cent over the last year to reach a new all-time high of £265,000, official figures show. Property values in London have continued to increase around twice as quickly as those across the UK, with the capital seeing a 19.3 per cent jump in prices in the 12 months to June, according to the data released by the Office for National Statistics. The average house price in London is now just shy of half a million pounds, at £499,000, and the ONS said that ‘house prices are increasing strongly across most parts of the UK’. Scroll down for video . House prices grew faster in London than anywhere else  over the 12 months to June, the ONS found . UK house prices outside London and the South East increased by 6.3% in the 12 months to June and stand at £201,000 on average . The report reveals that a typical first-time buyer faces paying 12 per cent more for their starter home than they did a year ago – the highest annual increase seen since April 2010. In June, which is the most recent month for which the figures are available, the average price paid for a house by a first-time buyer was £204,000. On a month-on-month basis, house prices in general increased across the UK by 0.5 per cent between May and June. London and the South East are continuing to record the strongest annual price uplifts, and the ONS said that if these regions were taken out of the figures, UK house prices would have increased at a slower pace of 6.3 per cent in the 12 months to June and they would stand at £201,000 on average. However, all regions have seen house price growth over the last year. The North East remains the English region with the lowest average house prices, at around £150,000. However, prices in the North East have lifted by 4.4 per cent over the last year. Wales has seen the smallest annual price growth out of all the UK nations and regions, with a 3.5 per cent year-on-year increase taking average prices there to £167,000. In Scotland, property values have grown by 6 per cent annually, pushing the average house price there to £193,000. Northern Ireland, which saw some sharp falls in property values in the wake of the financial crisis, has seen prices lift by 4.9 per cent over the last year, taking them to £137,000 typically. Property values in England have risen at a faster rate than the UK average, with a 10.7 per cent annual increase pushing the average price to £276,000. First time buyers are having to find record amounts of money to get on the housing ladder . England remains the only UK country where property prices are higher than their pre-financial crisis peak, now standing at 10 per cent above their previous high seen in 2008. Prices in Northern Ireland are around 47 per cent below their previous peak, while those in Wales are sitting around 3 per cent below their previous peak levels. Values in Scotland are the closest to touching their previous peak, currently standing at 1.6 per cent below their previous high in 2008. Campbell Robb, chief executive for housing charity Shelter, said: ‘Today’s house price hike is yet another blow for people across the country desperate to put down roots and create a stable home. ‘No matter how hard people work or save, millions are being priced out of a home of their own, caught in the ‘rent trap’ and constantly moving from one expensive property to the next.’ The continued strong growth in house prices was reported as commuters learned that they face a 3.5 per cent increase in rail fares next year after official inflation figures used to calculate the rise were published. The new-year rises are based on the previous July’s rate of Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation plus 1 per cent. Some other recent studies which point to how trends are likely to develop in the housing market in the coming months have suggested that the London housing market is now starting to rapidly cool off. Experts have suggested this is probably due to the impact of consumers growing more cautious amid speculation over when interest rates are likely to rise, which will mean borrowers face higher costs, as well as stricter mortgage lending rules which came into force at the end of April. The new Mortgage Market Review (MMR) rules force lenders to ask borrowers for more detail about their spending habits, to check that they can truly afford their home loan. They also have to apply ‘stress tests’ to make sure that the borrower could still afford their repayments as and when interest rates increase. The Bank of England also expects the pace of house price inflation to slow in the coming months. Earlier this month, the Bank predicted that house price growth is forecast to halve by next spring, which could mean that prices across the UK increase at a more moderate pace of around 6 per cent across next year. But the Bank couched the predictions in cautious terms, saying: ‘There is more uncertainty about the path for the housing market in the near term than three months ago.’","Office for National Statistics released new house price inflation figures today .

"By . Simon Murphy And Nick Craven . It was supposed to be a present, albeit one of a rather surprising nature. But a massage Jemima Khan and her boyfriend Russell Brand booked to celebrate the comedian's birthday has resulted in a complaint to the police and an ongoing legal dispute. The celebrity couple are now pursuing legal action against the masseuse Szilvia Berki, accusing her of making a number of false allegations. Scroll down for video . Celebrity couple Jemima Khan and Russell Brand, left, are pursuing legal action against masseuse Szilvia Berki, right, accusing her of making a number of false allegations. Ms Berki is now said to be accusing the police of corruption and hacking her phone . She is said to be accusing the police of corruption and hacking her phone. She also claims she has been the subject of a cyber attack. The drama began in June this year when, according to Ms Berki, a 31-year-old Hungarian-born masseuse, Ms Khan contacted her via text and email, to see if she could provide a massage at her £15million Oxfordshire home, Kiddington Hall. Ms Berki, a former researcher, had set up her massage business only a couple of months previously and advertised on a number of different websites, including the beauty directory Wahanda and the classified ads site Gumtree. She also set up her own, somewhat amateur, homepage on the internet in which she describes herself as 'a fullfigured, curvy BBW [Big Beautiful Woman] lady in my late 20ies. I am a qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance.' There is no suggestion that Ms Khan was ordering anything other than a standard massage. The Mail on Sunday has chosen not to disclose further details published on the site. Ms Berki, who is based in Wimbledon, West London, says Ms Khan, 40, agreed to send a car to drive her 70 miles to Oxfordshire on Saturday June 7, three days after Brand's birthday. According to Ms Berki they agreed a fee of £500. The original story has been widely reported in the Daily Telegraph and re-published on media websites. But last night Ms Berki said: 'I have never had this before – that someone has sent me a driver. To be honest, this was something very special. A fee for a massage is not £500, obviously. But we calculated about four hours' travel time and two hours' massage which is like six hours and then it was a Saturday as well. Lavish: Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, where the alleged incident is said to have taken place . '[My normal rate] is £70, £80, £90, £100, it depends really if it is like an aromatic [sic. aromatherapy] massage or I also do Thai yoga massage. So it depends really how long it is and what kind of massage... if I use aromatic oils it costs more. It depends. 'For Thai yoga massage you have to be fully dressed, you even have to wear your socks because that is how it's done, while for other massages it's different. A massage – at least in my opinion – it's sensual. 'But then people call up and they say, ""I want to have a full service, I want to have a happy ending, I want to have this and that."" And this is usually when I hang up the phone on that client.' Ms Berki says that when she arrived at the 17th Century Oxfordshire mansion, Ms Khan came out to greet her. She said: 'She came to the car. She was wearing a summer dress, white, with some kind of colour on it. She asked me if I was German because of my accent. She was really very nice, very, very nice.' However, according to Ms Berki, the atmosphere soured and she was asked to leave. Although £500 was paid into her bank account the following Monday, she was so unhappy about the treatment she claims was meted out to her, she went to her local police station the following Saturday and made a complaint. Ms Berki told officers she was pushed by Mr Brand and was left terrified after Ms Khan's white German Shepherd jumped at her. The driver then took Ms Berki home and Ms Khan later emailed to apologise for any misunderstanding. The matter was passed on to Thames Valley Police, which launched an investigation. Five weeks later, on July 25, the Thames Valley force contacted Ms Berki to say it was not pursuing the case because there was no independent or forensic evidence. They said: 'Thames Valley Police can confirm that it has concluded an investigation referred to us by the Metropolitan Police Service regarding an alleged assault at an address near Woodstock on June 7. A photo posted on Hungarian-born Szilvia Berki's Gumtree advert . 'The investigation into this matter concluded on July 25 and no further action will be taken in relation to this incident.' Lawyers representing Russell Brand and Jemima Khan have denied all Ms Berki's allegations. There was no physical contact whatsoever, they say, and Mr Brand simply asked her to leave. However, Ms Berki is so incensed by the police decision to drop the case she has since lodged a complaint over the way the matter was handled. There have been suggestions that Ms Berki's reliability has been under question. Ms Berki said: 'They told me last week, on Friday. I had a little nervous breakdown. 'I sent a lot of emails to various people asking for help [including her local MP, Zac Goldsmith, who is Jemima's brother]. 'There is CCTV evidence showing that the dog attacked me. 'They told me that I looked relaxed and that it was a friendly dog and this is not what the legislation says is a dangerous dog. 'The policeman said this was not an attack as he jumped on me in a friendly way. How can an animal, a big dog, jump on me in a friendly way? I was very distressed [after what had happened].' Thames Valley Police are now in the process of reviewing the initial investigation. Meanwhile, lawyers acting on behalf of the celebrity couple warned Ms Berki that they may take legal action if she repeated her 'false and defamatory allegations'. She, however, remains defiant and says she is considering pursuing a civil action against the celebrity couple. A message posted on Szilvia Berki's website describing her as being a 'qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance' She said: 'I have the right to speak about it. They admitted they can't stop me talking to the police.' Mr Brand was a rather startling choice of partner for Ms Khan, the socialite daughter of the billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith who has two children by her former husband, the Pakistani cricketer and politician, Imran Khan. News of the couple's relationship emerged in September 2013 when they were spotted strolling arm in arm around New York's East Village. Brand has also formed a strong bond with Jemima's dog, a white German Shepherd named Brian, and has frequently been seen walking him. The comedian even took Brian along to a Comic Relief press conference and an interview for The Jonathan Ross Show, where he invited the dog to sit alongside him on the sofa. Known for his edgy and often ripe humour, Russell Brand has enjoyed a successful career as a stand-up comedian, actor and writer. Much of his material is influenced by his own difficult experiences, including battles with drug and sex addiction. While he landed a few TV roles in the 1990s, his made his mark in stand-up comedy. He competed for New Act of the Year at the Hackney Empire in 2000 and soon got a job on MTV as a presenter, but was fired the following year after coming to work dressed as Osama Bin Laden on the day after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 'Put bluntly, it was a very stupid thing to do and I put it under what I call the ""drug-brella"" – stuff I did while on drugs,' Brand later said. He was soon picked up by other networks, including Channel 4 and the BBC, from which he resigned in 2008 after leaving crass voicemail messages along with Jonathan Ross for veteran actor Andrew Sachs concerning his granddaughter. In 2010 he married US pop star Katy Perry, but ended the marriage 14 months later. In her autobiography, she said Brand never spoke to her again after sending her a text message initiating the divorce. Brand joked in his stage act that being in a monogamous relationship with Perry was little better than being a monk because he was unable to have sex with other women.","Massage Jemima Khan and Russell Brand booked has resulted in complaint to police and ongoing legal dispute .

"By . Scott Jones . Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had a blazing row with their former Rolling Stones bandmate Brian Jones on the day he died, culminating in Richards drawing a knife, according to an extraordinary claim made to police. In a bizarre twist in the mystery, The Mail on Sunday has seen documents in which the daughter of the man now thought to have been involved in Jones’s death claims that the Stones’ former guitarist was confronted at his East Sussex home by Jagger and Richards over who owned the rights to the group’s name. Still going: The Rolling Stones on stage on Saturday night in London but a mystery still remains over the death of their former guitarist Brian Jones . Back again: This was the first time the Rolling Stones played Hyde Park since their concert 44 years ago, two days after Brian Jones was found dead . Hours later Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. The unsubstantiated claims, contained in an internal police report, were dismissed by officers, but will add further fuel to the conspiracy theories that surround Jones’s death in 1969 and question whether he really did drown under the influence of drink and drugs. The allegation comes after the Stones played in front of 65,000 fans at London’s Hyde Park last night, re-enacting the emotive tribute they gave for Jones at the same venue 44 years ago. Last night’s concert was the first time the Stones have played at the park since their requiem for Jones two days after he was found dead. The source of the claim is Jan Bell, the daughter of Frank Thorogood, Jones’s builder-cum-minder who was present at Jones’s farm on the night of his death. Thorogood died in 1993. A year later, it was claimed that he had murdered Jones. Sussex Police appealed on TV for information and Bell telephoned them about the alleged incident. Bandmates: Keith Richards with Brian Jones in 1967, two years before Brian's death . Her father told her that he intervened in the row between Jones and Richards, she claimed. Titled ‘Briefing Note: Death of Brian Jones’, the police report states: ‘She said that her father had told her a number of years ago that on the day of Brian’s death, Messrs Mick JAGGER and Keith RICHARDS visited Brian JONES at the farm in the morning and her father was present when Brian was asked by both men whether he would give up the name of the “Rolling Stones” to them and agree to a financial settlement. ‘Brian apparently declined to do  so and it is alleged that Keith RICHARDS drew a knife. It is suggested that THOROGOOD calmed them down and both JAGGER and RICHARDS left the house.’Brian Jones started and named The Rolling Stones in 1962. Last night, a Rolling Stones spokesman declined to comment on the claim. After the report was written, no further action was taken because a senior officer in Sussex Police intervened to block standard investigating procedures, it is alleged. The Mail on Sunday has traced  the police officer who interviewed Jan Bell. The officer, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I arranged to meet lawyers representing Mick Jagger and Keith Richards – two firms, one in New York and one in Los Angeles – to talk specifically about Jan Bell’s statement to Sussex Police, about them being at the house on the day of the death and about the knife being drawn. Death: Cotchford Farm in Sussex where Brian Jones died in the swimming pool . ‘But the Assistant Chief Constable intervened and blocked me from meeting the Stones’ lawyers. The ACC drew a line under it. The statements made to Sussex Police by Jan Bell should have led to what the police call standard “trace and eliminate” work – to prove or disprove any information the police have been given, and to work out if something did or did not take place. ‘But I was told to put details of Jan Bell’s interview into a report, and that was it.’ The astounding allegation is the most startling piece of material that The Mail on Sunday has uncovered about Brian Jones’s death. However, our enquiries have also brought to light further claims about what one band member may privately have suspected about it.

The Mail on Sunday has ascertained that as far back as the 1980s, Richards was aware of suspicions that Frank Thorogood killed Jones, and that Tom Keylock, a Stones manager, had led a cover-up. Robert Greenfield, an American author and a former editor of Rolling Stone magazine, lived with  Richards in the South of France in May 1971, during the recording of the Stones’ album Exile On Main Street. Greenfield recorded hours of conversations with Richards during this period, which reveal that the guitarist was aware of the alleged cover-up that Keylock – who Richards called Mr Get-It-Together – put in place. Richards told Greenfield about the aftermath of Jones’s death: ‘I wanted to know who was there and couldn’t find out. The only cat I could ask was the one I think got rid of everybody and did the whole disappearing trick so when the cops arrived, it was just an accident. 'Maybe it was. Maybe the cat just wanted to get everyone out of the way so it wasn’t all names involved, etc. Maybe he did the right thing, but I don’t know. I don’t even know who was there that night, and trying to find out is impossible.’ There is also new evidence that in the 1980s Richards was aware of Thorogood’s alleged involvement in Jones’s death, via Patrick Townshend, a former business partner of Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman.

"By . Harry Slavin . Crystal Palace will be in safe hands at the weekend when Keith Millen takes the helm once more. Palace failed this week in their bid to replace Tony Pulis but have a reliable stop-gap in the 47-year-old, whose caretaker managerial experience shows a proven track record in a notoriously tricky role – helping Bristol City preserve Championship status in 2010 and aiding the Selhurst Park revival last term. Malky Mackay had looked poised to take over at Palace but is now out of the running for the job following Sportsmail's revelations about the Scot and Iain Moody being accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic text messages during their time together at Cardiff. I'm your man: Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen (left) and chief Steve Parish (right) Promising signs: Millen took charge of the narrow defeat by Arsenal on the opening day of the season . Millen took charge of the Eagles’ first match of the season as they went down fighting at the Emirates Stadium, Aaron Ramsey’s late goal securing a last-gasp 2-1 win for Arsenal. And he’ll be continuing his fourth stint as an interim replacement in English football when he takes charge against West Ham on Saturday. BRISTOL CITY . 2005 .

Millen first took on the role while he was assistant boss at Bristol City in 2005, after player-manager Brian Tinnion left the club, drawing and losing his two games before Gary Johnson was appointed. Johnson led the club to promotion from League One to the Championship but it was left to Millen to save the club’s second-tier status when the manager left by mutual consent in 2010. A draw against league leaders Newcastle in his first game impressed and five wins from their final nine games steered the Robins to safety. Millen was awarded the role permanently at Ashton Gate after Steve Coppell left the role after just four months in charge at the beginning of the 2010-11 season. He led City to a 15th place finish in the table and picked up his first manager of the month award after three wins in five in November. However he left his position the following season after a poor start, which culminated in a 5-0 thrashing at Blackpool, before joining the Eagles as assistant in November 2012. And he found himself back in the temporary hotseat last season after Ian Holloway’s departure, taking charge of four games, including a 0-0 draw at home to Everton and a 1-0 victory at Hull.

"By . James Rush . The carer of a severely disabled man was captured on film stealing money from him after his suspicious father hid in a bedroom cupboard with a video camera. Brendan Mudd and partner Mandy Holden, both 46, feared carer Kayleigh Spinks, 22, was stealing disability allowance meant for their son Joe Ware, 21, who has severe cerebral palsy. The couple hatched a plan to catch the crook who stole money from drawers in their home, in Maidstone, Kent, which was being saved to buy a van to help transport Joe. Mr Ware's parents today slammed Spinks as 'disgusting'. Scroll down for video . Red handed: Spinks is captured on camera as she looks under the bed wearing surgical gloves . Accused: Spinks can be heard denying stealing £1,000 as Mr Mudd accuses her of taking the money . Mr Mudd hid among the clothes in his bedroom cupboard after Mandy went to work and calmly waited for 30 minutes before he secretly filmed Spinks come into the room. The shocked dad peeked through a gap in the wardrobe curtains and saw the carer take cash from under his bed - wearing medical gloves so she left no finger prints. He then jumped out of the cupboard, still filming, and demanded Spinks explain what she was up to. The whole confrontation was caught on . camera with Mr Mudd demanding 'What are you doing?' as red faced Spinks . immediately apologised and confessed to stealing £100. Mr Mudd called police and Spinks, a carer from Maidstone, Kent, was arrested and taken for questioning. Spinks . admitted two counts of theft at Maidstone Magistrates' Court last month . and has now been ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work and pay £250 . compensation. On . the day of the sting on September 13, Mr Ware's mother carried out her . usual routine of letting Spinks into the house and leaving her to care . for Joe. Mr Mudd said: 'As . soon as Mandy left I heard Kayleigh go outside to her car - I think to . get the gloves - and then come back inside. 'I . heard this pitter patter of footsteps as she came up the stairs and . then she came straight into the bedroom and headed for my bedside . cabinet. 'The wardrobe is material fronted and . through a little crack in the curtain I was able to film everything. 'I'd been crouched down in the wardrobe for about 20 minutes and was . already really uncomfortable, but I had to stay quiet. 'She . passed eight inches in front of me and went straight for the bedside . cabinet. I waited for her to start rifling through and then I jumped out . and said: ""I've caught you!"" She started saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, . I'm sorry"". 'I said to . her ""You've been taking money from us!"" and she said ""I'm sorry, I only . took £100 out of the cupboard"". Of course I was still recording and it . was all on tape.' Captured: Mr Mudd contacted police before Spinks was arrested and taken for questioning . Spinks was convicted for stealing £100. The couple has said a total of £1,000 has gone missing from their home. Mr Mudd said: 'I feel violated in my own home. To put trust in people and for them to blatantly steal from you is disgusting.' Mother Ms Holden . said: 'I was going to leave her a note where the money was saying ""I . know what you are doing"" but I was worried that she would run off and . leave Joe on his own. 'That is when we came up with the idea of Brendan hiding in the cupboard. 'Brendan said as soon as I had driven . off in my car she was upstairs. She had her medical gloves on so she . didn't leave any finger prints. Guilty: Spinks admitted two counts of theft to magistrates and was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work and to pay £250 compensation . 'I never thought a carer would steal from someone so vulnerable. We got on really well, I thought she was a nice girl. I even offered her Joe's old TV when I was getting him a new one. 'I . have to really trust the carers to come into my house and look after . Joe, so I am finding it really hard to trust again after she abused it. Even now I'm angered by the thought of someone going through my stuff.' Spinks, who has a young daughter, was employed by Allied . Healthcare to feed and look after Joe three times a week while the . couple were at work. After she was caught and charged by police Spinks admitted to stealing just £100 in front of Magistrates. Mr . Mudd said: 'The police couldn't believe what I'd done.

"By . Melissa Kite for the Daily Mail . When my boyfriend shook me awake in the middle of the night, shouting inches from my face, it took me several minutes to work out why he was so livid. Apparently, I had been making little noises in my sleep, and doing so deliberately just to annoy him. Toxic relationship: Melissa Kite was emotionally abused by her ex-boyfriend for three years . It was something of a change to his behaviour earlier that evening, when he’d refused to speak so much as a word to me. I had no idea why, but then, there was often no perceptible trigger behind his terrifying mood swings. Although there was always just one person at fault: me. Often it would be just the way I looked at him. This could lead to being pushed into a chair and drilled, finger-wagging, for hours about my disrespect. Sometimes it was the things that I said which were ‘wrong’, leading him to explode with devastating insults. This behaviour, which lasted throughout our three-year relationship, wasn’t just cruel and demeaning. It shattered my self-esteem. It could easily have destroyed my life. So you might expect me to welcome the proposals unveiled yesterday to make emotional abuse illegal. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to create a specific offence of domestic abuse that will mean men can be prosecuted not just for violence against their partners, but also for any psychological torment they inflict. But, far from being enthused by the plans, they fill me with panic. For while I agree with campaigners that emotional cruelty can be every bit as frightening and destructive as physical attacks, I think criminalising such behaviour could have devastating consequences for all involved. I would certainly hate for my ex-boyfriend to have been prosecuted for what he did. Not just because of the terrible toll this would have taken on him — reputational damage, job loss, distress, and the inevitable rise in his anger — but also for the way it would have changed me. I don’t think I would have been able to recover from the justice system intervening in my personal life. In the end, I recovered from the experience because I took control and left that destructive situation myself. I first met my former boyfriend, a high-flying City boy, through friends eight years ago, when we were both in our mid-30s. He was smart, extremely charming and I fell for him instantly. At first he seemed the model boyfriend; even when I noticed his wardrobe held identical sets of shoes, suits and ties arranged meticulously in colour order, I just thought him well organised. I never imagined how extreme such perfectionism could become. Scroll down for video . The truth emerged on our first holiday, just weeks into our relationship, when he whisked me off to Provence. One evening, out of the blue, he yelled at me for getting out of the car first and told me to ‘come back here’. When I went inside he ranted that I was never to walk ahead of him again — always alongside or behind. Of course I packed my bags, disgusted, but he begged me to forgive him — so I did. This was to set the pattern for endless similar incidents that followed. His control over me only grew: he made me line up my shoes, checked my text messages to make sure I wasn’t having an affair, and threw me out of his house one night because my mobile rang while we were in bed. 'Non-violent crime': Theresa May wants psychological torment to be classed as a crime . The many incidents of bullying, intimidation and brainwashing are too numerous to list, but he wanted to control every aspect of my life — right down to the clothes I wore — and flew into terrifying rages whenever I went against his will. It was a living hell having to walk on eggshells all the time and the stress changed me beyond recognition. I went from being a confident, independent, feisty woman to someone who made myself small to please him and who, yes, eventually walked meekly alongside or behind, often in flat shoes. I lost over a stone, became incredibly nervous, and isolated myself from my family and friends because I couldn’t face the shame when they told me to leave him only for me to tell them I couldn’t. Of course, I contemplated leaving, but I was convinced I was head over heels in love and would never be able to survive without him. I also considered calling the police on occasion — usually after a particularly long and vicious verbal attack — but felt he had done nothing criminally wrong. He never laid a finger on me, except to manhandle me into a chair to lecture me, and he once accidentally threw a phone at my head. He’d got into such a frenzy about me putting a Britney Spears CD on that he let the phone slip as he gesticulated, although he wasn’t sorry when it hit me. Oh, and he once put his hands around my throat and mock throttled me because, he said, he wanted to demonstrate what he would do to anyone who ever threatened us. But on the whole — and victim groups may disagree — I never felt he crossed the line into illegality. I felt that what was going on was a toxic mess partly of my own making. And that meant taking responsibility for the relationship, and ending it myself. Not calling the police, although I was tempted at times, but empowering myself through leaving of my own volition. That is the essence of why I believe the police must not be dragged into emotional abuse: giving over control of your private life, effectively, to an institution takes you even further out of the driving seat. 38 per cent of domestic abuse victims are men, according to the ManKind initiative chairty . Women need to take back control not give it away again. Of course, this is desperately hard. Time and again I tried to leave my ex, then agreed to take him back — and I was extremely lucky we never managed to get married. But eventually, I did tell him that I would not put up with his nonsense any more. Then I put the phone down and ignored the torrent of calls and voicemails demanding that we talk. By standing by my decision, my self-esteem grew back. If the police had been involved, I do not believe I would have felt so strong or proud of my ability to help myself. Admittedly I had counselling, which gave me the confidence to deal with the break-up. It is here that I believe institutions can help, by increasing the support available to women in difficult relationships. If I had simply had him arrested for ‘emotional abuse’, I would have learned nothing and walked straight into the arms of another man with the same personality traits. Back in the driving seat: Melissa says those who suffer should take personal responsibility . And there are many, many more men out there who behave this way. Proponents of these new proposals might think a law change would stop them, but it would do the opposite. It would alienate these men further, given that such behaviour already stems from the emasculation they feel. I’ve often wondered if my ex felt threatened by my career and independence, which is why he set out to diminish and control me. Bringing in laws that govern what men can and can’t say to their wives and girlfriends in their own homes will only further aggravate the feeling that they have no power. On an individual level, too, prosecuting a man will bring him life-long problems that will only make his relationship with the opposite sex even worse. I shudder to think how a jail sentence would have impacted upon my ex. With the loss of job and dignity, I fear it would have pushed him over the edge into goodness knows what behaviour. Add to that the fact that it is impossible to define what constitutes ‘emotional abuse’, and there is far too big a grey area here. Such a law would be wide open to being exploited by women who want to punish their partners. Surely it could lead to terrible miscarriages of justice if, in the heat of a row, a woman — or man — could pick up the phone in spite and involve the police. I believe we have the legislation right already, with domestic abuse referring to physical violence and usually prosecuted under charges such as assault or battery. Extreme, threatening and intimidating behaviour can be covered by stalking and harassment laws. Those who suffer, what Theresa May calls ‘non-violent harm’ would be better to take personal responsibility for their situation rather than seek help from the State. Not only for their own good, but because this new offence would only create more victims.","Home Secretary Theresa May wants to create a specific offence of domestic abuse that criminalises psychological torment .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . For so long, it looked like Rangers were sleepwalking into the eye of a storm on Friday night. With the clock ticking down at Westfield, Ally McCoist’s team were staring at the nightmare prospect of being potentially five points off the pace after just two league fixtures. Just when the team looked like stumbling again, however, young talent Lewis Macleod provided a late intervention that again proved the old adage that it’s better to be lucky than good. At the end of another desperately poor performance, the 20-year-old’s deflected strike off Alan Maybury 12 minutes from time unlocked a home defence that had been untroubled all evening. Main men: Goal scorers Nicky Law and Lewis MacLeod celebrate their 2-0 win over Falkirk . First blood: Lewis MacLeod put Rangers ahead after scoring the opening goal . Twice as nice: Nicky Clark doubled Rangers' lead with a late goal at Falkirk Stadium . Falkirk: MacDonald, Maybury, Vaulks, McCracken, Dick, Durojaiye (Bia Bi 69), Taiwo, Alston, Cooper (Sibbald 82), McGrandles, Loy. Subs Not Used: Peter Grant, Bowman, Leahy, Shepherd, McGeever. Booked: Maybury, McCracken, Taiwo. Rangers: Bell, McGregor, Zaliukas, Mohsni, Wallace, McCulloch, Boyd, Macleod, Law, Templeton (Aird 68), Miller (Clark 56). Subs Not Used: Smith, Faure, Hutton, Shiels, Simonsen. Booked: Mohsni, Templeton. Goals: Macleod 78, Clark 84. Att: 6,927 . Ref: Calum Murray (Scotland). Falkirk’s resistance broken, substitute Nicky Clark secured all three points by turning home a second, pinching what looked a certain goal by Nicky Law, and adding gloss to a scoreline that Rangers’ overall play ill-deserved. For all the visitors’ celebrations at full time, deep down McCoist will know that on another night — one when goalkeeper Cammy Bell wasn’t in such inspired form amid a Falkirk siege — this could have been the precursor to a morning full of crisis headlines. Pressure had been mounting on the manager coming into this match after his team made heavy weather of beating 10-man Hibs in extra time in the Petrofac Training Cup before opening their league campaign with a 2-1 home defeat to Hearts. However, if McCoist was under some scrutiny so, too, were his underperforming players. All eyes were on Bilel Mohsni on his return after a two-match ban for a ridiculous flying head-butt on Scotland international striker Chris Martin during a pre-season friendly against Derby County. Up front, there was also a lot expected of front-pairing Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd. The pair entered this game without a competitive goal to their name since their return, although Boyd expressed confidence earlier this week that he can bag 25 goals this season. Peter Houston’s Falkirk team, who hope to make the play-offs, were unchanged from the side who battled back to draw 2-2 at Cowdenbeath on the opening day of the season. Such was the demand for this sell-out game, local kids were spotted climbing trees behind the west stand at Westfield to catch a glimpse of their favourites. And their youthful invention was initially mirrored by the Bairns on the park as Blair Alston dispossessed Darren McGregor and crossed just too far ahead of Tom Taiwo. Anger management: Kris Boyd shows his frustration during the game . Crock star: Kenny Miller was forced to come off after picking up an injury . Twinkle toes: Rangers' Lewis MacLeod (R) skips by Falkirk's Alan Maybury . Then young winger Alex Cooper’s cross caused consternation in the Rangers box, with Alston’s flick evading keeper Bell but landing on the wrong side of the Rangers post. The action started to peter out disappointingly, however, with Rangers once again looking sluggish, lacking in invention and appearing devoid of confidence. That was most evident when Macleod angered Boyd with a slack through-ball to the striker. In what was an increasingly poor first half, Rangers did threaten when Mohsni’s header from a Macleod corner hit David McCracken and flew up over the bar. Then, from the cleared corner, David Templeton’s 25-yard rocket flew just wide. At the other end, however, there was to be a real escape for the Ibrox side when Cooper intercepted the erratic Mohsni’s short back header and hared down on Bell’s goal. The French-born Tunisian redeemed himself with a sliding tackle, before his arm went up in apology to his angry team-mates. But he continually gave the ball away and, after being booked for clipping Alston 25 yards out, he was relieved to see the Falkirk midfielder’s free-kick curl wide. Best foot forward: Falkirk's Tom Taiwo (L) tackles Nicky Law of Rangers . Talking tactics: Rangers manager Ally McCoist talks to his assistant Kenny McDowall . For Rangers, the second half continued in much the same depressing pattern as the first. The again looked out of sorts . To the annoyance of Law and Lee McCulloch, Mohsni and Marius Zaliukas persisted in shelling forward long balls, bypassing the midfield, which were mopped up with ease by the Falkirk defence. Mohsni was then lucky to escape a second yellow for a foul on Conor McGrandles on the edge of the box. This time, he was sprung from jail by Bell, who saved a terrific free-kick by Cooper. The Rangers keeper’s next save from the resulting corner — stopping a towering header by McCracken — was even better and very much from the top drawer. Falkirk were on top by now, but their former Hibs midfielder Taiwo was lucky to escape a booking for a foul on Mohsni. Then, in a bid to inject some desperately-needed life into his listless side, McCoist sent on striker Clark for Miller, who looked to have picked up a knock. Such was the utter lack of creativity, however, Rangers could have sent on McCoist in his playing prime to no effect. When a spell of Rangers possession finally ensued, a fine chance presented itself for McCulloch. A weak headed clearance bounced up perfectly on the penalty spot, only for the Ibrox captain to blaze wildly over the bar. Battle royale: Rangers Lee Wallace and Falkirk midfielder Blair Ashton compete for the ball . Blast from the past: Alex McCleish was at Falkirk to watch his former team Rangers . There was an immediate scare at the other end of the park when Falkirk’s Rory Loy raced down the right, but his centre narrowly missed Alston and Cooper. Substitute Clark missed the chance of the night, though, when Boyd chipped a pass beautifully into the path of the former Queen of the South striker on the six-yard box — but he headed weakly at Jamie MacDonald. It was the Falkirk keeper’s first save of the match, which told its own story. But then came Macleod and Clark’s two late goals in six minutes to save the day for McCoist. In a frantic finish, Boyd also hit the net but his drought continues thanks to an offside flag. It mattered little to Rangers and their manager after what was a lucky escape.

"By . Jonny Singer . Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists that the scandal surrounding Malky Mackay and Iain Moody will not have an impact on his team's performance this weekend. A Sportsmail investigation led to allegatinons of racist, sexist homophobic text messages sent by Mackay and Moody while they were working for the club. But, speaking before his side's trip to Wolves, Solskjaer, who replaced Mackay last season, was adament that his team would remain focused on football. Focus: Solksjaer insists his side will be concentrating on the task at hand this weekend . Fine start: Cardiff have made a strong start to life  in the Championship, earning seven points in three games . 'Football wise I am sure the boys just concentrate on the game tomorrow,' he said. 'We have been focused and had a good start. I don’t think it will affect anyone's performance.' 'The boys have shown to me before that when we have had off-field media (last season) it hasn’t affected them. In the longer term it did last season, loads of off-field stuff.' 'But I'm sure the boys are just looking forward to the game. The mood at the start of a season is different, you are just looking forward to the games.'

The fastest man in the world, who struck Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay with Jamaica last weekend, should receive an invite from fellow countryman Ricardo Fuller to make a trip to The Den in the coming months. Fuller explained the pair know each other from back home - going out for a drink during downtime this summer - and Bolt wouldn’t hesitate in saying yes to taking in a game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Usain Bolt say he wants to play fro Man United when he retires . London Calling: Usain Bolt could be ready to watch Millwall thanks to an invite from Ricardo Fuller . Mates: Fuller explained the pair know each other from back home - going for drinks during the summer . ‘The next time Bolt is in London I am going to invite him to watch a Millwall game at The Den,’ the 34-year-old said ahead of the new Championship season, which the Lions kick-off against Leeds at home on Saturday. ‘And though he supports Man United, I know he will come here. Who knows? He might even start supporting us after!’ That trip could be sooner than expected. The six-time Olympic champion stays and trains with his agent in Teddington, south west London, when competing on the continent and is pencilled in to run at the Diamond League meeting in Zurich on August 28; Ian Holloway’s side host Fuller’s old club Blackpool two days later. ‘I saw Bolt when I went home in the summer,’ Fuller added. ‘We always hang out together and go for a drink. It’s normal. Everybody knows everybody in Jamaica. ‘Even though people might see him as this so-called superstar, he is just a normal guy. You could pass Bolt on the street and say hi.

Bolt’s friend Fuller signed a one-year deal with Millwall in July and, although he is very much an elder statesman in the group, is putting younger colleagues to shame across the ground in pre-season. Hardly surprising, the striker rationalises, given his nationality. ‘Bolt’s trainer, Glen Mills, used to coach me on the track as well,’ he added. ‘Me and Carlos Edwards (35) are the fastest players in training. The stats show it. We posted the same time. Bang on. But I should have broken the record – I let him off the hook!’ There may be charisma and measured arrogance radiating from Bolt, but Millwall’s Jamaican isn’t missing much swagger either. Fuller insisted he took a four-week break before finally committing to the club. ‘I spent the first month enjoying myself, seeing family and friends and then after the first month I started training and getting back into it,’ he said. ‘I knew about Millwall over a month before I came here. Blackpool also wanted to do something but we all know about the problems they are having.’ VIDEO I don't know if we will get promoted - Holloway .","Fastest man in the world is good friends with Millwall striker .

"author] . A Tour de France yellow jersey holder will always be grilled about doping and Vincenzo Nibali was no exception on Thursday, having to defend his choice to work with former doper Alexandre Vinokourov. Nibali joined Astana last year from Liquigas and fell under the guidance of Kazakh Vinokourov, who served a two-year ban after being found guilty of blood doping on the 2007 Tour de France. Vinokourov came back to the sport and won the 2012 Olympic title in London before taking over as Astana manager. Under scrutiny: Vincenzo Nibali arrives at the doping control following the 12th stage on Thursday . Kazakh-funded team Astana have a tainted reputation since their first year in 2007, when Vinokourov was kicked out of the Tour following his doping offence. It was also the team Spain's Alberto Contador was riding for in 2010 when he tested positive for a banned anabolic agent. But Nibali believes things have changed as he works with sports director Giuseppe Martinelli - the one who led the disgraced Marco Pantani to his Giro d'Italia title in 1998. Quizzed about his choice to work with Vinokourov and Martinelli after the 12th stage of the Tour de France on Thursday, Nibali said: 'I could not say anything about Martinelli, with whom I have a good relationship. 'It is thanks to him that I have joined Astana.' In charge: Italy's Vincenzo Nibali has a 2:23 lead over second-placed Richie Porte of Australia . VIDEO Kristoff leaves Sagan sulking on Stage 12 . Martinelli, who was Pantani's and Contador's sports director, has not been directly linked to doping, though. When leaving Liquigas, Nibali also took with him his long-time coach Paolo Slongo. 'It was important that we hired him (at Astana) because I worked a lot with him when I was young,' said Nibali, who has a 2:23 lead over second-placed Richie Porte of Australia. After the Lance Armstrong scandal, Nibali believes the peloton should look forward. 'Mistakes were made by a lot of riders,' he said. 'We need to leave these mistakes in the past and give their chance to the young riders. 'There are in and out-of-competition controls in cycling, there is the biological passport (since 2008). 'I came to Astana to be part of a group that could take me to the top in the Giro, in the Vuelta and in the Tour. There will always be idiots. I won't speak for the whole peloton but something has been done to clean up this sport.' Should he wear the yellow jersey in Paris on July 27, Nibali will become the sixth man to win all three grand tours after Frenchmen Bernard Hinault and Jacques Anquetil, Italy's Felice Gimondi, Belgian Eddy Merckx and Contador.","Vicenzo Nibali currently leads Tour de France 2014 .

Rooney had been offering advice and ‘having a laugh in the call room’ with the 19-year-old as they advanced through the rounds. But all friendly feeling was left in the blocks as he held on to win gold in 44.71sec, the fastest time in Europe this year. Hudson-Smith finished strongly but did not have enough track left to overhaul Rooney, taking silver in a personal best time of 44.75sec.

Out in front: Rooney (right) edges out compatriot Hudson-Smith to claim gold at the European Championships . This was Britain’s first one-two in the 400m at the Europeans since Du’ane Ladejo beat Roger Black in 1994. Hudson-Smith, from Birmingham, was formerly a 100m sprinter and only properly turned to one-lap running at the start of the year. He has since shaved an incredible one minute off his personal best. ‘To have someone to race against for the next couple of years is great,’ said Rooney, ‘It’s great for British athletics but obviously I’m ecstatic to come out on top. ‘He’s a fantastic kid and I’ve been having a bit of a laugh with him in the call room. We were a little bit more subdued before the final but still having fun. I’ve been offering him advice throughout the week. From a selfish point of view I’m glad he’s around because I think he’s going to push me to run fast. ‘I’ve been happy to let him take the spotlight this year. I said in every interview “it’s all about Matt Hudson-Smith”.’ Rooney was also 19 when he came to prominence by breaking Roger Black’s 21-year-old British junior 400 metres record at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. On the podium: Rooney (centre) and Hudson-Smith (left) receive their medals with third-placed Donald Sanford . Going for gold: Rooney (left) races home to finish first at the Letzigrund in Zurich on Friday . Since then Rooney admits he has failed to live up to expectations and had not won a major international title until Friday night. ‘I asked myself 100 times where that form had gone,’ said Rooney, ‘The pressure put on me by others is nothing compared to what I’ve done to myself. It’s nice to be a champion now, I’ve never won anything in my life.’ Rooney claimed he was under greater pressure after pulling out of the 4x400m relay team which went on to win gold at the Commonwealth Games earlier this month. ‘I’m not a superman athlete, I’m very human and very breakable so have to make these tough decisions but by pulling out of the relay I put a big target on my back. I had to get gold here, nothing else would have done.’ Laura Weightman held on to add a European 1500m bronze medal to her Commonwealth silver.

Great Britain's Desiree Henry and Ashleigh Nelson will vie for 100 metres gold on Wednesday night, although Asha Philip missed out on the European Championships final by less than a hundredth of a second. On a blustery night in Zurich, Nelson and Henry secured automatic progress to the final by finishing second in their heats. Teenager Henry equalled her personal best of 11.21 seconds as she finished behind overwhelming Dutch favourite Dafne Schippers, who she will again line-up alongside in the final later this evening. Personal best: Desiree Henry (C)  finished a close second behind favourite Dafne Schippers (L) 'I can't believe it,' the 18-year-old told the BBC. 'I just had a relaxed approach and I was determined to enjoy it. 'Dafne Schippers, we're virtually training partners and she's always encouraging me. I'll get ready for the final now, I can't wait.' However, British hopes of a three-pronged attack in the final were dashed as Philip missed out by the smallest of margins. The 23-year-old, former champion Verena Sailer and Celine Distel-Bonnet were all tied on 11.24 secs, with the latter taking the fastest loser spot when it went to thousandths of a second. 'I'm extremely disappointed,' Philip said. 'I don't know how I didn't get myself into a European final. 'After the Commonwealths and World Indoors where I've come out and done that, there are not many words that can describe how I'm feeling. I'm disappointed and feel like I've failed.'

There was to be no shock exit in the 400 metres semi-finals as world champion Christine Ohuruogu booked an automatic place for Friday's final, finishing just 0.02 seconds ahead of Poland's Malgorzata Holub in her heat. Great Britain will be without a representative in the men's 400 metres hurdles later that night, though, as national champion Niall Flannery, Tom Burton and Sebastian Rodger all failed to make it through the semi-finals.

'I got out this time which I'm actually quite proud of because I was a bit nervous,' Hudson-Smith told the BBC. 'This is all new to me, a real experience and I'm learning from it. 'I've done exactly what I want to do so far. To get three of us in the final is great.

In a fascinating interview with Sportsmail, Christophe Bassons also warns that cycling’s rejection of Lance Armstrong could have dire consequences. ‘I don’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling, because I think it is possible,’ said the French former professional rider. VIDEO Scroll down to see Lance Armstrong exclusively speak to Sportsmail about doping . Ready: Chris Froome and his team at Sky have had their ethics questioned by a leading anti-doping advocate . Ethics: Team Sky have come under-fire from Bassons who asks himself 'a lot of questions' Feared for: Christophe Bassons worries that cycling's rejection of Lance Armstrong (pictured) could be deadly . Bassons was a key adversary of Armstrong and he argues that Sky’s use of TUEs (therapeutic user exemption certificate) is no different to using the blood-boosting drug EPO. Speaking in Leeds on Friday to promote his updated autobiography - ‘A Clean Break’ - Bassons said it was wrong for Froome to race in April’s Tour de Romandie using a TUE for an asthma medication. Froome was not in breach of UCI or WADA rules but Bassons thinks Team Sky and Froome have been exposed compromising their principles. ‘Doping is about eliminating all obstacles to win a race,’ said Bassons. ‘I ask myself a lot of questions about Team Sky. I have the impression that they talk a lot and say a lot of things because they don't want to talk about other things. ‘The fact is Froome has shown his mentality by taking this product. He had a problem, he was ill and he took this product. He eliminated the obstacle to him winning. ‘It's not that different from taking EPO because you're tired and your haematocrit is low. Just because it's legal, it comes down to the same mentality. ‘Armstrong said years ago: “I've been tested 500 times and never tested positive.” That's the same mentality guys have got today. They just don't want to test positive. 'Mr Clean': Christophe Bassons was renowned for his refusal to dope and quit cycling after outing doping use . CHRIS FROOME, 29, GB .

XABIER ZANDIO, 37, SPAIN . ‘It's not about where the authorities draw the line, because people thinking about that are also only thinking the priority is not to test positive. ‘My dad was a bricklayer. If he was ill he wouldn't take a drug so he could carry on, he'd go home and rest. There seems to be this obligation with Sky to perform at any cost. That worries me.’ As a rider Bassons earned the nickname ‘Mr Clean’ because of his refusal to dope, even though he was a member of the Festina team that was busted for carrying doping products in a team car just before the start of the 1998 Tour. A year later he would write a newspaper column claiming the peloton was riddled with drug cheats, leading to an infamous confrontation with Armstrong during the race. Two years later he retired from cycling disillusioned. A courageous man who for the last 10 years has worked in anti-doping in his native France - he tries to educate young athletes against the dangers of drugs in sport - Bassons said on Friday he could see unfavourable comparisons between Team Sky and the US Postal Service team that dominated the Tour under the leadership of Armstrong. Pose: Bassons feels there are comparisons between Team Sky and the US Postal Service team . Unfavourable comparisons: Team Sky have been linked to the infamous team led by Armstrong by Bassons .

Sky have won the last two Tours under Sir Bradley Wiggins and then Froome, with the latter favourite to win the race for a second time this year. ‘What's also true is Sky have definitely gone against a lot of received knowledge in the sport,’ he said. ‘There were a lot of things we thought weren't possible and they've shown that they are possible. ‘They have a collective force like US Postal had. They communicate with people like US Postal did and they seem to produce riders who don't have any muscles and are very powerful. ‘Twenty years ago, almost, it was Festina, 10 years later it was Armstrong. I don't want to say that in the next few years Froome is going to be the next big scandal, but what they ought to do if they've got nothing to hide is communicate differently and stop communicating in that way, like US Postal used to do.’ Team Sky insisted earlier this week that it abided by the rules. In Friday's press conference, Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford said: ‘We set out to try to win this race with a British rider and ride clean and we've achieved that. ‘We're a clean team, we play by the rules. We are happy that WADA is happy with us and we are happy that the UCI is happy with us.’ Basson also argued that it was wrong that a former doper, Bjarne Riis, is a team principal for Tinkoff Saxo in this year’s race. ‘In 1999 Armstrong was far from alone in doping,’ he said. 'Everyone was doing it. It’d not acceptable that people like Bjarne Riis are still in the sport when we are trying to restore the credibility of cycling. 'Look at Laurent Jalabert. We know now he was a doper and yet he is working as a cycling commentator on French television, on a public channel I pay for with my television licence. I am paying for Laurent Jalabert.’ Questionable? Tinkoff Saxo team principal Bjarne Riis is a former doper in cycling . Bassons met up with Armstrong in Paris last December, giving the American the opportunity to apologise for the way he had treated him. ‘I compare the 1999 Armstrong to the 2013 Armstrong and they were two completely different men,’ said Bassons. ‘I saw a very tired man. He couldn’t look you in the eye. In 1999 he never dropped his gaze. Now he was scratching the table. He was nervous. He drank two glasses of Vodka before the interview and he drank afterwards as well. ‘I work in anti-doping with young people and I don’t always agree with the message the anti-doping bodies put out; about this war on drugs that is all about protecting people’s health. Because the war on drugs quite clearly hasn’t protected everyone’s health. ‘Frank Vandenbroucke, Jose Maria Jimenez, Marco Pantani, Philippe Gaumont, they’re not dead because of doping. They are dead because of the way they were rejected. Exhausted: Bassons said of Armstrong (pictured in 2004 for the US Postal team), he saw a 'very tired man' Different: A 'nervous' Armstrong 'drank two glasses of Vodka before the interview' claims Bassons . ‘Maybe Armstrong is stronger than I imagine but I don’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling, because I think it is possible. ‘In 1999 most riders were using drugs and others would have done the same thing as him. They would have acted in the same way and created the same system around them but they weren’t as strong and as intelligent as him. ‘By creating that system he created a lot of bitterness towards himself and now people are jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make themselves look good by condemning him. ‘But they are not assuming responsibility for their actions and what they did at the time.’ The UCI have ordered an independent inquiry into cycling’s doping past - CIRC - in the wake of the Armstrong revelations of last year. Bassons is unimpressed. ‘I haven’t spoken to CIRC,’ he said. ‘Every 10 years or so cycling has something like this. We had Festina in 98 and then the Armstrong affair. Now we have this thing with Froome and the TUEs, and it seems like WADA and the UCI might have facilitated something that shouldn’t have happened. We should be looking at the present. 'I don’t like talking about the past, even though I am here, because the focus needs to be on the present and what is happening now. That’s where we should be focusing our energy. ‘It’s ridiculous we are focusing our energy on something that happened 10 years ago when Bjarne Riis is still the manager of a team. ‘It is harder to dope these days because the tests are much more sensitive. But the biological passport is a problem. It’s a shield everyone hides behind but it has good things and bad things. ‘Riders can take microdoses of drugs like EPO. You are not tested between 9pm and 6am and if you take a microdose of EPO at 9.01 pm it will not be detectable by 6am the next morning. I know the mentality hasn’t changed in cycling.’","Chris Froome and Team Sky have ethics questioned by anti-doping advocate and French former professional rider Christophe Bassons .

When the explicit emails were exposed in June 2013, Army chief David Morrison warned the troops to ‘respect women or get out.’ ‘I will be ruthless in ridding the army of people who cannot live up to its value,' said Lieutenant General Morrison in a YouTube video is response to the online sex scandal. ‘Those that thing that it’s okay to behave in a way that demeans or exploits their fellow colleagues have no place in this army,’ But two men say they were not given due process and believe an example was made of them, because they did no worse than make ‘stupid comments,’ just like ‘thousands of other soldiers’, according to News Corp. Reports say the men believe they were used as a scapegoat so the ADF could take a harsh stance against sexist behaviour in their ranks . They claim that they were used to make to make a strong statement against inappropriate conduct in the army. The two men claim the Army Chief at the helm of the ranks did not even bother to talk to them, according to News Corp. ‘I take full responsibility for the stupid comments on my emails, but I should have got a kick in the pants, not the loss of my career,’ one of the men anonymously told News Corp. The two men both claim to have tried to kill themselves, after the decision to release them from the army ‘ended our careers and ruined our lives,’ according to News Corp. The two men reportedly say their careers are over and their lives have been ruined after their sacking from the Australian army . It is reported that it was a ‘one-man club’, and the other people involved were dragged in. This month the purported ringleader, Commando Hastings Frederickson, 40, pleaded guilty to three charges of using a carriage to cause offence, for circulating the pornographic images.

The German champions face bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup on Wednesday but they will be without Rafinha and Thiago Alcantara, with key man Franck Ribery also a major doubt. Yet the Spaniard is adamant that he has the depth necessary to compete on all fronts this season and he does not need any further additions in this transfer window. No more players: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola insists he does not need anymore signings . Ready: Bayern face rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup on Wednesday evening . Doubt: Winger Franck Ribery (left) is unlikely to feature against Dortmund on Wednesday in the Super Cup . Guardiola said: 'No, no new players. Thiago will be back and Rafa will be back and Franck will be back so I am happy about this squad.' French winger Ribery is still struggling to recover his fitness following the back injury which ruled him out of the World Cup, while defender Rafinha tore ankle ligaments at the weekend. Thiago, meanwhile, is continuing his recovery from knee ligament damage he sustained in May and Guardiola will not put a date on when he will return to the fold. Guardiola is also adamant that he will be able to give his six World Cup winners adequate rest this season by rotating his squad accordingly. The 43-year-old said: 'Thiago will be back soon. He really wants to come back as soon as possible but for these issues we have a doctor and you should ask him .

Lynsey Sharp was robbed of her golden moment at the European Championships two years ago, having her silver medal upgraded a year later when Russian winner Yelena Arzhakova was revealed to be a drugs cheat. The 24-year-old wants to defend her title ‘properly’ in Zurich, starting in the heats of the 800 metres on Wednesday morning. But she has learned from experience that things are rarely simple where her career is concerned. In the running: Sharp is determined to defend her European title when the heats begin on Wednesday . Inspirational: The athlete scrawled the message 'Get out strong, commit' on her hand in Glasgow . Sharp will run despite an oozing wound on her leg which repeatedly gets infected. It requires surgery but the Scot postponed an operation in order to compete at a home Commonwealth Games. That nearly didn’t happen either. She spent the hours before the final hooked up to a drip at a medical centre in the athletes’ village suffering from a severe sickness bug, but recovered and ran a superb race to win silver. Her tribulations continued with a ‘nightmare journey’ to Zurich. ‘It took 16 hours to get from Loughborough,’ she said. ‘Our 1.40pm flight was cancelled and the next one at 7.45pm only had business-class seats, so I spent nine hours at Heathrow and didn’t arrive until midnight.’ Sharp became Scotland’s sweetheart after her poignant victory in Glasgow, which she partly dedicated to her father Cameron Sharp, who won five Commonwealth medals before suffering life-threatening injuries in a road accident in 1991. Hero: Her performance in the home games has made Sharp something of a star in Scotland . Rearranged Podium: Yelena Arzhakova (centre) had her gold medal stripped giving Sharp the title . An impromptu decision to scrawl a note reading, ‘Get out strong, commit’, in black marker pen on the back of her hand had a profound effect on some fans. ‘I’ve had so many messages from people saying, “I’ve had surgery, you’ve inspired me”, and some have written things on their hands for charity walks and stuff. ‘I’ve never written on myself before but I felt I needed something to take me away from the emotion. ‘I don’t know if I’ll need it in Zurich.’ Sharp has run the fourth-fastest two-lap time in Europe this season and stands a good chance of winning a medal in Switzerland. ‘It would be nice to win European gold properly and experience the full thing, rather than getting my medal a year and a bit later,’ she said.","Sharp awarded gold in 2012 championships after winner failed drugs test .

"By . Martha Kelner for Mail On Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . Jo Pavey became the oldest European champion in history on Tuesday night, just one month shy of her 41st birthday and less than a year after giving birth to her second baby. Pavey cradled 11-month-old daughter Emily as she did a sprightly lap of honour at the Letzigrund Stadium after winning 10,000m gold just 10 days after taking a bronze medal in the 5,000m at the Commonwealth Games. Demonstrating remarkable powers of recovery, Pavey went ahead with one lap to go and accelerated down the home straight, resisting the challenge of silver medallist Clemence Calvin of France, who is 16 years her junior. Champion: Pavey crosses the line to win her first career title at the age of 40 . It is a first major title for Pavey, who replaces Russia’s Irina Khabarova as the oldest gold medallist in the 80-year history of these championships. Khabarova won the 4x100m relay title in 2006 aged 40 years and 27 days. Pavey said of her new record: ‘That’s a really nice statistic to have. It is quite an honour.’ The Exeter Harrier painted an unconventional but touching picture of family training sessions, with her husband and coach, Gavin, instructing drills with Emily strapped to his chest in a baby carrier, while four-year-old son Jacob mimics his mother by running down the long jump runway. ‘We decided to bring them both along (to Zurich),’ said Pavey. ‘It made me really emotional to have her watch it, its the first time she’s seen me run in a major championships. My little boy, too, of course. I can’t believe it, I really enjoyed it but I’m really surprised.’ A model of consistency, Pavey has never finished lower than fifth in her three previous European Championships. She won silver in Helsinki two years ago behind Portugal’s Ana Dulce Felix and on paper was the fifth fastest athlete this year on the start line. Final push: Pavey hangs on the shoulders of the leaders before making her move late on to take gold . She made things difficult for herself, running wide in lane two for much of the race. After hovering in eighth place in the middle of the leading pack, she moved into third with two laps to go before taking the lead on the 25th and final lap. Victory looked assured 80 metres from the line. She appeared overwhelmed, looking at the clock before raising her tired arms in a deliriously happy daze. ‘I bet people are criticising me for running wide so much,’ she said. ‘But every time I tried to tuck in I got spiked. I got a bit worried about it, thinking, “this feels a really long way, maybe I should have just done the 5k” but then I thought maybe everyone else was thinking it’s a long way too! ‘I tried to do a controlled last lap because I didn’t want to blow up on the home straight, then I didn’t know how close the other girls were, so I thought, “just give it all you’ve got and you can’t regret anything”.’ It was a poignant moment for Pavey, a prodigious junior athlete who set a British Under 15 record for the 1500m in 1988 but spent most of the following decade blighted by injury. Making it hard: Pavey ran most of the race on the outside of lane two before taking a final-lap lead . Celebration: The athlete celebrates her second medal at a major championship in just 10 days . She added: ‘It’s quite funny really, to try for so many years and now do it when I’m 40.’ The Great Britain team will expect to add more medals on Wednesday when Mo Farah is favourite to emulate Pavey’s success in the men’s 10,000m. The 100m trio of Dwain Chambers, James Dasaolu and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey thrived on the speedy Mondo track. All won their heats with Dasaolu, the second fastest European in history behind Linford Christie, the slowest of the three but the most comfortable. The 26-year-old has struggled with a hamstring injury since running 9.91sec last year but he claims to be in better shape than ever. ‘I wasn’t really pushing myself,’ said Dasaolu. ‘I’m expecting a medal, hopefully.’ Hopeful: Britain will expect more medals in the coming days with James Dasaolu and Mo Farah in contention . Dwain Chambers, competing in his sixth European Championships at 36, also eased up in 10.18sec and admitted he was in a race against time to win another medal. ‘The door is closing on me,’ he said. ‘I want to hear the national anthem again.’ Christine Ohuruogu, who originally planned 2014 as a year off from athletics, set a season’s best of 51.42sec to win her heat and qualify second fastest for this evening’s 400m semi-final. The reigning world champion was contesting only her third race of the year and eased up with 70m to run. Ohuruogu, who won Olympic gold in 2008, is in search of the only major title that has eluded her.","40-year-old mother Pavey wins first major title .

Northern Ireland are expected to be awarded the three points which will see them remain top of the Elite League which also includes Canada and China.

The striker, who has been praised for his finishing and positional play, has already been called up to both the Northern Ireland Under-17 and Under-19 sides.  Dale GormanGorman helped his youth club Letterkenny Rovers to league and cup titles before signing a two year scholarship deal with Stevenage. His introduction in an academy fixture against Watford recently was seen as the catalyst for his side overturning a two goal deficit. Josh DohertyA useful player who can play at full-back or in midfield, made his first senior appearance for Watford in their 4-1 defeat to Huddersfield earlier this year. The eighteen-year-old has nine caps and one goal across the Northern Ireland youth setups. CHARLES MARTLAND . The first fight broke out just before the hour mark as Northern Ireland prepared to take a corner. Several players, including Josh Doherty and Dale Gorman, found themselves tossed to the ground. Both benches joined the melee which only served to heighten tensions as stewards were forced to intervene. Referee Tim Marshall eventually decided to send off Mexico's Raul Gudino and Carlos Arreola as well as Northern Ireland's Robbie McDaid. The shocking incidents come almost a year to the day after the same teams clashed in Ballymena. On that occasion, Mexico ran out 2-1 winners after Rodrigo Gonzalez was sent off for a push while his team-mate Carlos Arreola lashed out at Cameron McGheehan but avoided a red card. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland were trailing to Victor Guzman's 30-yard thunderbolt but made full use of their extra man to level through Mikhail Kennedy before Sean Mullan scored what proved to be the winner with three minutes remaining.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . The Welcome to Vanchester billboard that appeared on Monday was the work of a bookmaker and not, it has to be said, anything to do with Manchester United or their new manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman is pictured in triumphant pose, mimicking the poster dedicated to Carlos Tevez by Manchester City which caused more than its fair share of commotion after the forward swapped Old Trafford for the Etihad five years ago. Monday's imitation might have been little more than a publicity stunt, but the timing could not have been better because the moment has come for Van Gaal to make his mark in Manchester too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training . Warm welcome: Betfair created a 'Welcome to Vanchester' billboard in ode to Louis van Gaal .

Winning smile: Darren Fletcher (left) and Wayne Rooney (right) hold aloft the International Champions Cup . VIDEO Rooney favourite for captaincy . After leading his team from one coast of America to the other — a commercially-driven venture that did not go down particularly well with him — the 63-year-old will take his place in the Old Trafford dugout for the first time on Tuesday when they face Valencia in their final pre-season friendly. In four days’ time, Swansea are the visitors for the opening Premier League game of the season and the Van Gaal era will begin in earnest. After getting to work on overhauling the coaching staff, playing squad and formation at United, he must now set about rebuilding the fortress established under Sir Alex Ferguson, whose Theatre of Dreams became the stuff of nightmares for David Moyes during his ill-fated spell. Not only did the likes of City, Liverpool and Tottenham walk away from Old Trafford with three points, it turned into a happy hunting ground for West Brom, Everton, Newcastle and Sunderland —teams who previously had never given themselves a prayer at United — as records tumbled. United went out of both domestic cups at home and the fear factor that had gripped opponents for so long was suddenly transmitted to them. Blue moon: Manchester City famously created a 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard after signing Carlos Tevez . That it is not something Van Gaal will tolerate. Already he appears to have re-established a winning mentality in a group aware of the price of failure. It would be dangerous to read too much into pre-season, but United have won all five games under their new boss, including matches against Real Madrid, Liverpool and Roma. Valencia are next and the fact Van Gaal has had his opponents scouted indicates he is treating it as more than a friendly. United are expecting a crowd in excess of 60,000, although tickets were still available over the weekend so there are no guarantees the game will be a sellout. New signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw are set to make their home debuts but Van Gaal is unlikely to risk Robin van Persie, Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj after all three players had extra time off following the World Cup. The United boss met with Fellaini over the weekend and it is understood the Belgium midfielder has not been told outright he will be sold. However, Van Gaal made it clear the £27.5million signing from Everton last summer will not be first choice and the possibility of a move to Napoli remains. Uncertain future: Marouane Fellaini could yet leave the club amid interest from Napoli .","A mammoth billboard welcoming Louis van Gaal to Manchester United has been created in the city .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Premier League communications director Dan Johnson has confirmed that plans for a new Under-21 tournament including clubs from around Europe are underway. Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday that a new cup competition made up of 16 teams from England and abroad is set to run parallel to the revamped domestic Under 21 league. And Johnson, who insists the tournament is not a rival to Greg Dyke's plans for a B league made up partly of Premier League reserve sides, has confirmed that there is plenty of support for the concept. Test: Chelsea's Under 21 side will face European opposition in the Premier League's new youth competition . England: Chelsea, Fulham, Leicester City, Man City, Man Utd, Southampton, Sunderland, West Ham. Europe: Celtic, Athletic Bilbao, Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Schalke, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven, Villarreal . He told The Guardian: 'We do believe it would be good for the development of talented young players but it is not an answer to the B league proposal at all. It is something we have wanted to do for a number of years. 'We are keen to work with UEFA on what we think is a good development opportunity and there has been a lot of support from clubs on the continent. 'Our view is that an Under-21 competition with a significant programme of international fixtures at lower age levels is a good opportunity to expose players to this level of competition. We now need to work with Uefa for their agreement.' The initiative is all part of the Elite Player Performance Plan introduced in 2011 to improve the standard of young players the top English clubs are producing. Triumph: Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker celebrates the winner in the final against Manchester United in May . Liverpool, who finished runners-up in last season’s Under 21 development league, have not taken up the opportunity, giving West Ham, who finished ninth, the chance to step in. The competition will run parallel to the  Under 21 league. That now carries the added interest of promotion and relegation and will see both Sky Sports and BT Sport televise 10 matches live. The organisers are hopeful matches will attract good crowds and it is expected clubs will field their best young players just below first-team level. Schalke academy director Oliver Ruhnert helped produce four of Germany’s World Cup winning squad and is one of Europe’s most respected authorities on youth football. He jumped at the chance to enter his Under 21 side. ‘This is a fantastic new initiative and the Premier League have been very good in setting it up,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘You need to expose your players to different types of football and different countries in front of foreign crowds.’ Another chance: Manchester United's youngsters are set to take part in the new tournament . Teams will be allowed to field three players over the age of 21. The format comprises four groups of four with the winners and runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals. All knockout games will be played over two legs and it is hoped the clubs’ main stadiums will be used for matches. The competition is designed to expose prospects to foreign opposition and take them away from the staid, behind-closed-doors environment of domestic youth football which has been criticised in recent years. There will, however, be no commercial opportunities during the inaugural season of the Premier League's new European cup and they are keen for it to be seen as a development opportunity; no prize money will be awarded to the winners, for example. Meanwhile, the name of the competition is yet to be decided, as is the venue for the final.","Premier League is set to unveil new European cup competition this season .

Arsene Wenger's side left it late to beat Crystal Palace on the opening day of the Premier League season, with Aaron Ramsey stealing all three points for the Gunners with a winner in added time. The Welsh midfielder was by no means the stand-out performer at the Emirates though, as Jack Wilshere performed well for the hosts and former Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh played brilliantly for Palace. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players... VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: They made it very difficult but we kept going . Late winner: Welsh wizard Aaron Ramsey scored in added time to hand Arsenal a 2-1 win at the Emirates . ARSENAL . WOJCIECH SZCZESNY - 6 . No chance with the goal after being severely let down by those in front of him. Wasn’t fully tested but mopped up when called upon. MATHIEU DEBUCHY- 6 . The Frenchman was slow to get forward down the right for the Gunners. Yet to show his best form n an Arsenal shirt following his summer move from Newcastle. Ponderous: Arsenal right-back Mathieu Debuchy was not at his best against Palace on Saturday afternoon . CALUM CHAMBERS - 6.5 . Picked up a silly booking for hauling Fraizer Campbell down, but a solid debut for the youngster who doesn’t look at all overawed after a summer move from Southampton. LAURENT KOSCIELNY- 7 . All or nothing display, as we’ve come to expect from the Frenchman. Frighteningly close to giving away a penalty at one end, then scored just before half-time. Handled the added burden of coaxing Chambers through his debut well. Firing the Gunners level: Laurent Koscielny, right, is congratulated by Santi Cazorla after making it 1-1 . KIERAN GIBBS - 6 . Failed to really get down the line as much as he’d like. Decent battle with Jason Puncheon with no clear winner before coming off with a niggle. MIKEL ARTETA - 5.5 . Skipper was over-run in midfield and his performance brought into focus the need for another body in there. JACK WILSHERE- 6.5 . While he did give the ball away frequently early on, a vibrant display full of energy and packed with a desire to get alongside Sanogo. Late rally: Ramsey, far right, completed an impressive comeback for Arsene Wenger's side with his late goal . AARON RAMSEY - 6.5 . Looked a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon and was strangely subdued. Plenty more to come, of course, but the Welshman overhit too many final balls. But you can never keep him out of a game and up he popped in stoppage time to win it. SANTI CAZORLA - 5.5 . Home attacks often ended with Cazorla, who lacked the cutting edge to break down a stubborn visiting side. ALEXIS SANCHEZ - 6 . A case of trying too hard, Sanchez looked bright but very little came off and the Chilean needs to play centrally. Excellent clipped delivery for Koscielny’s equaliser. Not quite clicking: Chile forward Alexis Sanchez had an up-and-down day at the office for the home side . YAYA SANOGO - 5 . Almost looks like a player who’s unsure what’s expected of him or the role in which he’s playing. Languid style doesn’t help and offered nothing off the ball. SUBS . NACHO MONREAL - threatening down the left, looked fitter than last season. ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN - struggled to impose himself on proceedings. OLIVIER GIROUD - Offers Arsenal a different dimension and his presence alone was a deciding factor in Arsenal winning this. Little impact: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was introduced in the closing stages but failed to leave his mark . CRYSTAL PALACE . JULIAN SPERONI - 6.5 . Very little to do, but made one superb save from Jack Wilshere before the end of the first half. Caught well. MARTIN KELLY - 6.5 . Didn’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded forward with purpose. BREDE HANGELAND - 6 . Classy glanced header put Palace ahead, but he was then guilty of losing Koscielny for the equaliser. First impressions: Ex-Fulham defender Brede Hangeland is mobbed by his Palace team-mates after scoring . SCOTT DANN - 7 . Palace’s best signing last year and started this well. Constantly organising the back four, strong in the air and had Sanogo in his pocket before being forced off. JOEL WARD - 6.5 . Unsung hero in last year’s survival and went about his business professionally without much fuss. Kept Sanchez quiet for long spells. JASON PUNCHEON - 6 . One of the most exciting players to watch in the Premier League. Direct runner with an eye for goal and plenty of tricks in his locker. Forever a nuisance, but let himself down badly by catching Monreal studs up and was deservedly sent off. Composed in the middle: Palace midfielder Joe Ledley shields the ball from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez . Neat and tidy: Palace captain Mile Jedinak nicks the ball from Aaron Ramsey during the second half . MILE JEDINAK - 7 . Carried on where he left off last season. Composed on the ball, kept things ticking over in the middle of the park but, more importantly, was disciplined in Palace’s shape. JOE LEDLEY - 7 . Has always been a good reader of the game and is now growing into the central midfield role. Comfortable alongside Jedinak. YANNICK BOLASIE - 6 . Not at his best but the threat of Bolasie’s pace in behind is almost as dangerous as the winger’s ability. Always a threat: Yannick Bolasie's pace meant he looked dangerous throughout for the visiting side . Star of the show: Much-maligned during his stay at the Emirates, Chamakh shone for Palace on his return . MAROUANE CHAMAKH - 7.5 . Superb. Asked to do a very specific job by Keith Millen - dropping in to make five in midfield without the ball - and he followed the caretaker’s instructions to the letter. Even picked up a grubby booking for a late challenge on Wilshere and didn't deserve to be on the losing side. FRAIZER CAMPBELL - 6.5 . Because of Chamakh’s very specific role, the striker found himself a isolated on occasion. Did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances. SUBS . DAMIEN DELANEY - Brought on for the injured Dann to shore up the back four but could only watch as Arsenal nicked it late on. DWIGHT GAYLE - Gave Campbell some light relief late on.

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . and Daniel Piotrowski . He goes by the name of Abu Bakr but the teenager who appeared on national TV wearing the logo of listed terrorist organisation Islamic State last week is actually 19-year-old part-time labourer Sulayman Khalid. Khalid, who grew up Sydney's southwestern suburbs, is of Iraqi and Italian background and had his  passport revoked by ASIO in December. He was charged on Friday with affray and intimidation in an alleged 'religious hate crime' incident involving a 43-year-old shopping centre cleaner. His lawyer Zali Burrows told Daily Mail Australia earlier this month that he is simply a 'young kid who is passionate about injustice'. But the security services have had concerns about the Islamic State supporter for some time. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Sydney man Sulyman Khalid, who goes by the name of Abu Bakr, appeared on SBS Insight wearing the Islamic State flag . ASIO cancelled his passport in December when he was identified as one of 20 men who ‘hold an extreme ideology’. On Saturday, police released information about Khalid’s alleged involvement in the shopping centre dispute. They said at about 8pm on August 10 a cleaner was approached by two men at Bankstown shopping centre, in Sydney’s west. He became fearful and security officers were contacted and the men were escorted out of the location. The two men returned about an hour and a half later and again approached the cleaner who was still working. During the SBS show, Khalid wore the Islamic State symbol adorned to a black sleeveless jacket as he sat in the audience . His lawyer Zali Burrows said Khalid is 'young kid who is passionate about injustice' Police then arrested Khalid at about 2.45pm on Friday 15 August in Stuart Lane, Bankstown. He was given strict bail conditions to appear at Bankstown Local Court on Wednesday 10 September. However, Khalid has claimed he was simply walking through the shopping centre after seeing a film with a friend when the cleaner – an Iraqi Christian - made a comment about his vest which was adorned with the Islamic State flag, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian government list the Islamic State as a terrorist organisation. They say it is an Iraq and Syria-based Sunni extremist group and former al‑Qa'ida affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology. The Islamic State follows an extreme interpretation of Islam which is anti-Western, promotes sectarian violence and targets those that do not agree with its interpretations as infidels and apostates. The Islamic State's announcement of a caliphate claims the land from Aleppo in Syria to Diyala in Iraq, the Sunni-dominated areas of both countries. Eventually, it aims to establish a salafist-orientated Islamist state spanning Iraq, Syria and other parts of the Levant. The cleaner apparently objected to the symbol he was wearing and Khalid claims the cleaner actually threatened him. In Iraq, Christians and Yazidis are currently being persecuted by supporters of the Islamic State, with thousands of refugees fleeing to seeking shelter in Irbil, Lebanon and Turkey. The Australian Federal Government recently opened its humanitarian refugee program to Iraqi Christians and Yazidis in response to the crisis. Khalid’s lawyer, Zali Burrows has argued a ‘verbal dispute’ between two people wouldn’t normally be treated with such important by police . She said there is a ‘witch hunt’ against Khalid since he appeared on the SBS Insight show on August 12 wearing the Islamic State symbol. 'Let’s hope the call to press charges does not further fuel the angry and dangerous mob who are bombarding my client and self with threats,’ she said. During the SBS show, Khalid wore the Islamic State symbol adorned to a black sleeveless jacket as he sat in the audience and made headlines after he walked off the show’s set part-way through filming. Burrows said she and Khalid were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The 19-year-old was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour-and-a-half later and further abused the cleaner . The 'black flag of jihad' as used by various organisations since the late 1990s consists of a white-on-black shahada . Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation. 'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter,' Burrows said of her client. Before the SBS TV discussion, fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie, aired Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client walked out because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'. Khalid believes Muslims are obligated to help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia. 'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added. Last week was not the first time Burrows has fallen out with TV execs over their portrayal of her client. In January this year she managed to stop a TV show where he was interviewed from airing on Channel Seven. Khaled Sharrouf is one of Australia's most wanted terrorists after fleeing Sydney in December on his brother's passport. He is now reportedly fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . Sharrouf is reportedly in the Middle East with his five children after his wife Tara Nettleton left Australia with them in February . Burrows won a last-minute injunction in the NSW Supreme Court to prevent Today Tonight running the segment after she told the court she agreed to them interviewing Khalid on the condition that he would have ‘editorial control’ of and the ‘final say’ before it was shown on TV. She said there had been a breach of contract as she was given the impression the show would focus on the unfairness of the process that led to the cancellation of Khalid’s passport. Khalid is by no means alone in Sydney with his blatant support for the Islamic State, an Iraq and Syria-based Sunni extremist group and former al Qa'ida affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology. On August 19 Wissam Haddad, the head of the al-Risalah Islamic Centre in Sydney’s southwest, revealed he too followed the ‘flag of Allah’, the Daily Telegraph reported. He denounced the Australian flag and said the Shahada, used by Islamic Stat militants, is a flag he will ‘live and die’ for. Islamic groups have expressed concerns over proposed new anti-terror powers, as they fear they will be unfairly targeted. Mr Abbott said Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience. Prime Minister Tony Abbott met with community leaders in Sydney at a conference this week after Islamic groups expressed concerns over proposed new anti-terror powers, as they fear they will be unfairly targeted. Mr Abbott said Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience . He told the conference that the laws were not about protecting 'one group of Australians from another group of Australians', in an apparent reference to concerns from the Muslim community, and said it was in the 'absolute interests' of every community to 'expose and to counter any potential for home-grown terrorism'. Mr Abbott is concerned that the 150 Australians involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq may bring their radicalised view of Islam back to Australia. 'The last thing we should be is complacent about this,' Mr Abbott said. Earlier, in an interview with Macquarie Radio, he urged moderate Muslims to join the 'Team Australia' fight against locally-bred extremists. 'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia,' he said. 'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.' He was also asked about reports that shops in Sydney's southwest were flying Islamic State flags despite the group being listed as a terrorist organisation. 'I don't know what the legal position is, but frankly, the only flag that should be flying is the Australian national flag,' he said.

Alleged Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is shown her preaching . 'If people want to fly other flags - a corporate flag for instance - fine, but the Australian national flag should always be part of it.' A former NSW counter-terrorism detective, who was a lead investigator in Australia’s biggest ever terror trial in 2005, has told Daily Mail Australia people should be concerned about how young men are becoming indoctrinated in Australia. Peter Moroney, a lead investigator in Operation Pendennis which originally busted homegrown terrorist Khaled Sharrouf as part of a large terrorist cell planning to carry out attacks in Sydney and Melbourne, said removing peoples' passports won’t change their beliefs. ‘It might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from Australia,’ he said. The 40-year-old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police, ASIO or the Islamic community. 'It’s not something that's going to go away. People's beliefs don't go away. You're investigating a belief system and what is driving them is their beliefs. It’s not like drug crimes that are motivated by money or greed. It’s hard to police.’ He also noted that cancelling passports does not necessarily stop people from travelling to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State fighting. Sharrouf travelled to Syria in December last year by using his brother’s passport, he is now allegedly carrying out beaheadings and posting pictures of severed heads on Twitter. Just last week immigration officials detained a Sydney teenager as he arrived in Abu Dhabi after using his brother’s passport to fly out of Sydney International Airport. ASIO reportedly believe the 19-year-old was on his way to Syria and Iraq. Anthony Whealy QC, the former judge who presided over the trial of the Terror Nine, told Daily Mail Australia in general terms that there are a number of factors that lead younger people on the path of extremism. 'Sometimes they come under the influence of a fanatical sheik or imam, that's what happened with Khaled Sharrouf. 'The second thing is a bit of peer pressure from young people who are equally angry and probably a bit equally angry and probably a bit disturbed and deprived. 'Thirdly I think the internet is a form of radicalisation that can't be underestimated.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . For the first time in four thousand years the ancient language called PIE can be heard thanks to decades of research. In a recording Dr Andrew Byrd, a linguistics expert from the University of Kentucky, reads the parable of the sheep and  the horses in an ancient language called Proto-Indo-European, or PIE. Even though there is no written record of the language, Dr Byrd has managed to recreate an approximate version based on knowledge of ancient texts in Indo-European languages, such as Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. The Kurgan hypothesis is the most likely explanation for how culture and language spread across early Europe and Asia . The language was last spoken between approximately 4,500 and 2,500 B.C by our ancestors from all over Europe and Asia. The parable itself was actually written in 1868 by German linguist Dr. August Schleicher, who then translated the story into PIE as a way to experiment with the vocabulary, according to Archaeology magazine. There is no way to create a definitive version of the language and Byrd says his pronunciation is 'a very educated approximation.' Audio source Soudcloud Archaeology . The parable of sheep and horses as it appears when translated into PIE, an ancient language which helped create English . Speaking to Huffington Post, he said: 'Languages differ on how they pattern their sounds together, and they use those sounds to create new words. Proto-Indo-European is very guttural.' Despite the interest in his recording, Byrd says that he has no intention to create any more, mostly because he would first have to create new stories as no written examples exist. Some of the many modern languages that stem from the Indo-European family include English, Swedish and Farsi. Byrd added: 'Farsi and English were 6,500 years ago the same language. That's pretty cool, and it kind of gives you a sense of unity.' Because of the lack of available information, PIE is a debated topic among researchers. Byrd believes PIE was probably spoken on the Eurasian steppes around 6,500 years ago, but other researchers recently introduced a controversial new theory that it was spoken several thousand years earlier in Turkey. Sadly we will probably never know what PIE actually sounded like, and Byrd joked that the only way to create a definitive recording was to invent a time machine. 'A sheep that had no wool saw horses, one of them pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly. The sheep said to the horses: ""My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses."" The horses said: ""Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool."" Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.'","Proto-Indo-European, or PIE, was spoken across Europe and Asia .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . Thousands of people in Israel, Turkey and Jordan got the shock of their lives yesterday, as they watched a spinning 'UFO' performing cartwheels in the sky. Police in these countries - as well as in Cyprus and Lebanon - were flooded with phonecalls by panicked residents, as the white, gleaming light danced high up in the atmosphere. Theories abounded over what this could be - a failing missile test, a satellite breaking up in our atmosphere, or a visit from an alien spacecraft. Scroll down for video: . Spirals in space: The strange sighting looked like a Catherine Wheel as it span over Jordan, Isreal and other countries last night . Last year, thousands of people in Israel, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon and Jordan called police as a white, gleaming light danced high up in the atmosphere . However, the mysterious light does appear to be earth-based technology, with the the spiral of light looking very similar to a Russian missile test which similarly scared people in Norway in 2009 with a light-show which seemed more Doctor Who than anything else. The event began at around 8:45pm in the evening, and after a few hours of panic, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said a test rocket had been launched just six minutes before that time. They called it a successful launch, although a leaked and then supressed video apparrently shows the missile beginning to fail. If this is the case, then the spirals of light in the sky is fuel spewing out from the missile as it burns in a fierce cartwheel through the sky, creating the startling geocentric shapes. The missile is thought to be 120 to 180 miles in the sky which, at the top end of the scale, is roughly half as high as the International Space Station, at 345miles. This amazing, mysterious beam was spotted over Norway in December 2009: This was later confirmed as a Russian missile breaking up, with the light display made by the missile spinning as it flew into the atmosphere . After days of speculation, it was revealed the sight was a Russian Bulava missile spinning out of control . If it was a missile exploding at that height, it explains why the spectacle could be seen from such a wide swathe of countries. Israeli Astronomical Association Chairman Dr. Yigal Pat-El said it was most likely a missile: 'It most likely spun out of control and its remnants and the fuel was what people saw. 'It reached a height of 200-300 kilometers and that's why it was seen from so many locations.' A witness said: 'We saw a large trail of light traveling from a distant spot in the sky. 'We could not see the source of the light. The trail was massive. It was an unusual sight. Moments later we saw swirling movement where the light was coming from.' The Russian Defense Ministry statement said the country had successfully test-fired a Topol strategic intercontinental ballistic missile from Russia’s Astrakhan region, to a testing area in Kazakhstan - approximately 2,000 miles from Israel’s northern border. In 2009, Norway’s northern town of Tromso were given a similar display. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted later this was a failed test of a Bulava intercontinental missile.

"By . Carol Driver . Holidaymakers have been warned to stay out of the water at nine popular beaches after heavy rain caused sewage to spill into the sea. Bathers have been told not to enter the sea below the high water mark - the area of sand reached during a high tide – and signs have been erected warning of the dangers. The sewage discharge affects nine beaches in Thanet, Kent, which relies heavily on summer tourism.They include: Walpole Bay, Palm Bay, Botany Bay, Kingsgate Bay, Joss Bay, Stone Bay, Viking Bay, Louisa Bay and Dumpton Gap. Scroll down for video . Partially closed: Kingsgate Bay, in Thanet, Kent, has been affected by the sewage spill . Bathers were still allowed to go on the rest of the beach which remained open to the public. All of these beaches are popular with day-trippers and holidaymakers, particularly those who stay at the nearby seaside towns of Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate. The source of the sewage leak was being examined by staff from the Environment Agency, working with officials from Southern Water and Thanet District Council. The leak was said to have been caused by the heavy rain which swept through the area on Monday but a more detailed assessment was still taking place today. Warning: Bathers have been told to keep out of the water in Joss Bay in Kent due to the sewage leak . The investigators were also trying to establish the impact on public bathing areas, hoping the overflow would break up. A Thanet council spokesman said: ‘We are working with the Environment Agency to reduce the impact of the spillages as much as possible and water sample tests will be carried out in the areas affected today to assess the quality of the water. Southern Water have contractors out clearing the waterline. ‘The council is keen to reassure members of the public that other beaches across the district are fully open and will advise if the area affected extends to any other beaches.’ This latest incident follows a previous sewage discharge on May 21 this year and Southern Water is already under investigation by the Environment Agency. It was also still being probed by the EA after several similar overflows in June 2013 caused by a failure of a pumping station at Foreness Point. A spokesman for Southern Water said: 'We released heavily diluted stormwater through our outfalls at Foreness Point Pumping Station, Margate, during storms last night to prevent homes and businesses flooding. 'The stormwater, the vast majority of which was rainwater, was screened and the site operated as it should – and as approved by the Environment Agency. 'The pumping station was working correctly and initially pumping hundreds of litres per second away for treatment. 'However, as the intensity of the rainfall increased, the site’s stormwater storage tanks - which hold 12 million litres of stormwater - filled up, and therefore the site operated as designed, first releasing screened stormwater through the 2km long sea outfall, then through the 600m short sea outfall.'","Areas popular with daytrippers partially closed due to sewage leak .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Matt Chorley . Intrusive new powers to spy on the last 12 months of everybody’s bank statements are being demanded by the taxman. In a major escalation of its existing rights, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants to be able to access monthly copies of bank, Isa and even joint account statements. This would mean sensitive personal details such as the size of families’ monthly mortgage payments, how much they spend in restaurants and the amount saved into a tax-free nest egg are open to scrutiny. Under the powers, HMRC would examine spending levels for a year before raiding accounts for unpaid tax . Last night, critics condemned the . unprecedented power grab as ‘Big Brother’ tactics. It is the latest . twist in the furore over HMRC’s plans to take money directly from bank . accounts to settle unpaid tax bills. At least 17,000 people a year will . have funds seized under the proposed new powers. But . yesterday HMRC chief executive Lin Homer went further, telling MPs on . the Treasury Select Committee she also wants to be able to ask banks or . building societies to hand over 12 months of a person’s bank or Isa . statements. This is to check their income flow so officials can be sure the money will be there when they swoop on the account. Ms Homer even suggested that if HMRC is given the power, a ‘debate will follow’ about extending it to other public bodies such as retrieving money owed for TV licences or car tax. But she told MPs she accepted there was a risk that HMRC could make mistakes when targeting someone’s finances. Under the powers, HMRC would contact people who owe money up to nine times and if they fail to respond their bank account would be frozen for 14 days. During this ‘cooling off period’, tax officials want to have access to a year’s worth of bank statements to assess whether the person can live on what money might be left if their taxes are taken from their account. HMRC says it would leave £5,000 in accounts once the debts have been removed. Labour MP George Mudie said: ‘This is another intrusion into people’s lives. 'You are going to have the power to get 12 months’ bank accounts from people, building societies… the lot.’ HMRC chief executive Lin Homer insisted the powers were needed to target 17,000 'recalcitrant debtors' but Lib Dem MP John Thurso said it was a 'unique right to go against the Magna Carta charter' The taxman fails to answer more than one in five phone calls. MPs demanded ‘resignations on the table’ unless significant improvements were made. HMRC admitted it would not be able to guarantee to answer 90 per cent of calls this year, as it brought in hundreds of extra staff to deal with peak periods. According to latest figures, in 2013-14, the HMRC answered just 79 per cent of calls to its call centres. Labour MP George Mudie said there must be improvements or there should be ‘resignations on the table’. He raged: ‘It’s no use trying. Trying is not the word. Either do it or go, that’s quite straightforward. You are harming a tremendous amount of people.’ Ms Homer insisted ‘significant progress’ was being made, but would like it to be ‘much better’. ‘It is one of the most important things we are doing.’ Liberal . Democrat John Thurso led a chorus of criticism of the move. He said: . ‘We are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state... to have the unique right to go against the Magna Carta and all the other . things we have established and to go in and seize – without judicial . process or review – a bank account. 'I just want to know if it is . justified, because my sense is that Parliament is going to reject it.’ Mr Thurso said that HMRC was trying to become 'judge, jury and executioner' and to remove legal protections from those who it believes owe tax, simply because it was 'slow and expensive' to follow the legal processes. He demanded to know whether the taxman would pay compensation in full if it removed money from people's bank accounts or ISAs in error and their house purchase fell through or they missed out on a windfall from rising share prices as a result. But Ms Homer insisted: 'I don't think this is against Magna Carta. I don't think it is substantially different from the PAYE arrangement. 'This is not disputed tax, this is tax that is due, that people who are not subject to PAYE are choosing simply not to pay and they are creating an environment within which the normally very low collection cost of tax is made substantially higher by their action, in a way which in the vast majority of cases is wilful. 'I believe that for the taxpayer as a whole, it is right that we have sufficient powers to stop these limited numbers of people avoiding paying tax.' More than 90 per cent of people pay their taxes, but a minority take the view that they will delay paying for as long as they can get away with it, said Ms Homer. 'We are talking about 17,000 people who don't dispute the tax is due, they just don't pay,' she said. 'We will have written to them, we will have engaged with them and they just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action. 'Of course, we can go to court, but the cost both in time and money of going to court will often outweigh or seriously diminish the amount of tax collected. In these cases, we believe with proper safeguards... this is a fairer way of extracting the tax everybody is due to pay.' The plan to take money directly from people’s bank accounts was announced in the Budget. But . the proposal to scrutinise statements emerged only  yesterday when HMRC . officials were questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. At present, the taxman is only allowed to know how much interest you have received from your bank accounts. Last . night, an HMRC spokesman insisted the new information it is demanding . would not be used for ‘any purposes other than the direct recovery of . debts’. He said: ‘We would immediately destroy the information once DRD [direct recovery of debts] has  been applied.’ Warning: David Beckham . Celebrities such as David Beckham, the Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw and around 1,300 other people have been warned to prepare for tax demands of more than £520million. They have been caught up in a £7billion crackdown by the Treasury that forces people to immediately pay disputed tax bills if they have used an alleged tax-avoidance scheme. Beckham, Mr Laidlaw and other investors are, or have been, clients of Ingenious Media, an investment company that financed films. The firm says it is ‘fundamentally unjust’ to demand payment for tax bills before a tribunal, due to begin in November, takes place. 'THIS GOES AGAINST THE MAGNA CARTA' HMRC’s new powers will ‘go against the Magna Carta’ by allowing it to seize money without needing the permission of the courts, an MP said yesterday. In the Magna Carta, which will celebrate its 800th anniversary next year, Article 39 states: ‘No free man shall be seized or imprisoned or stripped of his rights or possessions… nor will we proceed with force against him or send other to do so except by the lawful judgment of his equals, or by the law of land.’ Lord Thurso, a LibDem MP, said: ‘We are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state to go against the Magna Carta and seize – without judicial process – a bank account.’ HMRC . says it wants to look at the bank statements in order to make sure that . a person will not suffer hardship after the money is removed to pay the . tax debt. It has promised . all those targeted will be left with a minimum of £5,000 across their . accounts after the tax debt has been paid. It will also not seek to . ‘create or increase overdrafts’. Mrs . Homer told MPs that the people who will be targeted by the new . money-grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax, but simply refuse. ‘They don’t dispute that the tax is due,’ she said. ‘They just won’t pay. They just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action.’ But . Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered . Certified Accountants, said: ‘There is a dangerous sense of “Big . Brother” about it. 'There is a fear that this will set a precedent for . HMRC and other government agencies [such as the collection of unpaid . council tax]. ‘This is a dangerous route to begin to go down. ‘These . powers, if implemented, will affect families and individuals, as well . as small businesses, up and down the country and not large . multi-national businesses with armies of lawyers and accountants on hand . to prevent it happening.’ HMRC’s . consultation document says revealing bank or Isa statements would . ‘strike a sensible balance’ between ensuring it has accurate information . and maintaining the debtor’s privacy. But Lord Thurso added: ‘HMRC is asking to become judge, jury and executioner on this. ‘Is . it not very concerning that we are removing from the process that . currently exists the legal process simply because it is slow and . expensive?’","HMRC wants power to dip into bank accounts to retrieve taxes owed .

"By . Antonia Hoyle . They . are ailments many believed were consigned to the dim and distant past, . in Britain at least: gout, rickets, whooping cough, tuberculosis and . typhoid. Yet last week, the NHS Health and Social Care Information . Centre revealed that these diseases are re-emerging with alarming speed. Here, ANTONIA HOYLE hears from the experts about why we are seeing a . resurgence, and how treatments have improved over the past 100 years... FAMILIAR COMPLAINT: An 18th Century drawing of a man being treated for gout . WHAT IS IT? A . form of arthritis caused by the crystals of a compound called uric acid . forming in joints. This leads to inflammation. Alcohol and rich food . increase risk. In Victorian times, gout was associated with the . port-swilling rich. HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR? It didn't, but improvements in medicine in the 20th Century meant it was more easily treated. WHY IS IT BACK? 'Obesity . and alcohol consumption is not confined to the rich any more,' says Dr . John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health. Last . year 86,866 patients with gout were admitted to hospital - an increase . from 48,717 patients in 2009. HOW IS IT TREATED? THEN: 'Opium was . taken with whisky, and cocaine was used as an anaesthetic,' says Carla . Valentine, curator at Barts Pathology Museum in London. NOW: Ice . packs and painkillers ease discomfort while a drug called allopurinol . lowers uric acid levels. Eliminating alcohol and red meat from the diet . reduces the risk of future attacks. Rickets is a predominantly childhood disease that is caused by Vitamin D deficiency . RICKETS . WHAT IS IT? A . predominantly childhood disease that is caused by Vitamin D deficiency . and leads to 'soft' bones. During Victorian times, rickets was epidemic . because smog in cities blocked natural sunlight, a primary source of . Vitamin D. HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR? In the early 20th Century, foods started being fortified with Vitamin D. WHY IS IT BACK? One . in four children is now not getting enough sunlight. 'This is . compounded by efforts to prevent skin cancer,' says Dr Middleton. 'Actually people need exposure  to the sun, little and often.' Dietary . deficiency is also to blame - an increase in breastfeeding has . exacerbated the problem as breast milk contains less Vitamin D than . formula brands. There were 702 cases in 2012, up from 561 cases in 2008. HOW IS IT TREATED? THEN: . From the 1700s, cod liver oil has been used to combat rickets. In the . 20th Century all schoolchildren were prescribed cod liver oil until the . 1950s. NOW: The Government recommends all children under five take . daily Vitamin D supplements.

An . infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also impact  on the . bones and the nervous system. Symptoms include a persistent cough, . weight loss, night sweats, fever and tiredness. TB - historically called . consumption - killed one in four people during Victorian times. HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR? Less . crowded living conditions in the 20th Century cut infection. Administration of the BCG vaccine from the 1920s, the discovery of . antibiotics in 1928 and the introduction of the antibiotic streptomycin . also helped. WHY IS IT BACK? The rise in immigration from Eastern . Europe where TB is more common, and our increasingly crowded cities. In . 2011, 8,963 cases of TB were reported in the UK. 'We need better . treatment services to identify people in the early stages,' says Dr . Middleton. HOW IS IT TREATED? THEN: 'People were quarantined in . sanatoriums in the countryside,' says Carla Valentine. 'They were also . put in a steam room with herbs to clear their lungs.' NOW: Extra BCG . vaccines for babies in high-risk areas. Sufferers are prescribed . antibiotics. 'There is a new test that exposes people who have TB - even . if they are not displaying symptoms - so they can be given a course of . antibiotics,' says Dr Middleton. TB is an infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also impact on the bones and the nervous system . WHOOPING COUGH . WHAT IS IT? A . bacterial infection of the lungs and airways, it begins with a . persistent dry cough and progresses to fever and bouts of coughing that . have a 'whooping' noise. In the Victorian era it killed more than 1,000 . people a year. WHY DID IT DISAPPEAR? A vaccine introduced in the 1950s. WHY IS IT BACK? Since . the 1990s, new vaccinations have proved less powerful, and the bacteria . that cause whooping cough are more resistant to them. Dr Middleton says . isolated pockets of people in deprived areas haven't been immunised. The biggest spike in cases since 1959 happened in 2012 when in the first . ten months of the year there  were 7,728 reported cases, with 13 babies . believed to have died. HOW IS IT TREATED? THEN: 'Patients were rehydrated with a mixture of sugar and salt water,' says Valentine. NOW: . Antibiotics. All pregnant women are offered a vaccine. Children are . vaccinated at two, three and four months, and then given a pre-school . booster. Typhoid/cholera are bacterial infections caught by drinking contaminated water . TYPHOID/CHOLERA . WHAT ARE THEY? Bacterial infections . caught by drinking contaminated water. Symptoms include diarrhoea, . sickness and fever. Both diseases were epidemic in Victorian times . because of poor sewerage systems. One in five affected died. HOW DID THEY DISAPPEAR? With new vaccines in the late 19th Century and the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s. WHY ARE THEY BACK? Because . we're bringing back the infections from abroad. 'It is a consequence of . international travel,' says Dr Middleton. There are an estimated 500 . cases of typhoid each year in the UK. Although no cases of cholera have . originated in England and Wales for more than 100 years, there were 12 . reported cases of Britons infected abroad during 2012. HOW ARE THEY TREATED? THEN: Salt water and sugar for dehydration, and bed rest. NOW: Antibiotics.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A 37-year-old man allegedly beat his mother's boyfriend with brass knuckles before shooting him in the stomach for having mixed-race grandchildren. Craig Wilson, 45, was allegedly attacked by Jeff Daniels at a rural Mississippi home on Friday night, two weeks after the older man found a burning cross in his yard - a hallmark Ku Klux Klan intimidation technique. Police went to see the cross but he did not want to press charges. Relatives said that the fight unfolded on Friday because Daniels was angry that Wilson's mixed-race grandchildren were at the home. Yet because the suspect and victim - who survived the attack but remains hospitalized - are both white, police said the assault can't be classified a hate crime under Mississippi state law. Scroll down for video . 'Racist attack: Jeffery Daniels, 37 (left), allegedly beat and shot his mother's boyfriend, Craig Wilson (right), for having mixed-race grandchildren. Wilson survived the attack and is in fair condition . Innocent: Relatives said Jeffrey Daniels was furious that Craig Wilson invited his daughter's mixed-race children (pictured) to stay at his Mississippi home . 'That's the way I read the law,' Smith County Sheriff Charlie Crumpton told The Clarion-Ledger. 'I told my assistant district attorney that the law is very clear that the victim has to be a different race in order for it to be a hate crime.' Wilson has undergone surgery for the gunshot wound to his intestines and has since been . upgraded from a critical to fair condition at the University of . Mississippi Medical Center. The sheriff could not say if the attack and the burning cross were connected, but Daniels has denied being involved in the cross incident. 'I didn't know nothing about no cross,' Daniels, who spent three nights in jail for a charge of aggravated assault, told the Clarion-Ledger at his home in Raleigh on Tuesday. He insisted he was walking his dogs two miles away from their house at the time. But his mother Gaylene Daniels, who has been in a relationship with Wilson for 12 years, told the Carion Ledger that she saw her son's dog, Jack Daniels, as she opened the door and saw the burning cross. She added that she had heard of his anger about the children but never told her about it personally. When she confronted him about it, it caused a row but she stopped it, worried that he would return and hurt them, she said. Just days later, the violent argument erupted in the home. Survived: Craig Wilson has been upgraded from a critical to a fair condition in hospital. He was allegedly viciously beaten with brass knuckles before being shot in the stomach . Threat? Relatives said two weeks before Daniels allegedly assaulted Wilson, someone left a burning cross at the front of Wilson's home - a hallmark Ku Klux Klan intimidation technique . Wilson's relatives told WTOC the violence erupted about 8pm Friday when Daniels and his son stormed Wilson's home shouting racist slurs. They said Daniels was angry Wilson was letting his mixed-raced grandchildren sleep over; Wilson's daughter, Whitney Wilson, is white and has children with a black man. The . men allegedly got into a heated argument before Daniels beat Wilson . with brass knuckles and a stick, and when Wilson went to grab his gun, Daniels grabbed it and shot him. Gaylene Daniels said her son then came up and grabbed her and said: 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.' But speaking to the Clarion Ledger, Daniels claimed that the fight took place after he heard his daughter was at the home . and he went there to see her. As he . arrived at the home, Wilson approached him with a gun, he said, and a . scuffle on the ground ensued. He said Wilson punched him six times so he . could get the gun off him and shoot. Julie Wilson, the victim's sister, considers the attack a hate crime. 'They called him some severe names and then they told him to leave and they chased him off his porch around his house and beat him with brass knuckles and shot him with his own gun,' she told WTOC. Daughter: Craig Wilson's daughter Whitney Wilson (pictured) has mixed-race children. The children's father is black . Julie Wilson also said the threats to keep the mixed-race grandchildren away have been ongoing. 'He (Daniels) told everybody that he would die for his children and to him the grandchildren are like his and he almost paid the price this weekend,' she said. WDAM reported Daniels had been arrested for assault several times before. According to the Rankin County Sheriff, Daniels was arrested in January for encouraging is son to fight other teens. Daniels was charged with two misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and convicted of one.

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . Hostess Brands has announced it will close the suburban Chicago bakery where the Twinkie was invented in 1930, cutting 400 jobs and shuttering a piece of American baking history. On Wednesday, the company said it plans to close the Schiller Park bakery in October. Hostess Brands CEO Bill Toler said the company is closing the plant as it tries to improve efficiency, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. National treasure: Twinkies were invented in a suburban Chicago bakery in 1930 - but the company behind the sweet treat has now announced that the bakery will be shutting down in October to improve efficiency . 'While the old Hostess company was in bankruptcy, many competitors took over the shelves and are tenaciously defending their business and thus we must be highly efficient and technologically advanced to compete,' he said. Hostess filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The plant's employees were stunned by the news, Donald Woods said. He is president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco workers and Grain Millers International Union Local 1. 'They were working like 12 hours, six days a week, and they were looking for this plant to be a part of their future,' he said, adding that the workers voted in May to rejoin the union. They had been told the company planned to keep the plant open long term, he said. Site: The Schiller Park bakery, pictured, re-opened last year following the company's bankruptcy, and workers were told the company would keep it open long term. Employees said they were shocked by the U-turn . The company said they will be providing severance packages as well as outplacement services, and the workers' union will push for employees to be relocated to other plants. The bakery had just reopened a little over a year ago as Twinkies returned to store shelves after Hostess' bankruptcy. At the time, Hostess brands were sold off to different buyers. Metropoulos & Co. and Apollo bought Twinkies and other Hostess cakes for $410 million. The spongy, cream-filled snack cake was invented in Schiller Park in 1930 by a bakery manager looking for uses for idle shortcake pans.","The bakery at Schiller Park, which re-opened in July last year following the company's bankruptcy, will close again in October 'to improve efficiency'

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Times are so tough, even the tooth fairy is feeling the pinch. She has left on average $3.40 per tooth around the nation — or about 30 cents less than in 2013, according to a survey from Visa. The new number is an 8 percent drop in the national average compared to last year. 'She's had her wings clipped a little bit,' Jason Alderman, Visa's vice president of global financial education, told USA Today. The tooth fairy has been leaving about $3.40 per tooth in the US, a drop of 8 percent in the national average compared to the previous year . 2010: $3 . 2011: $2.60 . 2012: $3 . 2013: $3.70 . 2014: $3.40 . Source: Visa . Despite the drop, prices in 2014 are still higher than in recent years. In the last five years, the tooth fairy left, on average: $3 in 2010, $2.60 in 2011, $3 in 2012 and $3.70 in 2013. Tooth inflation brought the price up by more than 14 percent between 2011 and 2012, and then 23 percent between 2012 and 2013. 'Even . though it is down, this is the first real decline we've seen even . during the recession because tooth fairy inflation has far exceeded the . rate of traditional inflation,' Alderman told USA Today. Market specialists say that the amount of money the fairy leaves is a sign of our economic state of mind and consumer confidence, according to USA Today. Last year, some 6 percent of fairies left $20 bills for each tooth. This year, less than 4 percent of kids have earned $20 or more per tooth. 'Less money might be a small disappointment for kids, but it's an ideal opportunity for parents to talk to their children about the importance of saving and budgeting,' Alderman said. Visa, which has been tracking the national dollar-per-tooth average since 2009, says dads are more likely to give kids whatever they find in their pockets while moms tend to be more deliberate about paying up. On average, fathers say the fairy left about $4.20. For moms, that price was about 45 lower, or about $2.90. 'There is . no value in having the tooth fairy be excessive,' Alderman told USA Today.

"By . Simon Tomlinson for MailOnline . An Iraqi MP and United Nations relief workers today dismissed claims by the U.S. and the UK that the humanitarian crisis on Mount Sinjar was all but over. Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil claims some 70-80,000 refugees are still stranded on the mountain despite assertions from American and British leaders that they number only in their low thousands. President Barack Obama yesterday said the ten-day siege by the Islamic State had been 'broken' by missile strikes and humanitarian aid drops, allowing tens of thousands of Yazidis to escape. Downing Street also said the situation had improved so much that further aid drops may not be necessary. But Ms Dakhil said this was not the picture she was getting from other Yazidi leaders she had spoken to in the area. Scroll down for video . 'It's not true': A picture posted on Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil's Facebook page shows her in hospital (left) after she was injured when a helicopter crashed while trying to evacuate her from Mount Sinjar. She has dismissed claims by the U.S. and UK that the siege of the mountain by Islamic extremists had been 'broken' by air strikes . 'The situation is very terrible': Ms Dakhil, who is currently being treated at a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, claims up to 80,000 Yazidis are still trapped on the mountain . 'Crisis far from over': Some of refugees are still stranded on Mount Sinjar (above) despite assertions by the UK and U.S. that they were only a few thousand remain . She is currently being treated at a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, after she was injured when a helicopter crashed while trying to airlift her off the mountain. Speaking from her hospital bed, she told the New York Times: 'It’s better now than it had been, but it’s just not true that all of them are safe — they are not. 'Especially on the south side of the mountain, the situation is very terrible.' She suggested that American reconnaissance missions had only visited the north side the mountain. During a parliament session this month, Dakhil broke into tears while describing the plight of her fellow Yazidis during the onslaught by IS in northern Iraq. Her claims were backed up by the UN which said the crisis was 'by no means over'. David Swanson, a spokesman for the United Nations co-ordinator of humanitarian affairs in Iraq, said: 'Although many people managed to escape from the north side, there are still thousands of others up there, under conditions of extreme heat, dehydration and imminent threat of attack. 'The situation is far from solved.'

President Barack Obama declared victory against ISIS in Iraq at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, last night . Kieran Dwyer, the chief spokesman for the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator added that the 'problem remains grave'. Their comments came after dramatic images emerged of the moment a humanitarian air drop was made by Hercules transporters over Mount Sinjar. The image - taken from a Litening III reconnaissance pod fitted to a Tornado GR4 aircraft on Wednesday night – was released as U.S. President Barack Obama declared the Islamic State siege of the area had been 'broken' by British and American intervention. Last night, a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘The number of people still on the . mountainside was now in the low thousands, with Kurdish forces assisting . around a thousand people to get off the mountain to safety every night. ‘This . view has been reinforced by images captured by UK Tornados who flew a . surveillance mission over the mountain last night and could not identify . people in the numbers previously estimated. ‘Alongside . this surveillance mission, two C130s distributed another 22 tonnes of . aid last night to those on Mount Sinjar, including a further 13,200 . litres of clean water and 480 shelter kits. ‘We are currently reviewing the need for additional airdrops, given that there appear to be adequate supplies on the mountain.’ Persecuted: Ms Dakhil is being treated in hospital after she was injured in this helicopter crash which happened when it was trying to take her and other refugees off Mount Sinjar earlier this week . Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will today press European allies to step up efforts to support Iraq as Downing Street indicated that Britain could supply arms to Kurdish fighters to help them take on IS jihadists. The Foreign Secretary will tell his European Union counterparts that there is a need for better co-ordination on both the aid effort and getting military supplies to the Kurds, who have complained about being outgunned by the militants. It is understood the UK would provide weapons and equipment should the Kurdish leadership make a request. In Iraq, there was a breakthrough in the political deadlock as prime minister Nouri Maliki agreed to step down following the nomination of Haider Abadi. The UK has called for Mr Abadi to form an inclusive government in Iraq, following concerns that Mr Maliki's administration had marginalised Sunni Muslims and helped fuel the IS insurgency. The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been at the forefront of efforts to halt the IS advance, and their efforts have been praised for helping thousands of Yazidis flee from Mount Sinjar where they had been trapped by the jihadists. At a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and senior officials agreed it was 'vital' that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are able to tackle IS. On what equipment would be provided to the Kurds, a No 10 source said: 'It is dependent on what the Kurds would need.'

Divisive figure: Nouri Al-Maliki announces his decision to step down as Iraqi prime minister as he stands next to his successor Haider al-Abadi (far left) who world powers hope will form a more inclusive government . France has already committed to supplying materiel, with president Francois Hollande confirming the 'imminent delivery of military equipment' to Kurdish forces in a phone call with Iraqi president Fouad Massoum. But the UK has so far only agreed to transport military equipment supplied by other countries to the Kurds. At an emergency meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Mr Hammond will press for 'better co-ordination of aid and military supplies to Iraq', according to No 10. Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande have also signalled that today's meeting could result in the European Union doing more to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq, as the focus remains on the plight of thousands of refugees who have fled IS militants. The need for further UK aid drops to refugees trapped on an Sinjar's mountainside is under review as it appears there are 'adequate supplies', Downing Street said, as it noted the option would be retained in case further need emerged. A rescue mission in Iraq involving the UK military is less likely after a US special forces operation discovered that thousands of Yazidis had escaped. President Barack Obama claimed the US had broken the Islamic militants' siege on Sinjar but added air strikes would continue. Britain will continue to monitor the situation on the mountain with the US and Kurdish forces, No 10 said, with Chinook helicopters and Tornados remaining in the region.","Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil claims U.S. troops had only cleared north of mountain .

Mrs Ramsey said: ‘I’m not happy with the explanation we’ve been given . and I’m taking legal advice about what we can do next.’ She has written . to the local council, but it had already cleared the kennels of . wrongdoing.

Bertha Nellie Kelly, 66, died at the scene after her wheelchair became stuck between carriages at Gresham City Hall station, Portland, while her son John Paul Kelly, 48, passed away later in hospital. Staff at the TriMet rail service say the chair became trapped as the train was pulling away from the platform on Saturday, and that the driver may have been unaware of the accident until reaching the next station. Bertha Nellie Kelly, 66, and her son John Paul Kelly, 48, died after he jumped on to her lap at a train station in Portland, hitting the controls of her motorised wheelchair (pictured), driving them on to the tracks . The wheelchair became stuck between two carriages as the train moved away, and transport workers say the driver may not have been aware of the accident until stopping at the next station . John Kelly lived in an adult care home but often spent the day with his mother, when the pair would visit a farmer's market, according to The Oregonian. At 11.25am the pair were heading to a branch of Kmart when he became excited and jumped into her lap, hitting the control toggle and moving the wheelchair forwards. Terra Schaller, who lived two doors down from Bertha Kelly, told the paper: 'He liked to jump in her lap when he was happy. That's just what John Paul did. He liked going for a ride on her wheelchair.' Schaller added that John Kelly had been born with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, depriving him of oxygen and leaving him with severe learning difficulties. Ms Kelly's best friend and next door neighbour, Sue, was at the train station  when the accident happened and tried to stop the wheelchair, but was unable to grab it. The chair rolled off the platform and fell three foot on to the tracks where it became jammed between coupled train carriages. Neighbours of Ms Kelly said her son, who had severe learning difficulties, liked to jump into her lap and driver her wheelchair when he was excited. Friends have today laid tributes at her doorstep (pictured) Police were called to the scene at 11.35 am but were unable to save Ms Kelly, a retired nurse, or her son. Officers from Gresham police are now investigating. Transport workers said they are not sure how the driver became aware of the trapped wheelchair, but may not have realised until pulling into the next station, nearly a mile away. 'Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and loved ones of those affected and to our operator,' TriMet said in a statement. At Ms Kelly's house in Portland today, neighbours and friends had laid stuffed animals and flowers in tribute to 'a sweet, sweet lady'. She is survived by another son, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.","Bertha Kelly, 66, killed along with son John Kelly, 48 .

Now a new documentary hopes to re-ignite the hunt for Said, who may be working as a cab driver in New York. The documentary, titled The Price of Honor, took directors Neena Nejad and Xoel Pamos three years to complete, and promises to reveal new details on the case - including details from Amina's private journals and the possible whereabouts of her father. 'Amina left behind a treasure trove of secrets critical to convicting the father of her murder that no one had explored until we started investigating,' Pamos said in a press release. 'In her own words, through letters, emails and diary entries, she answered almost every question we had about this disturbing case.' Days before their death, the girls and their mother, Patricia Said, left their father over threats of physical violence, stemming from their dates with non-Muslim boys. But Patricia eventually returned home and coaxed the girls to come back as well. Then, on January 1, 2008, Said took his daughters out for a drive to get something to eat. But instead of going to a restaurant, Said shot the girls dead. In the moments before her death, Sarah had enough time to call 911 and frantically ask for help. 'My Dad shot me and my sister, I'm dying,' Sarah says in the heartbreaking recording. Said then fled with his Egyptian passport and $9,000 cash. Disapproved: The sisters were allegedly shot dead after they started dating non-Muslim boys . A private investigator believes Said may be living and working as a cab driver in New York City . While the FBI believes he may have left the country and returned to Egypt, a private investigator hired by the girl's aunt believes he is still in hiding in the U.S. Said may have gone to New York City, where he has family nearby, and could be illegally working as a cab driver. While all yellow cab drivers must pass a background test, the president of the city's Foundation of Taxi Drivers told Fox News that there are ways to get around this. 'There are 10,000 illegal drivers in New York City,' Mateo told FoxNews.com. 'It’s as easy as getting in your car and driving to the airport or picking up illegal street hails.' There is currently a $20,000 reward for Said's capture. He is described as 6-foot-2, 180 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. He is known to wear dark sunglasses inside and outside, and frequents diners including Denny's and IHOP. The Price of Honor premieres in September.","Yaser Abdel Said, 57, is still at large six years after he allegedly shot dead his daughters Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17 .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The cartoon Uncle Sam helped inspire American men to enlist in World War I, but the national figure is actually based on a real man who lived more than 200 years ago and briefly fought in the Revolutionary War. Sam Wilson was born in Arlington, Massachusetts on September 13, 1766 and went on to become a wealthy meat-packer and business owned in Troy, New York. It was his government contract supplying provisions to U.S. troops during the War of 1812 that Uncle Sam first inspired the larger-than-life caricature. Inspiration: The character Uncle Sam is actually based on a real man who lived more than 200 years ago, and owned a slaughterhouse in Troy, New York . But Wilson's service to the U.S. started in 1781, when he enlisted in the Revolutionary Army at the age of 15. By the time he joined, the war was near a close and young Wilson was deemed too weak to fight on the battlefield. So he spent his six months with the army guarding cattle, mending fences and helping to slaughter and package meat. He took that skill with him when he moved to Troy, New York with his brother several years later. The Wilson brothers were one of the first pioneer families in the community and established several local businesses there, including a brick-making company. Eventually Wilson bought a parcel of land to start a meat-packing business, and when the War of 1812 broke out, he secured an important contract to feed the soldiers in New York and New Jersey for a year. Legend: A statue memorializes the real Uncle Sam near his birthplace of Arlington, Massachusetts . The 6,000 barrels of pork and beef that E&S Wilson slaughterhouse shipped to the soldiers in Greenbush, New York were stamped with the label 'E&S - U.S.'. Most of the soldiers stationed in the area were from Troy and familiar with Sam Wilson, who was given the nickname Uncle Sam in the community. So the soldiers associated the U.S. stamp with meaning both Uncle Sam and United States. Soon all provisions, whether they came from E&S Wilson or not, were referred to as Uncle Sam's. After the war, an author writing under a pseudonym published 'The Adventures of Uncle Sam: In Search After His Lost Honor' - one of the first references to Uncle Sam as the national personification. In the book, Uncle Sam was referred to as a meat packer, which lines up with the real Sam Wilson's background. But it wasn't until 1860 that Uncle Sam started to resemble the character we know today. It was artist Thomas Nash who illustrated Uncle Sam as a tall, goateed, thin man wearing a pin-striped suit and star-spangled top hat. In real life, Sam Wilson was actually clean shaven. James Montgomery Flagg used Nash's character as the basis for the most famous iteration of Uncle Sam. In 1917, Flagg created the famous 'I Want You for U.S. Army' propaganda poster which went on to sell more than 4million copies after appearing on the cover of Leslie's Weekly.","Sam Wilson was born in Massachusetts in September 1766 .

"By . Fiona Macrae . It is the stuff that superheroes are made of.  But the power to see round corners could soon be yours. British scientists are creating a camera that can peer round corners without the aid of a mirror. By taking pictures at the speed of light, it should be able to reveal hidden objects – from people, to parked cars, to military tanks. 21st century periscope: The invention consists of a laser, a super-fast camera which sits beside it and a computer (gadget pictured) It could be used by the Army to distinguish friend from foe, by rescue teams searching for survivors in collapsed buildings or mines, or simply by motorists who struggle to reverse park. Inventor Jonathan Leach, of Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, said: ‘It’s very James Bond, it’s very Superman.’ His invention consists of a laser, a super-fast camera which sits beside it and a computer. To see something that is around a corner, the laser is pointed so that its light ricochets off a wall and onto the hidden object. Some of this light will automatically bounce back off the object and back onto the wall and a tiny fraction will go back towards the camera. A normal camera, such as one in a mobile phone, takes 30 shots a second. While this may seem fast, light travels so quickly that the reflected light would have time to shoot past the camera and travel to New York before phone took a single photo. In contrast, the new camera takes 15billion shots a second, making it fast enough to catch the reflected light. The technology could be used by the military (graphic, pictured), by rescue teams searching for survivors in collapsed buildings or mines, or simply by motorists who struggle to reverse park . And at ten times more sensitive than the human eye, it has no trouble detecting the faint reflection. A computer then uses the amount of time the light spent travelling to the camera and the pattern of the reflections to work out the shape of the object and how far away it is. Dr Leach said: ‘You can work out from the unique way that light bounces of walls and comes to our camera, if it was a car, if it was a human, if it was a dog. ‘Those different objects interact differently with light in a way that our camera can detect. ‘In a similar sense, if an object is further away, light will take longer to come to our camera.  If an object is closer, it will take a shorter amount of time.’ Dr Leach, who is showcasing the equipment all week at the Royal Society’s Summer Exhibition in London, said the camera could eventually be used by the military to tell ally from enemy. Motorists could also use it to help with parking or tell them if there is a pedestrian round the corner. However, his immediate goal is to prove the camera can actually see round corners.  Although all the science says it can, the proof will come next week when tests whether it can tell the difference between cut outs of the letters ‘A’ and ‘B’ hidden round a corner.","Gadget invented by Jonathan Leach, of Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . David Gregory endured months of humiliating speculation that NBC executives were planning to fire him as moderator of 'Meet the Press.' When he finally got the boot last week, he left with nary a bad word to say about the network - telling his Twitter followers that he is leaving NBC 'humbled and grateful.' The New York Post reports that Gregory's gracious exit from NBC was ensured thanks to a $4million payoff he received before he was kicked off the Sunday talk show and replaced with chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd. Gregory's contract dictated that he had to be paid into next year. The network also paid a severance package after he signed a non-disparagement contract, sources tell the newspaper. Gregory wasn't even allowed to host one final episode of 'Meet the Press' after he was given the boot. NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell sat in the moderator's chair today. Todd will take over next month. Scroll down for video . Out with the old, in with the new: David Gregory (left), who has hosted 'Meet the Press' for six years, could be replace with Chuck Todd (right) as early as this Sunday . Andrea Mitchell filled in a moderator of 'Meet the Press' on the first Sunday after Gregory was fired. He wasn't even allowed to host a farewell show . The 43-year-old Gregory, who had been at the helm of the show for six years since the death of Tim Russert, has overseen a precipitous drop in ratings. After 15 years at the top of the Sunday political talk show heap, 'Meet the Press' has the lowest ratings in more than two decades. It currently comes in third after ABC's 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.' Politico reports that executives blamed Gregory for the slide, saying he didn't seem 'engaged' about politics and policy, which doesn't bode well for the host of a program about politics and policy. Politico also claims that Gregory was not liked at NBC and that he 'rubbed his colleagues the wrong way.' The Post reports that Gregory isn't likely to be out of work long. CNN is eyeing him to became moderator of its political debate show 'Crossfire.' Last week NBC announced that chief Todd will replace Gregory as host on September 7. Shortly before NBC made the change public, Gregory took to Twitter to announce he was leaving the network: 'I leave NBC as I came - humbled and grateful. I love journalism and serving as moderator of MTP was the highest honor there is. 'I have great respect for my colleagues at NBC News and wish them all well. To the viewers, I say thank you.' Resignation: David Gregory told his 1.7million followers that he was leaving NBC. His resignation came before network executives could announce he was being replaced . A memo from NBC News President Deborah Turness praised Gregory's 'remarkable gift for holding leaders to account,' but several news sources report that he was forced out. Todd currently has his own morning show on MSNBC, 'The Daily Rundown,' which airs weekdays at 9am. Ratings for 'Meet the Press' have been slumping for years. Last year, they hit 2.9million - the lowest level in 21 years as the show fell to third behind ABC rival 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.' And ratings have continued to nose-dive.TV Newser reports that on August 3, just 2.1million people tuned in - and only 584,000 from the vital 25-54 age demographic. Earlier this week, Politico reported that NBC had anointed Todd as its new 'Meet the Press' moderator. 'The move is an effort by NBC News President Deborah Turness to restore passion and insider cred to a network treasure that has been adrift since the death in 2008 of the irreplaceable Tim Russert,' Politico's Mike Allen said. The white-haired Gregory was a rising star at NBC when he was appointed replace Russert - whose sudden death was widely mourned by the political establishment. Media watcher say NBC hopes Chuck Todd's sources and his 'political junkie' enthusiasm will draw viewers back in to the show, which is known for its long, in-depth interviews with politicians and other newsmakers. Todd, 42, grew up in Miami and is a devoted University of Miami Hurricanes fan. He attended George Washington University in Washington, DC. - first majoring in music, then in political science - but never graduated. He has served as NBC's chief White House Correspondent since 2008. Politico reports that he has since developed a devoted following of  politicians, policymakers and other Washington insiders. 'Meet the Press' is one of NBC's marquee programs. On the air since November 6, 1947, it has the distinction of being the longest-running show on TV. Gregory is the 11th moderator of the show.","David Gregory has hosted the venerable political interview show for six years - since the death of then-moderator Tim Russert .

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . One is exactly the same size as David Ortiz and the other is pretty much normal for his age, but both these 13-year-olds can hit the ball straight out of the park. They may look like a (very) big brother standing next to his younger sibling, but 6'4"" Erick Figueroa and 4'8"" Ruy Martinez are quickly emerging as the stars of the 68th Little League Baseball World Series underway in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Proving that size is not everything, Martinez stunned spectators on Monday when the infielder helped Mexico to a 6-2 win over Australia with a huge third hit straight down center field in the fifth innings. Scroll down for video . Same age: Ruy Martinez, 13, stands next to Erick Figueroa, also 13 as they celebrate their individual success for Mexico and the Caribbean Region respectively at the Little League World Series in Pennsylvania this week . At totally the other end of the scale, but no less impressive, is Figueroa, who weighs in at 229 pounds. Put into perspective for those with a passing interest in the game, 13-year-old Figueroa, who represents the Caribbean team is comparable to Big Papi of the Boston Red Sox, who at 38-year-old has hit the 36th most homers in MLB history. Indeed, larger than most Major League Baseball players, Figueroa has been slugging away at the annual competition, taking the tournament by storm. Doing a quick search of baseball reference sites throws up the staggering fact that out of hundreds of professional MLB players, only 32 are at least 6'4"" and above 229 pounds. Little bit of magic: Ruy Martinez is about to strike his home run against Australia on Monday - to lead Mexico to a 6-2 win over their antipodean rivals and (right) practices in the cages beforehand . Enormous: Erick Figueroa is only 13, but the Little League player is exactly the same size as Boston Red Sox super star David Ortiz . Superstar: Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz is 6'4"" and weighs, 229 pounds - exactly the same as 13-year-old Erick Figueroa . Figueroa, from Puerto Rico, has been using his enormous comparative size to his advantage and like, tiny Martinez, helped his team swat away Australia last week. But it's not just the boys who are excelling at the Little League World Series. Mo'ne Davis, 13, is has been sending down pitches of up to 70mph as she managed two consecutive shutouts in a row. Davis led her Philadelphia team to victory last week as she became the first girl to throw a shutout in the history of the Little League World Series.

"By . Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . The USS Enterprise, a Navy ship stationed in Virginia, is slowly being taken apart. According to The Daily Press, the ship's 'inactivation' is being handled in Newport News. The ship 'will be dismantled and recycled' at Washington state's Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility after two more years in Virginia, the newspaper said. The Enterprise was active between 1962 and 2012 - and is 'the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,' The Press said. Farewell: The USS Enterprise is undergoing an 'inactivation' Rear Adm. Thomas Moore told the newspaper 'Serving on Enterprise was almost a badge of honor among those who were nuclear trained. If you didn't serve on Enterprise, you really haven't lived.' As part of the process, 'a complex in the lower decks [will have to be built] to allow for the eight reactors to be defueled,' The Press said. Program director Dave Long told the newspaper 'We've got probably half the ship or more that is uninhabited. It's dark - no electricity, no ventilation. And we've actually sectioned it off with certain barriers and locks, very safely, so people can't get lost.' Seen in 1969, the Enterprise was active between 1962 and 2012 . A ninth USS Enterprise will eventually be built and may include parts of the eighth ship being disassembled, the newspaper said. Speaking about the Enterprise's 'inactivation,' Capt. William C. Hamilton Jr. told The Press 'This is something nobody wants to do, but it has to be done. So let's have people who love the ship do it. That's the dignity of it. 'We go about our business because we have other things to do, but you can't have your dessert until you eat your peas.
