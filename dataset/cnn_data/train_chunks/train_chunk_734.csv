Charging an electric car could be as simple as finding a place to park it, as early as next year. A pilot scheme being rolled out in New York City will see a handful of wireless charging stations, that look like manhole covers, for electric vehicles. The start-up, based in the city, aims to make charging electric vehicles faster and easier with its wireless technology and app for drivers. A pilot scheme being rolled out in New York City will see a handful of manhole covers transformed into wireless charging stations for electric vehicles . HEVO's manhole points use . electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car's charging . coil. This negates the need for wires. HEVO's technology claims to charge vehicles at greater distances than other . wireless charging stations. They currently still  take between . eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle. HEVO Power has collaborated with New York University to bring the project to an area near Washington Park Square early next year. The company's website says: 'The durable, embedded hardware unit will be deployed as a sustainable infrastructure device in city streets, parking lots and garages, motor pools, highways and other highly trafficked areas.' While electric vehicles charging points are gradually being rolled out in some U.S. Cities (as well as in the UK,) it can take hours to charge a vehicle, which is not always practical. HEVO's manhole points, which are coming to New York City early next year, use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car's charging coil - negating the need for wires . HEVO's manhole points use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car's charging coil - negating the need for wires - at greater distances than other wireless charging stations, although while they are faster, they currently still take between eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle. While they might be suitable for long-stay car parks or driveways, the firm envisions that in the future the intelligent manhole covers could be placed in rows along a traffic lane to top up cars' power while they are in motion. HEVO's founder, Jeremy McCool, told Fast Company there could be 'a small strip at every yard or so that has another wireless charging plate, so as you go down the street you're collecting a charge'. The start-up's website says: 'It is the aim of HEVO today is to accelerate the . adoption of electric vehicles through the deployment of our wireless . charging network.

It also tells them how much power their vehicle has . The company said its 'green parking' and 'green loading zones' will give commuters access to reliable, premium parking locations and cost-competitive power, while the range of commercial fleets will be extended and reduce traffic congestion. There is also a HEVO app that lets users find vacant parking spots in which to charge their cars as well as tell them the perfect position to park over the intelligent manholes so their car recharges in the most efficient way possible. A 'pay it!' feature allows users of the charging point to pay their electricity bill, while a power meter shows the vehicle's charging progress so users can check on their car's power remotely. 'HEVO Power Stations provides the peace-of-mind and reliability of opportunistic charging to electric vehicle owners who are discouraged by range anxiety, limited public charging locations and higher associated vehicle costs,' the company said.

A generous widow with no close family donated almost all of her £1.7million estate to charity in her will. Jane Hutton, who developed dementia and lived in a care home near in Aberdeen, died last year aged 83. Mrs Hutton, who has been described as frugal by friends, had been married to husband Neil, but the couple had no children. The retired secretary left orders in her will for her £1,684,364 estate to be handed over to a variety of good causes after her death. Other than £14,000 she set aside to give to close friends, she gave a collection of her personal effects and £1000 to Cats Protection. She asked the rest be split between Christian Aid, HOPE Africa, World Villages for Children UK, and the British Red Cross. Each charity will be in line to receive around £410,000 each before tax. Retired secretary Mrs Hutton moved into the home shortly before her death. Gunilla Smith, 72, of Aberdeen, who developed a close friendship with the widow through exercise classes she organised, said she had been very careful with money. She said: 'Jane was never one for being front and centre and she was very frugal with her money and nobody could have guessed she was worth so much. 'When we went out she would never buy any expensive meals or any expensive drinks. 'In fact she even ran her late husband's car until it literally fell apart rather than buying a new one. 'She used to go to a group that put on shows and she would just sing at the side or have a small part, she hated being front and centre in the spotlight.' Mrs Smith added: 'I first met Jane when she was forwarded to the exercise class that I run by a nurse who was looking after her. 'She had received heart surgery on a valve and needed to do regular light exercises to get back to health. 'Jane attended my classes three times a week, and was extremely enthusiastic about it as she was in great health because of them. 'I became very friendly with her and went on holidays and days out with her as well as seeing her at the classes. Sadly her health began to deteriorate and she went into a home. Friends: Mrs Hutton, pictured surrounded by her close friends, lost her husband and the couple had no children. The animal lover left her estate to a variety of charities including Cats Protection . 'She came to class once a week but then had to give up and as her memory failed we lost the close contact that we once enjoyed.' Adeline MacDonald, 80, said Mrs Hutton had previously said she intended leaving a legacy to Cats Protection but had never hinted on the size of her estate. She said: 'She kept herself to herself. She was married but she didn't have any other family members. 'I was actually related to her as she was related to my husband. When her husband Neil died we were pretty close to each other but in later years we had sadly drifted apart as she was unwell. 'She had always said she would like to leave money to the Cats Protection as she loved cats but she did not say where the rest of her money was to go.' Matt Vincent of Cats Protection revealed Mrs Hutton had been a member of the organisation since 1987. He said: 'We are extremely grateful for all donations and gifts we receive. 'By leaving a gift to Cats Protection in her will, Mrs Hutton will help us to change the lives of some of the many cats and kittens that we care for every year. 'Without supporters like Mrs Hutton remembering us in this incredibly personal way, we simply wouldn't be the charity we are today.' A British Red Cross spokesman added: 'We are delighted Mrs Hutton has chosen the British Red Cross as one of the chrities included in her legacy.'","Jane Hutton from Aberdeen lost her husband and had no children .

"By . Duncan Gardham . PUBLISHED: . 16:14 EST, 26 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:16 EST, 27 October 2013 . ‘White widow’ terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite has reappeared on Twitter, making references to soap operas and Strictly Come Dancing. The world’s most wanted woman made the bizarre comments while tweeting about her love for jihad. The mother of four is thought to be a key member of Al-Shabaab. The Al-Qaeda-linked Somali terrorist group carried out the Nairobi mall attack last month in which 67 people were killed, including six Britons. On the run: 'White widow' Samantha Lewthwaite . Intelligence analysts believe Lewthwaite – who was married to 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay – is using a Twitter account named after the Muslim Youth Centre, a Kenyan offshoot of Al-Shabaab. Although Lewthwaite, 29, stopped tweeting in the aftermath of the Nairobi attacks, she apparently began again a fortnight ago, with her last message being posted as recently as Friday evening. One of her first tweets since the attacks said: ‘In Islam there’s no choice. It’s not like, “Do I watch EastEnders or Corrie tonight?” No shortcuts in Islam!’ It is believed the tweet is a reference to the belief among many Muslim extremists that jihad against unbelievers is obligatory. Rant: Intelligence analysts believe Lewthwaite is behind the tweets from this account, which reference British pop culture . Secret tweeter: Lewthwaite, pictured, has links to Al-Shabaab. the terrorist cell which was behind the Nairobi mall attack . Happy families: Lewthwaite was dubbed a 'white widow' after the death of her husband Jermaine Lindsay, the suicide bomber died in the 7/7 attacks on the London underground in 2005 . In another post, Lewthwaite added: ‘Muslims in Somalia don’t want to  sit at home on a Saturday evening glued to Strictly Come Dancing with its C-list “stars”:))).’ She also appears to mock British police’s arrests of UK-based terror suspects, adding: ‘Oi! You’ve been nabbed Sunny [sic] Jim!’ Although it is impossible to verify who is writing the messages, the author refers to herself as ‘a girl in Kenya’, uses British references and speaks of Lewthwaite in the third person. Intelligence analysts believe the tweets are by the fugitive widow. Lewthwaite, a former soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is said to have converted to Islam as a teenager. Identity: The person behind the tweets has said that she is 'a girl in Kenya' 'Nabbed': She appeared to comment on recent terror arrests in the UK . 'No shortcuts in Islam': Lewthwaite suggested that being a Muslim does not allow choices, such as that between EastEnders and Coronation Street . Rejected: Lethwaite added that Somalian Muslims don't want to watch Strictly Come Dancing, hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth, left, and Tess Daly, right . Calling herself by the Islamic name Sherafiyah, she met and married Lindsay in 2002. After the 7/7 attacks, she returned to Aylesbury but fled the UK by 2011, moving between Tanzania and Kenya to raise money for terrorism through fraud. She has been on the run from Kenyan authorities after she narrowly escaped a police raid two years ago. After the Nairobi attacks last month, Interpol issued an international  warrant for her arrest. A Twitter spokesman said yesterday that it did not comment on individual users’ accounts.","Samantha Lewthwaite, the world's most wanted woman, is on the run .

Despite not having appeared on the big screen for over ten years, Sir Sean Connery is the most popular British actor among American film fans, it has emerged. The James Bond star was listed as the most recognisable and well-liked actor in a recent US survey which measures the public's opinion of celebrities. The Q score charts, which are carried out every six months among 1,500 people by the New York based Q Scores Company, has released its first 'Brit Q' rankings in which the 83-year-old actor triumphed. Pictured as James Bond in 1962, Scottish actor Sir Sean Connery was named as the most popular British film star in the American poll . Other British stars to make the list of favourites were Sir Anthony Hopkins, 74, and Liam Neeson, 61. The figures, which were first compiled in 1998, show how the Scottish actor was temporarily knocked off the top spot in 2008 by House star, Hugh Laurie. Like others on the list, Laurie's popularity took a dive after his departure from the US television programme. Dame Judi Dench placed sixth while Daniel Craig, who appeared alongside her in the most recent James Bond films, came eighth. The Bond star, who is now 83, is considered a favourite as 'young men still want to be him' according to The Q Scores executive vice-president . Downton Abbey stars Dame Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton both appeared the chart as well as younger celebrities such as Kate Beckinsale, Lucy Punch and Carey Mulligan. Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe ranked at 20, while Twighlight heart-throb Robert Pattinson came 47th. The number of names on the Q Score lists vary from just 28 in 1998 to 46 in 2003, and 41 in 2008. While more seasoned actors topped the . 1998 charts, younger stars started to appear in 2003 with Catherine . Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom and Alex Kingston making the cut. Dame Judi Dench and Daniel Craig also appeared in the list's top ten after starring alongside each other in more recent James Bond films . Kate Beckinsale (left) and Keira Knightley (right) were among some of the younger stars to appear on the list . While Keira Knightley, Michelle Ryan and former EastEnders actress Saffron Burrows all featured on the 2008 chart, only Ms Knightley remained in the 2013 list. Henry Schafer, executive vice-president at the Q Scores Company, said: 'Awareness of Sean Connery and his appeal was strong across the country and with all ages. 'He had already transcended the normal run of actors in the way people felt about him.' Mr Schafer told the Sunday Times: 'British men have become more dominant over the past 15 years as they appear in more Americanmovie and TV roles as well as the awards season.' 1.

A doctor is being investigated after a grieving couple claimed their daughter was 'pushed over the edge' after she was told 'in graphic detail' how she would die of cancer. Fiona Clark, a consultant haematologist at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital, was accused of disobeying the wishes of leukaemia sufferer Vickie Harvey, 24, and her family. Her parents say Miss Harvey had told doctors that she did not want to be kept updated on her terminal condition, from which she passed away on 10 December 2013. She had been diagnosed a year earlier, but made clear she would rather not know the details of her illness. Her parents, Eric, 62 and Lynn, 58, had also asked Dr Clark to spare Miss Harvey the truth, with her father Eric allegedly begging Dr Clark not to say anything, only to have their request ignored. Miss Harvey, a beautician, had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in September 2012 and had a successful stem cell transplant on Christmas Day the same year. But after months in remission she relapsed in July last year at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. She was transferred to Worcestershire Royal Hospital near her family in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and was placed under the supervision of Dr Clark. At this point she decided would rather not be completely informed about her condition - leading to 'heartless' Dr Clark allegedly telling her that 'she was going to die'. Just two weeks later, Miss Harvey had died - and her parents say that she 'gave up' after hearing the news. They lodged a complaint with the hospital this morning. Mr Harvey said: 'When we were in Birmingham, Dr Clark phoned me up and I had to beg with her for ten minutes not to tell Vickie that she was dying. 'The nurses knew it was on her record that she didn’t want to know what was happening. It was Vickie’s wish, she told us she didn’t want to know anything bad. 'We were always frightened to death she was going to say or let slip to Vickie. Grief: Eric Harvey, 62 (left) and Lynn Harvey, 58 (right) say that their daughter 'gave up' after hearing that she would soon die . 'Then a week later Vickie had a private meeting with Dr Clark. The exam was only meant to take five minutes but we were waiting for half-an-hour. 'After 30 minutes we went in and Vickie was sobbing her heart out. We asked what was the matter and the doctor just said she was upset because she had been told she had to go back to hospital. 'But outside Vickie just turned around and said ‘Dad, she’s told me everything. She told me what’s going to happen to me and what the future holds. Young: Vickie was just 24 when she passed away - and her parents say she had been asked to be spared the details of her cancer . 'All Vickie said was: ""Isn’t there anything else you can do?"" And the doctor took that opportunity to tell her everything. 'Hearing how she was going to die in such graphic detail shattered Vickie and she just gave up.' The family also claim Dr Clark even tried to persuade Vickie’s mum Lynn, 58, to sign a ‘do not resuscitate’ form saying she 'didn’t want any hero paramedics' attempting to save her. Mr Harvey added: 'Not long after we had another meeting with the doctor and she was saying how Vickie’s blood count was going up too high. 'And Vickie’s head went down and she started crying and I had to literally carry her out of the room. 'But when I was outside, the doctor just stood there and said to my wife and my eldest daughter, ""you do know she’s going to die don’t you - this is going to kill her""’. 'She even tried to get my wife to sign a ‘do not resuscitate’ form without me in there. 'She said ""we don’t want any hero paramedics, they are just going to bring her around but she is just going to die in the A&E"". 'The doctor kept saying Vickie needed to know so she could plan what was left of her life but as soon as she knew she didn’t last two weeks. 'I think she gave up. She couldn’t eat well because of the illness but she didn’t even try. 'We knew she was going to die but I always thought she would have been here for Christmas. 'Gave up': Miss Harvey's parents say that Vickie did not even try to eat in her final weeks . 'I think she would have lasted another couple of weeks. This doctor just pushed her over the edge. 'The hospital trust have told me they are investigating Dr Clark.' In his letter of complaint to the hospital trust, Mr Harvey added he found the doctor’s attitude 'bullying and overbearing' and that they felt 'verbally abused'. Chief nursing officer Lindsey Webb said Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust would be meeting the family to look into Miss Harvey’s care.

White women are at more risk of getting breast cancer than those who are black or Asian because they are less likely to breastfeed and more likely to drink alcohol . White women are at more risk of getting breast cancer than those who are black or Asian because they are less likely to breastfeed and more likely to drink alcohol, researchers claim. A study has revealed that white women in England have the highest rates of the disease. But it warns that younger women from Asian and black communities could catch up as their lifestyles become more westernised. Researchers from Oxford University and Oxford University NHS Trust examined data on the living habits and medical and social factors of more than one million women aged 50 to 64 in England. They found that those from southern Asia had an 18 per cent lower rate of breast cancer, and black women had a 15 per cent lower rate, compared to white women. The study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, showed Asian and black women had more children than white women and were more likely to breastfeed, which is known to protect against breast cancer. Around two thirds of white women breastfed their children compared to 83 per cent of black women and 85 per cent of Asian women. Alcohol is linked to breast cancer and the study showed three-quarters of Asian women were non-drinkers, compared with 38 per cent of black women and 23 per cent of white women. Around a third of white women were on menopausal hormone therapy – which slightly raises the risk of breast cancer – compared to a fifth of Asian women and 29 per cent of black women. When the researchers excluded these and other lifestyle factors, the risk of developing breast cancer was found to be similar for women of all ethnic groups. A study has revealed that white women in England have the highest rates of the disease. But it warns that younger women from Asian and black communities could catch up as their lifestyles become more westernised . But many of the black and Asian women in the study were first-generation immigrants. The researchers warned that as later generations of women of ethnic minority origin change their lifestyles, their risk of breast cancer will increase. Author Dr Toral Gathani, from Oxford University, said: ‘In this study of largely post-menopausal women, the lower risk of breast cancer in south Asian and black women is largely explained by differences in lifestyle and reproductive patterns. ‘It’s important for women of all ethnic groups to understand the modifiable risk factors for breast cancer, such as obesity and excessive alcohol consumption, and to reduce their risk.’","Study reveals white women in England have the highest rates of disease .

Some men with prostate cancer should be offered monitoring of their condition rather than radical surgery or radiotherapy, say new NHS guidelines. Doctors treating patients with intermediate or low-risk prostate cancer should consider ‘active surveillance’ – keeping an eye on the problem rather than treating it immediately, according to the NHS watchdog. Updated guidance from Nice says prostate cancer can be slow growing and that many men will have cancer that will not cause them any harm in their lifetime. Considerations: NHS guidelines suggest some men suffering from prostate cancer should receive monitoring rather than radiotherapy (file picture) Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men. In the UK, more than 40,000 are diagnosed with it each year and the condition leads to approximately 10,000 deaths. But men with early-stage prostate cancer can live for years without their disease getting worse and many face the dilemma of deciding whether to opt for therapy which may lead to side effects or active surveillance which delays treatment. The standard treatment of radiotherapy or surgically removing the whole prostate is most effective for those with aggressive, high-risk cancers. But it can damage surrounding healthy tissue, with up to a quarter of men suffering urinary incontinence and two-thirds having erectile difficulties. Many doctors already use active surveillance, but Nice – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – is trying to formalise how it should be put into practice. The updated guidance suggests that for some men with localised, low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer, active surveillance should be offered instead of more extreme treatment options. The guidance sets out a new protocol detailing how men who choose this option should be monitored with blood tests, biopsies and physical examinations, to see if and how the cancer is developing. Patients: In the UK, more than 40,000 are diagnosed with it each year and the condition leads to approximately 10,000 deaths (file picture) Dr John Graham, chairman of the guideline development group, said: ‘All treatments for prostate cancer have serious side effects which can affect the quality of life, especially their effects on erectile function, fertility and continence. ‘This is why it is so important that men are able to understand the treatment options available to them and, with the support of their healthcare professional, are able to make a choice to suit their individual needs, both clinically and related to their quality of life.’ In 2009 a US study found that careful selection of low-risk patients followed by monitoring every six months meant many could avoid treatment without jeopardising their survival. Most patients choosing active surveillance did not suffer any spread of the disease, while one in six was cured after delayed treatment, the study showed. It added to evidence that some men can be safely spared unnecessary radical treatment which may cause side effects that can seriously impair quality of life.","Some men should be offered monitoring rather than radical surgery .

New hope: The new once-a-day treatment gives 24-hour help to asthmatics, many of whom are failing to keep the condition under control . The first once-a-day inhaler for asthma sufferers has been approved for use in Britain. The new treatment gives 24-hour help to asthmatics, many of whom are currently failing to keep the condition under control. Asthma is an inflammatory disease that constricts the airways, resulting in attacks of breathlessness that can be fatal. It affects more than five million Britons, many with moderate to severe problems. Up to three out of four of these patients have ‘uncontrolled’ symptoms despite having one inhaler to combat an attack and a second to keep the airways open. Studies show patients find it hard to follow complicated instructions about when to use different inhalers, and that incorrect use often leads to asthma attacks and the need for hospital treatment. Combined reliever and preventative treatments currently on the market need to be used at least twice a day, which some patients struggle to do, say asthma experts. The new drug called Relvar Ellipta is the first to combine a daily dose of a steroid to reduce inflammation and a new type of long-acting beta2 agonist, a drug that dilates the airways. Although some patients may also need to carry a blue inhaler for immediate relief, others will be able to dispense with them. Research shows patients use the grey palm-sized device correctly from the start and up to six weeks later. In addition, the new inhaler can be used by thousands of people living with the lung disease COPD. Dr Dominick Shaw, of Nottingham Respiratory Research Unit, said ‘Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are chronic lung diseases that affect millions of people in the UK. ‘They can severely affect a person’s ability to lead a normal life. ‘Both diseases are associated with attacks - exacerbations of the underlying disease, often triggered by infection, where symptoms worsen, breathing becomes even harder and treatment with high dose oral steroids can be required. ‘People with attacks often require an admission to hospital to treat their disease. The new drug, called Relvar Ellipta, is the first to combine a daily dose of a steroid to reduce inflammation and a new type of long-acting beta2 agonist, a drug that dilates the airways . ‘The mainstay of treatment for improving symptoms and reducing attacks for both asthma and COPD is inhaled medication; the release of Relvar Ellipta is a welcome addition in the fight against these chronic lung diseases.’ The NHS spends around £1billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma, and for COPD the costs are estimated to be over £800million. The new inhaler made by GlaxoSmithKline and Theravance costs £27.80 or £38.87 depending on the strength which is similar to some twice-daily combination inhalers. It has been approved for prescribing by GPs and asthma specialists to adults and adolescents aged 12 and older by the European Commission. As part of its assessment, the European Medicines Agency reviewed results of 10 clinical studies in 7,783 patients with COPD and 16 trials in 9,326 patients with asthma. Dr Samantha Walker, of Asthma UK, said ‘There are over 5million people with asthma in the UK and we know that a significant number find it difficult to remember to take their preventer inhalers, which sometimes have to be taken several times day. ‘We are very interested to see if using an inhaler that can be taken just once-a-day improves the regular use of preventer medicine, particularly in those whose symptoms are not managed as well as they could be and who are at an increased risk of an attack.’","New treatment combines reliever and preventative treatments in one puff .

It concluded Friday, the painting still a masterpiece but the story about the flea market all the more improbable. A federal judge has awarded ownership of a disputed Renoir painting to a Baltimore museum, citing 'overwhelming evidence' that the painting had been stolen from the museum more than 60 years ago. The judge's decision rejected the claims of a Virginia woman, Marcia 'Martha' Fuqua, who maintained that she bought the painting at a flea market for $7, even as others, including her own brother, disputed her story.

A woman claims to have bought an original painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir at a flea market in West Virginia, paying $7 for a box of trinkets and that the painting were among them. and paid $7 for a box of trinkets that included the painting. A federal judge ruled on Friday that the woman hand it over to a Baltimore museum, which proved it had been stolen in 1951 . This painting, which is only about the size of a napkin, is today worth between $75,000 and $100,000. It has been missing for over 60 years . Marcia 'Martha' Fuqua (seen left in 2010) maintained that she . bought the Renoir at a flea market in late 2009. While the judge didn't discredit her story, he said there was overwhelming evidence that the painting had previously been stolen, meaning she could not be in possession of it . In making her ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema did not pass judgment of the truthfulness of Fuqua's story. The judge said only that because the museum had shown the painting was stolen, it didn't matter how Fuqua acquired it — she could not legally gain possession of stolen property even if she acted in good faith. Fuqua did not attend the hearing. Her lawyer, Wayne Biggs, declined to comment on whether he would appeal. The napkin-sized painting made news in 2012 when an auction company announced plans to sell it on behalf of an anonymous woman dubbed 'Renoir girl' who said she bought the painting at a West Virginia flea market in 2009 for $7. The woman said she did not know the painting was a Renoir when she bought it, even though it was held in a frame with a 'RENOIR' panel attached. The auction company had expected to fetch at least $75,000, but the auction was canceled when the Baltimore Museum of Art came forward with long-forgotten records showing the painting had been stolen in 1951. Marla Diaz, attorney for the Baltimore Museum of Art, speaks to the media outside of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia January 10, 2014 . Matt Fuqua, brother of Martha Fuqua, speaks to the media outside of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia January 10, 2014 . As it turned out, Fuqua's mother, who used the name Marcia Fouquet, was an artist who specialized in reproducing paintings from Renoir and other masters, and who had extensive links to Baltimore's art community in the 1950s. In addition, Fuqua's brother, Owen 'Matt' Fuqua, told a Washington Post reporter that he had seen the painting in the family home numerous times, well before his sister supposedly bought it in 2009, though Matt Fuqua changed his story several times subsequently. The FBI seized the painting in October 2012 and has been keeping it while the courts sorted through the ownership claims. After Friday's hearing, Matt Fuqua said he was glad the museum is getting the painting and called his sister a liar. 'I'm ecstatic because the truth came out,' he said. He said a deposition he gave to lawyers supporting his sister's version of events was a lie. 'At the time, I was trying to protect her,' he said. Matt Fuqua said after the hearing that he suspects somebody gave the painting to his mother. 'She was beautiful back in the day,' he said of his mother, who died recently. 'She had a lot of suitors.' Matt Fuqua said he asked his mother many times about the painting's origins, but she wouldn't say. 'It was secretive, and I wasn't very good at keeping secrets,' Matt Fuqua said. Martha Fuqua, of Lovettsville, Va., maintained throughout the case that she bought the painting at a flea market and gave a sworn statement under penalty of perjury as part of the court case. Her lawyer tried to argue that the museum's claims were inadmissible because the documents were so old that nobody could attest to their accuracy. But Brinkema said the museum's documentation was legitimate. 'All of the evidence is on the Baltimore museum's side. None of the evidence is on your side,' Brinkema told Biggs.","Renoir known as Paysage Bords De Seine painted in 1879 .

As a result, Troyer, at 2'8"", is one of the shortest people in the world. Troyer's size has certainly made an impact on his career.

'If my parents didn't raise me in the way that they did,' he explains, 'I wouldn't be in the position I am now. 'They raised me very independent and taught me you can do anything you want to. I have an average-sized brother and an average-sized sister and I had to do everything they had to. 'We had a mid-sized farm [in Michigan], so we had to feed the cows and feed the pigs, help put the hay down. There was a lot of picking up wood and cutting down trees. It was real country.' In the new documentary Troyer hopes to reveal what life is really like when you're born small and stay that way . But the life of a farmer didn't appeal and Los Angeles beckoned, and Troyer got his first break in his mid-20s, as a stunt double for a nine-month-old baby in the 1994 film Baby's Day Out. It would be another five years before he landed his break-out role as Mini-Me in the Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, thus guaranteeing a spot in the limelight. While roles like Mini-Me did get him out of Michigan, you can't help but wonder whether he entertains a little resentment at never playing the hero and always the comic foil because of his short stature. It seems not. 'No, I love comedies,' Troyer says, swatting aside the question with professional ease. 'Me and Mike Myers had great chemistry between us. He improvises a lot and when he improvises you have to [do it too]. You have to be quick on your feet. [Mini-Me] was an important role for me, it put me where I am now.' Verne returns to his Amish roots in the documentary . But Troyer does hope that people will also see beyond his size. 'If I was average [sized] I would hope that I would still have been in a position where I'm at,' he insists. 'I would hope that people see it isn't just the size. It's also the talent, the artist inside me.' It's for this reason that he's 'a huge fan of Emmy winning actor Peter Dinklage' who stars as Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones. 'It's so great to have that character and to have him in that show,' Troyer says.  'It's a serious role and it could have been for an average-sized person. He's amazing, I can't say enough about him. It's Troyer's commitment to highlighting the humanity of people with his condition that persuaded him to participate in Incredibly Small World. 'I thought it was a great idea going into the lives of so many different little people and seeing how they lived,' Troyer says. 'To show there's many little people out there who do things that people wouldn't think they could do. 'Basically showing the world how independent we are and also the struggles that we have in the outside world. So, I thought that was a great idea.' Overcoming said struggles can certainly be challenging. But 'you have to be positive and get out there and do it,' he says. 'There's a lot of little people who think they can't do certain things, but like I say, if you put your mind to it, you can do things that average people do, just in a different way. 'For instance, for me, if I got to a public bathroom, there's a lot of door handles. 'Once I couldn't get out because I couldn't reach the handle, so I took a trash can, climbed up the sink and got out that way. It's kind of like MacGyver - you improvise, you work it out. 'It [Incredibly Small World] will show [the public] that there are people that they probably don't see and [challenges in their life they] don't think of - just like the door handle thing.' Verne Troyer has built a big name for himself, despite standing at just 81cm tall . That's why Troyer's 'proud to be a part of it, to show the audience that different people can do different things.' People with dwarfism will always be forced to navigate life differently than those without their condition. But fundamentally, 'they're just people, Jo Schmo, the guy next door or whatever.' 'You don't have to treat them any different. We can do anything you can do. Don't look at us like we're circus people or these people that you make fun of. 'I hope we just show people that we're very independent and that we can do anything that normal people can do.'

Disgraced Toronto mayor Rob Ford went clubbing on Saturday ... all in the name of work. Having put his name on the ballot to run for another term, despite repeated calls for him to step down in the aftermath of his crack cocaine scandal, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process. While the conservative politician announced he no longer drinks in the wake of admitting he smoked the illicit drug in 'a drunken stupor', Muzik is known party palace for both locals and visitors, in the past entertaining touring musicians like Justin Bieber as well as celebrities and sport stars. Numerous photos of the 44-year-old looking hot and sweaty popped up on Instagram and Twitter, posted by revelers surprised to see Ford wandering around the dance floor. It's getting hot in here: Social media was set alight on Saturday night when controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford showed up at popular nightclub Muzik . Popular party man: According to Doug Ford, Rob Ford's brother and campaign manager, nightclub goers came running to have their picture taken with the mayor . Representatives for the Toronto man, who announced he had quit drinking in November in the wake of a drug scandal, said he had one sugar-free energy drink while at club Muzik . Muzik is a popular nightclub in downtown Toronto that recently hosted Justin Bieber . Councillor Doug Ford, the mayors brother and campaign manager, said the appearance was in the name of drumming  up support for the forthcoming election, set for October 27. He said the mayor consumed only a sugar-free energy drink and was at the club for about an hour. 'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford told The Toronto Sun. 'There have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, there’s been the Bieber there and no one got a response like Rob did. 'The place went upside down ballistic. 'All he did was take pictures.' This photo, posted on Twitter by user crozey98, was captioned: 'Boozin with the mayor.' This photo was posted on the official Muzik nightclub Twitter page . Earlier this month Ford was the first to register for the City's municipal election, promising 'Ford more years' and claiming to be 'the best mayor this city has ever had'. It was a surprise move following his drug fiasco and the erratic behavior that followed it, which caused international media attention and embarrassed many Canadians. Ford was forced to admit his drug use in October after Toronto police confirmed they had obtained long-rumored video footage of him smoking from a crack pipe. Reports of the video had surfaced in May but Ford denied its existence. Then court documents revealed police wiretaps of alleged gang members who spoke about delivering drugs to the mayor and having pictures of him using drugs. The wiretaps are evidence in the case against Ford's friend Alexander Lisi, who faces trial on drug and extortion charges. The mayor has not been charged. Sticking around? Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (center), . along with his brother Doug Ford (left), show up to file his reelection papers at . Toronto City Hall in Toronto, Canada on Thursday January 2, 2014 . In the weeks since the revelation, Ford was made countless efforts to show he has quit drinking and has been adhering to a healthier lifestyle, the most recent of which was his sober stop at Muzik. 'The campaign started, it’s not going to stop,' Councillor Ford said. 'I’m going to meet him for breakfast — he needs eggs because he’s on a strict diet — and we’ll go to a restaurant and the place will go upside down when we walk through.' Prior to going to the nightclub, the mayor attended the Theatre Centre’s gala arts event. Ford appears to need all the help he can get. Political pundits are skeptical at his chances of being re-elected. 'I do not believe Ford will win more than about 25 percent of the vote whoever his opponents are,' University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman said earlier this month. 'It is possible, however, to win with under 30 percent, depending on the vote split.'","Rob Ford, 44, made a surprise appearance at downtown Toronto nightclub Muzik on Saturday night .

'Liar': New Jersey State Senator Ray Lesniak, left, went on television Saturday calling Chris Christie a 'Liar-in-Chief' But not everyone is turning their back on Christie, just yet. On Sunday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended the governor, but said he is putting his political future in jeopardy should evidence surface that he had any knowledge of his aides’ alleged actions in the George Washington Bridge scandal. ‘He says he didn’t know. I think it’s pretty darn credible. He wouldn’t make this blanket denial unless it’s not true,’ Giuliani told ABC News. ‘If, for some reason, it’s not true, the man has put his political career completely at risk if it turns out there is some evidence that he knew about it. ‘He’s taken the complete risk that his political career is over.

During the interview, the former mayor talked about how Christie was unaware of a major traffic jam in New Jersey during the height of his re-election to the Obama administration. He also mentioned how the governor was caught off guard the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. ‘And the reality is, things go wrong in an administration. And frankly, you know, he was in campaign-mode at the time, during campaign-mode you miss a lot of things. You’re not paying as much attention. We see that with Benghazi,’ Giuliani said. ‘After the fact, it seems like how didn’t they know? But the reality is you miss a lot of things when you’re running a government that’s as complicated as New Jersey, New York or the United States,’ Giuliani added. ‘This has happened to many presidents, many governors, many mayors. It’s happened to the present president at three or four times where he said I didn’t know. And then the press says, gosh, how could he not have known?’ Chris Christie, pictured on Thursday, denied he had any prior knowledge of the bridge plan. He could be impeached if found guilty .

He added: 'Using . the George Washington Bridge, a public resource, to exact a political . vendetta, is a crime ... Having people use their official . position to have a political game is a crime. So if those tie back to . the governor in any way, it clearly becomes an impeachable offense.'

When authorities searched the apartment of Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, they found $822,000 in cash and a large collection of guns hidden in holes cut into the walls. Other than the cash, there were few valuables. Books, hats, sweatshirts and household items bought at discount stores filled the rent-controlled Santa Monica, California, apartment the notorious crime boss shared with his longtime girlfriend while he was on the run. Proceeds of crime: James 'Whitey' Bulger, captured in Santa Monica, California, after 16 years on the run . But authorities are hoping they can attract buyers for Bulger's belongings so they can compensate his victims. Bulger's possessions will be sold to . the highest bidders during a criminal forfeiture auction expected to be . held over the next few months. Prosecutors . in U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz's office are now trying to decide which . of Bulger's belongings should be auctioned. They are trying to balance . their desire to compensate relatives of Bulger's murder victims with . avoiding glamorizing Bulger or his crimes and staying within the . boundaries of good taste. 'We . want to certainly be able to obtain funds to go back to the victims who . were harmed by Bulger, but we don't want to do that in a way that . glorifies Bulger or potentially causes some offense to the victims or . others who have been impacted by Bulger,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney . Mary Murrane. Bulger . was convicted in August of orchestrating or participating in 11 . killings during his reign as leader of the Winter Hill Gang. He was . sentenced to two life terms plus five years in prison. The cash and . proceeds from the auction will be split among the estates of murder . victims who choose to participate and several extortion victims. There are a few things likely to bring in a substantial amount of money, including a gold and diamond claddagh ring with an estimated appraised value of $48,000, a replica of a 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring and a 40-inch flat-screen TV. But most of the items found in the apartment Bulger shared with Catherine Greig are ordinary things that have no intrinsic value. Authorities are hoping they could appeal to crime memorabilia collectors or other buyers. There's a rat-shaped cup used to hold pens and scissors, a collection of books about the mob and Bulger's gang, an assortment of cat figurines and 'Soldier of Fortune' magazines. There are also Valentine's Day and Christmas cards Greig sent to Bulger. Modest: The apartment in which Bulger hid with his girlfriend had few items of value . Authorities haven't yet decided whether personal items should be auctioned, Murrane said. 'It's looking at those items that on their own don't have value and which of those would be appropriate to auction, knowing that they would sell only because of who owned them,' she said. 'It's definitely a question of balance.' Families of Bulger's victims have mixed feelings about the upcoming auction. Bulger was convicted of gunning down Patricia Donahue's husband, Michael, in 1982 while targeting a different man who offered him a ride home that night. She said she isn't opposed to the auction. 'I can't imagine anybody wanting his things, but if they can sell them and make money and give the money to the victims, I think that's great. I'm sure a lot of the victims can use the money,' she said. Peaceful retirement: James 'Whitey' Bulger pictured with his then-girlfriend Teresa Stanley in this undated photo . But Steve Davis said he doesn't like the idea of an auction. The jury was unable to reach a decision on whether Bulger was responsible for his sister Debra Davis' death. 'I wish they would burn everything right in front of all of us,' Davis said. 'They should just destroy everything. That would kill the memories we have of him.' Thomas J. Abernathy, assistant chief . inspector of the asset forfeiture division of the U.S. Marshals Service, . said the program has two goals: to compensate victims and to deter . future criminal activity. 'It's a very important piece of the law enforcement process. Compensating victims is paramount in our program,' he said. Auctions in other high-profile cases have brought in millions. The . U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for selling seized and . forfeited properties, raised $232,000 through a 2011 online auction of . Ted Kaczynski's belongings, including 20 personal journals and the . hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses depicted in his famous FBI sketch. This photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's office shows inside James 'Whitey' Bulger and Catherine Greig's apartment at the Princess Eugenia complex, in Santa Monica . A two-day auction in Miami in 2011 brought in $3.2 million in the case of convicted financier Bernard Madoff to compensate victims of his $65 billion Ponzi scheme.

Marcus Wareing wants to try and boost his business by making the attitude of his waiters less pompous and more friendly and 'American' A double Michelin star-winning celebrity chef has said that British restaurants should be 'more American' when it comes to their service. After closing his eatery at the Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge for refurbishment, TV chef Marcus Wareing said that he was going to be telling his waiters to be 'less French and more high-end American'. Instead, he's focusing on giving his restaurant a friendlier 'dinner party atmosphere' in order to attract more customers. He has said that when it re-opens it will focus more on friendly attitudes and less on long elaborate menus and wine lists. Wareing said: 'I believe there has been a gradual, but genuine evolution in what the . customer is looking for in today’s fine dining offering and we are now . moving away from the more formal styles of service.' In addition to a change in the style of service, the famous chef has also said that the starched linen used to cover the tables will also go 'on the bonfire', in favour of showing off the table legs. Wareing told the Evening Standard: 'My number one priority is ending the stuffiness. People want to come to relax and not sit there while the waiter talks you through the 10 different ingredients in the dish. 'If someone comes in and says, ""I want three courses and a glass of Chardonnay and I want it in half an hour"", we’re not going to stick our noses in the air and say, ""Humph why isn’t he having the tasting menu"", we’re going to deliver it. 'I want people to have that feeling you get when you’ve been to a really good dinner party and you come away thinking, ""Wow, that was an amazing evening"". That’s what we want to reproduce. The change in service is the brain-child of the restaurant manager Daniel Greenock. Greenock recent spent over a year managing the New York restaurant Eleven Madison, and intends to bring what he's learned about service back to the UK. A spokesperson for Marcus Waering said: 'The intention is not to make it into an American diner, its all about the service' 'We're stripping back the stiff and formal side and making it more engaging and friendly.' Due to the recession and following economic slump, fewer people are eating out, choosing instead to dine at home or choose less expensive restaurants. Wareing claimed that less people are ordering the more expensive tasting menus, and on average people are spending around 10 per cent less when they come to his restaurant. While the restaurant has no plans to change into an American diner, the manager intends to strip back the service to a more simple and appealing style .","Staff to be 'Less stiff and formal' and 'More engaging and friendly'

Jeremy Paxman has been blamed for a beard trend that has brought a slump in sales of shaving gels, it has been claimed. Will King, the chief executive of King of Shaves, said last year’s craze for beards among stars including the Newsnight presenter and Hollywood actor George Clooney, had damaged the men’s toiletries industry. He believes that many followed Paxman and Clooney by growing facial hair, starting a ‘beard phase’ that has adversely affected the whole men’s shaving sector. The British entrepreneur, who launched his shaving products business in 1993, said: ‘Sales across the shaving industry were actually down in the UK and US last year for the first time because of guys not shaving, because of the celebrity beard, and partly because of the recession.’ ‘[The downturn] took five years from the start of the recession, and maybe it has been spurred on by the whole internet entrepreneur look, the “I work in Shoreditch, I don’t need to shave” look,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. Paxman caused a media storm on August 12 when he returned to work on Newsnight after his summer break with a beard. Twitter was deluged with opinions both for and against his salt and pepper bristles, while commentators debated the pros and cons of facial hair. The 63-year-old presenter was invited onto the BBC’s Today programme to contribute to the debate, but declined.

Right, Paxman is pictured outside the BBC Broadcasting House, without a beard, in October 2012 . Paxman said that he was bemused by the reaction. He wrote: ‘I had not seen it coming.

'At a rough guess I calculate that all those five minutes every morning have devoured months of my life.’ When the presenter returned to work earlier this month after a Christmas break he had shaved his beard off. In an interview with Radio Times he said: ‘If a chap can’t shave on holiday, what can he do?

Britain’s spies might have a licence to kill, but they risk losing their licence to drive if they are caught speeding – until now.

Changes to motoring laws mean officers in MI5 and MI6 will be able to break speed limits when national security is at stake. Law breaker: Spies like James Bond will be able to break the speed limit without falling foul of the police . The idea of giving more people the same rights on the road as ‘blue light’ services like the police, ambulance and fire brigade was backed by 9 out of 10 of those who responded to a government consultation. Under the move exemptions from having to stick to the speed limit will be expanded. But before spooks can put their foot down they will have to undergo a driver training course. It means scenes of James Bond speeding through the streets of London and the UK meant 007 was actually breaking the law. Transport minister Robert Goodwill is expected to give them the green light to speeding when the responses to the consultation have been considered. Vehicles used to carry organs for transplant, bomb disposal units, and mountain rescue teams are also set to be added to the list. Bomb disposal units will also be able to ignore speed limits when rushing to security incidents . It is understood that 93 per cent of those who replied to the consultation on the issue backed extending the speeding exemption to those involved in ‘the protection of life and limb or national security’. The DfT said: ‘The strongest support came from the Police Service who gave their full backing to  this proposal. ‘Most of those that commented agreed that emergency response drivers must be appropriately trained for what can be extremely demanding circumstances. ‘It therefore made sense to regulate and prescribe high speed training to those who can demonstrate a need to be exempt from speed limits.’","Ministers to allow MI5 and MI6 to speed if national security is at stake .

Britain is to demand national governments have the power to give a red card to Brussels red-tape. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, revealed the idea of allowing a bloc of fewer than 10 EU states to veto unwelcome laws will be a key demand of renegotiation talks to claw back powers. But he rejected calls from Tory MPs for the UK to be able to say no unilaterally to anything that the European Union demands, warning it would undermine the single market. David Cameron was warned last night that he risked causing disastrous divisions in the Tory party after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say No to European legislation was branded unrealistic. The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011. The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron. Mr Hague today said the idea of every EU country being able to go it alone and reject any Brussels edict would be unworkable ‘in any system which relies on common rules’. But he revealed Tory plans to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership before an in-out referendum would include allowing groups of member states to say no to Eurocrats. Under existing EU rules, if a third of the 28 member states object to planned legislation they can raise a ‘yellow card’ demanding it be reviewed. But Mr Hague wants to go further and allow a ‘red card’ system which would allow fewer than 10 countries to reject EU laws outright. ‘We do want a much bigger role for national parliaments,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘It’s common ground not only in the Conservative party but in the country that the powers of the European Union have increased too much, that they are too great, that they must be diminished. ‘It is common ground I think that national parliaments need a bigger role. One of the things I have advocated is a red card system where if enough national parliaments across the EU want to block something then they are able to do so.’ Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics . He said the idea would ‘absolutely’ be part of British demands for a fresh settlement with the EU. ‘There’s a yellow card system, not very much used at the moment, but it needs to be much stronger red card system. ‘And many other ways can be looked at of strengthening the powers of national parliaments.’ But he dismissed the calls from dozens if Tory MPs for every national government to be able to refuse to implement EU law. Mr Hague added: ‘What you can’t have in any system which relies on common rules  even in a free trade area that relies on common rules is each of the parliaments being able regularly and unilaterally to say we are not applying this or that just by own decision. ‘Clearly a single market or free trade area would not work on that basis; even the Swiss or Norwegian arrangement with the European Union could not work on that basis. Bernard Jenkin, who co-ordinated the letter, said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the Uk renegotiates its relationship with the EU . ‘We have to be careful what we support but the direction of greater power for national parliaments and reducing relatively speaking the powers of the European Union, vis-à-vis national parliaments is something I very strongly support.’ The row is expected to intensify on Wednesday when Chancellor George Osborne makes a speech arguing that Britain should remain within a reformed European Union. The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011. The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron. The rebels say at least six Cabinet members also back them, plus six ministerial aides and members of Mr Cameron’s policy board, making the true figure 107 MPs or more. One signatory said: ‘If Downing Street digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers. They will create a Cabinet split. This is a wake-up call. If the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it’s going to be absolutely disastrous.’ At the moment, Mr Cameron can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the EU budget. But while Parliament can raise concerns with the European Commission, it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws. The rebels call on Mr Cameron to ‘make the idea of a national veto over current and future EU laws a reality’ and ‘enable Parliament to disapply EU legislation, where it is in our vital national interests to do so’. The MPs point out that this ‘would transform the UK’s negotiating position in the EU’ as Mr Cameron seeks to carve out a new relationship with Brussels ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017. Bernard Jenkin, who coordinated the letter, said: ‘We’re all being very polite to each other but I think it’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of Europe rather than pretending we agree. ‘It’s the facile tactics Europhiles always use. They start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, another signatory, said many rebels don’t even want the single market, adding: ‘If this makes the single market not work, that’s not the problem. We can still have free trade, which is more important. Laws should be made by our democratic representatives, not by the fiat of Brussels.’ Signatories include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and ex-defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. One said: ‘Downing Street’s argument is such rubbish. We are at crunch point. They are heading for the most almighty smash-up.’ They said Mr Cameron had nothing to lose by making the veto Tory policy because the pro-European wing of the Tory Party was so depleted. One added: ‘Would the party be split? I don’t think so.’ Europe's ‘travelling circus’, in which MEPs decamp to France once a month, costs taxpayers at least £93million a year. European Union figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in Brussels and shipping it to Strasbourg for just four days each month. Conservative MEPs estimated the true cost to be £130million – and called for an end to the practice. Some £250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities, a report on the ‘financial and environmental impact’ showed. Maintaining the parliament in Strasbourg costs £50million a year. Although MEPs voted to scrap the ‘circus’ by three to one last year, the French will veto any such attempt. Conservative MEP Ashley Fox said: ‘This craziness has to stop.’","Foreign Secretary reveals plan will be key demand of EU negotiations .

A father of two who married his girlfriend in hospital after being diagnosed with terminal cancer just before Christmas has died less than a month after the wedding. Felix Glenny, 23, married his partner, Cola Weller, on 20 December after doctors told him that the pains that were initially diagnosed as stomach cramps were symptoms of advanced bowel cancer and there was nothing they could do. Mr Glenny, who was diagnosed on his son, Ralph's, second birthday, and who also has a five-month-old daughter, Pearl, died in Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent on Saturday night from the same disease that killed his mother and grandfather. Today, his 22-year-old widow from Lower Stoke, near Rochester, told MailOnline: 'I feel happy knowing he is in the safe arms of his mum, and the children and I have gained a guardian angel.' Felix Glenny, who married Cola Weller at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent in December, died at the weekend . Heartbreaking: Mr Glenny, 23, was diagnosed just before Christmas and told he only had weeks to live . Proud father: Mr Glenny leaves his two young children: Ralph two, and Pearl, who is just five months old . Mr Glenny, who worked for a water supply company, had suffered stomach pains for weeks and was initially told he had various ailments including a kidney infection, irritable bowels and a sickness bug. But on 11 November he was admitted to hospital after a surgeon found a large tumour in his bowel, and days before Christmas doctors told him he had weeks to live. Mr Glenny and his fiancee married in an emotional bedside ceremony with son Ralph as a pageboy. Senior hospital chaplain, the Reverend Steve . Spencer, blessed the marriage and led prayers for the couple’s two small children. Speaking after the wedding, Mrs Glenny said: 'When we found out the cancer was terminal we just wanted to do it straight away. 'It was a really amazing day, I had a lot of fun. It was crazy because we were really happy, but it was so emotional. Happier times: Mr and Mrs Glenny decided to marry as soon as they were told his cancer was terminal . Newly-weds: The young couple from Lower Stoke, near Rochester in Kent, met through mutual friends in 2010 . Mr Glenny had suffered from stomach pain for weeks but doctors had told him he had a kidney infection or virus . The Glennys got married in Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent, where Mr Glenny was admitted in November . 'It was a lovely day and we’ve been thinking about it ever since, it was just perfect. 'I was so glad he managed to get out of bed for it, it was great to see our family and friends so happy for us.' After Mr Glenny's story was published, well-wishers - including X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne - joined a fund-raising campaign to make sure his children would be provided for after his death. Mrs Osbourne, 61, herself a cancer survivor, donated £10,000 and sent a message telling the Glennys: 'Never give up the fight and hope.' People, many of them strangers and some from as far afield as Australia, donated £48,000 in just a couple of days and the total fund now stands at more than £58,000. Mr Glenny's best friend Ashley Clark, who set up the fund-raising campaign to help support his friend's young family, announced his death at the weekend.

Savaged: Simon McKinley's ear was bitten off during the attack by his Staffordshire Bull Terrier Tyson . A dog owner survived a savage attack in which his ear was bitten off by his pet... the somewhat aptly named Tyson. Simon McKinley's ear was torn off during the attack by his beloved Staffordshire Bull Terrier which shares the name with boxer Mike - who infamously bit off the top of Evander Holyfield's ear during a 1997 bout. Mr McKinley, 38, blacked out twice during the frenzied 15-minute attack at his home in Westtown, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. He has lost 50per cent of his hearing in his left ear, ripped off in the incident on New Year's Eve, and was bitten on his right arm after he tried to fend off the dog. His girlfriend, Alaina Noble was also cut on her face and needed stitches, after she desperately tried to pull Tyson away. It was only when police arrived that the dog was finally hauled away from his terrified owner. Mr McKinley was rushed to hospital where he had an operation on his arm, and is now facing a further three where doctors will try to partially reconstruct his ear. He said: 'I was on the bed stroking him and suddenly he just went. It was just like turning a light switch.' Tyson sunk his teeth into Mr McKinley's left ear and right arm as he attempted to push the pet away. 'He just came back for more,' he said. 'He was not giving in. Terror: Mr McKinley's girlfriend, Alaina Noble (right) was also cut on her face and needed stitches, after she desperately tried to pull Tyson away . Emergency: Mr McKinley was rushed to hospital where he had an operation on his arm, and is now facing a further three where doctors will try to partially reconstruct his ear . 'Everyone else said it had been going on for about 15 minutes or so, but I didn't know what was going on.' Ms Noble added: 'Me and the police were trying to get the dog out of the bedroom and he went for me. It's put me off having another dog for life.' The couple were taken to nearby Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, while their dog was taken to kennels. Tough decision: The couple have opted to have Tyson humanely destroyed . Mr McKinley has lost 50per cent of his hearing in his left ear but was told it could improve over the next five years. As well as three reconstructive operations, he will also undergo physiotherapy to help return movement to his right wrist. He said he has opted to have Tyson humanely put down. 'They said some people, believe it or not, want to keep the dog,' he said. 'But I said he should be destroyed. 'It was hard but I couldn't have had him back. I'm just glad it was me and not a kid. 'The police said a kid wouldn't have survived these injuries.' The couple got Tyson when he was around 18 months old. Mr McKinley said his temperament had always been very good, but that the pet had fought with another dog a few weeks earlier. He said Tyson had later been found to have distemper, a viral disease, which he believed had made it act aggressively. Tyson had not been given the recommended vaccinations for parvo or distemper. Mr McKinley added: 'I'd like other people to know that if they're going to buy a dog, particularly a Staffy, they should make sure they don't make the mistake I made. 'I should have asked for a breed certificate and vaccination records, but I took it on trust.'

You will know them for being among the country’s greatest celebrities, be it film stars, singers or models. But here are some faces you may not be so familiar with, for these images are of famous Britons when they were children. And yesterday the four female stars joined a string of celebrities to have shared photographs from their youth for charity. Prime suspect for a royal role? This nine-year-old is young Helen Mirren, now 68, who went on to win an Oscar . What a model child this girl is: The six-year-old tucking into an ice-cream cone was years away from finding fame as a model in the 1960s. Now 64, the enigmatic Twiggy has vowed to help orphaned children find a home . Isn't she Absolutely Fabulous! Who knew this girl would one day star in On Her Majesty's Secret Service? The 67-year-old actress is still dressing up to perform, most recently in Wolf Of Wall Street with Leonardo DiCaprio . In one, a successful actress and presenter balances on a gymnastics beam, under the watchful eye of her coach. The dark brown pixie-cut hairstyle is now a thing of the past but she can still deliver a performance, albeit in a somewhat different way. Another, who has become a household name for starring in scores of major films and theatre productions, is recognisable from her wide-lipped smile as she poses on a beach wearing a floral swimsuit, while a young model-in-the-making can be spotted due to her skinny legs as she perches on a concrete step slurping on an ice cream. This little Brit has talent: Years later she drops the brown bob and grimace (left) for a dazzling smile (see below) Presenter-to-be: In this gap-toothed school photo she is a little more recognisable as TV's Amanda Holden . Linda Robson: This innocent, chubby-cheeked child would later star in intense drama Birds Of A Feather . Little Nina Wadia, with a twinkling little grin, perfected anger by the time she landed a lead role in EastEnders . Honoured: This young Brenda Blethyn, now 67, grew up to win an OBE and numerous awards for acting . And in a fourth image, a star known for her love of performance proves she had the acting bug at a young age, as she holds her skirt out wide to do a curtsey. The female stars are backing a campaign by Barnardo’s, which is calling for more people to become foster parents to youngsters in need of homes. Brenda Farrell, head of fostering and adoption at the charity, said: ‘Without the right foster family to care for them, many vulnerable children may never experience the love and stability they so desperately need and happy memories will remain a distant dream. What a character: The Scottish crime writer looks dapper and adorable in his kilt, bow tie, and sleek hair . Stylish sweep: This little boy started life in the care of Barnardo's. He became top designer Bruce Oldfield . First a sweet little Stratford girl (left and below), Joy Joyner later found fame as Tanya Branning on EastEnders . Confident: Little Joy was confident and outgoing from a young age before hitting the stage and screen . Dreamy: Despite the whistful gaze, this young Fay Ripley surely knew nothing of the trials and tribulations of romance, which would come when she starred in Cold Feet, her breakthrough role in 1997 . 'We are truly grateful that so many household names are helping us to broadcast our plea for people to consider becoming foster parents. ‘Currently a third of all children in foster care are moved between different families more than twice every year due to the lack of suitable foster carers. 'The number of children in the care system in the UK has risen for the 7th year in a row to more than 90,000 and at least 8,600 new foster carers are needed in the UK.’","Photographs supporting new Barnardo's campaign for foster children .

Attack: Martin Schulz, president of the EU parliament, said that issues such as freedom of migration are 'not up for negotiation' British plans to crack down on unrestricted immigration within the Europe were attacked last night by the leader of the EU's Parliament. Despite calls from politicians in the UK - and other European countries - to curb the unrestricted movement of workers between EU countries, senior officials from Brussels have said the principle is 'fundamental' and cannot change. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, said that while he took plans for EU reform, championed by David Cameron, 'very seriously', some elements were 'not up for negotiation.' He also poured scorn on the idea that Britain would be able reform its relationship with the EU by threatening to leave - which is what the Conservatives are proposing by promising to offer a referendum on EU membership if they win the next election. Mr Schulz, a German socialist politician, said that he would like to see Mr Cameron's plans for reform, but made clear that, in his view, some features of the EU cannot be changed. His claims were almost immediately backed up by Nick Clegg, who today said that freedom of movement was in place 'for very good reasons'. Speaking to the Observer, he said: 'The principle of free movement of people has been one of the greatest successes the EU has, it is a fundamental principle and it's not up for negotiation any more than renegotiating the principle of the free movement of goods, services or capital.' He added that any change to the EU of the scale 'needs unanimous support and ratification of all member states'. Last month it was reported that Home Secretary Theresa May was considering capping EU immigration at 75,000 workers. Though the figure was never confirmed, the Conservative minister did speak out about 'the abuse of free movement in the EU' - which includes fears of benefits tourism. Mr Schulz also objected the UK pressing for reform 'with one hand on the escape hatch', rather than trying to change things from inside the EU. The intervention came as Conservative backbencher piled additional pressure on Mr Cameron to give Britain extra powers to resist new laws drafted by Brussels. A group of 95 MPs sent a letter to the Prime Minister saying the Commons should be allowed to block new EU legislation and repeal measures that threaten the 'national interest'. Difference of opinion: David Cameron, left, has said he would like to reform the UK's relationship with the EU, while Nick Clegg, right, echoes Mr Schulz's comments in an interview today . According to the Sunday Telegraph, signatories to the letter - drafted by senior MP Bernard Jenkin - include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, whose party favours remaining in the EU, today echoed Mr Schulz's comments that freedom of movement was an untouchable feature of membership. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the Liberal Democrat leader he said: 'I think the principle that people can move around the European Union to look for work is a founding principle of the European Union for very good reasons.' If you want a single market, if you want more jobs to be created... you need to give people the right to look for work.'","Martin Schulz attacked plans to crack down on EU immigration .

The pilots of Rescue 193, a Royal Navy  Sea King search and rescue helicopter, could hear the screams of an expectant mother above their roaring engines as she gave birth in the back of their aircraft. The pair glanced at each other across their cockpit but did not dare look back into the helicopter’s darkened cabin. There a team of airmen and a midwife were busy working by torchlight to deliver a baby boy. Rescue 193 is the callsign given to the duty Sea King that remains on 24-hour standby at Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose in Cornwall ready to rescue people across south west England. Prepared: Naval Air Squadron Sea Kings on the ground at Culdrose, Cornwall, awaiting a call to attend an emergency . Drop: The squadron hovers above a boat during a training exercise . On that particular October evening heavily pregnant Ella McLachlan was being lifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital at Treliske, near Truro. Baby Marcus was born at 5lb 3oz around two miles south east of Truro. His early arrival meant the helicopter landed with eight persons on board instead of the seven it took off with. Despite the unusual drama, this was just one incident in a typically unpredictable shift for the crews of 771 Naval Air Squadron. The unit flies eight of the famous grey and red Sikorsky Sea King helicopters based at Culdrose, where they stand guard over the rugged coastline and western approaches up to 200 miles out to sea. Squadron boss Commander Martin Shepherd explains that his crews and helicopters are on constant standby to rush to the aid of those in distress. During the day they can scramble at 15 minutes’ notice and at night within 45 minutes. 'There are very few careers where on a daily basis you feel you have had such a positive effect,’ he says. ‘There's this incredible satisfaction for a job that has a quantifiable result.’ Ready: Petty Officer Mark Richardson prepares to be winched from the Sea King onto the deck of a passing vessel . Emergency response: Observer Lt Commander Andy Watts winches aboard the helicopter's stretcher . Equipment: The team throw down a winch ready to bring the stretcher up from the boat's deck . The crucial role the squadron plays – whether rescuing sailors from stricken fishing vessels, searching for missing walkers or ferrying emergency cases to hospital – means that every year they conduct 300 or more rescues, frequently in extremely challenging weather. Shepherd says: ‘Aviation is very tightly controlled by regulation to keep everyone safe. But when everyone else is putting the aircraft into the hanger, we will be launching in conditions that are extremely testing.’ Before sending his helicopter crews on leave this Christmas, Shephard reminded them of the role they had played in assisting hundreds of people, many of whom would be dead without the Royal Navy’s intervention. ‘I told the crews to think, as they sat down to eat their turkey dinners, that there would be 300 people going to be sat around with their families after rescues we had made,’ Shephard says. Despite the festivities, the 60th year of the Royal Navy’s search and rescue service did not end quietly. Helicopter crews were called into action more than two-dozen times as the foul weather lashed Britain almost non-stop during the festive season. History: For nearly half a century, the 771 Naval Air Squadron, known as the Ace of Clubs has saved thousands of people in life or death situations . On the edge: Two of the troops lean out of the door of the aircraft while they are stationed above the stranded boat . View: The crew catches a glimpse of view cliffs as the Sea King passes alongside the rugged Cornwall coast line . During the holiday period flyers from Culdrose and HMS Gannet in Prestwick, Scotland, saved or helped more than 20 fishermen, stranded walkers and medical cases. Invited to witness the work of 771NAS for myself, the Navy offered to fly me on a search and rescue training mission. After a thorough briefing about the aims of the mission we’re about to experience, it’s off to the equipment room to be kitted out for flight over the sea. Once encased in rubber immersion suit, leather gloves and boots and cumbersome helmet I’m ready to go. Soon we’re walking across the concrete parking ramp to the waiting Sea King. Our helicopter, number XV648, is the oldest Sea King still in British military use. It is blasting out hot and smelly exhaust gases, vibrating under the power of its two Rolls-Royce Gnome turbine engines, each producing more than 1,400 horse power. Once aboard, the aircraft is cramped, noisy and the rear cabin where the observer and aircrewman work is dark, the only natural light coming from a giant side door which is latched open during winch operations. Members of the crew talking continuously over the intercom between themselves and over the radio to air traffic controllers make it hard to follow out what’s going on sometimes. Inside the cockpit: The Sea King is 1950s technology and XV648 is the oldest in 771 fleet . Pilot:  Steffen Volkwein, who is is on an exchange posting from the German Navy, takes the controls during the practice operation . As this is a live training mission, we are soon lifting off from Culdrose and heading out to see. Soon we’re hovering near a co-operative merchant ship which has agreed to allow a stretcher and crewman to be winched down onto its deck. Petty Officer Mark Richardson is lowered from the open door, the stretcher soon following behind him to demonstrate how casualties are rescued from ships at sea. Richardson is no stranger to danger. He was the crewman on duty last November when a 21 metre French fishing boat, the Panamera, started sinking and he had to pluck five sailors to safety. On this flight he is assisted by Chief Petty Office Andy Penrose, also a trained paramedic, who is there to assess Richardson’s performance. The aircraft commander is veteran Observer Lieutenant Commander Andy Watts, who will leave the Navy after more than 30 years when the Sea Kings retire. He's retraining to be a primary school teacher but describes his time on the Royal Navy’s search and rescue force as ‘the best job I have ever done’. Once Richardson is safely back aboard, the Sea King flies to a nearby quarry where the crew show us how they can land the helicopter in tight spaces. Treatment: Petty Officers Andy Penrose and Mark Richardson practise medical techniques on a mannequin . Assistance: One of the crew members try their hand from the observer position as the winch prepares to pull the stretcher up . Next it’s my turn to experience being dropped out on the winch line, which is no thicker than a pencil and can extend to 245 feet. Watts signals me to come forward to the door from my seat inside the helicopter. I’m sitting with my legs dangling over the edge as we hover about 100 feet over the cliffs near the Lizard. The view down is not for those suffering from vertigo. Watts slips the winch over my shoulders and under my armpits and then I’m pushed out of the door. The sensations are overwhelming as I swing just metres below the moving rotor blade, waves crashing below my feet. The winch whirrs and I’m lowered down on the grass where Mark Richardson clips himself to the harness and the two of us are rapidly lifted back to the helicopter. The sight of the Sea King’s belly as we’re raised from the cliffs is exactly what injured sailors would see as the Navy arrives to help them. Back onboard: Two of the crew members are winched up onto the helicopter, pictured left is Petty Officer Mark Richardson . View from below: A crew member holds on to the winch as he leans out of the helicopter . It’s a relief to be safely back inside the warm aircraft. I can only imagine how comforting it must be to be helped aboard in a real emergency by these real-life heroes. If the glamorous end of naval aviation is reserved for the aircrews, the engineers fulfil a vital role. Without them, none of the Sea Kings would ever get airborne and the pilots would be stuck on the ground. 771’s Engineering Officer Lt Cdr Stuart Cantellow, who has 130 engineers and technicians working for him, explains that the Sea Kings are 1950s technology but have been constantly upgraded. Cantellow, who joined the Navy having been sponsored through university, says: ‘It now takes longer and longer to maintain. It takes 30 man hours to achieve one flying hour. Aircraft need servicing after every flight and lots of maintenance. 'All of the airframes are older than me. Most have more than 10,000 hours of flying time – more than a year aloft. The whole Sea King fleet here has 1.54m flying hours and still have 64,000 hours to go until retirement.' Waiting: The squadron are perched mid-flight as they make their way to a vessel during the training exercise . On time: Lieutenant Commander Andy Watt checks his watch as he briefs the crew on board . Sea Kings have been flying since 1969 and Cantellow reckons that every day they are asked to do things that are more demanding than a Grand Prix car. ‘It is the equivalent of three or four Formula One races every day,’ he says. Like the ageing Sea Kings, Royal Navy search and rescue is coming to the end of its life. By 2017 a US-owned company, Bristow Helicopters, will take up the mantle having won a £1.6bn outsourcing contract designed to modernise the operation and introduce a fleet of new aircraft. Although the decision has attracted some public controversy, there is no sign of bitterness among the crews on 771 NAS. Commander Shepherd admits that any reduction in the military’s role is ‘not something you would necessarily welcome’. But he explains that some of his men and women will transfer to the new venture, while others like Andy Watts will leave the Navy. Regardless of what the crews on 771 do next, they will move on with a lasting memories of the 10-tonnes Sea King. ‘There is a lot of affection for the Sea King because for a lot of us it is the aircraft we learned to fly and fight in,’ Shephard says. ‘This is where I cut my teeth.’ Forward planning: Petty Officer Mark Richardson (left) and Veteran Sea King Observer Lt Commander Andy Watts breif the crew ahead of the training mission .

Scott Calder, 22, and his 56-year-old mother Marie were caught in a hail of bullets after they were ambushed in a car park outside the Gala Bingo branch. Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder, who uses the nickname 'The Demon' on his Facebook page, was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire. Scene: Police search the car park outside the Gala Bingo in Harpurhey, Manchester, where 22-year-old Scott Calder and his 56-year-old mother Marie were shot . Target: Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire . Detectives were also believed to be investigating reports of a dispute between Mr Calder and other members of the family. Ms Calder and her son were attacked shortly after Mr Calder arrived at the car park outside the bingo hall to pick her up at around 7.15pm last night. Moments later, a black car pulled up behind the family, blocking them in the car park outside the Harpurhey branch of chain Gala Bingo in Manchester. Probe: A police cordon remained around the scene today as officers continued to investigate the shooting . Two men then climbed out of the car and fired a number of shots at the Mr Calder's Audi. One bullet hit Ms Calder in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack. Mr Calder managed to get out of the car park and abandoned his car in a nearby street before he and his injured mother staggered to hospital. The nearest hospital, North Manchester General, is about a half-hour walk away. Doctors then called police to investigate the shooting. Neither injury was believed to be life-threatening. The incident occurred in the gritty Manchester district of Harpurhey where controversial BBC Three reality TV show People Like Us was based - and which was critically panned for showing a stereotypical view of the locals. Just minutes before the shooting Mr . Calder posted a message on his Facebook page saying: 'Stab me in the . back, I'll blast ur spine.' Another posted on January 5 said: 'n this game there's only one don' and on Jan 9 he wrote: 'Even if I died young who cares.'

A grandfather has carved a wooden replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, despite having lost three of his fingers in an industrial accident. Jason Welch, 43, has always been a dab hand with a chisel but didn’t know what he was getting himself into when he started the project in 2011. The self-employed wood carver, from North Creake, Norfolk, decided to create a scale model of the 230ft tapestry to help cope with the grief of his 16-year-old son Ricky dying three years ago, and he has been hard at work in his shed ever since. True dedication: Grandfather Jason Welch decided to create his Bayeux Tapestry replica to help cope with death of his son Ricky, who tragically died in 2011 aged 16 . The self-employed wood carver managed to complete the incredibly intricate carvings despite losing three fingers in a horrific farming accident when he was aged 19 . The grandfather-of-two searched for weeks before sourcing the 25 five foot planks of wood he needed for his project. It took him two years to carve, paint, draw and then sand his 135ft long version of the historical Bayeux Tapestry. He finally completed the work just before Christmas but says his masterpiece is now gathering dust in his workshop because it is so big. Mr Welch, a self employed wood carver, said: 'I like working with my hands and keeping active... I had to draw all the detail onto these five foot panels, then chisel it and spend ages sanding it.' Jason Welch worked for three years in his workshop in North Creake, Norfolk. He searched for weeks before finding sourcing the 25 five foot planks of wood he needed . Comparison: The original Bayeux Tapestry was created (bottom left and bottom right) was created over nine centuries ago. Legend suggests it may have been commissioned by William the Conqueror's wife. Jason Welch's version (top left and top right) was carved out of wood rather than embroided into cloth . Shame: He says the the 230ft scale model is now gathering dust as it is too big to put in his home. He is hoping someone will come forward to put it on display . Mr Welch added: 'That last part was the hardest because my hands started to ache because I don’t have all my fingers... I just hope that someone will get in touch with us and put it on somewhere for the year.' Remembering the accident in which he lost his fingers, Mr Welch said: 'I was about 19 and I used to work on a farm... I had these gloves on and they got caught in a chain and cord. It pulled my hands into it and my fingers went.' He added: 'It was horrific it really was. I lost all the fingers on my left hand bar my thumb. Luckily they managed to partially sew my little finger back on.' After two years of hard graft in his workshop, Jason Welch finally completed his ambitious 230ft scale replica of the Bayeux Tapestry shortly before Christmas . Jason Welch has always been interested in history and religion so started working on the project without realising it would take up most of his spare time for two years . A slice of history: The original Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and is actually created from a piece of embroided cloth, not wood . Mr Welch was inspired to create the masterpiece after the tragic death of his 16-year-old son Ricky in 2011. He says the daunting task kept his mind off the heartache that left he and partner Belinda, 42, devastated. He added: 'Originally I started it because my son died and I trapped myself in my work shop... I was always interested in my history and religion so I just started doing it.' 'I just developed a passion for ancient history and just thought it would be a great achievement if I could actually carve the whole thing in planks of timber... I never imagined it would become what it is now. I’m really happy,' he said. The most famous scene on the Bayeux Tapestry depicts King Harold being shot in the eye by an arrow. One theory suggests the work was commissioned by William the Conqueror's wife . The original Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and is actually created from a piece of embroided cloth, not wood.

American author David Gordon wrote a book called 'The Serialist' that made him a celebrity in Japan . One struggling author had no idea how big he was big in Japan--that is, until he went there and was met by a TV crew and put in a 'James Bond' style hotel. New York based novelist David Gordon wrote a book called 'The Serialist' in 2010 which premiered in the United States and did moderately well. In Japan the book was a sensation. Suddenly a Japanese translation came out and Gordon started winning Japanese literary contests. Gordon wrote an essay for The New York Times in which he explains how he won all three major literary contests, something no one had done before, especially not an American. Gordon had always been a fan of Japanese culture but had no idea he would be received so well there. 'It was like having a distant teenage crush on someone who suddenly wrote and said, “I like you, too,' wrote Gordon. Gordon explains how his book was renamed 'Niryuu Shousetsuka' translates into, 'Second Rate Novelist' since the book is about a pulp fiction author. Not only did Gordon's book win big among readers, Japan decided to help Gordon reach an even wider audience with a movie adaptation. The film called, 'Niryuu Shousetsuka: Serialist', is set in Tokyo with Japanese actors speaking Japanese. Gordon quips in his essay at the fact that his book actually takes place in Queens and features non-Japanese people. David Gordon's book 'The Serialist' was translated into Japanese and adapted into a film . In June of 2013, Gordon went to the premiere of his film and he also released a new book called 'Mystery Girl' at the the same time. The book wouldn't be out in the United States until July. He explains how his life in Japan seemed to be moving ahead of his life in the United States. It was certainly more glamorous. 'In a daze, I was paraded before the press, blinded by flashbulbs and tracked by TV cameras. But because I couldn’t understand the directions, I often talked to the wrong camera, stared into space or even leaned on the scenery — until my intrepid and glamorous young translator told the reporters to wave if they wanted David-san to look at their cameras, like a baby at a birthday party,' wrote David. He describes going to interviews, readings, and book signings. He says people applauded his ability to sign his name 'really big on a poster.' David describes coming home from his trip and returning to his 'book-filled rooms' smaller than his hotel suite in Tokyo . 'Don’t get me wrong, it’s fine, but once in a while, as I eat a burrito . and watch an old samurai film, I wonder how that other, more glamorous . writer, David-san, the Second-Rate Novelist, is doing over there, where . it’s already tomorrow,' he concluded.

Scientists from around the world are working to enable a young Brazilian paraplegic to kick off the opening game of the FIFA World Cup 2014. The teenager will wear an exoskeleton, artists' illustration pictured, that will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected . The suit itself will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes placed either on the scalp or within the brain itself. These signals will be sent wirelessly to a computer worn by the wearer, converting them into movement. The team behind the suit is a collaboration between various universities including Duke University in the U.S., the Technical University of Munich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne among others. It plans to incorporate sensors into the exoskeleton that feed information about touch, temperature and force back to the wearer. The feedback is expected to come through a visual display or a vibrating motor. ‘The vibrations can replicate the sensation of touching the ground, rolling off the toe and kicking off again,’  Gordon Cheng, at the Technical University of Munich, Germany said in an interview with the New Scientist. The body suit is the result of research from the Duke Nicolelis lab that looked into hair-thin and flexible sensors, known as microwires, implanted into the brains of rats and monkeys.

The teenager - who is yet to be selected from a group of 10 hopefuls - will undergo training in a virtual reality simulator to translate thoughts into signals. ‘We want to galvanise people’s imaginations,’ Miguel Nicolelis, the Brazilian neuroscientist at Duke University added to the Washington Post. ‘With enough political will and investment, we could make wheelchairs obsolete.’ The body suit is the result of research from the Duke Nicolelis lab that looked into hair-thin and flexible sensors, known as microwires, implanted into the brains of rats and monkeys. These flexible electrical prongs can detect minute electrical signals generated by hundreds of individual neurons in the animals’ frontal and parietal cortices - the regions that control a vast brain circuit that is responsible for voluntary movements. In 2000, Professor Nicolelis’ lab reported that a monkey had been able to use power of thought to control a robot arm using these sensors. More recently, his lab has shown that monkeys can control the movement of both arms on an avatar using just their brain activity. To enable the monkeys to control two virtual arms, researchers recorded nearly 500 neurons from multiple areas in both cerebral hemispheres of the animals’ brains, the largest number of neurons recorded and reported to date. VIDEO: Miguel Nicolelis at TEDMED 2012 . Several human quadriplegics have also received implanted brain chips in clinical trials. For instance, Matt Nagle, who was paralysed after being stabbed in the spine, learned to raise, lower and drop after objects after electrodes were implanted in his brain. Professor Nicolelis is now developing  a new kind of electrode that branches like a tree into a vast network covering a larger volume of the brain. He hopes this network will help make deliver more complex exoskeletons that can control a greater number of limbs using the power of thought.","The kick will take place during the opening ceremony in Sao Paulo, Brazil .

The glass is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and is currently being tested by various manufacturers. It could one day be used on windows, workplace furniture, smartphone displays, tablets, calculators, and more. ‘Corning’s Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass inhibits the growth of algae, mould, mildew, fungi, and bacteria because of its built-in antimicrobial property, which is intrinsic to the glass and effective for the lifetime of a device,’ said James R. Steiner, senior vice president and general manager, Corning Specialty Materials. The left-hand image shows the number of microbes on the treated display, while the right-hand image shows a standard glass screen. Unlike current antibacterial sprays, the silver on the display doesn't fade and can't be wiped off . Corning also claims it was able to added the antimicrobial feature without weakening the glass, and because the display is also scratch-resistant, microbes can't live in the cracks.

The 27-year-old, right, tried to manage the pain through steroid . injections so that she  could take part in the World Championships in . Moscow in August, but that provided little relief. 'Having it operated . on was an option but I wanted my body to heal naturally,' says Jess. 'Unfortunately I had to pull out of the World Championships because my . coach was worried about how competing could cause further damage, . leaving me with a problem for years and, at worst, forcing me into early . retirement.' Physios Alison Rose and Rob Johnson then worked with . her doctor to develop a recovery programme.

A new treatment for acute respiratory distress . syndrome (ARDS) could reduce death rates in intensive care patients by . 80 per cent, a groundbreaking trial suggests. ARDS is a major cause . of death in intensive care units and  is caused by lung injury. There is . currently no effective drug so patients are usually treated with . life-support systems. But a clinical study testing a new drug called . Traumakine in eight UK hospitals found it cut mortality by 81 per cent . in ARDS patients. The treatment also reduced the amount of care . required, according to a report in medical journal The Lancet . Respiratory Medicine. Dr Geoff Bellingan, medical director of University . College London Hospital, who led the trial, said his team now planned . further investigations. The ballads of Lionel Richie may be the perfect music to give birth to .

University in Turkey and Harvard University in the United States, women . in labour were allowed a choice of music, from classical to pop, as long . as it had the stipulated tempo. The results showed that these . mothers had a lower level of pain and anxiety compared with those who . did not listen to music. Just why songs with a tempo of 60 to 80 beats . per minute should have such an effect is not clear but it may be because . matching the beat of the heart has a  relaxing effect 'Music is used for pleasure and it can also be used for therapeutic benefits,' says Dr Serap Simavli, who led the study.

Advice: Kylie Minogue said she asked sister Dannii, former X Factor judge, if she should join The Voice . The Voice star Kylie Minogue has revealed that she snubbed Simon Cowell’s offer of a chance to appear on his rival talent show The X Factor. Kylie, 45, appeared on the BBC1 singing competition for the first time last night after a major overhaul of judges, following the exit of Jessie J and Danny O’Donoghue. The Australian pop superstar said last week that she had previously been approached by The X Factor. Her sister Dannii had appeared on the ITV show before a bitter public feud with TV mogul Cowell. But sources connected to Cowell’s show insisted to The Mail on Sunday that the singer had ‘never been in serious consideration’ for a judging role on The X Factor. Her younger sister Dannii, 42, appeared alongside Simon Cowell on The X Factor between 2007 and 2010 but fell out with her co-star when he allowed details of their romantic fling to be revealed in an  ‘unauthorised’ biography. Cowell, 54, later admitted that Dannii has refused to speak to him ever since. Despite her sister’s embarrassing experience on The X Factor, Kylie said that Dannii had been very encouraging when she asked if  she should sign up for the BBC1  talent show. She said: ‘She hasn’t experienced The Voice but I did speak to her before I pressed the go button  on this. ‘I said, “I’m quite close to doing this, what do you think?” and she was just so supportive, and basically thought I’d love the experience and really enjoy what it is to become a mentor.’ But she added that The Voice had been more physically and emotionally demanding than she had expected, explaining: ‘You really become invested. Fling: Dannii Minogue had a fling with Simon Cowell while judging on the show but has not spoken to him since . 'Your sleep is interrupted because you think, “I’ve got to make this decision tomorrow”, and you don’t want to  do it. ‘The great parts are really great, and the sticky moments that matter which decision you make are  no fun. ‘When you have 30 cameras around, you literally cannot hide, there is no point running because you can’t. ‘You’re out there and you’re completely exposed. Launch: The show started tonight with its new judges, Ms Minogue and Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson . ‘It’s daunting at first, but then I forgot all the stuff that I was consciously worrying about beforehand like “How will I react?”, “How will I be?”, “What will I say?”, “Am I going to have something funny, wise, illuminating, touching?” ‘You literally just don’t know.  No one can prepare you, I don’t think.’ Kylie added: ‘Overall, the best thing anyone said was just be yourself. The more you are yourself  the better it is, and actually you don’t have any choice.’ She also revealed that she hopes to perform on the show herself during the series – but admitted she might be more nervous than usual after dishing out advice to hopeful contestants.","Australian pop star, 45, has replaced BBC1 show after major overhaul .

Wolf: Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured on the Andrew Marr Show, said the attitudes it embraces are 'more damaging' today . For his latest Hollywood role he has become an icon of hedonism, recklessness and the worst excesses of the banking industry. But according to Leonardo DiCaprio, even the profanity-laden, ultra-expensive life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, whom he plays in The Wolf of Walls Street, does not match up to the 'destructive' heights of today's Wall Street. The actor said that as the economy has grown, the culture of unbounded greed shown in the film, directed by Martin Scorsese, has becoming 'more and more damaging in our culture'. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said the culture of Wall Street as shown in the film, which is set mostly in the boom years of the 1990s, was 'incredibly destructive.' He then added: 'I think this attitude is more and . more damaging in our culture today. As our economy continues to expand, . the population continues to surge - this has to do with the evolution of . our species in a lot of ways.' And though the actor admitted that the excesses of the film - which shows bankers using prostitutes at work, taking hard drugs and even organising a midget-throwing competition - were distasteful, he insisted the 'cautionary tale' was simply being true to life. He said: 'People have been talking about a . protagonist getting his proper punishment at the end of a film. Our film . doesn’t have that because it’s the truth.' Responding to some critics, who have complained that the film ignores the suffering of investors who lost millions to line bankers' pockets, he said that when making the film a conscious decision had been made to show only the people living the high life. Banking excess: DiCaprio, who plays Jordan Belfont in the film, founds a corrupt stock-brokerage . High life: DiCaprio's character is pictured on his yacht, where he meets FBI investigators . Hedonism: The film features DiCaprio's character having sex on top of a pile of money . He explained: 'We very purposefully didn’t do that [include the victims]. To me, the best thing a film can do is immerse an audience completely in somebody else’s mindset. These people weren’t thinking about their victims – they were ships moving forward that didn’t think about the wake of their destruction.

As New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez is handed a season ban for 2014, 60 Minutes has examined the doping charges leveled against him. In a show due to be broadcast on CBS on Sunday, the chief witness against A-Rod in the MLB case will claim he injected the player with banned substances. Although A-Rod declined to take part in the CBS show, Anthony Bosch will feature alongside Major League Baseball's Rob Manfred. Claims: Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch alleged on 60 Minutes that he injected A-Rod with drugs . The drug charges made against A-Rod led originally to a 211-game suspension, but that was lowered on Saturday. The baseball player has denied using banned substances while at the Yankees and never tested positive for drugs while on the team. However, in 60 Minutes, Bosch alleges that he injected testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and a human growth hormone in A-Rod at least a dozen times. 'Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject,' he claimed, adding that the player paid him $12,000 a month. Biogenesis founder Bosch alleged that A-Rod had asked him what he gave his former client and MLB player Manny Ramirez, as the New York Yankee tried to achieve his dream of 800 home runs. Text messages between A-Rod and Bosch, that were seen by 60 Minutes, show that at times the pair were in contact daily. Bosch went on to claim that A-Rod's associates tried to intimidate him in an effort to prevent him from helping with the MLB investigation into the player. Fight back: Alex Rodriguez has denied using banned substances while playing for the New York Yankees . Investigation: Bosch is interviewed about the allegations on 60 Minutes . Manfred told the show the alleged threats appeared credible, 'particularly given that he identified . individuals that we had our own concerns about'. Bosch had originally denied giving players performance-enhancing drugs but he later started to co-operate with the investigation. The MLB dropped its lawsuit against Bosch and is paying for his security guards and legal fees. The arrangement has been described as a $5 million bribe by A-Rod in his own lawsuit against the MLB - a charge that Manfred has denied. The 38-year-old player has denied the doping claims, issuing a statement on Saturday that read: 'I have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to federal court.'","Biogenesis founder alleged he gave player testosterone and other banned substances .

Clardy, a Portland-based pimp, was wearing a pair of Jordans when he stomped on the face of a man who was attempting to leave a hotel without paying Clardy's prostitute, the paper adds.

'Under product liability there is a certain standard of care that is required to be up-held by potential dangerous product,' he said. 'Do [sic] to the fact that these defendants named in this Tort claim failed to warn of risk or to provide an adequate warning or instruction it has caused personal injury in the likes of mental suffering.'

A care home was fined £140,000 after the death of a pensioner who staff failed to realise was missing for eight hours on a freezing cold November night. Dorothy Spicer, 84, who suffered from . Alzheimer's, was found the following morning lying in the grounds of the . Whitefriars Care Home in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Although she was suffering from hypothermia, staff waited 80 minutes before calling her an ambulance. Mrs Spicer,  previously a lively women able to get around with the aid of a walking stick, never recovered and remained bed-ridden in hospital until she died two months later in January 2010. The Order of St John Care Trust, which owns the home, admitted breaching the Health and Safety At Work Act by failing to ensure the safety of Mrs Spicer. As well as the £140,000 fine, the trust - which is the second largest not-for-profit provider of care homes across the UK - was also ordered to pay £65,000 costs. Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, Judge Michael Heath said: 'In this case there were corporate, systematic and procedural failings which were ultimately a significant and substantial cause of Mrs Spicer’s death. 'The Trust fell far short of providing a safe standard. Serious injury or worse was plainly foreseeable. It is only a matter of good fortune that no tragedy occurred before that which befell Mrs Spicer.' Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting, said Mrs Spicer was last noticed sitting in her usual chair in a communal lounge at the care home at 8.30 pm on the evening of November 25, 2009. No-one saw her wander off and it was only at 5.20 am the following morning that she was found, still in her day clothes, lying in the gardens of the home. The security alarm on the door she almost certainly walked through on her way out of the building had been disabled, which meant that staff were not warned of her departure. Whitefriars Residential Care Home: The Order of St John Care Trust, which owns the home, admitted breaching the Health and Safety At Work Act by failing to ensure the safety of Mrs Spicer . 'She was conscious but not coherent. An ambulance should have been called immediately but she was brought back in and attempts were made to warm her,' said Mr Thorogood. It was only when day staff started to arrive that the emergency services were alerted and Mrs Spicer was taken to Peterborough Hospital where she was found to be suffering from hypothermia. Her death on January 21, 2010, was directly attributed to the hypothermia which left her with restricted mobility and brought on pneumonia. Mr Thorogood said: 'This was exposure of vulnerable residents of a care home to avoidable risks. 'The . investigation found failings that were corporate, systematic and . procedural. These were a substantial cause of the loss of Mrs Spicer’s . life. 'There was a lack of . adequate leadership. There was a failing by management at the care home . and from higher up within the Trust.' 'The total malfunction of that home is unbelievable': Mrs Spicer's daughter Jane Howard reads a family statement after the company which operated the care home was fined £140,000 for failing to ensure her safety . Staff complained they were under so much pressure they were not able to carry out a proper handover to the following shift and no head counts were carried out to establish that all residents were on the premises. Mrs Spicer, a widow from Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, had been cared for by her two daughters before eventually going to live at Whitefriars two years before her death. Both were in court to hear the Trust admit its failings.

Irish Republicans plotted to kidnap Queen Victoria at Balmoral to help free prisoners, it has emerged. The ‘desperate and daring’ terrorists wanted to take the Queen from her Scottish estate and hold her hostage in a shabby cottage, according to newly-released records. The rifle-wielding gang from Salford, Greater Manchester, intended to keep her until the government agreed to release Republicans from prisons across Britain and Ireland. Irish Republicans planned to kidnap Queen Victoria from the Balmoral estate in 1867, it has emerged . After a respected former police officer raised the alarm about the plot, dozens of undercover detectives, armed with revolvers and cutlasses, were sent to the estate, according to the Mirror. A warning about the plot was sent to Scotland Yard from Manchester’s chief constable on October 14 1867. Although he conceded he found it hard to believe such an ‘audacious’ plot would be carried out, he made clear he trusted his ‘intelligent’ and ‘perfectly sober’ informant. The paper reports him as writing: ‘[The . Republicans] believe Her Majesty goes about the country with very few . attendants, no guard and that there will be no difficulty in . accomplishing their design.’ He said the assault was planned for the . following Tuesday. After an ex-police officer raised the alarm, dozens of undercover detectives were sent to the estate . Detectives were sent to the Aberdeenshire estate but the operation was scaled down after a few days when plotters may have realised their plans had been found out. Queen Victoria was 48 years old at the time of the plot and 30 years into her reign. She died in January 1901 at the age of 81. The files have been made available in the National Archives at Kew, West London, after 147 years.","'Desperate and daring' terrorists planned to keep her in a shabby cottage .

Up to 1,000 high-definition cameras will be used by officers for a year in a £1.6million test of the cutting-edge technology. Commanders hope the footage will help restore trust in the force and give an ‘objective’ account of the most controversial confrontations. Trial: Patrolling police officers in London will start wearing the first of three camera models in April . The announcement comes just days after an inquest ruled Mark Duggan, from Tottenham in North London, was lawfully killed by armed officers in 2011, in an incident which sparked riots. Questions over the actions of those involved in the shooting dogged the Met for more than two years. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, head of the Met’s firearms unit, added: ‘I am absolutely convinced it is the right thing to do. 'These are officers who want to be believed and want the public to trust them, and if that is what it takes, that’s what we have to do.’ The move has been hailed as a positive, behaviour-changing move which will instill faith in the Force .

A Georgia community has rallied around a Vietnam veteran who has been living out of his minivan with his dog for more than a year after being evicted from his home by mortgage giant Freddie Mac. John Chambers, 65, lost his house in Victory Park, Marietta, in January 2013 and has lived in a Walmart parking lot since, with his seven-year-old border collie Scout. Chambers says he was evicted without warning, lost his job after his employer learned he was homeless and has had trouble finding alternative housing through the Veterans Administration. Home: The minivan Chambers and his dog scout have called home for more than a year . Hope: Chambers was disheartened by the turn of events but has been touched by the outpouring of kindness from the community since his situtation was made public . Chambers is a former architectural draftsman who served in Vietnam and helped build facilities for U.S. troops in Iraq as a private contractor. The veteran's home is now owned by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., also known as Freddie Mac. Chambers sued the corporation, claiming that he was wrongfully evicted without proper notice and was led to believe he was being placed in a loan modification program. Freddie Mac spokesman, Brad German, says the corporation doesn't comment on pending litigation. Local paper the Marietta Daily Journal published a story about Chambers' situation earlier this week as he prepared to spend another night in his van while the region was hit with sub-freezing temperatures and wind chills. Since then, hundreds of people have offered money, temporary shelter and food for his dog, Scout, he said. 'I'm so overwhelmed I really don't know what to say,' Chambers told the newspaper before checking into an extended stay hotel room being paid for by the American Legion Post 29 in Marietta.'Tons of people have come out to the car, dropping off food, cards, asking how they can help, telling me I could stay the night in their house. This is surreal. I don't want to be in the limelight, really. I'm a little uncomfortable by it. But it humbles me. People coming by, giving me money, giving me groceries. People have been coming out of the woodwork all day,' he said. Cold world: College-educated architect and Vietnam War veteran John Chambers, who has been living homeless in his minivan since January of 2013, prepares for another cold night inside his mini-van in a local shopping center parking lot with his dog Scout . When he was evicted, Chambers approached a homeless shelter with Scout, but the facility did not accept dogs. So he chose to stay in his minivan with his beloved dog. The Veterans Administration was less than helpful.“They said they were going to try and find me some housing. I drove to East Point, and when I got there they said they didn’t have any housing,” he said. “I asked ‘Why did you make me drive all the way from Marietta to East Point when you could have told me that over the phone?’ And she said, ‘Oh, I didn’t want to but my supervisor told me to do it.’” Chambers told the Marietta Daily Journal.Chambers told the Marietta Daily Journal that at least 100 people have come to visit him in his minivan since the story was published, bringing cards, cash, dog food and offers of accommodation. Homeless: John Chambers checks on his former home in the Victory Park Community of Marietta, Georgia. His 186 Parkview Drive home was foreclosed on by Freddie Mac which he is currently fighting in court . The service officer for Post 29 of the American Legion, Ken Buechel, said the group's goal is to help Chambers find a new job and get back on his feet. Metro Atlanta real estate agent, Melody Unger, and her attorney have also formed a nonprofit group to try saving Chambers' home.'She's trying to get investors to actually buy my house, which would be my best bet because I'd like to drop this lawsuit like a hot potato,' Chamber said. He's spent more than $22,000 in legal fees trying to save his house, which is worth about $50,000.Unger said she contacted her attorney, Elizabeth Cook, and shared the story with her. The two women have now formed a nonprofit organization, JRC Home Fund Inc., to which people can donate money to help save Chambers’ home. Man's best friend: Chambers was unable to take Scout to a homeless shelter with him so chose to stay with the dog in his minivan . “If we can just get 100 people to donate $500 I feel like we could probably get the house for $50,000,” Unger said.Despite falling on hard times and facing uncertainty, Chambers said the outpouring of support has rekindled his optimism.'I was getting into a bitter state but it's a whole new world out there and I have a new life because of this,' he said. 'Just to have found one person in this world like all of the ones I've run into so far would have been enough to change my outlook. And here I've found more than a hundred.'","John Chamber, 65, has been living in his car with his dog Scout for more than a year .

Lewis Clarke is due to set off later this month on a gruelling 735-mile, 60-day trek in temperatures that can drop to minus 40C. But Lewis has already demonstrated his mettle by being part of the youngest relay team to swim the English Channel – at the age of 12. Tough journey: Lewis Clarke, pictured training in Greenland earlier this year, will walk 12.5 miles a day in blizzards and temperatures as low as minus 40C . His latest journey will take him from Union Glacier on the coast of western Antarctica to the Pole,  9,000ft above sea level. Accompanied by polar guide Carl Alvey, he hopes to walk an average  of 12.5 miles a day, carrying tents and equipment weighing 150lb –  and possibly confronting appalling blizzards. The youngster will be trying to beat the record set by Canadian Sarah McNair-Landry, who skied to the South Pole in 2005 aged 18. Lewis, a pupil at Queen Elizabeth’s Hospital School in Bristol, is raising money for the Prince’s Trust and already has the backing of TV presenter Dan Snow and a number of business sponsors. From scratch: Lewis has had to learn cross country skiing in order to take part in the trek . Heavy: The youngster will be carrying 150lb of equipment and supplies on the 750-mile journey . New heights: Lewis pictured walking on his first glacier in Alaska in July 2011 . Lewis said: ‘Some people claim to have walked or skied to the South Pole, but have done only the last 100 miles or so. Mine will be the real deal – the full, mind-blowingly freezing, 735-mile trip from the coast of Antarctica all the way to the Pole.’ To add to the challenge, Lewis is new to cross-country skiing and had his first lessons on Norway’s Hardanger Plateau in February. He said: ‘It’s the place where Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who beat Captain Scott to the Pole in 1911, trained. It was the only place where Amundsen struggled and nearly died.’ In March, Lewis spent two weeks  in Greenland. He said: ‘There was just one problem – we had the most unbelievable weather. No blizzard-force winds, no freezing temperatures, just sun and clear skies. The sun made the scenery look glorious but for experience it would have been good to see what really bad weather can be like.’ Charity: The 15-year-old is raising money for the Prince's Trust and already has the backing of TV presenter Dan Snow .

Lewis and his parents are aware of the dangers posed by Antarctica’s brutal climate, which has defeated the most seasoned explorers, including Scott who died there in 1912. He added: ‘It’s the greatest adventure of my life so far, and the greatest physical challenge, but there  are real risks.’ His mother Sarah Johnson, a trainee GP, said: ‘When Lewis said he wanted to swim the Channel, like any mother I was worried. Now he’s upping the ante, so there are greater worries this time. ‘But he’s trained hard and if anyone can do it, Lewis can. At least he’s doing something amazing rather than hanging around on street corners or playing computer games all day. We’re so proud of him.’ His father Stephen Clarke, a TV executive, added: ‘There’s no knowing with Lewis, he’s so intrepid. But whatever he comes up with, we’ll support him.’","Lewis Clarke is due to set off  on the 735-mile journey later this month .

An American diplomat has been expelled from Delhi as India kicks back at the U.S. after one of its diplomatic team was forced to leave. India's deputy consul in New York, Devyani Khobragade, was facing an indictment charging her with visa fraud and paying her housekeeper below the minimum wage. As she arrived back in India to take up a post at the United Nations that offers her diplomatic immunity, the U.S. was ordered to remove one member of its diplomatic team from its embassy in Delhi. Back home: Devyani Khobragade is pictured with her father, left, as she arrives back in Delhi on Friday . The name of the official due to be removed from Delhi is not known, but it is believed that they are of a similar rank to Khobragade. The State Department confirmed to NBC that one of its officials will be leaving Delhi, as tensions between the countries increased after Khobragade was arrested and strip-searched. 'We deeply regret that the Indian . government felt it was necessary to expel one of our diplomatic . personnel. This has clearly been a challenging time in the U.S.-India . relationship,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Khobragade's arrest on December 12 was denounced as 'barbaric' by Indian officials, who refused to waive her diplomatic immunity so she could be prosecuted. In the rising tension over the case, security barriers around the U.S. Embassy in Delhi were removed, and a visiting delegation was snubbed by Indian officials, the BBC reported. An order has also been made to halt . 'commercial activities' at the embassy, which has a bowling alley, . swimming pool and gym, and is used by non-diplomats. New role: Khobragade has been given a post at the UN that will offer her diplomatic immunity . Reaction: Security barriers at the U.S. Embassy in Delhi are removed as tensions between the countries rise . In the U.S. a 20-page indictment had accused 39-year-old Khobragade of creating a fake employment contract to obtain a visa for her housekeeper, Sangeet Richard, that claimed she would be paid $9.75 an hour for a 40-hour week. However, a Manhattan grand jury found the housekeeper was paid less than $2 an hour after being made to work more than 90 hours a week, with no days off or sick leave. When India refused to lift her diplomatic immunity, the U.S. ordered Khobragade to leave the country. She will be allowed to return only to face a court. Khobragade has denied the charges. A statement issued by her lawyer Daniel Arshack said: 'She knows she has done no wrong and looks forward to assuring the truth is known.'","Devyani Khobragade given UN post that offers her diplomatic immunity .

A woman whose tenacity and sexually charged savvy famously helped win millions in damages for a chemical-leak plagued small town will now seek justice for the 300,000 West Virginians whose tap water was poisoned Thursday thanks to what appears to be a chemical company's shoddy safety practices. Erin Brockovich announced on her personal website Friday that she and her team are headed to Charleston, West Virginia to investigate the cause and possible implications of the 750,000 gallons of a coal processing chemical that spilled into the region's water supply from a leaking tank at Freedom Industries. 'You have to find out what’s going on,' declared the gutsy blond who became a household name when Julia Roberts played her in a 2000 Hollywood film. Famous name: Erin Brockovich, who famously helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win some $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she'll step in to lend her expertise 300,000 West Virginians' fight for justice . No ally: As 300,000 residents in and around Charleston, West Virginia suffer without water safe to drink or even bath in, a banner name in safe water and environmental advocacy has joined their cause . It's an imperative that may not be easily met: as federal and state officials scramble to uncover who's to blame for the disaster, a complex hierarchy of ownership of the plant in question starts at small town Freedom itself and slithers upward to the likes of Koch Industries. Thursday's tragedy began with a smell: residents of Charleston, West Virginia began to complain of a licorice-like aroma in the air, one that seemed most potent near the town's water treatment plant. For an unknown period, a chemical called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol used in the Mountain State's prevalent coal industry had been gushing into the Elk River, a waterway from which West Virginia's largest water treatment plant sources its water. Beware: More than 300,000 people have been told to indefinitely avoid drinking or even touching tap water following Thursday's chemical spill in Charleston, West Virgina . Amazing life: Brockovich (right) became a household name after Julia Roberts (left) portrayed her in 2000's Erin Brockovich, for which the Roberts won a best actress Oscar. After Brocovich's $300,000,000 victory against the chemical company responsible for sickening countless residents of Hinkley, Calilfornia, she has continued her fight by helping other communities . Panicked officials warned residents in nine counties to immediately and indefinitely stop using their tap water and to not even touch it. As West Virginians swarmed stores to purchase bottled water they had no clue when they might get their water back because officials--some seemingly clueless and others unwilling to say what they may or may not know about the leak--remained mum on a cleanup time-frame. The unanswered questions greatly outweighed the answers. 'I can't tell you that the water is unsafe, but I also can't tell you that the water is safe,'was West Virginia Water president Jeff McIntyre beguiling answer to reporters eager to know the dangers of the spill at a Friday press conference. Torn community: Bonnie Wireman of Dry Branch, West Virginia talks about how the ban on using tap water for drinking and washing has detrimentally effected her and her family Sunday. The coal miner widow made clear that she did not blame the coal or chemical industries for the spill . Necessary for life: Bonnie Wireman of Dry Branch has to cover her faucets in bags as a reminder that she cannot use the tap water in her home because of Thursday's spill . It left people, especially those unable to leave the affected area--the poor, the disabled, the elderly--terrified. It's just that sort of scenario that catches the attentions of the famed environmental crusader and her investigative team. 'When things like this happen, we respond accordingly,' Brockovich told The West Virginia Record. 'People have contacted us who are concerned, and it’s certainly a . scenario that concerns us. I mean, there are 300,000 people without . water right now.' 'The emergency now is getting the back-up plan and getting water to these people and businesses. 'Then, . we can look at damages. We don’t know any of the answer to this right . now. I mean, what didn’t we learn from the BP spill or the Tennessee . Valley Authority spill. What have we not learned? 'We . have to start looking at the question of, ""Are we forcing an issue . where speed, greed and money are more important than safety?""' After . fixing the immediate problem of finding drinking water, Brockovich said . it must be determine what lasting affects West Virginia's leak will . have on its children, ecosystem and wildlife. It's . the same process she took beginning in 1993 when she began her quest in . Hinkley, California where Pacific Gas and Electric helped sicken an . entire town following a serious and subsequently concealed release of . dangerous Chromium 6 into the town well water. The . detrimental health effects of chromium 6 are well studied, however the . compound the poured into the West Virginia river last week is not nearly . as well understood, especially at the extreme levels released during . the leak. Dire need: Employees of the South Charleston Public Works Department help local residents to obtain water as officials remained mum as to win the tap water would become safe again . Workers at Freedom Industries continued through the night to empty storage tanks of chemicals into tanker trucks at it's plant in Charleston, West Virginia on Sunday, days after it dumped 7,500 gallons of a toxic chemical into the river where 300,000 residents in the area get their water .

Poison control experts won't categorize 4-methylcyclohexane methanol as lethal but will only refer to the chemical as 'harmful if swallowed.' The substance is considered dangerous to touch, hence the warnings not to bathe in city water.

It will take days for the substance in the water to break down and far longer for it to break down in the soil surrounding the river.

Risk: The head of the Inspired Gaming Group was one of 20 business leaders handpicked to join Mr Osborne on the trip . Chancellor George Osborne is facing questions over why he took a betting firm tycoon on a trip to China. Luke Alvarez, a boss of one of the world’s biggest makers of betting machines, was taken on a trade mission to the superpower. The head of the Inspired Gaming Group was one of 20 business leaders handpicked to join Mr Osborne on the trip. His firm supplies nearly half of Britain’s 34,000 Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs). But campaigners against the machines - known as the ‘crack cocaine’ of the casino industry - condemned the invitation. Matt Zarb-Cousins of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: ‘Mr Cameron might say he’s concerned about FOBTs but he appears to care more about the profits of the firm that makes them. ‘The Government should protect people from addictive gambling products rather than the interest of the betting industry.’ Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘Everyone was surprised when the government was unresponsive to call for reform of FOBTs. Now we know why - they were too busy jet-setting with the makers of the machines. ‘We used to be famed around the world for our manufacturing but now George Osborne takes the makes of digital roulette machines on international trade missions.’ There was no answer to the Daily Mail’s phone calls to the Inspired Gaming Group yesterday. The trade visit to China in October was designed to ‘showcase the best of Britain’s digital technology industry, strengthen ties between British and Chinese companies and help British companies gain access to the fast-expanding Chinese market’. Mr Alvarez has won two deals to supply fixed odds football and lottery games to China, according to the Sunday People. The rise of FOBTs across British high streets has alarmed residents and anti-gambling campaigners. While the industry has denied that it is targeting poorer communities, there is concern that punters can lose up to £300 a minute in the machines. While the industry has denied that it is targeting poorer communities, there is concern that punters can lose up to £300 a minute in the machines . The Prime Minister recently admitted FOBTs were ‘a problem’ and called for cross party support for action when a review of the dangers reports back in the Spring. Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed handing new powers to local authorities to reduce the number of FOBTs in betting shops. There is a current limit to four, though critics have said that bookies are getting away with more in a community by simply opening up new shops. Mr Miliband also wants to increase the time between bets as he warned that the machines were ‘spreading like an epidemic’. Labour forced a vote in the Commons last week on the plans to give councils more powers over the machines. But the government voted down the plans by 314 to 232, majority 82. Culture Minster Helen Grant has said the UK’s five largest bookmakers will make changes to the way the machines operate from March. The Minister has said bookmakers must take immediate action to increase protection for players. She said the government was waiting for the findings of a study into how the machines are used and their impact on players before deciding what further action needed to be taken. According to the Gambling Commission, there are close to 34,000 fixed odds terminals making over £1.2 billion every year. Mr Cameron has blamed Labour for the rise of the machines, noting they were ‘introduced in 2001 after the [last] Government had relaxed gambling regulations’.","George Osborne took Luke Alvarez to China on trade mission .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 06:07 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 13 January 2014 . An elderly woman has revealed that she has handed over £200,000 to fraudsters after half a century of being targeted with letters claiming that she had won a fortune. Sylvia Kneller, 76, became addicted to answering the scam letters, which demanded that she pay a small amount of money in order to receive the thousands of pounds she was supposedly owed. Among the frauds she was caught up in were claims that she had won the lottery and a letter from a so-called psychic offering to pass on her powers to Mrs Kneller. The pensioner says that her inability to ignore the fraudulent messages led to the break-up of her marriage and caused her to have a nervous breakdown. Tricked: Sylvia Kneller has given £200,000 to fraudsters over half a century after receiving begging letters . Last year local officials were forced to step in and protect Mrs Kneller, saying that she had been exploited worse than anyone else they had ever encountered. The retired cleaner from Farnham in Surrey first started receiving begging letters from fraudsters at the age of 20, and was soon sucked in to a series of scams. Typically, they would tell her that she was eligible for a prize worth thousands of pounds, but first had to hand over a smaller sum such as £20 or £100 as a 'transaction fee'. Some of the letters have been still more outlandish - one recent example claimed to come from a clairvoyant named 'Madame Soleil' and told Mrs Kneller she could inherit the psychic's mystical abilities. The victim said she was unable to stop responding to the letters even though they were obviously hoaxes, adding that the fraudsters sent her so many messages that she believed they had a personal relationship. Anger: The scammers took advantage of the 76-year-old because they knew she was vulnerable . Suffering: Surrey County Council said that Mrs Kneller's case was the worst one they had ever encountered . 'The scammers used to write me personal letters, I'd look forward to getting them,' she told The Sun's Rhodri Phillips. 'I thought they were my friends - but they were out to rip me off.' Mrs Kneller added: 'All the mail that I have been getting I realised was spam mail, spam letters - but it does get you all excited and they shouldn't do that to old people, it's not right. 'I can honestly say I've never had one penny over all these years. But in your mind, if you're a believer, you believe it and that's it - it becomes like an addiction.' She said that she had suffered a number of medical issues - including a nervous breakdown - as a result of the letters, and her obsession with the bogus payouts destroyed her relationship with her first husband. The pensioner was one of 80 people identified by Surrey County Council as being particularly vulnerable to scammers, leading trading standards officials to intervene. Pile: The pensioner still receives dozens of letters a week despite the council intervening . Mrs Kneller now knows to ignore the begging letters, but still receives dozens of messages a week because fraudsters regard her as a promising target. Steve Playle of Surrey Council said: 'This is the worst case we have come across, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were worst out there that we haven't come across yet. 'We want to encourage people to speak to their elderly neighbours and friends and if they are receiving these types of mail, to make sure they are not responding to them and to point out they are not going to get any money, they are just lining the pockets of fraudsters.' Mr Playle added: 'Sometimes people are quite lonely, it's their only contact with the outside world, they do feel addicted and I know people find it hard to understand. 'Sylvia is one of those people and it's quite brave of her to come forward and be highlighted as a victim to warn others.' Action Fraud, a Government body which aims to help the victims of scams, warned Britons to beware of any messages asking them to hand over money in exchange for an unexpected reward.","Sylvia Kneller, 76, began receiving letters from fraudsters when she was 20 .

Hardworking families are being forced to pay up to £528 extra in council tax every year to cover the cost of those who fail to pay their bills. New figures show the total sum left uncollected last year totalled £2.4billion, a new record, with Liverpool council the worst offender in allowing £114million to slip through its fingers. With every penny that goes uncollected adding to a higher bill for law-abiding families, the average UK council tax bill now includes a £102 tax-dodger subsidy. Subsidy: Hardworking families pay up to £528 extra in council tax every year to cover the cost of those who fail to pay their bills. Every penny that goes uncollected adds to a higher bill for law-abiding citizens . Nine of the ten worst offenders are Labour-run councils, many of whom complain about problems caused by government budget cuts while simultaneously allowing tens of millions of pounds to vanish through council tax dodges. The country’s total council tax arrears has risen 25 per cent in five years. By far the worst offender is Liverpool . council, who in 2013 allowed a staggering £114m to go unpaid – leaving . the average household paying an extra £528 a year simply to counter the . cost of people failing to pay their bills. Liverpool - £114m, adds £528 to average bill . Hackney - £41.8m, adds £403 to average bill . Haringey - £32.6m, adds £313 to average bill . Hounslow - £29.7m, adds £306 to average bill . Lambeth - £38m, adds £284 to average bill . Islington - £28.1m, adds £277 to average bill . Croydon - £40m, adds £271 to average bill . Lewisham - £31.8m, adds £268 to average bill . Newham - £27.8m, adds £265 to average bill . Enfield - £32.1m, adding £264 to average bill . This is despite Liverpool’s mayor Joe Anderson recently warning that government funding cuts could lead to riots in the city. Outside Liverpool, the top ten councils with the worst collection rates are all in London. Labour-run Hackney council failed to collect a total of £41.9 million last year, adding £403 to an average household’s council tax bill, while Haringey allowed £32.6 million to disappear, forcing families to fork out an extra £313 each. Hounslow came in fourth place nationwide, with the total £29.7 million uncollected adding a £306 subsidy to a typical council tax bill. The likes of Croydon and Lambeth councils appear slightly further down the list  thanks to a large population bringing down the average added to taxpayers’ bills, but they were easily among the worst offenders in terms of total money left uncollected. Croydon allowed £40million to slip through its fingers last year, while Lambeth let tax dodgers off without paying a total of £38million. Warning: Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson recently said government funding cuts could lead to rioting similar to that in August 2011 (pictured). This is despite Liverpool council allowing £114 million to go uncollected . In contrast, the best performing council in the country is Conservative-run Amber Valley in Derbyshire, where only £718,0o0 went unpaid, adding an average subsidy of just £13 per household. Speaking to the Sun, local government minister Brandon Lewis said: 'Every penny not collected means a higher bill for the law-abiding citizen who does pay on time.'","Total council tax left uncollected totalled £2.4billion last year, a new record .

The University of Utah will provide free paternity tests to people who used the on-campus fertility clinic after it was revealed a rogue employee swapped his own sperm with samples. Convicted kidnapper Thomas R. Lippert worked at the now-defunct Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City from 1988 to 1993, during which time a woman was impregnated with Lippert's sperm instead of her husband's. The university said today that the school had been investigating 'credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample' since April 2013, CBS reported. It is offering clients who used the facility during Lippert's employment free paternity tests. Thomas R. Lippert served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electo-shock therapy . The university said it did not own or operate the clinic, but contracted with RMTI for specimen preparation. Lippert served two years in . prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 . and performing 'love experiments' on her including electroshock therapy, . threatening her family and locking her up in a black box over a . three-week period. Lippert went on to work at the Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993. His deception was only revealed after a Utah family who visited the clinic for IVF in 1982 sent cheek swabs off for online genetic testing. The results were shocking with the family discovering that their 21-year-old daughter Ashley was not related to the man she believed to be her father but instead was Lippert's child. The mother of the family tracked down a cousin of Lippert's who revealed the man's past.  A genetic test with Lippert's 99-year-old mother revealed that Ashley is his daughter. The girl's mother Paula told KUTV that she and her husband Jeff were 'shook' but she reminds herself that she loves her daughter as much as ever. According to reports, Lippert would keep a wall of portraits of children born through the clinic at his desk and seemed 'proud' of them, sparking fears he may have secretly fathered other children. Paula asked: 'All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I thought, ''oh . my god how many of those are his biological children?''' Information as to just what happened at the sperm bank are sketchy as Lippert died in 1999 and the clinic closed in 1998. Appeals are being made for anyone who received a sperm donation at this time and may have doubts to come forward. CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist, has set up a site Was Your Child Fathered by Thomas Lippert? as she is concerned that there may be more children fathered by Lippert in the Salt Lake City area. Lippert's widow, who did not have any children with the kidnapper said she was not surprised by the revelations, telling KUTV: 'I think, because Tom didnâ€™t have any kids, he wanted to have a lot of kids out there.' Mrs Lippert said that she tried to leave her husband but that he had threatened to kill her. Thomas Lippert worked at  Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993 where it is believed he swapped sperm samples with his own. Pictured right, Lippert as a young law professor . Lippert was found guilty of the abduction of fine-arts student Susan Wells Cochran, 21, when he was a 25-year-old law professor at Southwest State College in Marshall, Minnesota. The professor, who was a friend of Miss Cochran, tried to 'brainwash her into falling in love with him' with the help of a student assistant Harold Ross Tenneson, 21. The kidnappers drove Miss Cochran through several states after abducting her when she posted an ad for a ride to Boston to visit her boyfriend. Miss Cochran told People: 'We got 30 miles out of town. And, well, that was it.' She was forced to strip and endure electroshock therapy confined in a 'black box'. She was also forced to sleep in the same bed as Lippert but he did not rape her. The student was found three weeks later at the Southwest State Library by FBI after a lengthy search for the missing woman. Lippert accepted a plea bargain for the government and served two years in jail along with undergoing psychiatric treatment for 90 days.","Thomas Lippert served two years for kidnapping student in 1975 .

A boss was hounded at his family home during a bullying campaign by members of  the Unite union over proposed job cuts. Matthew Ingle had to hire security guards and sought a High Court injunction after protesters allegedly carrying banners, horns and sirens descended on his house in a small village. They were also accused of bad mouthing the 59-year-old to neighbours near Skipton, North Yorkshire, after his company announced plans to move a transport operation – threatening the jobs of 53 lorry drivers at DHL. Conflict: Protesters allegedly descended on Matthew Ingle's home as 53 jobs at DHL came under threat . Protesters posted warnings to Mr Ingle on a Facebook page and were said to have indicated that he would have ‘no peace’ until he reconsidered his decision. One entry read: ‘We came to your town where you do your shopping. We came to your village and spoke to your neighbours. ‘We came to your local pub where you have a drink. We came to your house but you hid behind your large gates... ‘Come back to the table and talk to our Unite reps. We are not going away. We have nothing to lose.’ The allegations follow revelations in the Mail that Unite leader Len McCluskey was using dirty tricks to target executives and their families in Scotland last year . Other online posts accused Mr Ingle of being a ‘coward’ and ‘running scared’. Unite, Labour’s biggest donor, yesterday refused to condemn the actions and boasted that it was ‘proud’ of having saved some of the jobs. The revelations come after the Mail revealed how Unite boss Len McCluskey deployed a dirty tricks ‘leverage’ squad to target executives and their families during last year’s dispute at Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery, which was at the heart of the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk Labour party. The campaign against Mr Ingle started after his kitchen supply company, Howdens Joinery, announced plans to move a transport operation from Widnes, Cheshire, to Howden, East Yorkshire. Details of the three protests at Mr Ingle’s home which took place last January and February emerged in court papers after he applied for an injunction to end the ‘harassment to himself and his family and the nuisance and trespass to his property’. It is believed the injunction was not pursued. Tory MP Priti Patel condemned the tactics. She said: ‘Nobody should have to live in fear of union bully boys demonstrating outside their family home. 'But Ed Miliband refuses to condemn this deplorable behaviour in case he upsets his union paymasters.’ A Unite spokesman  said: ‘Unite is proud of having saved our members’ jobs at Howdens Joinery.’ Labour said: ‘We condemn intimidatory tactics from either unions or management in any dispute.’","Matthew Ingle, 59, allegedly bombarded with sirens and banners at home .

David Cameron’s populist attacks on immigration risk ‘destroying the future’ of the British people, a senior EU official has claimed in an extraordinary attack on an elected Prime Minister. Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission, accused Mr Cameron of fuelling fears of an 'invasion' and claimed Britons claiming ‘much more’ in benefits than EU migrants. It is the latest broadside from the continent aimed at the Prime Minister since he complained about child benefit being exported across the EU and urged other European leaders to curb immigration. Scroll down for video . Attack: Viviane Reding, vice-president of the European Commission, accused David Cameron of fuelling populist rhetoric about and immigration 'invasion' Mr Cameron has made clear that tackling immigration from Europe would be a key demand of his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. Taking part in an online web chat, Miss Reding said Mr Cameron was using populist attacks on Europe to win votes, to the detriment of the Bririth people. ‘The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections,’ she said. ‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [in Britain]. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually. Pressure: The Prime Minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of Britain's EU membership to tackle immigration . ‘What the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out. “And those who take out of social security are much more the [UK] nationals than the European Union citizens, who take advantage of the free movement of people. ‘It’s just a myth to speak about an invasion, this invasion is just not taking place.’ At the weekend Mr Cameron said: ‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’ The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union. He added: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.’ But the remarks triggered an angry response from Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Mr Cameron of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules.

Alan Cox, 47, said he was a 'latent homosexual' but admitted preying on girls while under the influence of drugs bought online . A man who dropped his trousers in front of two teenage girls told a court he was a 'latent homosexual' and blamed drugs he had bought off the internet for his actions. Alan Cox, 47, from Nelson, Lancashire, said he had no recollection of running towards the girls shouting 'My pants are falling down' and said he may have been suffering a bipolar episode, Burnley Crown Court heard. But the divorced father-of-three, who told police he had taken the legal high NRG-3 before the incident in Colne, Lancashire, admitted indecent exposure, breaching a ban on him contacting young girls, and possessing an indecent image of a child. Cox, a convicted paedophile, was jailed for two years after the court heard that he had been released from jail three months before the incident on May 26 last year. He was said to be in a psychotic state when he let himself into a house in Colne holding an armful of teddy bears, and claiming he was looking for his ex-wife. He was fobbed off and left, but just after 10pm he drove three times past two girls aged 15 and 16 before stopping his BMW and running towards them, shouting 'My pants are falling down'. The court heard that Cox, who was holding a piece of wire, let go of his trousers and they fell around his knees.  The girls fled to a nearby house and the father of one of them went out looking for Cox. Robert Elias, prosecuting, said the father found Cox's car and let down two of its tyres to prevent him running away. Meanwhile, Cox leapt over a wall, landing near a railway line where police were investigating the death of a man who fell from a bridge. Mr Elias said: 'He was behaving . bizarrely, singing to himself. He was arrested on suspicion of murder . and taken into custody.' When . questioned, Cox said he had run away from a police road block and had . been sprinting for his life, his trousers fell down and he pulled them . back up. He told officers he had taken NRG3, a legal high, bought over . the internet, and it had made him paranoid. Cox, who represented himself at Burnley Crown Court, said he was a 'latent homosexual' with no interest in women . The . prosecutor said : 'It seems he was in a state where he was paranoid. He . thought he was about to be shot. He doesn’t accept that the police . murder inquiry was real. 'He thought that was some sort of persecution of . him. He was also in a disinhibited state sexually.' A psychiatrist said Cox struck while in a temporary, drug-induced psychotic state, caused by legal highs. The court was told that he had also walked uninvited into a neighbour’s house with an armful of teddy bears.  After he was arrested, he was taken to a police station spent most of his time naked in his cell and carrying out sex acts. At Burnley Crown Court, Lancashire, the father-of-three, from Nelson said he had no recollection of the offences but claimed it was 'highly improbable' they happened, as he was a 'latent homosexual'. Cox, who represented himself in court and said he planned to return to his native New Zealand as soon as he could, added: 'I am not interested in women.' When he was arrested, Cox said he had taken so-called 'legal highs' - drugs he had bought online (file image) He said: 'I find the charges highly . improbable and certainly implausible and it would appear there is a . miscarriage of justice about to take place. 'I have no defence. I have no memory. The only defence I have is I was bipolar and having an episode at the time.' He added: 'I was abused as a child by another man, which makes it even more implausible that I would do such a thing.' Inquiries revealed Cox had been banned from contacting girls under 16 under an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) after being given 33 months' jail for assaulting a 12-year-old girl in 2010. He also had a caution for molesting a 15-year-old girl, the court heard. Cox admitted breaching the SOPO, indecent exposure and possessing an indecent photo of a child and was jailed for two years on Friday. He was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life and will be banned from working with children indefinitely. Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said it was 'odd and disturbing' that the defendant had had some wire with him. He told Cox: 'You have mentioned there would be a miscarriage of justice but you also indicate that you have no defence and you must understand that I have to sentence you on the basis of the facts as they have been outlined to me in court.' 'I sincerely hope that during the course of your remaining time in custody, and whilst on licence, that you will do intensive work to do with your background problem with drugs.'","Alan Cox, 47, from Nelson, Lancashire, dropped trousers in front of girls .

Mr Lockett, described as a hardworking potter at a firm in Stoke, Staffordshire, had no previous convictions or cautions. A father-of-two who took out a payday loan to set up a cannabis factory has been jailed. Keith Lockett, 32, cultivated the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room . Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that 'completely out of character' and to raise money, he grew the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room. He was only raided when neighbours reported an 'unusual smell' coming from his property. Neighbours claim Lockett was a fan of US TV show Breaking Bad - which sees high school chemistry teacher Walter White (played by actor Bryan Cranston) being diagnosed with inoperable cancer and turning to a life of drugs crime. Neighbour Denise Paul, 46, said: 'People on the street have been saying he was a fan of the Breaking Bad show. It certainly mirrors what he did as he was a respected man round here who was really popular. 'It is such a shame he turned his hand to this. It is out of character for him.' Mr Lockett, described as a hardworking potter at a firm in Stoke, Staffordshire, had no previous convictions or cautions . Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, remarked: 'Keith was the last person I would have thought would have done this. He must have been badly influenced by some wrong people.' Prosecutor Neil Ahuja said: 'When officers attended on April 21 it was clear that the rear upstairs bedroom had been converted into a growing room for cannabis plants. 'There were 29 plants in the process of being grown, supported by the usual paraphernalia. 'The electricity meter at the property had been bypassed to provide free power for this.' The court heard the plants were a couple of weeks from maturity, and would have had an estimated street value of £15,000. When he was interviewed by police Lockett, of Bentilee, Staffordshire, claimed he was growing the cannabis for his own use and it was a sole operation. However, text messages on his mobile phone proved he had set up the operation with others, though Lockett is the only person to be charged in connection with it. The electricity company said the estimated value of the illegally-used power, together with the damage to the meter, would be £1,536. Lockett, who already has two children aged four and seven, pleaded guilty to producing cannabis and abstracting electricity. The court heard he lost his job at a pottery firm as a result of his crime. Hamish Noble, defending, said: 'It's clear Keith Lockett had his own difficulties with the misuse of cannabis and drinking too much. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that 'completely out of character' and to raise money, he grew the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room. He was only raided when neighbours reported an 'unusual smell' coming from his property . 'This operation started to offset the cost of buying cannabis, and the growth did better than expected. 'He would not have had all 29 plants himself, more like seven or eight. In the weeks leading up to his arrest he was considering pulling out of the operation.' The court heard Lockett was 'ashamed and remorseful' but the judge said 'a message must be sent out.' Jailing Lockett for eight months, Judge Fletcher told him: 'You knew this was illegal, you knew there was a risk involved, and now you know that when risks don't pay off there are consequences. 'You have affected yourself but, more importantly, your partner, your children and now your unborn child by this greedy and foolish behaviour. 'I see no reason why I should suspend the sentence.'","Said to be 'completely out of character' for father of two Keith Lockett, 32 .

Charlie Richardson, leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang', died in September 2012, but his last book is set to be released . One of London's most infamous gang leaders and rival to the Kray twins has revealed how he once bugged a Prime Minister and foiled a plot to expose 'saucy' pictures of Princess Margaret. Charlie Richardson, leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang', died in September 2012. But his own account of how he rose to be one of the capital's most feared and dangerous underworld criminals is set to be released this week. In it he claims that he helped a South African businessman bug the then British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. During a visit to Johannesburg Richardson writes that he helped with the plot to tap a phone conversation about a mining deal, so that he could bed the stunning wife of a South African spy by the name of Gordon Winter. He writes that he found out who cleaned the Prime Minister's office and bribed them to plant the bug on the desk in a scheme that involved a 'a willing cleaner, a bugging device, and sticky tape.' Richardson, a father of six, was one of the last of a generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into criminal folklore. His trial at the Old Bailey shocked the nation, as details of how his gang tortured and intimidated their opposition were revealed in shocking detail. While Richardson controlled large swathes of South London with his brother Eddie, the Kray twins held East London using similar techniques, and the gangs fought vicious turf wars. The book - The Last Gangster: My Final Confession - also details how Richardson was approached by actor Richard Harris who asked the gangster to  ensure the 'safe receipt of some potentially saucy pictures involving the Queen's sister.' The photographs had fallen into the hands of another actor, John Bindon, who also had links to the criminal underworld.

Richardson, a father of six, was one of the last of a generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into criminal folklore. These photos were issued by Thames Valley Police when he escaped from Springhill open prison in May 1980 . Bindon was demanding Â£100,000 in exchange for the photos, but Richardson said that he persuaded him to take Â£5,000. He said he handed over the Irish actor Mr Harris in a south London pub: 'I never knew the full contents of that envelope. 'My actor pal walked briskly to the fire and threw the envelope into the middle of the flames. 'They were photographs, for sure, because I could see the outline of the prints as they twisted, turned and melted in the heat of the fire.' He added: 'Within seconds the photos - and the secrets of a princess - were gone.' Richardson was arrested on the day England won the World Cup in 1966 and his trial heard how he sought to extract information or money from his victims through, among other things, attaching electrodes to parts of their anatomy.

His gang were also claimed to have pinned victims to the floor with six inch nails and removed their toes with bolt cutters. Richardson always denied the crimes and said the details were simply used to help jail his gang, adding that he was imprisoned 'for nothing'. He received ten years for his part in the torture but became a minor celebrity in later life. Richardson escaped from an open prison in 1980 and fled to France, but he was arrested and returned to jail before being allowed out on day release in 1984. Following his release in 1984, Richardson sought to become a legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a cameo in a film of his life.","Charlie Richardson, leader of 1960s 'Torture Gang', died in September 2012 .

The announcement came as Britain is poised to overtake ailing France in the European car production league table. Strong and rising sales of British-built cars, both at home and abroad, will see France slip from third place – behind Germany and Spain – to be replaced by Britain.

Lottery scratchcards whose £100,000 prizes have already been won are still on sale, an investigation has revealed. The £2 cards are being sold in shops, supermarkets and petrol stations across the UK – despite the fact that all five top prizes have been claimed. National Lottery operator Camelot says the £100,000 red Cash cards can legally remain on sale, but Martin Lewis, of the Money Saving Expert website, said: ‘One would hope that if you are buying a scratchcard that advertises a chance to win a £100,000 prize, you actually have a chance. No chance: The £100,000 red Cash scratchcards are still on sale in UK stores despite all five top prizes having been claimed . ‘Camelot should be doing everything to . communicate the situation over the cards or be withdrawing the cards . and replacing them with a new tranche. ‘I think many people playing would be . disappointed to know there’s no chance of a dream win. With these cards, . it truly could not be you.’ About 12million of the cards were printed with the odds of scooping the jackpot standing at almost 2.5million-to-one.

New Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols is among the 19 new cardinals that Pope Francis announced today . The Archbishop of Westminster has said he is 'humbled' to be appointed a cardinal by the Pope. Vincent Nichols will be made a cardinal at the next consistory on February 22, the Catholic Church in England and Wales confirmed. Archbishop Vincent said: 'Today, I am deeply moved by the honour conferred upon the Catholic Church in England and Wales and on the Diocese of Westminster in my appointment as Cardinal by His Holiness Pope Francis. 'The Catholic Church in our countries has always had a profound and loving loyalty to the Holy Father, the Successor of St Peter. This appointment enables me, on behalf of all, to serve the Pope in a direct and prolonged way. 'Personally, this is a humbling moment when I am asked to take a place in this service of the Holy See and in the line of much loved Cardinal Archbishops of Westminster. 'I seek the blessing of Almighty God for these new responsibilities and I ask for the prayers of all people of faith that I may fulfil them with energy and devotion.' Pope Francis chose 19 men from Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, including the developing nations of Haiti and Burkina Faso, in line with his belief that the church must pay more attention to the poor. Francis made the announcement as he spoke from his studio window to a crowd in St. Peter's Square. Sixteen of the appointees are younger than 80, meaning they are currently eligible to elect the next pope, which is a cardinal's most important task. The ceremony to formally install them as cardinals will be held February 22 at the Vatican. A U.S.-based advocacy group for people who have been sexually abused by clergy criticised one of the pope's appointments and also said he should have promoted an archbishop in Ireland to cardinal's rank. Pope Francis blesses a baby during a baptism at the Vatican today. The cardinal appointments were made during his Angelus prayer from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square . Since his election in March as the first pontiff from Latin America, the pope has broken tradition after tradition in terms of protocol and style at the Vatican. But in Sunday's list Francis stuck to the church's rule of having no more than 120 cardinals eligible to elect the next pontiff. Some appointments were expected, including that of his new secretary of state, the Italian archbishop Pietro Parolin, and the German head of the Vatican's watchdog office for doctrinal orthodoxy, Gerhard Ludwig Mueller. Two others named Sunday also come from the curia, as the Holy See's Rome-based bureaucracy is known. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the pope's selection of churchmen from Haiti and Burkina Faso reflects Francis' attention to the destitute as a core part of the church's mission. Pope Francis, pictured in Buenos Aires last week, chose 19 men from Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, including the developing nations of Haiti and Burkina Faso . Once again, the cardinal's red hat eluded Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin. The prelate in that traditionally Catholic country has angered some in the Vatican by strongly criticising how the hierarchy handled the worldwide clerical sex abuse scandal. The U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, expressed disappointment that Francis didn't promote Martin. 'While far from perfect, he's better' than some other prelates on abuse, said David Clohessy, director of the group's chapter in St. Louis. SNAP also criticised the choice of Mueller, saying he had a 'dreadful' record on children's safety. Under the tenure of Mueller, who was appointed by fellow German Pope Benedict XVI, critics have accused of Vatican's handling of the sex abuse scandal, including letting paedophile priests transfer from parish to parish when complaints were made.","Archbishop Vincent named by Pontiff for one of Church's highest honours .

Gordon Ramsay ‘really got away with murder’ as his company hid ‘incriminating evidence’ of alleged fraud from the taxman, a leaked memo claims. The highly damaging document, apparently written for the chef and his former business partner, boasts of avoiding more than £2.2 million in tax, and has triggered a serious investigation into Ramsay’s restaurant empire. The document, seen by The Mail on Sunday, was written by the chef’s former finance boss Trevor James, who claims he helped Ramsay or his company avoid paying back huge sums during a previous probe. A highly damaging document, apparently written for Gordon Ramsay and his former business partner, boasts of avoiding more than £2.2 million in tax . THE STAFF TIPS: £125,000 . Tax expert Trevor James said tax reduction had 'no real basis' and admitted removing 'incriminating evidence'. THE HOUSE: £211,450 . The . chef reclaimed VAT on refurbishments on his South London home, . including, James says, £211,450 more than they were entitled to. THE SUPERCAR: £20,000 . Mr James, himself a former tax . inspector, admits to making false declarations to HM Revenue & . Customs officials and shielding the chef from scrutiny. He boasts: ‘We . have skated on some very thin ice here, but we have got away with it.’ Referring . to how the chef avoided VAT on improvements to his London home, Mr . James adds: ‘The duty at stake is enough to warrant prosecution for . years to come, should the real facts emerge.’ The . details have come to light after The Mail on Sunday revealed HMRC’s . investigation into Gordon Ramsay Holdings over claims of potential . ‘serious tax fraud’ in August. The chef denies any wrongdoing, with his spokesman ­saying the memo ‘was deliberately kept from him’, and that the individuals involved were dismissed. He also adds that he alerted the authorities as soon as he became aware of it. In the memo, dated August 3, 2010 James writes: ‘HMRC have seriously underestimated the additional tax etc that was at stake and I cannot stress enough that we really have got away with murder here.’ James claims his methods were ‘legitimate, of course’ despite talking of prosecution and admitting that he knowingly removed documents from the company’s personnel files. The memo says: ‘It would have seriously complicated ­matters had I left all the paperwork in... it could, potentially, have cost us many hundreds of thousands, possibly millions. The document also claims Ramsay, 46, personally received £375,000 of tips held in a ‘tronc’ fund intended to be shared among restaurant staff. James convinced HMRC to cut £125,000 from the tax bill on tips, ‘with no real basis’. He wrote: ‘We simply shouldn’t have got away with that.’ On his US series Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares, the chef berated a restaurant owner for personally benefiting from the tips fund. Gordon Ramsay with his wife, Tana, at a party in Los Angeles, United States . James explains that inspectors were . ‘desperate’ to interview Ramsay, but he always refused access, . eventually prompting the taxman to threaten legal action to ‘compel . Gordon to answer questions about the tronc money’. Inspectors launched the high level ‘Code . 9’ probe into a potential ‘serious tax fraud’ at Gordon Ramsay Holdings . after being handed the 11-page dossier – which includes details of . potentially serious criminal activity. Two sources connected to the TV chef . claim Ramsay, 46, was made aware of the contents of the memo and . discussed the contents with James during a phone call. One insisted: . ‘Gordon and Trevor definitely discussed the contents of his memo, and . Gordon knew exactly what had gone on. ‘But . even though it was a very serious subject, when he was shown the . document he was pretty dismissive. He didn’t seem interested or . concerned.’ Former Inland Revenue investigator . James was hired by Ramsay in 2007 after he led a previous investigation . into the company’s tax affairs. He later became a director of the . business alongside Ramsay after chief executive Chris Hutcheson, the . father of the chef’s wife Tana, left the business in an explosive public . fall-out. James . resigned as a director this year, following row with the fiery chef. His . exit coincided with HMRC’s decision to launch a new investigation. James’ document also boasts of avoiding tax due for refurbishment work to . Ramsay’s multi-million-pound townhouse in Wandsworth, South London. Inspectors launched the high level 'Code 9' probe into a potential 'serious tax fraud' at Gordon Ramsay Holdings after being handed the 11-page dossier . He saved just over £100,000 by arguing the chef – who previously used his home kitchen to film TV shows – needed a new kitchen for business purposes. But on top of that legitimate rebate, James wrote that Ramsay made a ‘terrific saving’ of £211,450 by over-claiming for work. The memo also claims Ramsay saved about £20,000 in tax due on an Aston Martin by arguing that the car spent most of its time in the garage being repaired, and that he escaped tax on £42,640 income from September 2000 to May 2003.

Electronic tags are being put on hospital bedding because nearly £400,000 a year is being lost on missing linen. Tags are being put on 300,000 sheets, gowns and pillowcases to stop them disappearing from NHS wards and operating theatres. The tagging is being implemented by an NHS laundry which was fed up after spending £390,000 last year replacing bed sheets and gowns not returned by its hospitals. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board's laundry service, Green Vale, in Cwmbran, South Wales, is adding electronic tags to hospital bedding in a bid to cut the bill for replacing lost and stolen items . A variety of reasons were blamed for the vanishing sheets and gowns including petty theft, staff throwing them away and patients taking them home. Now Aneurin Bevan University Health Board’s laundry service, Green Vale, in Cwmbran, South Wales, has fitted radio frequency identification tags to the 300,000 pieces of linen. Health Board facilities manager Alan Dudley said: ‘It will help detect inappropriate disposal or quickly and accurately assess the stock available. ‘The disappearance of the items may be because it has been disposed of by staff who may consider it too soiled to launder, stolen, or left with patients when discharged home. ‘In an effort to reduce these losses, bed linen, patient gowns and theatre wear is being tagged to enable it be traced accurately to and from hospitals.’ The tags will allow scanners to count the pieces being dispatched and received by the laundry and also to detect linen lost in waste bags or stored in cupboards. The service is tagging 300,000 sheets and hospital gowns after spending £390,000 on replacements last year . Mr Dudley said: ‘This will allow Green Vale to identify at which sites losses are occurring and to work with staff to determine the actual causes and take action to prevent these. ‘Where losses continue then health boards will be charged for replacing the linen providing an incentive to take effective action to reduce the cost to NHS Wales of lost linen. ‘Harnessing technology in this way demonstrates how we in the public service can do things differently and better.’","Aneurin Bevan University Health Board’s .

Jailed: Andrew Harris, 45, charges swingers £40 to continue conversations with alluring, 'open-minded' couples on a fake casual sex site . The creator of a fake swingers website stole more than £200,000 from people looking for casual sex. Andrew Harris, 45, conned hundreds of victims for four years by charging them £40 to access 'titilating' but fake profiles. But, afraid to risk exposing their fetishes, users were too embarrassed to complain. Finally, after a man contacted trading standards, Harris was today jailed for two years. The user - known as TB - told Birmingham Crown Court he and his partner were surprised at the number of 'open-minded' people on the remote island of Anglesey. 'Anglesey is not renowned for its swinging scene,' the court heard. After exchanging a few messages with a number of contacts, the couple were blocked and ordered to pay a subscription fee to continue. They did - but the interested users suddenly disappeared without trace. Fearing a scam, TB set up a different profile and received exactly the same messages from the same people. He contacted Birmingham Trading Standards. Judge Simon Drew told Harris, who owns Zilet Ltd software company: 'This case is a large scale fraud and involves a large number of vulnerable victims. 'Although you sought to dupe them of relatively small sums of £40 each, they were very, very unlikely to complain beyond the limited scope of others with similar interests on the Internet. 'They were very unlikely to complain because of that embarrassment factor of having their sexual interests examined by the authorities and other people. The businessman, who runs a software company, was caught after four years when a user in Anglesey was surprised by the number of swingers on the remote island - who disappeared when he paid the fee . 'Further more, this was long term running for at least four years and sophisticated because it involved clever use of the website.' Mr Mark Jackson, prosecuting, said a council enforcement officer set a trap for Harris by signing up to the 'free service'. The officer received messages from the same people who had contacted TB, including Kitten, who boasted of her 'personal attributes'. Sentence: Birmingham Crown Court heard Harris's scheme was calculated and clever, charging little for something users would be too embarrassed to complain about. He was ordered to pay more than £60,000 . Byron Broadstock, defending, said the site started off as a legitimate business and it involved lots of genuine profiles. It was not a case of people getting nothing for their money, he added. The judge fined the company £42,000 and ordered it to pay £21,358 costs.","Andrew Harris, 45, charged £40 fee for users to access 'titilating' profiles .

She was wearing a grey-hooded jacket, a red jumper, blue jeans, and is carrying a JD Sports carrier bag. The baby girl, who was with members of her family and hospital staff at the time of the incident, was then moved into a lift. They were able to stop the woman from entering the lift with them. She remained in the area for a while before she left the hospital by herself. Officers are appealing for information from the public so that they can trace the woman.

A simple blood test that gives early warning of heart attacks is being developed by scientists. It is hoped that by looking at cells in a person’s blood the test will distinguish a heart attack waiting to happen from other painful but much less serious conditions. Those determined to be at high risk of having a heart attack in the next few days or weeks could then be given potentially life-saving treatment. The simple blood test that gives early warning of heart attacks measures cells released by fatty deposits often associated with blood clots . Researcher Professor Peter Khun said: ‘There are plenty of other ways to suggest that you are at long-term risk of a heart attack and there are good ways of diagnosing that you have just had a heart attack but what we don’t have is the ability to say “You will very likely have a heart attack in the next three weeks and we need to do something about this now”.’ Heart disease is Britain’s biggest killer and every seven minutes someone in the UK dies from a heart attack. One in three of those who have a heart attack die before reaching hospital. The test, being developed at the Scripps Research Institute in California, focuses on cells called CECs released when fat that is clogging up and narrowing the arteries cracks. A blood clot then seals up the damage, blocking the blood supply to the heart in the process – and causing a heart attack. Most of the 100,000 heart attacks that occur in the UK each year start this way. The Californian researchers used blood samples to count the number of CECs in the blood – and showed there are more of them in people who have recently had a heart attack. The test is quick and relatively inexpensive, and may help save lives in the future by predicting one of the most common forms of death in the UK . Writing in the Institute of Physics journal Physical Biology, they said: ‘This first and important validation study shows that we can clearly separate patients with a heart attack from the healthy population.’ This paves the way for a study which will check whether the number of CECs in the bloodstream can predict an imminent heart attack. It is thought that the fatty deposits crack slowly – meaning the telltale signs will be visible in the blood days or weeks before a blood clot triggers a heart attack. The rapid and relatively inexpensive test could be used to rule out other causes, including simple things like indigestion. Those deemed to be at high risk could be put on drugs, including blood thinners.  A stent could inserted to keep the artery open. British experts stressed that the researchers have yet to show that the technique can pick out heart attacks waiting to happen. Dr Mike Knapton, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘These scientists have found that you can detect circulating endothelial cells or CECs in the blood of patients following a heart attack, which are not found in healthy people. ‘This is an interesting finding and suggests looking for CECs could be another way of identifying a heart attack. ‘In the short to medium term, it is unlikely to change how people in the UK are treated as we already have good ways to treat and diagnose heart attacks, and targets to ensure rapid treatment times.” This study appears to be laying the groundwork for future research to see if this test could be used to identify patients in the early stages of a heart attack.’","Heart attacks are one of the most common forms of death in the UK .

A grandmother was found dead in hospital toilets after doctors failed to notice she had serious infection. Lyn O’Reilly, 57, suffered the fatal infection after a bowel operation at Basildon Hospital, Essex. But senior consultants failed to detect it - mainly because they were relying on inexperienced junior doctors. An inquest into her death, on August 31, 2012, was told the junior doctors looking after her had only been in the job for four weeks. Lyn O'Reilly had been admitted to Basildon Hospital for a bowel operation but died of an undetected infection. She and 130 patients were being cared for by one junior doctor at night . For some of her time in hospital, a single junior doctor was left alone to care for 130 patients on the night shift - something which, even now, remains standard practice at the hospital. Yesterday, Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray called for a ban on junior doctors being left unsupervised at night. The inquest was told 'a window of opportunity' to save Mrs O’Reilly was missed and her medical notes were 'a shambles'. Mrs Beasley-Murray, said: 'There were very serious failings in the post-operative care Mrs O’Reilly received at Basildon Hospital.' The inquest heard junior doctors had raised concerns about her condition, but these had not been acted upon by consultants. Junior staff were given only minimal support, day or night time by more senior doctors. Communication between nurses and doctors was also poor, another reason why the deterioration in Mrs O’Reilly’s condition was not acted upon. The coroner was told poor notes meant it was not clear if a senior consultant had reviewed Mrs O’Reilly’s case on the morning of her death. It appeared she had 'probably not' been reviewed. Mrs O’Reilly was found collapsed in the hospital toilets, after days of complaining of being in pain. Nurses performed CPR for 25 minutes, but were unable to save her. A post-mortem examination found fluid in her abdomen, caused by an abscess which had burst and led to the fatal infection. An inquest was told 'a window of opportunity' to save Mrs O'Reilly was missed and her notes were 'a shambles' Independent expert Jonathan Refson said: 'If a senior registrar had reviewed Mrs O’Reilly on August 30, they would have thought something was not right. 'Personally, I would have arranged an urgent CT scan. If that had been done, she would have had a different management plan. Acting first thing in the morning would have made a difference.' Mrs Beasley-Murray recorded a narrative verdict and added: 'The standard of documentation was woefully inadequate.' She added she had already raised concerns about similar short comings with medical notes in past cases and planned to write a detailed report to hospital managers, outlining how she thought they needed to improve. Ms O’Reilly’s family paid tribute to her after the inquest. Relatives fought back tears as Mrs Beasley-Murray severely criticised Basildon Hospital for failing to give her adequate care. After the inquest, her brother, Dave O’Fallon, said: 'She was a caring woman who wouldn’t hurt a fly.'She didn’t deserve the treatment she got.'  Her mother, Rita O’Fallon added: 'She was my best friend.' Communication between nurses and doctors was also poor, another reason why the deterioration in Mrs O'Reilly's condition was not acted upon. She was found collapsed in hospital toilets, after days of being in pain . Mrs O’Reilly’s death has already led to some changes at Basildon Hospital. These include the employment of more nursing staff at weekends and over bank holidays, better support for junior staff and improved note taking. A statement from the hospital says: 'Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust would like to send its condolences to the family of Lyn O’Reilly at this difficult time. 'The poor care we provided to Mrs O’Reilly is an example of why we have significantly changed the way we work and placed safety and compassion at the heart of everything we do.' Medical director Celia Skinner said: 'We are sorry we failed to provide Mrs O’Reilly with the care she required. Since her death in August 2012 we have worked tirelessly to change and become a hospital which the local community have confidence in.' Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray, said: 'It is clear that the hospital has put in substantial efforts in preparation of this inquest. The action plan is to be commended. The court has been gratified to hear of such changes.'","Lyn O'Reilly had been admitted to Basildon Hospital for a bowel operation .

The first group of people to have the chance of starting a new colony on Mars by 2023 have been selected. Mars One picked 1,058 people to progress to the next round in its search for humans who want to be the first to live, and die, on the Red Planet. The . hopefuls, who are all over the age of 18, will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training starts in 2018. Scroll down for video . Among those to make the first cut were 297 applicants from America. Hopefuls will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training begins. The robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 with plans to send a colony of humans to Mars by 2023. This illustration shows what the settlement would look like . The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans. Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion. More than 200,000 people applied for a . one-way ticket to Mars in a bid to become one of the first colonists, who are expected to settle on the planet by 2023. A . total of 297 of the candidates to make the first cut are from the U.S. while 75 are Canadian. India was the next best represented country with . 62 candidates, followed by Russia with 52, although the project . originally set out to source applicants from 107 different countries. Gillian Finnerty, 21, from the University of Sheffield and Dannielle Potter, 29, from Manchester University are among the Britons who made the first cut. Almost 77 per cent of the people selected are employed, while 15 per cent are still at school, CBS reported. Some 357 people are not yet 25, while 415 have not yet . celebrated their 35th birthday. The oldest person to make it to . the next round is 81, which means they will be 90 when the settlement lands. Each was asked to explain why they would leave behind their loved ones and . revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen to be shortlisted. Bas Landorp, co-founder of the Mars One project, said the candidates are the first tangible glimpse of what a new human settlement will look like. ‘We’re extremely appreciative and impressed with the sheer number of people who submitted their applications,’ he said. ‘However, the challenge with 200,000 applicants is separating those who we feel are physically and mentally adept to become human ambassadors on Mars from those who are obviously taking the mission much less seriously. 'We even had a couple of applicants submit their videos in the nude!’ The Dutch-based project wants to launch a supply mission to land on Mars by October 2016. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips 'much safer than moon missions' Chief Medical Officer of Mars One, Dr Norbert Kraft, said the next selection phases this year and in 2015 will include ’rigorous simulations, many in team settings, with focus on testing the physical and emotional capabilities of our remaining candidates’. ‘We expect to begin understanding what is motivating our candidates to take this giant leap for humankind. ‘This is where it really gets exciting for Mars One, our applicants and the communities they’re a part of,’ he added. Mr Lansdorp said: ‘We fully . anticipate our remaining candidates to become celebrities in their . towns, cities, and in many cases, countries. It’s about to get very . interesting.’ Applicants who were not selected can still reapply at a later date, which has not yet been announced. The Mars lander and rover, illustration pictured, will be built by Lockheed Martin. This lander design will be based on the successful Mars lander used in the 2007 NASA Phoenix mission, which was also built and tested by Maryland-based firm . Mr Lansdorp said: ‘U.S. astronaut Clayton Anderson was rejected by Nasa for its astronaut training programme 15 times, yet in 2007 he boarded the Space Shuttle Atlantis for a trip to the International Space Station. He proved anything can happen and the door is never completely closed.’ It was announced just before Christmas that in less than five years, a communications satellite could be installed on Mars to stream live images from the settlement into homes on Earth. This would mean millions of eagle-eyed space enthusiasts could scour the live images for signs of alien life, or track changes in the weather, according to Mr Lansdorp. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 and will be built by Surrey Satellite . Technology Ltd (SSTL) - the company which was announced as one of the . official partners of the plans just last week. In less than five years we could be live streaming images from Mars straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite, artist illustration pictured, on the Red Planet. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 . It will provide a 'high bandwidth communications system in a Mars synchronous orbit' and will be used to relay data and a live video feed from the lander on the surface of Mars back to Earth. Mars One is said to have paid SSTL $60,000 (£36,00) to design what will be the first 'geostationary' satellite on the planet. The Mars lander will then be built by Lockheed Martin. This lander design will be based on the successful Mars lander used in the 2007 NASA Phoenix mission, which was also built and tested by Maryland-based firm. The satellite, artist impression pictured, will provide a 'high bandwidth communications system' to send data and live video back to Earth . Speaking at a news conference in December, Mr Lansdorp said: 'Anyone with internet access will be able to see what the . weather's like on Mars.' The . robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 - two . years later than initially planned. This unmanned mission is designed to explore and collect information about the planet with a view to launching a manned mission and setting up a Mars colony. Mars One recently launched an IndieGoGo . crowd-funding campaign. The project raised $10,000 (£6,121) in the first hour and . is currently at $111,881 (£67,496). The project is asking for a total of $400,000 (£245,000) and needs to raise this by 25 January. The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by . engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the . broadcasting rights to the mission. By comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion. The landing systems of the craft will be tested eight times before they are . used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips . ‘much safer than moon missions’. The . applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their . lives - and be filmed for a reality TV programme. Viewers . would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth . in ten years’ time. By 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers. The . hopefuls, who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their . training starts, said why they would leave behind their loved ones and . revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen. By . 2015, the selected candidates will start an eight-year training regime . where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation. In 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers. Two living units, two life support units, a second supply unit, and another rover arrive on Mars . The majority of applicants for the . one-way trip to Mars came from the United States, with India . and China coming in second and third place. The second round will include an . interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to . the third round will compete against one another. The . third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates . for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and . online. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.","More than 200,000 people applied for a .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:43 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 13 January 2014 . Television shows focusing on teenage pregnancies and young mothers have helped lessen the number of high school girls who become pregnant, according to a new study. 'Teen Mom' and '16 And Pregnant' have long been derided as allegedly glamorizing teenage pregnancies, but a new analysis that compared the decreasing birth rate by young mothers and television ratings now shows that the programs may have caused teens to think twice about having unprotected sex. Researchers at Wellesley College have concluded that the rate of teen births dropped by 5.7 per cent during the time that the shows were on the air from June 2009 to late 2010. Warning sign: Kailyn Lowry is one of the 47 teenage moms that have been featured in the MTV shows 16 And Pregnant, Teen Mom and Teen Mom 2 which are now being noted as bringing down the birth rate . By the numbers: The television shows are cited by teenagers as reasons why they think before having sex . All told, that could mean as many as 20,000 births were avoided as a direct or indirect result of the show. 'This can explain around one-third of the total decline in teen births over that period,' researchers Phillip Levine and Melissa Kearney wrote. While a host of factors could have had a combined impact on the birth rate drop, the researchers were convinced that the show definitely brought down the number of abortions among teens. 'This suggests that the shows’ impact is attributable to a reduction in pregnancy rather than greater use of abortion,' the study states. The New York Times noted that the latest drop is just one in a pattern which has gone on since the 2008 recession, but analysts are still giving credit to the show. 'It’s thrilling,' National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy chief executive Sarah Brown told The Times. Cautionary: Janelle Evans has a son Jace and is now pregnant with her second child after suffering a miscarriage. She has a history of violent outbursts, having been arrested ten times in the past three years . Downward trend: The show, coupled with the recession and increased health education, have been cited as reasons for a decreasing number of teen births . 'People just don’t understand how influential media is in the lives of young people.' The latest national figures cited by the paper state that 29 out of every 1,000 American girls give birth before their 20th birthday. That figure shows a drop from the 2007 finding of 42 out of every 1,000 girls. Critics of the show, which first started as 16 And Pregnant and then spun off with Teen Mom and later Teen Mom 2, as an inappropriate way to glamorize the lives of these young mothers and their volatile relationships with the children's fathers. One of the clearest examples of the perils of the fame given to the young mothers is the case of former Teen Mom subject Farrah Abraham, who starred in and later released a sex tape with porn star James Deen. Glamorizing? Farrah Abraham went from being featured in the show with her daughter to organizing her own sex tape release, a decision which she later said 'ruined my life' After initially teasing that she made six figures on the tape, she has since revealed that she only got paid $10,00 by selling the video and said that it 'ruined my life'. The researchers described how the show creators were purposefully showed the difficulties facing new mothers- citing how one mother spent a month in the hospital and how another child had to be airlifted to a hospital for emergency treatment. 'Overall, the realities of the lives of teen mothers are presented in ways that may have been unknown or difficult to imagine for other teens viewing the show,' they wrote in the study.","A new study claims that the MTV reality series helped bring the teen birth rate down to 5.7 per cent .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 13 January 2014 . The family of a pregnant . Fort Worth woman being kept alive by a ventilator are suing the hospital that is refusing to turn off her life support, against their wishes. Mother of one, Marlise Munoz is 20 weeks pregnant and has been in hospital since November, when she suffered a pulmonary embolism. Her relatives say doctors have told them that she is brain dead. But John Peter Smith Hospital is refusing to allow them to take her off life support, saying that Texas law prohibits it from following a family directive when a pregnancy is involved. Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness . Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period . The woman's husband Erick Munoz, who has   and . mother Lynne Machado are now taking legal action against the hospital, . also in Forth Worth. Attorneys for the family told the Star Telegram: . 'We do plan on filing some litigation, and it will be filed soon.' The . lawyers wouldn't give further details but said they are 'making . progress' on the case. A spokesman for the hospital welcomed the move. 'JPS . is encouraged by this development because the courts are the . appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this . matter,' J.R. Labbe said. 'JPS . remains focused on providing compassionate care to all patients while . also following the law as it applies to healthcare in the state of Texas,' he continued. Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term . Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures . The hospital is pointing . to a provision of the Texas Advance Directives Act that reads: 'A person . may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this . subchapter from a pregnant patient.' But . experts interviewed by The Associated Press, including two who helped . draft the law, said a brain-dead patient's case wouldn't be covered by . the law. 'This patient is . neither terminally nor irreversibly ill,' said Dr. Robert Fine, clinical . director of the office of clinical ethics and palliative care for . Baylor Health Care System. 'Under Texas law, this patient is legally . dead.' Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor, said he did not believe the law applied in this case. He . said the hospital would not have absolute immunity from a civil or . criminal case if it went outside the subchapter referenced by the law, . but noted that 'most medical decisions' are made without immunity. Munoz's mother Machado says she was shocked to learn her state left the family . powerless to carry out their daughter's wish to never be . dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant. In December Machado lashed out against the law, saying that it had put her family through ‘pure hell.’ ‘The doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a DNR or a living will, the law supersedes that,’ Machado told NBC News. Machado’s . son-in-law Erick Munoz found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor two days before Thanksgiving. Erick is a paramedic - as was . Marlise - and immediately performed CPR, but it was no use. At 14 weeks . pregnant with their second child, Marlise had been without oxygen for an . hour. ‘They did a CAT scan and an EEG and there was no brain activity,’ Machado said. ‘She was clinically declared brain dead. 'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders . 'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Marlise had suffered what was likely an embolism. She has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator. The family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen. All they know is that they are powerless over their daughter’s fate or that of the unborn fetus. 'Knowing our daughter is not there, but her body is being kept alive, is hard to see,' Machado told CNN. Marlise must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks. ‘At that point they would decide . whether to start labor, do a C-section, or see if she could go to 34 or . 36 weeks when the fetus would be full term,’ Machado said. But . she and her family are horrified things even got this far. ‘No family . should have to go through this,’ she said. ‘It’s been pure hell.’ ‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick Munoz told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo. Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation. And this isn’t it. 'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said . ‘We . knew what her wishes were,’ Erick told WFAA. The . couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive . by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order.  But that wouldn’t have made a difference. Texas . gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a . DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under . Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as . pregnant.’ Doctors said the baby has a . normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when . Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen. ‘They . don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick . told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’ 'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle .","Erick Munoz of Fort Wort, Texas, found his wife Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor on November 26 .

Prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, 30, faces up to 16 months in jail for having sex with inmate Ronell Wilson . A prison guard who thought having a child with a convicted cop killer would get him off Death Row faces up to 16 months behind bars today. Nancy Gonzalez's last ditch plan to save Ronell Wilson's life didn't work and she is due to be sentenced in New York for having sex with an inmate. The 30-year-old has already lost custody of the baby boy she gave birth to and her federal job at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Gonzalez and Wilson, 33, had sex while the convict . was awaiting resentencing. It happened after an appeals court threw out his first . death sentence, handed down in 2007, on a legal technicality. At a previous hearing, Gonzalez's attorney claimed the family of Wilson was manipulating her and blamed her for a jury condemning him to the death penalty. Her child, which was conceived in an 'activity room' at the center while Gonzalez was working there, is named Justus and was born on March 21. He was placed in foster care with Gonzalez's maternal aunt. A . family court judge found that Gonzalez's behavior was neglectful . because Gonzalez, a recovering drug addict, was not allowed to use . alcohol while free on bail. Wilson was convicted of capital murder for shooting dead two undercover NYPD detectives during a 2003 gun bust. He was sent to Death Row for a second time in September. Gonzalez refused to testify at his hearing. Defense lawyer Anthony Ricco has asked Brooklyn Federal Judge Brian Cogan to sentence Gonzalez to probation so she can receive mental treatment, the New York Daily News reported. Ricco said Gonzalez was sexually abused as a child and when she served in the military, leading her to engage in destructive sexual relationships 'to cope with stress and anxiety.' Prosecutors said they suspected Wilson targeted Gonzalez and impregnated her so that he could use his child as an argument not to sentence him to the death penalty. In court filings, Mr Ricco described his client as mentally unstable and vulnerable. Cop killer Ronell Wilson was sent to Death Row for a second time in September . Gonzalez's pregnancy threw up a spanner in the works of the death penalty case against Wilson - though she ultimately refused to take the stand and testify on his behalf . The baby, Justus, was conceived in an 'activity room' at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn . He claimed that she had been sexually abused and raped by her step-father, her uncles and other men.

Apologetic: Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chairman, president and CEO, has revealed in an interview that the company does not know the full extent of the data breach across stores last month . Promises: He vowed to improve the company as he spoke with CNBC's Becky Quick in the interview . The holiday season theft is now believed to have affected a whopping 70 to 110 million customers between November 27 and December 15, according to a Target press release, as opposed to the previous estimate of 40 million customers. The information included names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. When Steinhafel learned of the breach, 'my heart sunk', he said. 'It's hard for me to describe the feeling that came over me.' He said that he's 'still shaken by it' and has had many 'sleepless nights'. But he added there will be more to come as 'we are not going to sleep until we get it right and we regain the trust of our guest. And we're gonna be better as a result of this'. It took the company four days to tell customers about the breach - a decision Steinhafel defended.

'Zero liability is zero liability,' he said, 'which . means Target is paying for any possible fraudulent . activity on anybody's credit card.

But he accepted that customers have every right to be angry - and that the company still has a long way to go before earning back their trust. Following the breach, sales plummeted at the store, but on Friday, the company revealed that sales have almost returned to normal levels. 'Clearly, we're accountable and we're . responsible,' he said. 'But we're gonna come out at the end of this a better . company. And we're gonna make significant changes.

A tap water ban in West Virginia is slowly being lifted on Monday as officials fear the system could be overwhelmed after hundreds of thousands of people went five days without clean water. Some 300,000 residents of Charleston had their tap water poisoned last Thursday when company Freedom Industries' alleged . shoddy safety practices led to a chemical spill into the water supply. It has also emerged that Freedom Industries has worked largely without regulation or . environmental inspection for more than two decades. Governor Earl Tomblin told a news conference on Monday that the ban is being lifted in a strict, methodical manner to help ensure the water system isn't overwhelmed by excessive demand, which could cause more water quality and service issues. Scroll down for video . Workers inspect an area near the Elk River where a chemical leaked at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston, West Virgina into the water supply . West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin told a press conference today that a ban on the water supply was gradually being lifted so that the system would not be overwhelmed . Customers were asked to flush out . their systems before using the water again. Officials cautioned the . water could still have an odor, but they said it was safe. Over . the weekend, water tests reportedly showed that levels of the . licorice-smelling chemical  4-methylcyclohexane methanol were . consistently below a toxic threshold, and in some samples, there was no . trace of the substance at all. However one homeowner showed just how toxic and flammable the water still was on Sunday by setting on fire a glass poured from his kitchen tap. Questions . were now being raised as to how and why the leak occurred and whether Freedom Industries took too long to let state officials . know about the problem. Work continues around a storage tank with the chemical designation MCHM,  4-methylcyclohexane methanol, the chemical that leaked into the Elk River, at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston . The facility largely flew under the radar of government . regulators who viewed it as a low-risk operation - but in reality, a . problem at a key holding wall went undetected and unreported at Freedom . Industries Inc. The chemicals stored at Freedom's facility near the Elk River are not considered hazardous enough by regulators to prompt routine inspections. As a result, the chemical storage terminal was a low priority for regulators, who must pick and choose how to allocated scarce manpower when enforcing environmental laws. 'I think that the loophole that this facility fell into is because it was not a hazardous material, it flew under the radar,' said Randy Huffman, cabinet secretary of West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, which enforces environmental laws. Before the chemical leak last week, environmental inspectors had not visited the Freedom Industries site since 1991, the Wall Street Journal reported. Freedom's storage terminal holds millions of pounds of chemicals - including some used in coal processing - just a mile and a half upstream from pipes that take in water for a public drinking supply. The distance left little opportunity for chemicals to dilute in the event of a spill. And those chemicals were stored behind a brick-and-concrete block dike that seems to have had structural problems - an issue the company apparently was aware of. A state official says the president told regulators that Freedom had put $1 million into an escrow account to fix the wall that ultimately failed to hold Thursday's spill. State environmental officials would not have seen the dike problems - they say they never had reason to inspect the site. Although regulators never visited, it appears company officials were aware of issues with the containment dike. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern told state regulators that $1 million was put into an escrow account to repair the wall, said Mike Dorsey, the DEP's director of emergency response and homeland security. Company officials have not returned calls seeking comment on the condition of the dike. 'The wall is an old cement block wall, and there's some problems with the mortar in a couple places, Dorsey said. 'And it came out through that.' A resident of Charleston, West Virginia sent a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination . A Charleston couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4-methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal . During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags . around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while . others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant. Water . distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large . tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home. So far, only ten people exposed to . the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in . serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling . said. The chemical, even in . its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they . shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound . can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting . and diarrhea. Other . than schools, day-care centers, hotels and many restaurants were still closed on Monday, the region was open for business but foot traffic was . slow. Stores and . offices adjusted by providing bottled water and hand sanitizer. State government offices were open on Monday. Erin Brockovich, who helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in West Virginia . The contamination disaster began with a . smell last Thursday when residents of Charleston began to complain of a . licorice-like aroma in the air, one that seemed most potent near the . town's water treatment plant.

Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez who is currently in jail on a murder charge has been prevented from watching his team's play-off victory. Tough rules at Bristol County House of Correction in Boston meant Hernandez was not allowed to watch the televised game. He was confined to his cell when the crucial AFC Divisional Round match was on, Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson revealed. Sheriff Hodgson told the Boston Herald: 'He's not allowed to watch any TV. It’s jail. It’s all about standards and sending a message. 'We only allow two hours a day of entertainment television.' Inmates are only allowed to watch self-help tapes and self-help documentaries, according to the strict prison guidelines. Hernandez, who is prevented from mixing with other inmates due to his high-profile . status, is allowed three hours exercised a day in a 12ft eight foot enclosure. The 24-year-old is on remand in the high-security prison after being charged . with murdering Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player who was found shot dead near his Massachusetts home in June. Prosecutors claim that Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. In September, 2013, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to murder. He is also now a suspect in the 2012 double-murder of two men outside a Boston night club. Authorities believe that the June 17 . murder of Lloyd is in some way related to the double-murder of . Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the . Cure Lounge in Boston on July 16, 2012. The new developments in the case were detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court in Bristol, last month. Hard-hitting: New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount (29) breaks free from Indianapolis Colts safety LaRon Landry (30) Missing out: Former team player Aaron Hernandez was not allowed to watch New England Patriots beat Indianapolis Colts . According to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder. It previously has been reported that Hernandez, who was on a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was charged, and his friends fought with Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting. However, there is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant. Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel Abreu, right, were killed after getting in an altercation in a club in 2012 . Scene: The men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on July 15, 2012 . According to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave. When the men left with their friends about 2.30am, the silver Toyota SUV pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire. The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man. The warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from the club taken the night of the murders. Additionally, authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were related. According to the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the connection between the three murders in front of him. The combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder.","Former Patriots star Aaron Hernandez is in jail charged with murder .

She told of the moment she first let her family know what had happened to her . Jailed drugs mule Michaella McCollum has told of the moment she phoned home with the news that she had been arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs out of Peru. The 20-year-old, from Dungannon, County Tyrone said that the shock of finding out her daughter was in custody almost 6,000 miles away 'nearly killed' her mother. She was last month sentenced to six years and eight months in prison, alongside Melissa Reid, also 20, with whom she was caught trying to smuggle 24lbs of cocaine out of Lima airport in August. Miss McCollum's family launched a missing person appeal after she failed to answer her phone or update her Facebook page for more than a fortnight. In fact she was being held in a police cell in Lima. She remembered the moment her mother, Nora, picked up the phone, saying: 'As soon as she heard my voice she screamed ""Michaella! My baby! I thought you were dead"".' 'She started crying. Then I said ""Mummy, I'm in jail. In Peru"".' At this point, Miss McCollum said the phone went silent, according to Patricia Devlin at the Sunday Life newspaper in Belfast.

Inside: Miss McCollum speaks with her lawyer from inside a cell at Sarita Colonia prison in Callao . 'I found out that after we'd spoken she . had chest pains and was taken to hospital - I nearly killed her with the . stress', she said. Miss McCollum and Miss Reid, sometimes . called the 'Peru two', decided to plead guilty to drugs trafficking in . the hope of receiving a more lenient sentence. The six years and eight months they were given is the minimum jail term for the offence. In return for the guilty plea, prosecutors did not pursue allegations that the women had been paid to carry the drugs. Sentence: Miss McCollum, right, and Miss Reid, left, were given sentences of six years and eight months for drug trafficking. They are shown attending a court hearing last month .

As their sentence is under seven years, the possibility remains open that they can be transferred to a prison in the UK - though the governments in both countries would have to agree to the transfer. The pair had been working at bars in Ibiza before they made the trip to Peru. They originally claimed to have been kidnapped  by a gang in Ibiza and forced to travel to Peru. Though they did not pursue that defence in court, Miss Reid has maintained that she attempted to smuggle the drugs 'under duress'.","Michaella McCollum, 20, told how she broke the news to her mother Nora .

Another former army comrade, Eliav Aviram, said: 'I feel committed to share the very last moment before they're going to bury him.' Sharon was a farmer-turned-soldier, a soldier-turned-politician, a politician-turned-statesman - a leader known for his exploits on the battlefield, masterminding Israel's invasion of Lebanon, building Jewish settlements on war-won land and then, late in life, destroying some that he deemed no longer useful. To his supporters, he was a war hero. To his critics, he was a war criminal. Israeli authorities closed off streets around the parliament in anticipation of huge crowds on Sunday. Visitors were asked to park at lots in and around the city and were brought to the site by special buses. President Shimon Peres and former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who succeeded Sharon after the 2006 stroke, was among the visitors.

Throughout . his life, he was at the center of the most contentious episodes of the . Israeli-Palestinian conflict, starting as a young soldier fighting in . the 1948 war over Israel's creation. In the 1950s, he led a commando unit . that carried out reprisals for Arab attacks.

British Prime Minister David Cameron walks from 10 Downing Street in London, to attend Prime Minister's Questions at the Houses of Parliament . British Prime Minister David Cameron has paid tribute to Ariel Sharon by saying he was an 'important leader' for the country and said he had taken 'brave and controversial' decisions. 'Ariel Sharon is one of the most significant figures in Israeli history and as prime minister he took brave and controversial decisions in pursuit of peace, before he was so tragically incapacitated,' Mr Cameron said. 'Israel has today lost an important leader.' The veteran soldier, nicknamed the 'bulldozer', fought in the series of wars that forged the state of Israel before entering politics in 1973. Critics held him responsible for the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel's Lebanese Phalangist allies in Beirut refugee camps. However, others pointed to his efforts to secure a stable peace as prime minister between 2001 and 2006, including unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Sharon was still in office when he suffered his stroke, and never regained consciousness. Complications after surgery at the beginning of this month had seen a sharp deterioration in his condition. Historians credit him with helping . turn the tide of the 1973 Mideast war when Arab armies launched a . surprise attack on Israel on the solemn fasting day of Yom Kippur, . causing heavy Israeli casualties. Sharon . became a minister in Menachem Begin's government in the late 1970s, and . voted against the historic 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. But . when it fell to Sharon to remove Jewish settlements from Egypt's Sinai . Peninsula, he obediently ordered protesting settlers to be dragged away . and their homes bulldozed to rubble. As defense minister in 1982, Sharon launched the invasion of Lebanon, where he became complicit in one of bloodiest incidents of the Lebanese war, when Israeli-allied forces systematically slaughtered hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps in September 1982. An Israeli judicial inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the killings, and he was forced to step down as defense minister. Yet over the years, he gradually rehabilitated himself by holding a number of Cabinet posts. As opposition leader in September 2000, Sharon demonstratively visited a contested Jewish-Muslim holy site in Jerusalem, setting off Palestinian protests that quickly lurched into an armed uprising that ultimately killed hundreds of Palestinians and Israelis. Several months later, he was elected prime minister. While Sharon ordered a tough crackdown on the Palestinian uprising, he made a dramatic about-face in 2003 when he announced his plans for a unilateral withdrawal from occupied lands. In 2005, he directed a unilateral pullout of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year occupation. He later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the centrist Kadima Party, with a platform promoting further territorial concessions and support for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. It seemed he was on his way to an easy re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006.","Sharon's coffin was displayed in a plaza in front of the Knesset .

The schoolgirl who went on the run with her married maths teacher has ended their relationship for a boy of her own age. The girl, who was 15 when she fled to France to start a new life with Jeremy Forrest, 31, had claimed she wanted to have his children and would wait for him until he was released from prison. But just four months after he was jailed  for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child, she has found a  new boyfriend. The schoolgirl, who cannot be named, is pictured with her teacher Jeremy Forrest aboard a Channel ferry as they head to France in September last year . Just weeks ago the girl’s family . said she wanted to continue her relationship with Forrest after he left . prison – and they would respect her choice. In an exclusive interview . with the Mail in September, the girl’s stepmother condemned him for . abusing his position of trust as her teacher but said she had stopped . hating him. ‘She loves him, and as far as we are aware she is just waiting until he comes out of prison,’ said the stepmother. She said the family would always have misgivings about Forrest but would ultimately respect the girl’s choice of partner. ‘We . will never feel 100 per cent confident about him,’ she added. ‘I’d like . [my step-daughter] to meet someone and be happy. If that someone is . Jeremy, it’s Jeremy. We’ll support her whatever she decides.’ Forrest was jailed for five-and-a-half years for abducting the girl who he first kissed when she was 14-years-old . The . news of the girl’s change of heart is said to have devastated Forrest, . who insisted he was not a paedophile and simply fell in love with his . pupil, who he intended to marry. He triggered an international . manhunt last summer when he fled with the girl. He had groomed her from . when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils. After taking her . virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital home, they . left for France, using the names Jack Dean and Gemma Grant. At first, . the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but soon . after CCTV footage showed her with her arms around her teacher on board a . ferry from Dover to Calais. They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her. After . being convicted at Lewes Crown Court in June, Forrest is serving a . five-and-a-half year sentence and will have to sign the sex offenders’ register for life. Social workers have banned the girl from speaking . to him until she is 18 so it was left to his father Jim, 60, to break . the news on Saturday that she had found a new boyfriend. A source close . to the family said: ‘He is upset and is finding it very difficult. His . father told him about the new boyfriend but she can’t speak to him . herself to break up with him properly.’ In the months after the girl . was  reunited with her family she refused to live with her natural . mother, who condemned the relationship with Forrest. She moved in with . other family members but has since moved back home with her mother and . three siblings in the south of England. Friends realised she was in a . new relationship because she was sending the boy messages on Twitter, . which she signed off with lots of kiss signs. Her natural mother told . a friend: ‘I am so, so glad my daughter is back where she belongs. Now I . want her to go on and enjoy the things any girl of her age would. I . have met her new boyfriend quite a few times now. I like him a lot and . hope they can enjoy being in a relationship together.’ She added: ‘I’m delighted there has been no contact between my daughter and Jeremy Forrest. I’ve longed for her to move on.’ Forrest . began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles . when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something . she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with . bulimia. She opened up to him about the break-up of her parents’ marriage before he kissed her in a classroom. He took her virginity at . his home when his wife Emily, 32 – from whom he is now estranged – was . away. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, which . they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest. After Forrest was . jailed, she said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I don’t want anyone else. I . want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we . can marry and have children.’ The college student, now 16, claimed she instigated their escape to France, adding: ‘If anything, I groomed him.’","Forrest, 31,  was jailed for five-and-a-half years for abducting the girl .

Travels: David Menasche on Lake Harriet in Minneapolis in the winter of 2012/2013 during his 101-day journey around the nation to visit his former students . A passionate English teacher robbed of his memories by terminal brain cancer decided to seize each day left to him the best way he knew how - by traveling the country to visit his favorite former students and ask them what impact he made to their lives. David Menasche, 41, spent 15-years teaching at Coral Reef Senior High School in Miami but three invasive surgeries, two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy and 30 rounds of radiation therapy had left him almost-blind and with limited mobility. Unable to continue his life's work teaching his 11th graders, Menasche set off in November of 2012 on a countrywide trip to meet his former students to simply ask them if he had made a difference in their lives. The Mark Twain devotee dubbed his . journey the 'Vision Quest' and in August of 2012, Menasche posted a . message to Facebook, asking if any of his 3,000 former Coral Reef alumni . wanted to meet him, reminisce about his lessons and most importantly - . let him sleep on their couch. Menasche, . who had separated from his wife when he began to plan his final trip, . was astounded to receive replies from students in 50 cities across the . United States. Despite a . seizure robbing him of his sight and the use of most of the left side . of his body, Menasche resolved to undertake the trip on his own by bus. Scroll Down for Video . Send off: Daivd Mensche with current students and teachers of Coral Reef Senior High School in Miami, where his former students number almost 3,000 . Nationwide: This map shows pins set down across the United States where David Menasche met former students - traveling 8,000 miles by bus and air in the process . 'I am at the end of my life,' he explained to USA Today. 'I don't know how much longer I have left, and I just wanted that sense of satisfaction that the time I did have I used well.' Now, Menasche's journey has been published as a book, entitled The Priority List A Teacher’s Final Quest to Discover Life’s Greatest Lessons - which is published this month. The oldest of his students were in their early 30s - some with families of their own - and the popular English teacher wanted to 'get caught up and see the results of my work.' Sadly his treatment has left him with 'massive' memory loss. 'I don't remember my childhood at all. In fact, I don't remember anything prior to roughly 16 or 17 years old. And even the things that I was doing as a teacher are somewhat spotty'. Students: David's last day in with former student Tahira Augustus in Atlanta, Georgia - his next stop was Washington D.C. So, as he traveled to meet students across the nation, Menasche was told of a much-loved teacher who made learning a joy. He discovered he would be as comfortable teaching Walt Whitman as rapper, Tupac Shakur. That instead of becoming annoyed with his students for passing notes, he would tell them, 'I'm an English teacher! Why wouldn't I encourage you to read and write?' Indeed, on the rare occasion that a student fell asleep, Menasche would paint Wite-Out on their noses. The inspirational teacher spent 101 days on the road and visited 31 cities across 8,000 miles, speaking to 75 former students who lived as far afield as Hawaii. One ex-pupil was Stephan Palahach, who is now an aspiring screenwriter in New York City. Happy: This is David with former students he met up with during his travels and here is one student (left) who David discovered to his surprise had stolen her favorite texts from class that he taught . He told USA Today that Menasche was 'one of the few teachers I felt who were really present. I've had great teachers in my life, but he was really present in the moment.' The former student and one-time teacher spent time together talking and going to the movies. 'There was a fleeting moment when we were sitting around a computer sharing silly Internet videos together and laughing,' Palahach said. 'He ceased to be my old teacher, and he was definitely a friend.' His failing health was never an excuse and Menasche made it to Boston, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, Portland, Hawaii and Minneapolis among other cities. Along the way he discovered something poignant and wonderful: 'It seems like it was not a wasted life,' he said to USA Today. 'I wasn't so sure — I honestly wasn't.' Diagnosed with terminal brain cancer the day before Thanksgiving in 2006, aged 34 - Menasche was told then he had less than a year to live. Refusing to be bowed by this death sentence, he threw himself into his work. Champion: David poses with the statue of Rocky at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and here is David with former students in Memphis, Tennessee (right) 'For six years, the only time I wasn't in class was when I was undergoing brain surgery. I never avoided the topic of my cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, with my students, but it was not something I dwelled on, nor did they,' he said to CNN. 'I covered my bald, lacerated head with a woolen hat and scheduled chemotherapy around my classes, and I got so good at being sick that I could run to the bathroom, heave into the toilet, flush, brush my teeth and fly back to class in under three minutes. They pretended not to notice.' However, despite his new-found zest for life to use every day to its fullest, in the summer of 2012, he was hit by a huge seizure which robbed him of his ability to teach any longer. 'The cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom, but I wasn't ready to let it take me out of the game,' said Menasche to CNN. 'I wasn't afraid to die. I was afraid of living without a purpose.' Bravery: After being diagnosed with one year left to live almost eight years ago - David Menasche has refused to give in or take any day for granted . Release: This is The Priority List - which will be released this month and tells the poignant story of David Menasche's journey around the United States from November 2012 to February 2013 to visit his ex-pupils . The greatest lesson that Menasche learned on his journey was that he made the most difference in what he and his students came to dub 'intimate interludes' between classes, 'when we shared heartaches and vulnerabilities and victories.' 'To learn this meant the world to me, it really did,' said Menasche to CNN. 'The truth of it is those were the moments when I was trying my hardest, when I really wanted to be at my very best, so that I could set an example for them that they could look to. 'It was just overwhelming the generosity and love that I got back.' 'Not only did they give my life meaning while I was a teacher, even after I left the class room they continued to give me a sense of purpose.' Now living in his new home of New Orleans, Menasche is preparing to publicize his incredible book and journey and ready himself for the inevitable. 'I am one of those people who has had to face my fate squarely and my reality is that I have a brain tumor and it is not going to go away. 'Rather than taking that as a death sentence it gave me a sense of urgency that if there was living to be done now is the time to do it.","Florida English teacher David Menasche, 41, traveled the nation to meet former students after becoming too ill to teach .

Formula 1 driver Jenson Button’s father has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 70. John Button, who was a driving force behind his son’s world championship-winning career, was found dead in his home on the French Riviera by a friend yesterday. A statement released by the driver’s agent read: 'It is with great sadness and regret that I can confirm John Button passed away at his home in the South of France on Sunday. Guiding force: Jenson Button's father John has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 70 . Discovery: John Button, who was a guiding force behind his son's world championship-winning career, was found dead in his home on the French Riviera by a friend yesterday . 'Whilst we await confirmation, initial signs would indicate a suspected heart attack. A close friend who was visiting John on Sunday was the first to discover the tragic news. 'John’s children Jenson, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya and the rest of the family are clearly devastated and ask for their privacy to be respected during this extremely difficult time.' John Button, who used to drive rallycross, became a familiar face on the F1 circuit as he proudly cheered his son on to success. When Mr Button split from his wife Simone, Jenson moved in with his father but the links with his mother and older sisters, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya, were maintained.

As an eight-year-old schoolboy who drove to victory in his first race, freckle-faced Jenson had already told his father he wanted to be a F1 world champion one day. With his father’s backing, this dream went on to become a reality. They were not flush with money. Mr Button once had to borrow enough money to buy fuel for the drive home from a kart race in Scotland. Mr Button coached his son and helped pay for his racing from a kart engine preparation business where Anthony Hamilton, whose son Lewis who would become the 2008 world champion, was among his customers. A 'very sad' McLaren Mercedes team principal Martin Whitmarsh said: 'In my long Formula 1 career, I’ve encountered many drivers’ fathers, but I think it’s safe to say that John was perhaps more devoted to his son than any of them. Cheerleader: John Button, who used to drive rallycross, became a familiar face on the F1 circuit as he proudly cheered his son on to success, including the moment where he became world champion in 2009 . 'Ever since Jenson was a boy, racing go-karts, his dad has been at his side, helping him, supporting him, finding the money for the next race. 'As Jenson grew older, and continued to win in cars, still John was always there, his most steadfast helper and supporter. 'And, even now, in recent years, during which Jenson has become the consummate Formula 1 world champion that he is, the most experienced driver on the Formula 1 grid in fact, still John has been ever-present, as loyal and as loving as ever, a benign and popular member of Jenson’s small and intimate entourage.

I believe John has attended every grand prix over the past four seasons, and over that period he’s become a unique and, I think it’s fair to say, irreplaceable part of the McLaren ""family"". 'He was not only a great dad, but also a lovely man, and he’ll be enormously missed by Jenson, of course, by all at McLaren, and indeed by the Formula 1 community at large.

Dozens of videos of teenagers and young people fighting have been posted on a disturbing Facebook page which appears to glorify bare-knuckle bouts. The site boasts that its clips are meant to 'entertain' web users, while some of those featured in the videos say they treat their vicious fights as a type of 'sport'. But residents of the areas where the videos were filmed have denounced the 'worrying trend' of public fights which they say are making their streets more dangerous. A leading MP described the Facebook page as 'very depressing', while the father of a young man killed by a single punch urged the fighters to think again about their actions. Warning: graphic content . Brawl: This is one of the fights featured on the Facebook page 'Fight Central', which has been taken down after complaints from campaigners . Collection: Dozens of clips of filmed brawls were featured on the site before it was deleted from Facebook . The 'Fight Central' page appeared on Facebook on January 2, and hosted video clips of 43 different fights, ranging from brawls caught on CCTV to incidents of violence filmed on bystanders' mobile phones. It was taken down earlier today after receiving negative coverage from campaigners and politicians. Before the page was deleted, it claimed: 'Fight Central is a Facebook page which regularly uploads fights that have been recorded by anyone. 'People can send fights in for us to upload for your entertainment! Please note that we do not encourage the act of fighting without professional or qualified supervision.' Two of the most popular videos uploaded to the site were filmed in Blackburn, Lancashire, leading residents to speak out against the voyeuristic clips. Squaring off: A video of two 20-something men fighting in the streets of Blackburn, Lancashire attracted hundreds of views . One video filmed in November last year showed two 16-year-olds fight, surrounded by 50 other teenagers watching. The brawl was sparked by a Facebook argument, according to one of those involved who admitted that he regularly organises fights because 'it's like sport'. Another video from Blackburn featured two men in their 20s punching each other in the face, until one falls to the ground and gets kicked in the head. Duncan Roberts, who lives in the area where the violent clip was filmed, said: 'There is a small group of young men around here that treat bare knuckle fighting as a hobby or a sport. 'It's a worrying trend round here that more young lads are getting into. I suppose they don't have much else - they have no work, no money.' Another local resident added: 'The video doesn't surprise me at all. I've only lived here for a year and I'd say that half of those weekends I have seen a fight in some form or another on the streets. 'The police presence is pretty poor and not much seems to get done about it.' Attack: The video, filmed on a bystander's mobile phone, showed the men lashing out at one another . Merciless: One man is pictured kicking the other as he lies on the ground after being knocked over . Police have investigated the videos, but have not made any arrests. Blackburn MP Jack Straw, the former Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, said that the film clips were 'very sad'. He said: 'I just think that this is very depressing and I wonder if the individuals involved realise just how sad they are. 'It's very difficult to control what goes on the internet but this is terrible for residents that see people fighting on their street in broad daylight.' Dave Rogers, whose son Adam was killed in Blackburn in 2010 after receiving a single punch to the head, also spoke out against the violence. 'It is such an unhealthy development and you have to wonder if these people have really thought about the consequences,' he said. 'The key lesson from Adam's death was that one punch can kill. 'I don't know what can be done about it but I wish that I could tell each of them Adam's story and the potential danger they are getting themselves into.'","'Fight Central' page advertised 43 amateur videos of brutal fights .

A young mother has been been found guilty of slitting the throat of Ground Force star Tommy Walsh's daughter, in a verdict described as ‘satisfying’ by the celebrity builder. Leanne Bloomfield, 28, was convicted of wounding with intent after she used a shard of glass to slash Natalie Walsh, 22, upwards from her neck to her chin at Cafe De Paris near Leicester Square in central London. The mother-of-two attacked Ms Walsh with such ferocity on February 4 last year that the student required plastic surgery and therapy to get over the assault. Wounding with intent: Tommy Walsh's daughter Natalie (left) was attacked by Leanne Bloomfield, 28, (right). Bloomfield was today found guilty of slitting Ms Walsh's throat with a shard of glass . Natalie Walsh was left with a deep two-inch gash on her neck after being attacked with a shard of glass by Leanne Bloomfield at Cafe De Paris near Leicester Square in central London . After the verdict, Mr Walsh, who was in court with his wife and son, condemned the defendant’s 'laddish' behaviour during the assault on February 3. The celebrity builder, who became famous in the BBC’s gardening show Ground Force with Charlie Dimmock, said his daughter, who was not in court today, had undergone plastic surgery and therapy following the attack. During the trial, Southwark Crown Court heard how Bloomfield pulled Miss Walsh's hair back before attacking her at the cabaret club, favoured by stars from Made In Chelsea and TOWIE. She also kicked the 22-year-old, as she lay on the ground, and later texted a friend to say she'd had a 'massive punch up with some girl', adding: 'ha ha, b****, she got me good in the nose through'. Bloomfield allegedly went on to say: 'Me and my sister did a number on her, she was in a heap. They didn't catch me, ha ha.' But she was caught because her Santander bank card had fallen into Ms Walsh's bag after their belongings spilled onto the floor during the row. Ms Walsh also suffered a 'nasty cut' to her thumb, and needed an operation for a severed tendon, as well as treatment for the cut to her throat. The attack took place at London's Café de Paris, a nightclub and cabaret favoured by celebrities . Celebrity builder Tommy Walsh (left), who became famous in the BBC's gardening show Ground Force with Charlie Dimmock (right), said he was 'satisfied' that justice had been done following his daughter's attack . Leanne Bloomfield attacked Natalie Walsh with such ferocity that the student required plastic surgery . Speaking about the verdict, Mr Walsh said: 'Pleased isn’t the right word. Satisfied...There are no winners in this. The only winner is justice has been seen to be done.' He . added: 'It was really tough but we are a really close knit family... We . can move on. We've no interest in what happens from here.' Mr Walsh said Broomfield 'didn’t appear remorseful or contrite' following the attack. 'She has two children. You should think about your behaviour before you go and behave drunkenly or laddishly,' he added. Mr Walsh said his daughter had achieved a first in her medicine degree at Kings University in central London despite deferring her final exams after the attack. After the verdict was read out, Broomfield, from Colchester in Essex, turned to the jury and said: 'I didn’t do it', before breaking down in tears. As she continued to protest her innocence, Judge Peter Susman QC told the defendant 'please be quiet'. He adjourned sentencing to February 7, adding he had 'no choice but to impose a prison sentence' but granting bail until that point. He said: 'You must make arrangements for your children’s welfare on the basis you are going to prison.' The court heard that Broomfield had previously been cautioned by police in August 2004 for common assault after a fight with a woman in a street.","Leanne Bloomfield, 28, found guilty of attack at London celebrity nightclub .

'They then gently told me that someone had been killed and that they thought it was Mark and could I come and identify him. 'I was absolutely hysterical when they told me. I just kept saying: ""I can’t believe it"". 'You find yourself going into such a state of shock that it does not hit home at all. It is like a bad dream.' Mrs Buckley said that after a while the sense of dread at hearing an air ambulance at work begins to diminish and the implications of what it means do not normally sink in. But this time she was faced with the agonising task of telling her four daughters that their father was dead. Sharon Buckley, far right, sits with three of her four daughters, Kate, Charlotte and Ginny who lost their father Mark after he died in a cycling accident . 'Mark absolutely adored his girls.

Mark Buckley, who died in a cycling accident last September, had completed four Iron Man triathlons . 'Telling them their fit and healthy dad had suddenly died was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.' An inquest is to be held later this month into how Mr Buckley was killed last September. His death came after years of heartache for the family who saw their second daughter, Katie, battle leukaemia for years from the age of 16. She relapsed after a round of intensive chemotherapy and only recovered after her younger sister Ginny, 11, donated her bone marrow. 'The girls feel really sad about losing their dad but we are all plodding on,"" said Mrs Buckley. 'Ginny is like a little lost soul without her dad. He was the only male in a female household and there is a gaping hole now he has gone. 'Mark was a very strong character and he always looked after the girls. It was such a shock to suddenly lose Mark - especially after everything we had been through with Katie’s illness. 'His death was so hard to accept as it came completely out of the blue.' She said that her husband was such a proficient cyclist that I never worried about him being out on his bike.” Prisoners at Garth Prison where Mr Buckley was a PE Officer are building a bench in his memory which will be put up at Dunsop Bridge near where he died.

This is the moment a pensioner who got stuck in the mud while out walking her dog was rescued by emergency services. The stricken lady, thought to be in her 70s, was walking near her home on Dartmoor, Devon when she became stuck. She dialled 999 but struggled to get through due to poor phone reception and after several calls was heard to say 'itâ€™s now up to my' before the line went dead. Ordeal: A walker in her 70s got stuck in the mud while out walking on Dartmoor, Devon. She called emergency services but due to poor reception was cut off as she said 'it's not up to my..' Devon and Cornwall Police deployed a helicopter and at 2.42pm on Saturday the crew spotted the woman. With assistance from a family of farmers, a ladder and an old door, officers managed to reach the woman and slowly extract her from the mud. By 3pm the woman was safely back on . solid ground and the farmers helped further by allowing her to shower . and dry off at their home, and even provided her with fresh clothes. The woman suffered no serious injuries, just bruising as a result of her ordeal. PC Adrian Taylor, an air observer for the National Police Air Service, said: 'When we were called to assist we knew we needed to find her quickly as she was very distressed, cold and uncomfortable. 'Without the assistance of the helicopter, officers could have searched for hours without locating her. 'The woman was completely stuck, up to her waist in thick mud, and unable to move. 'She was in the course of a small river and had simply sunk into an unexpectedly deep section of mud. Team: Police officers who assisted in rescuing the woman - who escaped with minor injuries . 'The depth and consistency of the mud was very unpredictable and clearly hazardous in places.' PC Taylor added: 'As an experienced walker, she was well equipped for most occasions but was very unlucky to get trapped as she did. 'The incident does serve as a reminder that even experienced, competent walkers can get into difficulties very suddenly on Dartmoor. 'Fortunately she had a mobile phone with her and it was in an accessible place so she was able to reach it and call for help. 'The rescue was a fantastic team effort with assistance from the police helicopter, officers on the ground and the local farmers. 'The officers who got her out were all very muddy by the end but we are thankful it was a happy ending.' A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'After a lot of rapid enquiries, including requests to mobile phone providers, it was established at about 2.15pm that the woman was not far from Brent Tor, north of Tavistock. 'The police helicopter was deployed as well as officers from Tavistock and Okehampton, and at 2.42pm the helicopter crew spotted the woman and directed officers to her. 'With assistance from a family of farmers, a ladder and an old door, officers managed to reach the woman and slowly extract her from the mud.'","Pensioner in her 70s walking on Dartmoor, Devon when she became stuck .

Tragic: Sam Boon died in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco in July 2012 . A teenager who collapsed in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco died as a result of misadventure, a coroner has ruled. Samuel Boon, 17, fell to the ground in front of classmates on a five-day trek in temperatures of 120F (49C) in July 2012. The 6ft 2in teenager was taken to hospital by minibus, where he was sadly pronounced dead. Now, south London coroner Selena Lynch has criticised the trek leaders - claiming they were 'inexperienced' and 'lacking in local knowledge'. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, she said: 'The cause of Samuel’s death was contributed to by his obesity . and lack of fitness and acclimatisation. 'These . risk factors and his tiredness and obvious difficulty in keeping up . with the trek were not fully recognised by the leaders, who were . inexperienced and lacking in local knowledge.' Samuel, who weighed 20 stone, collapsed at around 3.30pm on July 17, 2012, while trekking in Amezmiz, in the foothills of the High Atlas mountains, the inquest in Bromley, south east London, heard. He 'quickly became unconscious', yet it took more than an hour for an emergency vehicle to arrive - and when it did, it was a minibus, rather than a fully equipped ambulance. When Samuel . eventually reached a medical centre, he was pronounced dead. 'Samuel was carried to the road where it was noted that his breathing had ceased,' said Mrs Lynch. 'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed by the leaders and Samuel was placed in the aisle of the minibus. Scene: The 17-year-old collapsed in front of classmates on a five-day trek in Amezmiz (pictured) at the foot of the High Atlas mountains, an inquest heard. He was taken to hospital, where he was sadly pronounced dead . 'By this time it was probable that Samuel’s life could not have been saved even with advanced medical treatment.' She added: 'Plans . for evacuation relied almost entirely upon local agents to find and . obtain appropriate facilities. 'They were appointed . without their qualifications being checked or references obtained, and . were not given any formal training. Devastating: Before the trip, Samuel had been prescribed the drug DesmoMelt for bed-wetting . 'There . were no arrangements in place for an ambulance with medical equipment . and/or personnel to be provided in an emergency, and the facilities at . local medical centres had not been assessed.' Eleven pupils from Bexley Business Academy in south east London went on the trip, and had raised funds to support the expedition, the inquest heard. The itinerary was to include a few days helping to build a school. The students had been due to work on a rural project for seven days after the trek, but the trip was cut short after Samuel died. At the time of his death, temperatures in the region were reported to have risen as high as 49C. Before the expedition, Samuel's . parents had been given 'inadequate and misleading' information about the . level of fitness required on the trip, as wells as the risks involved, said Mrs Lynch. 'Samuel was not adequately assessed as to his physical ability to participate,' she said. The teenager had also been prescribed the drug DesmoMelt for bed-wetting, which he had taken with him to Morocco. Recording the verdict, Mrs . Lynch said the cause of Samuel’s death was either exertional heatstroke . and/or hyponatremia - a condition where salt levels are reduced in the . blood, caused by excessive intake and/or retention of water. She . said the teenager, who lived in Abbey Wood, south east London, may have taken DesmoMelt in the 'recent past', which can cause or contribute to hyponatremia. High temperatures: Recording a verdict of misadventure, south London coroner Selena Lynch said the cause of Samuel's death in Morocco (pictured) was either exertional heatstroke and/or hyponatremia . However, she added it was not possible to . determine whether he did so - and if so, whether it contributed to his death. Speaking after the inquest, Samuel's parents criticised the company, World Challenge, which organised the trip. Ken . Boon said he would never have allowed . his son to go on the expedition if he had known about the arrangements for emergency care. 'If . we had known that in an emergency there would have been no helicopter, . no ambulance, no medic - in fact, the best emergency response available . was a mini-bus with no medical assistance - we would never have allowed . Sam to go, he said. 'In fact I don’t think there is any school in the country that would go.' In a statement after the inquest, Matt . Eastlake, managing director of World Challenge, said: 'Samuel Boon’s death was an absolute tragedy and our . deepest sympathies remain with his family and friends. 'World . Challenge’s highest priority is the safety of its participants and as . the coroner noted, we have introduced a number of new measures since . Samuel’s death, especially in terms of monitoring participant fitness. 'We . will take time to reflect on the coroner’s findings and give serious . consideration to any change or development where we feel appropriate . which will improve safety further. He added: 'We have worked hard over the last 26 years to . develop an excellent reputation for our approach to safety and how we . operate.

Residents of a cul-de-sac claim their lives are being plagued by a continuous buzzing noise which is causing them to fall ill and making it impossible to sleep. The sound has been swarming Clay Place in Acomb, North Yorkshire, for more than a month - and despite daytime traffic numbing the buzz, the silence of the night makes it almost unbearable. Some residents believe the noise - which switches on and off every few seconds - is from nearby mobile phone masts, or newly installed streetlights in an adjacent street. Buzzing: Paul and Keiko Croft (left, with a sound monitor) and Tanya Rostron (right) inside their houses in Acomb, North Yorkshire, who claim their lives are being plagued by a continuous buzzing noise . Paul Croft, 61, who lives on the street with his 48-year-old wife Keiko, said: ‘We went away on holiday at the beginning of December and when we came back, we noticed the sound. ‘It's been keeping us awake every night - sometimes we only get an hour's sleep, and as Keiko doesn't work, she has no break from it, and it's making her ill. ‘She collapsed at the doctor's last week out of sheer exhaustion. It is literally driving us crazy.’ Mr Croft, a former BT engineer who now works in the company's complaints department, added: ‘We have got a device which can monitor sound waves, but it doesn't pick much up in the house. Losing sleep: Some residents on Clay Place (pictured) believe the noise - which switches on and off every few seconds - is from nearby mobile phone masts, or newly installed streetlights in an adjacent street . ‘On Saturday night, we went out into the street and the machine was picking up strong microwaves. 'It's been keeping us awake every night - sometimes we only get an hour's sleep' Paul Croft, local resident . ‘There are several mobile phone transmitters nearby, which I think are responsible, because they're due to start transmitting 4G signals soon. ‘Also, they have recently installed new streetlights nearby, which could well be emitting these waves, which we're hearing at home. ‘There's only one more traditional yellow-light street lamp on our street and so that would explain why the monitor won't pick anything up at our home.’ Fearing for their health: Mr and Mrs Croft say the buzzing on their road is making it impossible to sleep . Other residents on the street have . complained of tinnitus-type symptoms with their hearing. Tanya Rostron, 46, . lives next door to the Crofts with her 13-year-old son. Not him: Ex-Yorkshire and England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott commentates on Test Match Special and is known for his strident opinions expressed at length . She said: ‘I first noticed it about six weeks ago, but it . seems to have got worse and it's becoming unbearable. It's a lot worse . at night - it's just a constant buzz. ‘It . might stop for two seconds but then it's back and there's no let-up. It . sounds louder upstairs and it's really aggravating. I only moved in . July but I've only just noticed it. 'I was relieved when I heard about Paul and Keiko because I did start to think we were going mad. There's only four houses on the street but we all seem to be affected. I'm not working at the moment because I'm off-sick, but it's not helping my health at all.’ The Crofts have contacted the City of York Council's noise pollution teams, who have left monitoring devices in their home. The Environmental Protection Unit is now analysing recording made at the house, and has visited at night to listen to the noise. Mr Croft said: ‘We have been switching from room-to-room at night to try and get rid of the noise. ‘We've tried sleeping on the floor as you can hear it more when you put your head on the pillow and we've swapped bedrooms, but nothing's helped. ‘We don't know where to go with it now, we need someone to help us and someone to shed some light on what this could be.’ The road's four properties are worth between £90,000 and £145,000, with one sold last September.","Sound has been swarming North Yorkshire road for more than a month .

After news of the curious killing made headlines across the country, Jessica Kay St. Clair Hackney took to Facebook to insists Brad Davis bludgeoned Denver St. Clair in the head and then administered the 'atomic wedgie' when he was unconscious. 'I'm sure if he were conscious enough to undo the so-called wedgie, he would have been able to get it undone, but he was struck in the head with a weapon no one can find,' she wrote.

An autopsy found he was killed by blunt force trauma and/or asphyxiation. Davis told authorities that he had given the 58-year-old man an 'atomic wedgie,' but Hackney wrote the 33-year-old was simply 'being a smart A$$.' She added that it was a calculated plan to hurt the dead man's reputation. 'It's like he hurt the family again by trying to disgrace my uncle,' Hackney wrote. She said she hoped that despite the fact the bizarre story has 'made headline news all over the U.S., hopefully everyone will figure out they arenâ€™t being given the whole story.' The family are also angry because authorities never told them about the wedgie attack until after it was all over the news. The 'sad thing is the family wasn't even warned about that part!' she wrote. 'We only knew he was beat.'

Davis told detectives the altercation began when St. Clair badmouthed his ex-wife Tressia St. Clair - Davis' mother. The men began to fight before St. Clair allegedly tried to punch Davis. Father and son brawled before Davis allegedly pulled the elastic band of his victim's underwear over his head from behind. Davis said he acted in 'self-defense'. However the man's death has been ruled a homicide. Police believe Davis altered the crime scene to make it look like the men had had a fight before he called 911.

The 51-year-old accounts manager was punched repeatedly and repeatedly kicked by the yobs, suffering two black eyes, a broken nose, a badly-bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating. Brutal: Mark Earnshaw was punched repeatedly and repeatedly kicked by two yobs, suffering two black eyes, a broken nose, after he remonstrated with them for over-turning bins in his local park . Injuries: The 51-year-old account manager also suffered a badly bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating . He has permanent damage to his right eye and scars to his face, while the vision in one of his eyes is still impaired following the attack near his home in Anchorsholme, Blackpool, Lancashire in March last year. Mr Earnshaw was celebrating becoming a grandfather to twins when he was dropped off at home by taxi following a birthday party at a nearby social club. As he was getting ready for bed sat around 2am he hearing smashing noises and went outside to investigate. Bins had been overturned at the entrance . to Anchorsholme Park opposite and Mr Earnshaw feared vandals were about . to damage flower beds and the bowling green, as well as the children’s . play area. Sentenced: Kyle Spencer, 19, (pictured) and a 17-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons, was sentenced to three years detention for the attack on Mr Earnshaw. 'I had gone to the surprise birthday party alone because my wife went to the hospital as my stepdaughter was going into labour with twins,' he said. 'It was really dark at that time and I assumed nobody was about, so was surprised when I heard a voice - it said ""what are you staring at?"" Two teenagers suddenly appeared out of the darkness and they seemed quite agitated. 'I told them I didn’t want any trouble, that I’d had a good night and that I was looking forward to going to bed. I thought that was the end of it, but as I was getting ready for bed I heard a lot of noise coming from the park. 'I love that park and go there a lot with my dog Cooper and my granddaughter, so it really annoyed me that they were vandalising it. I pulled on a pair of jeans and trainers and headed out.' He went out to talk to the youths, but when they became very abusive and angry he turned to walk away. As he did so he felt a great heavy blow from behind. “They came out of nowhere saying they were doing it because they had nothing else to do, then one of them squared up to me saying, ‘go on touch me’ over and over again and that’s when I really started to panic,' he said. 'The best thing I thought to do was just a walk off, but I must have taken about three steps when I felt a hard thump from behind. 'He hit me again and my glasses went onto the floor. I could hardly see where they had landed so bent down to pick them up. 'They started punching and kicking me - I just thought to myself I had to stay on my feet, it was my only chance otherwise they would knock me into a coma. 'I heard my nose crack twice, the pain was unbelievable. Blood was streaming down my face, it was just pouring out. My right eye was bleeding too and I could feel it closing up. Suffering: Mr Earnshaw has permanent damage to his right eye and scars to his face, while the vision in one of his eyes is still impaired following the attack near his home . Wary: Mr Earnshaw welcomed the sentencing, but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future . 'I was bent over trying to fend them off, shouting, ""I’ve had enough, leave me alone"", but it just carried on.' Mr Earnshaw eventually escaped and ran back into the safety of his home, but he was followed and the same two yobs began smashing up his neighbour’s car. He said: 'I yelled for my wife to call the police and headed straight for the shower to wash all of the blood off. Then my neighbour was at the door saying the lads kicked in the doors of his car . 'They obviously thought I’d gone into that house - I couldn’t believe beating me up wasn’t enough for them. I just kept thinking, that could have been my head.' Mr Earnshaw was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital where he was x-rayed and then transferred for special surgery at Preston Royal Hospital to stich up the hole in his cheek. 'You could have stuck your little finger through my cheek, I couldn’t believe it when I looked in the mirror, I was a mess. Scene: Mr Earnshaw at the spot where he was attacked in March last year . 'It frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening.' Both Spencer and the 17-year-old admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Preston Crown Court. The younger boy also admitted criminal damage and both were sentenced to three years detention. Mr Earnshaw welcomed the sentencing, but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future as he did not want to suffer the same fate as tragic Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death as he confronted youths damaging his wife’s car outside their home in Warrington, Cheshire in 2007. 'I won’t bother tackling these yobbos next time - I don’t want to be another Garry Newlove,' said Mr Earnshaw, who is married to Angela, 49, a receptionist. 'I’m pleased these lads have gone to jail so they can reflect on what they have done but unfortunately now I would let these people get on with it next time if I saw the getting up to no good. Unharmed: Mr Earnshaw at his beloved Blackpool FC prior to last year's vicious attack . Family ties: Mr Earnshaw and his wife Angela, 49 . 'It’s not worth risking my own life tackling these people in future. 'Obviously I don’t like the senseless damage of things and it annoys me people get a kick out of smashing up the park. 'Then you then hear about what happens to other people like Garry Newlove who lost his life doing something like I did - and I think that could have been me. 'If I’d fallen to the ground unconscious and been beaten some more, my wife may have been going to a funeral. I went out without really thinking about the consequences.' Detective Constable Alan Quanbrough of Lancashire Police said after the hearing: 'This was a senseless and sustained attack on the victim, who received life-changing injuries.

Relatives of a murdered retired postmistress have criticised police who initially treated her death as an accident - even though she was repeatedly stabbed and set on fire. Detectives still working on the unsolved killing of 86-year-old Una Crown in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of the confusion. Her body was discovered by relative John Payne, 77, when he called at her bungalow to take her for a day out last January. She had suffered serious burns and multiple stab wounds. Death: Una Crown, 86, with her late husband Jack. Detectives still working on her unsolved killing have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of early confusion . Probe: An officer stands outside the Wisbech home where Mrs Crown was found murdered in January 2013 . However, officers first thought she had accidentally set herself on fire. They told Mr Payne and his wife Judy, 70, that they were free to enter her home and sort through her belongings. But three days later they dramatically changed their minds and launched a murder investigation, telling Mr and Mrs Payne the bungalow was now a crime scene. A post-mortem found Mrs Crown had been stabbed repeatedly - including through the heart and lungs - and then set on fire by her killer. Mr and Mrs Payne complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and said they had felt ‘very let down’ by Cambridgeshire Constabulary. Now, one year after her death, the force has admitted key evidence could have been lost as a result of the confusion. Investigation: Police officers in Cambridgeshire first thought Mrs Crown had accidentally set herself on fire . Evidence: A post-mortem found Mrs Crown had been stabbed repeatedly - including through the heart and lungs - and then set on fire by her killer . Mrs Payne, from Wisbech, said: ‘I was surprised when the police said it was an accident. After a few days the point was proved. We got home and within half an hour the police arrived and told us it was a homicide.’ Mystery: Mrs Crown, who lived alone, was last seen alive on January 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day . Police officers said the family’s complaint to the IPCC had been ‘locally resolved’ and Mrs Crown’s relatives were content with this. Detective Chief Inspector Jon Hutchinson said: ‘There was a problem with the first two days in that the officers that attended were under the impression this was a tragic accident. ‘Officers made the assumption that it was a non-suspicious death. There is always the potential, as a result of that, we may not have been as quick off the mark as we should have been. ‘We are absolutely determined that we will do everything to bring the offender to justice and to bring closure to Una’s family.’ Mrs Crown, who lived alone, was last seen alive on January 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day. Police believe she was murdered some time before 9pm. A £10,000 Crimestoppers reward has been offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of Mrs Crown’s killer. Det Con Hutchinson added: ‘We still believe the answer to this crime lies in the local community and we need their help. ‘I would urge people to think back to this time a year ago, did a friend or loved one come home with blood on them or smelling of smoke? Were they acting strangely around that time? Did they suddenly come into money? ‘Any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, could prove crucial to solving this terrible crime and giving some closure to Mrs Crown’s family who are desperate for answers.’","Detectives are still working on unsolved killing of 86-year-old Una Crown .

The Environment Agency today warned that Dorset, South Wiltshire, Somerset and the Thames Valley would face continued flooding, with heavy rain forecast for Wednesday. In addition, rivers are at worryingly high levels in Hampshire, West Berkshire, Surrey, West Sussex, Wiltshire and along the River Severn. The agency added that Wednesday's predicted rain would fall on 'already saturated ground', increasing the flood risk and prolonging the time it will take for affected areas to recover. There are more than 150 flood warnings and alerts currently in place, with much of South-East England and the West Country warned to stay vigilant. Forecast: Heavy rain will arrive on Wednesday, causing chaos in flood-affected areas . Be prepared: More than 150 flood warnings and alerts were today in place across the South of England . 'There is a continued risk of flooding in southern England, especially Dorset, South Wiltshire, Somerset and the Thames Valley, and we urge people to remain vigilant and prepared to take action,' a spokesman for the Environment Agency said today. 'Environment Agency teams are out on the ground, maintaining flood defences, clearing watercourses and deploying pumps and temporary defences to protect communities at risk.' A pest control company has predicted that the widespread flooding will encourage an 'influx of rats' by forcing the rodents to seek shelter on high ground away from rivers. Chris Davis of Cleankill Environmental Services said: â€˜The rats are simply trying to find dry places to live. 'Rats like water and are good swimmers but they canâ€™t tolerate being submerged for long periods and can drown.' Hardy: A daffodil which has survived the storms to bloom in a garden near Weymouth in Dorset . Bursting through: The growth of the flowers has been encouraged by the mild temperatures . Householders are advised not to tackle the rats themselves as they can become aggressive if they are cornered and there is a risk of being bitten. However, it's not all bad news about the weather - in a public garden in Dorset, one plucky daffodil defied the turbulent weather and flowered three months ahead of schedule. The flower emerged from the ground at Abbotsbury Sub-Tropical Gardens near Weymouth in Dorset last week. Despite the storms, temperatures have been relatively mild for January, with the thermometer rising as high as 10C. 'It is quite unusual to see these daffodils flowering so early,' said curator Stephen Griffith. 'We thought the cold December might push it back a bit, but we have had mild temperatures this January that seem to be the reason it is in full bloom so early.'","Environment Agency warns of more flooding across the South of England .

A sadistic mother who masterminded a sickening attack in which her own sister-in-law was held captive in a flat and tortured for five days has been jailed for four years. Suzannah Bertram, 32, and two men tied Lisa Bertram up in a room in a flat in Blackpool, Lancashire, burned her with a gadget used to 'zap' insects, cut her with a knife, cut all her hair cut off, and forced her to swallow a 'noxious substance' along with a cocktail of medication. The incident apparently took place after the group 'took exception' to something 36-year-old Lisa, who has learning difficulties, had said to Bertram. Savage: Suzannah Bertram was jailed along with Derek Buchanan (left) and Fraser Gallagher (right) for torturing her sister-in-law Lisa, who has learning difficulties, over a five day period in August 2012 . At one stage Lisa was taken to hospital when her lip ended up partially hanging off and became infected. But after treatment she was allowed back to the flat in Central Drive, Blackpool, Lancashire, when Bertram ordered her to falsely tell medics she had been beaten up in the street. Back at her makeshift cell, she was then subjected to yet more 'cruelty and degradation' before one of the gang made a 999 call when she passed out. Paramedics found Lisa in a 'very dire state' and was said to be 'very incoherent, injured, wrapped in a dirty duvet'. She woke up in hospital and is now recovering from her ordeal. Details of the attack emerged at Burnley Crown Court where Bertram - the mother 'of a number of children' - admitted wounding, false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon. Fraser Gallagher, 20, from Glasgow was locked up for 42 months and Derek Buchanan, 18, of Blackpool, was given 12 months. The attack took place in a flat on Central Drive in Blackpool, Lancashire. Lisa Bertram had arrived with her husband Kevin only two months earlier and initially stayed with her attacker before moving to a flat upstairs . Both admitted false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon. Earlier Richard Haworth, prosecuting, said the victim was a 'vulnerable young lady, with significant leaning difficulties.' She arrived in Blackpool in June 2012 with her husband Kevin and initially stayed with Bertram before moving to rent the flat upstairs. Mr Haworth added : 'Between August 13 and August 17, 2012, Lisa Bertram was subjected to a prolonged, cruel and degrading attack at the hands, at various times, of the three defendants. 'She sustained physical and emotional harm during the course of that time.' The prosecutor said the attack began after the victim’s husband was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital unbeknown to his wife. She went downstairs in search of him and found Bertram lying asleep on the sofa with two men inside the flat. Mr Haworth said Gallagher then ordered Lisa to the floor by the window and then put the table over her, so it’s legs were by her head at one end and her knees at the other. Heaters were then put either side of her and she was 'tightly encased' in that position. Gallagher then got a yard brush, put it on top of the table and she recalled feeling something wet on her legs. She thought it might be urine. The victim felt tingling in her legs and described what she thought was a 'zappy thing', which turned out to be a prohibited Taser-type device, which had originally been used as an electronic fly swatter. The prosecutor said: 'Clearly, at some stage during the course of that week-long period, she sustained an injury to her mouth, a serious tear to the upper lip. The lip was partially hanging off and became infected.' Brutal: Suzannah Bertram admitted wounding, false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon at Burnley Crown Court (pictured). She was sentenced to four years in prison . Bertram took the victim to hospital where she received stitches but told her sister-in-law to say her injury had been caused by two girls. But Lisa did not go to the Royal Preston Hospital for further treatment as advised. The prosecutor added: 'One cannot say how exactly, or who exactly, caused that injury to the lip. The fact remains it was caused during the time of the false imprisonment.' The prosecutor said when the victim returned to the flat, she was made to go under the table again and one of her legs was tied up to the cord of one of the heaters. He added: 'The following day, as she believed it was, Gallagher zapped her on the arm four times with the taser and cut her hair. Some of her husband’s medication was there and Suzannah Bertram told the complainant to take some.' 'Gallagher made her drink some yellow fluid. Derek Buchanan was present. He was part and parcel of the false imprisonment, administering the noxious substance and tasering. It beggars belief what these defendants were doing to her.' Mr Haworth said at one point Bertram had taken a knife and started to cut downwards on Lisa's arm until the victim passed out. Paramedics were eventually called to a report that Lisa had taken an overdose, only to be horrified when they arrived at the scene. One of the paramedics said. 'She appeared as though she had not been cared for in any way.' In mitigation defence counsel Sharon Watson said: 'It’s impossible to explain what would lead three people to behave in the terrible, despicable way that they did towards Lisa Bertram, a lady who had done absolutely nothing to them. ' 'The best guess is that something was said by Lisa Bertram. Individually, none of the people in the dock would have behaved in the way that they did. 'It would appear together they conducted themselves in a way that was out of character and out of the norm. The incident was dreadful and must have been terrible for Lisa Bertram to endure.' Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'Over several days this incident occurred which led to harm to Lisa Bertram in a most cruel manner. This was a dreadful case.'","Suzannah Bertram, 32, kept her sister-in-law in a 'dire state' for five days .

Two cowboy builders conned an elderly customer, charging him twelve times the going rate for botched home improvements. Philip Riley, 56, and 59-year-old Joesph Featon charged the 76-year-old man £29,800 for painting his house and fitting a window. The pair used their powers of persuasion to coax the man into parting with the money from his savings after an elaborate con spanning almost three years. Philip Riley, left, and Joesph Featon, right, charged their 76-year-old victim twelve times the going rate for three years of botched home improvements, including painting and erecting a small fence . They pitched up at the man's house every two to three months, to paint, fit a window or work on the porch. During one visit they charged the customer £10,000 to paint his fence. Police were eventually called to inspect their poor workmanship after a tip off from neighbours. Reputable builders later concluded the bill should have been just £2,500 - more than 1,000 per cent below Riley and Featon’s asking price. At Liverpool Crown Court the pair, both from Blackpool, each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were each jailed for 12 months. Greater Manchester Police said the construction con began in June 2009, when the two men knocked on the front door of the victim in Standish, near Wigan. They claimed to be builders and agreed a price with the pensioner to carry out work on his house including painting the outside of the house and fencing. But unbeknown to the old man he was being overcharged 'ridiculous amounts of money'. Between July 31, 2009 and March 21, 2012, both men were paid a total of £29,800 after they attended the house every two to three months, painting, fitting a window and working on a porch. The pair pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed for 12 months each. They were found out when neighbours of their victim noticed he was paying 'ridiculous amounts' for the work . But the alarm was raised by the neighbours when they realised that in March 2012 the victim had raised two cheques for Riley and Featon, totalling £10,000 for work to erect a small fence at his address. When the work for the full building project was assessed, the true value of the 'improvements' was valued at just over £2,500. Both men were then arrested later and charged. Det Con Shaun Nicholls said after the case: 'Both men preyed on a vulnerable member of our community, knowing that if they could talk their way into his good books, they would be able to con him out of money. 'For over a period of just under three years, they claimed they were doing work on his house and charging him ridiculous amounts of money. 'When the “work” was looked at by a professional, it was described as substandard at best. 'Thankfully, after an investigation, we were able to bring both men to justice and force them to face up to what they have done.'","Philip Riley and Joesph Featon charged 76-year-old customer twelve times the going rate for botched home improvements .

Fruit juice is so high in sugar it should not count as part of a healthy five-a-day diet, the Government’s obesity tsar has warned. The public should even start watering it down to wean themselves off it, said Oxford professor Dr Susan Jebb. Some brands of orange juice contain as much sugar as cola and should be taxed because of their potential effect on the nation’s health, she claimed. Experts say shoppers are now getting confusing messages about food, with a huge range of products saying they count towards a five-a-day diet. Tinned fruit, children’s drinks and even spaghetti hoops are all claiming health benefits – even though they are said to contain potentially unhealthy levels of sugar and salt. Juice drinks have been singled out as a particular concern – lacking fibre and other nutrients as well as being high in calories. Even pure fruit juice is said to contain a large amount of naturally-occurring sugar – but people end up drinking too much of it because they do not see it as unhealthy. Dr Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, said: ‘I would support taking it [fruit juice] out of the five-a-day guidance. ‘Fruit juice isn’t the same as intact fruit and it has got as much sugar as many classical sugar drinks. ‘It is also absorbed very fast, so by the time it gets to your stomach your body doesn’t know whether it’s Coca-Cola or orange juice, frankly. I have to say it is a relatively easy thing to give up. ‘Swap it and have a piece of real fruit. If you are going to drink it, you should dilute it.’ healthy choices graphic . A small carton of orange juice contains about two and a half teaspoons of sugar, while a large glass has five. A whole orange has just two teaspoons, but also contains far more fibre – about 3 grams compared to none in juice. Fruit also makes people feel fuller, helping to cut down on the need for other snacks. Dr Jebb’s comments come after health experts last week urged firms to cut the amount of sugar added to food over concerns it is becoming the ‘new tobacco’. In 2011, researchers from Leeds University and the University of Bangor also called for fruit juice to be discounted from a healthy diet. They said it gives the public a ‘sweet tooth’ and discourages them from eating fruit pieces that are far better for health. The ‘five a day’ campaign was launched by the Department of Health in 2003, with the aim of encouraging Britons to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables every day. Its guidance says smoothies and juices, plus tins of fruit and veg, can count as up to two portions. Oxford researchers have claimed that following the guidelines could prevent 15,000 deaths a year from cancer, strokes and heart disease. But surveys have found that as little as a fifth of adults and one in ten children meet the target. A poll of 2,000 adults by the World Cancer Research Fund last year  found that an average of 22 per cent of adults in England meet the five a day target. Figures ranged from 17 per cent in the North to 26 per cent in the South.","Dr Susan Jebb said public should wean themselves off certain products .

Decision: Mark Bridger, who was convicted of the murder of five-year-old April Jones, has abandoned his application for permission to appeal against his whole-life tariff . The man convicted of the murder of five-year-old April Jones has abandoned his application for permission to appeal against his whole-life tariff. Mark Bridger had planned to appeal the sentence doled out to him after he kidnapped the child before sexually abusing her, murdering her and disposing of her body. However, his decision not to appeal the court's ruling was confirmed today by the Judicial Office. The former slaughterhouse worker was given the whole-life sentence by trial judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams after he was convicted by a jury at Mold Crown Court. It was originally thought that Bridger’s appeal bid would be heard by leading judges at the Court of Appeal in London on January 24. Bridger, a father of six, snatched April near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year. Her body has never been found. Sentencing Bridger in May, Mr Justice Williams said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile, who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls.' He said Bridger abducted April for a 'sexual purpose' after he had been jilted by his girlfriend and then murdered the schoolgirl and disposed of her body to 'hide the evidence of your sexual abuse of her'. Police believe Bridger dismembered April before dumping her body parts at various locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his home in Ceinws, Mid Wales, after traces of her blood were found all over his rented cottage. The judge said: 'How you disposed of her body must remain a mystery. It will serve no purpose for me to speculate as to what happened but all the indications are that you burnt at least a part of her in the wood burner.' April's grieving family, including her parents Coral and Paul Jones, were understood to have been informed of Bridger's decision not to appeal the sentence. The had previously described Bridger as 'taunting' them with his appeal plans. Tragic: April Jones was snatched near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year. Her body has never been found . ‘He’s put us through so much. It’s like he’s taunting us, like he wants to show he’s got the upper hand,’ Mrs Jones had said. ‘It’s disgusting. He’s in prison where he belongs and he should stay there. He’s just torturing my family with these legal battles.’ Fewer than 50 other criminals in the UK have been handed sentences which mean they must spend the rest of their lives behind bars. Others serving whole-life terms include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley. On January 24 at the Court of Appeal, Lee Newell, who murdered child killer Subhan Anwar in prison, and murderer and rapist Matthew Thomas are seeking to challenge their whole-life terms. Cruel: Police believe Bridger dismembered April before dumping her body parts at various locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his home in Ceinws, Mid Wales . The test cases will be heard by a panel of five judges - Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Brian Leveson, Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Burnett. In addition, Attorney General Dominic Grieve has referred the case of Ian McLoughlin, who was given a life sentence with a tariff of 40 years for murdering a man on day release. In that case the five judges will be asked to rule on whether the 40 years can be regarded as 'unduly lenient' and should be increased. The central legal issue at the hearing before the judges will be the nature of the sentencing scheme for whole-life orders and the compatibility of such an order with the European Convention on Human Rights. Grieving: April's family, including her parents Coral and Paul Jones, were understood to have been informed of Bridger's decision not to appeal the sentence . The Government has said that whole-life tariffs are 'wholly justified in the most heinous cases'. Such terms were deemed a breach of human rights following a successful appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) by murderers Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. Last year the trio won a ruling that their whole-life sentences amount to 'inhuman and degrading treatment'. Life: Others serving whole-life terms include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley . Whole-lifers should be entitled to a review of their sentence 25 years into their term at the very latest, the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg-based court said. The ruling by 17 judges from across Europe sparked further outrage among critics of the court - despite reassurances that the decision did not amount to grounds for imminent release. Triple killer McLoughlin, 55, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey last October for stabbing a man on his first day-release from prison after 21 years in custody. When sentencing McLoughlin, the trial judge imposed a 40-year tariff, saying he could not pass a whole-life term because of the European court ruling. McLoughlin - who had killed twice before - stabbed Graham Buck, 66, as he came to the aid of a neighbour in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, last July. Newell, 44, is challenging a whole-life sentence imposed last September at Warwick Crown Court. He was convicted alongside Gary Smith for the February 2013 murder of convicted child killer Anwar in his cell at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire. Newell was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder committed in 1988. Convicted rapist Thomas was told 'life means life' after murdering a newlywed bride and then kidnapping and raping a second woman. Thomas, then 43, from Luton, pleaded guilty to the murder of Colette Magee in Luton in November 2013. He also admitted two counts of rape, one of indecent assault and one count of kidnap of the second woman.","Bridger had planned to appeal against his whole-life tariff for murder .

A primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke - but is still able to write. The woman, known only as 40-year-old M.P., developed ‘word blindness’ as a result of the stroke. The rare condition is thought to occur when the brain’s language zone is robbed of its visual inputs but remains intact. A 40-year-old primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke. However, she can still write and understand speech. Image shows an MRI of the woman's brain. The big arrow identifies the left visual cortex which is responsible for processing visual information. The small arrow shows the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres. Both have been affected by the stroke . M.P. entered her classroom one morning in October 2012 and discovered she was unable to read the names on the register. In a panic, she then turned to her lesson plans and discovered that they, too, looked like ‘hieroglyphs’. M.P. went to see the school’s head teacher who was equally baffled and sent her to stay with her mother. During the following two days, M.P. began to experience further problems. She could no longer tell the time and it took her several hours to pack a travel bag. She also started to have difficulty finding words and she became confused and anxious. Her mother took her to hospital where she was admitted and diagnosed with a stroke. Ten months after her stroke, M.P. was still unable to read but had learnt to decipher words by tracing each letter with her finger. The large arrow in the image shows a blockage in one of the arteries in M.P.'s brain. The small arrow shows constrictions and dilations in another artery . M.P. was found to be suffering from alexia without agraphia – or ‘word blindness’ – a rare condition which causes people to lose the ability to read, but without impeding their ability to write and to understand speech. The condition developed as a result of the stroke she suffered. It is believed to be caused by lesions in the brain’s ‘language zone’ and occurs when this part of the brain is robbed of its visual inputs but, otherwise, remains intact. Following the stroke, M.P. tried to teach herself to read again but her efforts were met with little success. She employed the skills she had learnt as a primary school teacher and used flashcards and writing exercises to try and improve her condition. However, her efforts failed. Determined not to give up, she discovered she could decipher a word by tracing each individual letter with her finger. Writing in the journal Neurology, her doctors explained: ‘Given a word, M.P. will direct her attention to the first letter, which she is unable to recognise. ‘She will then place her finger on the letter and begin to trace each letter of the alphabet over it in order until she recognises that she has traced the letter she is looking at. ‘“That is the letter M,” she declares, after tracing the previous 12 letters of the alphabet with her finger while deciphering a word in front of her. ‘Three letters later, she is able to shorten this exercise with a guess - “This word is mother,” she announces proudly.’ While M.P. is not able to read, some words still elicit an emotional response from her.

A study found that migraine tablets are better at easing pain if patients believe they are effective. Even dummy drugs provide more benefit if expectations are raised. The researchers behind the Harvard Medical School study of Maxalt pills said that information is as important as medication in reducing migraine pain. Placebo: The researchers said the patient receiving information is as important as the medication itself . They said: ‘One of the many implications for our findings is that when doctors set patient’s’ expectations high, Maxalt – or potentially other migraine drugs – becomes more effective. ‘Increased effectiveness means shorter migraine attacks and shorter migraine attacks mean that less medication is needed.’ The research team looked at how much headache pain 66 migraine patients suffered during an attack. They then gave them envelopes with pills to be taken during each of their next six attacks. Three of the envelopes contained Maxalt, a migraine drug used in the UK as well as the US. These were either labelled correctly, in an attempt to raise expectations, wrongly labelled as placebo, to avoid raising hope,  or marked neutrally as ‘Maxalt or placebo’. The same labelling system was used on a second three envelopes which contained placebo pills. Experiment: The patients in the survey were given six envelopes, some containing medication and other containing a placebo . This effect was especially strong if the patients thought they were taking proper pills – but even those knowingly taking a dummy pill felt better than when they took nothing. And, to the researchers’ surprise, when Maxalt was labelled as a placebo it worked no better than a dummy drug marked as being the real thing . The findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine (MUST CREDIT), add to evidence that the placebo effect –the idea that having faith in a medication increases the chances of it working - is real. Researcher Professor Ted Kaptchuk said: ‘Our discovery showing that patients’ reports of pain were nearly identical when they were told that an active drug was a placebo as when they were told that a placebo was an active drug demonstrates that the placebo effect is an unacknowledged partner for powerful pain expectations.’ With the Maxalt working less well if the patients believed it was a dummy drug, the researchers said that doctors might want to avoid stressing the possibility of side effects and other negatives to patients. However, they acknowledged that withholding information is fraught with ethical issues. It could lead to an erosion of trust between patient and doctor. The research team expect similar results would be obtained for other migraine treatments. However, the pattern may be different for conditions that appear symptomless to the patient, such as high cholesterol.","Researchers gave patients a mixture of medication and placebos .

A gene regulating our body clock may stop us piling on the pounds and could be used to create anti obesity drugs, researchers claim. Researchers found that the 'neuropeptide Y system' (NPY), may play a central role in determining how fat we become. They compared the NPY system in mice with humans and found an important difference. Radical: A gene which regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production could be used to combat obesity in humans . In humans the neurotransmitter communicates with four well-known 'cell surface receptors' in the brain (Y1, Y2, Y4 and Y5) which trigger the system's effects. However mice have an additional receptor, Y6, which has a profound effect on their body composition. It is produced in the part of the brain that regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production. Scientists may have discovered a gene which could control how fat we become . Researchers deleted the gene in mice to understand its effects on body fat. They found that mice without the Y6 gene were smaller and had less lean tissue than normal mice. On the other hand as they aged they became fatter than normal mice especially when on a high-fat diet. The mice on a high fat diet actually became obese and developed metabolic problems similar to diabetes. Although . the Y6 receptors are different in humans, the findings, published in . Cell Metabolism, could help researchers develop anti-obesity drugs in . the future. Professor Amanda . Sainsbury-Salis, from the Garvan Institute in Sydney, said: 'I find it . amazing that one gene, which is expressed in the small part of the brain . that controls the body clock, has such a profound impact on how much . fat is stored on the body, and how much lean tissue is maintained. 'Importantly, we use mice as models of human beings in research, and so when looking for anti-obesity drugs, we need to fully understand the function of the NPY system in this animal model to understand how similar circuits in humans connect with the body clock.'","Scientists find gene that regulates biorhythms also controls fat levels .

A sleeping pill prescribed to thousands of patients can increase the risk of heart attacks by up to 50 per cent, according to scientists. Research carried out among heart attack victims found that numbers were higher among those who had taken zolpidem tablets, prescribed in the UK under the name Stilnoct and in the US as Ambien. Scientists have linked taking zolpidem to an increased threat of heart attacks, and believe that taking the equivalent of 60 of the pills can increase the risk by as much as 50per cent. Risk: A study carried out among heart attack victims found that numbers were higher among those who had taken zolpidem tablets . Even taking just four pills with a dose of 35 miligrams per year increases the risk of a life-threatening cardiac episode by 20per cent. The study, which was carried out by experts at the China Medical University in Taiwan, is the first to link zolpidem with cardiovascular problems. Drug manufacturers Sanofi Inc have refuted the finding and said there are no known adverse cardiac reactions to zolpidem. Experts can not be completely sure that the pills are responsible for heart problems. However, scientists, who presented their findings at  the world’s biggest cardiology conference in Dallas, Texas, say further and wider-reaching investigations into possible side effects of the drug are required following the study of more than 5,000 people. Scientists who compared 5,000 heart attack victims with 20,000 healthy adults claimed there was a higher rate of heart attacks among those who took zolpidem. The findings, revealed at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, showed that even taking the pills sporadically can increase the risk of suffering a heart attack. 'The risk of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) was greatly increased with zolpidem exposure,' the report said, according to the Daily Express. Medication: Around five million people in Britain are prescribed z-hypnotics, including zolpidem, for insomnia every year . As part of a separate study the China Medical University scientists found that taking the equivalent of a 10mg zolpidem tablet every week can double the risk of a patient suffering a damaged aorta blood vessel. According to the scientists the medication can increase the threat of an aortic dissection, where the vital aorta blood vessel is torn with potentially fatal results as it can cause internal bleeding. In a statement Sanofi Inc said that that known adverse reactions to the drug did not include acute myocardial infarction or aortic dissection. It said: 'We stand behind the substantial body of clinical data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of zolpidem, which was first approved in France in June 1987, amounting to 26 years of real-world use and 24 billion nights of patient therapy worldwide.' Around five million people in Britain are prescribed z-hypnotics, including  zolpidem, for insomnia every year. However, there have been an increasing number of fears over their safety and it is recommended that patients should take the lowest dose possible for no more than four weeks. In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration said that the recommended dosages of zolpidem should be halved to to five . milligrams because of concerns that the medication can remain in the bloodstream for longer than initially thought. An unrelated study carried out last year showed increased rates of cancer-related deaths among people taking all varieties of sleeping pills, not just z-hypnotics.","Research carried out among heart attack victims found a higher rate among those who took the medication .

A benefits cheat claimed almost £40,000 from the public purse despite entering £27,000 worth of premium bonds in the monthly £1million prize draw. Kevin Meredith, 44, fiddled benefits for five years while his haul of bonds was entered in the ERNIE draw each month. The father-of-four, who had just short of the £30,000 maximum in premium bonds, received £34,835 in income support and £3,126 in council tax subsidies over the course of five years.

Prosecutor Gareth Evans told how when the authorities eventually caught up with Meredith, he told them: 'Usually I’m ethical but this started and I couldn’t see a way out of it. 'I couldn’t think of a way of stopping it and putting things right.' The court heard that Meredith also failed to disclose the fact he earned a further  £600 a month by renting out a property, in addition to another house that he was buying.

Recorder Jeremy Jenkins said Meredith’s cheating richly deserved an 18-month prison sentence. However, he said that, for the sake of Meredith's young son and his elderly parents, it would be suspended for two years. He also ordered him to carry out 180 hours unpaid community work and pay £1,740 costs. Recorder Jenkins said: 'The benefit system is there for those in need not for people to abuse.

Scientists believe studying the bones of the Elephant Man could give clues about the abnormal cell growth that causes cancer . Studying the Elephant Man’s bones could give clues about the causes of cancer, experts believe. Scientists think his skeleton could shed light on abnormal cell growth and its causes. This could reveal why cells start to grow out of control causing tumours. Previously, attempts to study the bones of the Elephant Man, whose real name was Joseph Carey Merrick, failed. This was because DNA could not be extracted from the bones as they had been cleaned with bleach. However, new techniques have now allowed testing to resume, the BBC reports. It is hoped this research will finally clear up the mystery of exactly what caused his disfigurement and that it could also give clues about other diseases, such as cancer. Professor Richard Trembath, of Queen Mary University of London, where the bones are stored, told the BBC that the underlying genetic problem responsible for tissue overgrowth in the Elephant Man could also reveal clues to how a cell grows, and how it knows when it should stop growing. He said: 'While I wouldn’t predict that Merrick is sitting on the cure for cancer, it is through studies of this nature that we will have a better understanding of what it is that determines how a cell moves from a normal state, into this abnormal process of disregular cell growth.’ Joseph Carey Merrick was born in 1862 in Leicester. He began to develop disfiguring tumours before he reached the age of two and his condition deteriorated rapidly. It left him unable to work meaning he had to enter a workhouse, but he was so desperate to escape the workhouse that he moved to London and participated in an act called 'the Elephant Man, Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant'. When public opinion turned against the idea of freak shows, Mr Merrick moved to live at the London Hospital. He died unexpectedly in 1890 at the age of 27. Previous attempts to study DNA from the bones failed because the skeleton was cleaned with bleach. Image shows Joesph Merrick's bones being put through a CT scanner . It is still not known for sure what caused his disfigurement but it is thought that he had Proteus syndrome. This is a condition which causes the atypical growth of the bones and skin and is more common in men than women. Its cause is unknown but it can cause gigantism of the limbs, increased organ size, rough skin, tumours and life-threatening blood clots.","Studying Joseph Carey Merrick's skeleton could reveal why cells sometimes start to grow out of control causing cancerous tumours .

Magma in the depths of a super-volcano will eventually burst out like a beach ball held under water, scientists have said. Such a scenario would cause a massive eruption that could happen sooner rather than later and more frequently than previously thought. Swiss researchers have simulated 1.2 . million eruptions to work out the change in pressure required to cause a super-volcano to blow its top, New Scientist reported. Magma in the depths of a super-volcano will eventually burst out like a beach ball held under water, scientists have said. Such a scenario would cause a massive eruption that could happen sooner rather than later and more frequently than previously thought, they warned. A standard volcanic eruption is pictured . Super-volcanoes can eject more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of material at once, covering a continent in ash, but the last time this happened was around 75,000 years ago. These rare events represent the biggest natural catastrophes on Earth except for the impact of giant meteorites. Normal volcanic eruptions are powered by magma entering the volcanic chamber, which increases pressure building up inside and leads to an explosion. However, super-volcanoes’ much larger chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters. Super-volcanoes' large chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters. A super volcano of the magnitude of the eruption that happened 600,000 years ago that shaped Yellowstone Park (pictured) could lead to a 10°C drop in temperature across the globe for 10 years . To find out the pressure change and flow of new lava needed to trigger a super-volcano eruption, a team led by Luca Caricchi of the University of Geneva in Switzerland simulated 1.2 million eruptions. Their model showed that the chamber is gradually filled with magma, which is less dense than the cooler crust around it, but it eventually bursts though the top in a dramatic eruption. Professor Caricchi believes that scientists could estimate the risk of a blast by monitoring the magma in super-volcanoes. The research predicts that a super eruption will occur between 10 and 100 times more often than previously estimated. Another study, by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich recreated these conditions in a lab to see what it takes to trigger a super-volcano explosion. They squeezed silicates to pressures of 36,000 atmospheres and heating them to temperatures of almost 1,700 °C to do this. A super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1992 (pictured), which was 100 times weaker than the a super-volcano eruption, decreased the global temperature by 0.4°C for a few months . Super-volcanoes represent the biggest natural catastrophes on Earth except for the impact of giant meteorites. Scientists . from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, have discovered . that the spontaneous eruption of a super-volcano could be driven solely . by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger. Super-volcanoes . have a much larger magma chamber and are always located in areas where . the heat flow from the interior of the Earth to the surface is very . high. Consequently the magma chamber’s shape changes as it fills with . hot magma, allowing the pressure to dissipate so that the . super-volcanoes don’t erupt very often. But an extra pressure caused by different densities of solid rock and liquid magma could cause an eruption. The . researchers’ measurements showed the pressure resulting from the . different densities of rock and magma could crack more than 10km of . the Earth’s crust above the chamber. The silicates became less dense than solid rocks at the surface so that large volumes of them could breach the crust, just as Professor Caricchi’s team suggested. Wim Malfait, who led the Zurich research said: ‘They come more or less to the same conclusion – that buoyancy is the only real trigger that can work in very large magma chambers.’ He said that super-volcano eruptions may occur spontaneously, driven only by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger, according to the study published in Nature Geosciences. A super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1992, which was 100 times weaker than the well-known super-volcano eruption that occurred 600,000 years ago in what is now Yellowstone National Park, decreased the global temperature by 0.4°C for a few months. The predictions for a super volcano are a fall in temperatures by 10°C across the world for 10 years. However, eruptions only take place every 100,000 years or so and Dr Malfait said: It's not something that we should worry about in our personal lives.","The University of Geneva in Switzerland simulated 1.2 million eruptions to work out the pressure change required to cause a super volcano to explode .

Do you struggle with the concept of washing your hands in a public toilet and then having to open the door? If the idea makes your skin crawl and conjures up images of bacteria-riddled door handles contaminating your newly clean hands, a new invention could be for you. An entrepreneur from Essex has imported to the UK a device which allows people to open doors with their feet. Mick Janaway will start selling StepNpull in the UK on Monday. StepNpull is a metal device which screws onto the bottom of a door allowing a person to put their foot on it and drag the door open . Mick Janaway brought StepNpull over from the U.S. and will launch it on Monday. The simple metal contraption can be screwed onto the bottom of a door, allowing a person to place their foot on it and pull the door open. Mr Janaway believes it could prevent the spread of disease and infection. He came across the device in America after he caught an infection that nearly caused him to lose his arm. In August 2012 he contracted an infection in a small cut on his right thumb. It travelled up his arm and infected his bloodstream with strep A – a group of bacteria which are usually found on the surface of the skin and inside the throat. StepNpull will be sold online for £40 - Mr Janaway hopes it will help to stop the spread of infection and disease . Mr Janaway became interested in devices which help prevent the spread of bacteria after he picked up an infection which nearly cost him his life . Mr Janaway said: ‘I had four life-saving operations to save my arm and life – at one point I even stopped breathing on the operating table.’ If strep A bacteria penetrate into the tissues and organs of the body it can trigger what is known as an invasive infection. This can cause sepsis - an infection of the blood that causes a high temperature, rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing. Invasive strep A infection is viewed as a medical emergency and requires admission to hospital. Mr Janaway said: ''It was in Colorado that my life changed forever with the discovery of StepNpull. The minute I saw it, I was hooked. I just couldn't believe how simple it was and that nobody had done it before' The patient has to be treated with antibiotics and may also require surgery to remove damaged tissue. One in four people who develop and invasive strep A infection die from it. As a result of his near-death experience, Mr Janaway planned a list of trips to take with his family. He said: ‘It was there in Colorado that my life changed forever with the discovery of StepNpull. ‘The minute I saw it, I was hooked.

A group of retail stores including Marks & Spencer, Selfridges and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group of shops have said that a decision to apply Sunday trading hours to the Sunday before Christmas would be 'ridiculous'. The stores have argued that Sunday will be a crucial trading day this year as Christmas Day falls on a Tuesday and many people leave their shopping until the last minute. Plea: Retailers are pleading with the Government to relax Sunday trading laws on December 23 . Trader: Supermarket giant Tesco is among the high street names asking the Government to relax Sunday trading hours over Christmas (file picture) Relaxing the hours will leave stores less packed and make for a more pleasant shopping experience for customers, say the retailers. The trading laws were successfully relaxed during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London earlier this year. Sir Philip Green told the Daily Express: 'Extended trading in this instance would give a welcome boost to our high street retailers immediately prior to the biggest gift-giving day of the year.' A spokesman for supermarket giant Tesco added: 'We know our customers appreciated the extra flexibility on a Sunday around the Olympics and would not be opposed to seeing this repeated, for example around Christmas.' Beneficial: Sir Philip Green, head of the Arcadia group of stores, said that relaxing trading laws on December 23 would give retailers a welcome boost . Sainsbury's said that while it is not suggesting a permanent extension to Sunday hours, it is backing a temporary relaxation for December 23, while Asda have written to the Government asking them for clarity on trading hours for that day. Chief executive of the UK's fourth largest supermarket chain Morrisons Dalton Philips said that his company's stores will see 2.5million customers through their doors in six hours between 10am and 6pm - the current Sunday trading limits. He said: 'We're not asking for 24 hour shopping - we're only asking for an extra two or three hours.' A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that the Government will not be giving in to the retailer's pleas. Splurge: But researchers found presents only account for around half of the Christmas spend . Parents are spending an average of £1,056.82 on their Christmas shopping this year - working out as a hefty five per cent of their salary, a new study has revealed. Leading online retailer Littlewoods.com worked out that the combination of buying gifts for every member of the family and immediate friends was almost doubled by the ‘Christmas shopping experience’ outlays such as parking, visiting Santa and food and drink. Their poll showed the average parent intends on spending £551.28 on Christmas presents this year, one third of which being allocated to their children and a further sixth to their own parents.. But despite the average present spend totalling £551.28, it is in fact eight per cent down on last year - which a similar poll in 2011 calculated as being £592.26. Yet Littlewoods.com found the presents’ cost was only half of the Christmas spend - as 93 per cent of parents do not even factor into their budget the expense of impulse buys, travel, parking and petrol, and food and drink while out on the High Street, which worked out as an additional £505.54. With the average British parent expecting to shop seven times to gather all their gifting goods - these additional costs all add up. The additional costs of Christmas present shopping (during the entire festive period) are Food and drink - £178.78; Travel and transport - £133.70; Impulse buys - £110.67; Santa’s Grotto - £45.50 and Christmas donations - £36.89, making a total of £505.54. The £551.28 present spend added to the Christmas shopping expenses cost of £505.54 makes an average UK total of £1,056.82. Coming out on top were those in Sheffield racking up a total of £1,173.43, closely followed by those in Birmingham spending £1,158.05. Other regional big spenders are London - £1,110.14; Manchester - £1,009.27 and Luton - £1,05,75Gary Kibble, Brand Director at Littlewoods.com, said: 'With pennies stretched this year, it’s more important than ever for mums and dads to keep track of where their hard-earned cash is being spent. 'Additional extras can soon mount up without putting further strain on the gifting budget and with 24 days to go, the pressures of Christmas for the nation~s mums are starting to be felt. 'At Littlewoods.com we want to help our customers make Christmas as magical as possible with the ease and convenience of shopping from home and avoidance of hidden extras.' Research - carried out by One Poll in November 2012. - also found how much we spend on our relatives at Yuletide - for example £202.93 was being blown on our children; £57.50 on mum; £51.75 on dad; £36.90 in total on our grandparents and £28.20 on our mother-in-law. The Office of National Statistics last year revealed that the average full-time working female earns £22,900 per annum.

'It feels brilliant': Melissa has dropped to 10st 5lb and now wears a dress size 10 . When she was six, she suffered with joint pain and had arthritis in the knee, which made running around at school and joining in with games difficult. As she became more overweight, her school uniform had to be specially made for her, fuelling cruel taunts from her classmates. By the time she was 13, Melissa had to leave school to be taught at home as she couldn't cope with normal day-to-day life. Melissa felt trapped in a vicious circle; the fatter she became the more she ate to try and comfort herself. 'I couldn't break the cycle and I was getting bigger and bigger by the day,' she said. In September 2011 Melissa suffered a suspected stroke which resulted in her spending her 21st birthday waiting for an MRI scan, rather than enjoying her special day. 'I think it was a warning, it was like my body was shutting down,' she said. After her health scare, and making the devastating discovery that her long-term boyfriend had been cheating on her, Melissa decided to action about her weight. Weighing in at 21st 13lb and at size 28, her weight yo-yoed until she found support from fellow dieters at her local Rosemary Conley classes. With diet and excerise she has dropped to 10st 5lb and now wears a dress size 10. She revealed: 'It feels brilliant to be able to dress the way every woman in her 20s wants to dress - I can even fit into a size 8 in some clothes which I still have trouble believing!'

Special day: Regina and Thomas Jeglum decided to marry on Christmas day after he came out of a months-long coma . Dangerous job: Jeglum fell from a telecommunications tower while performing maintenance work on it . Jeglum is a telecommunications tower climber. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration rates his as 'the most dangerous job in America,' and ranks it as more deadly than logging and fishing. Workers climb hundreds of feet to replace antennas and do general maintenence on telecommunications towers. As cell phone networks expand, tower climbers are in high demand. At least 10 tower climbers have died this year from falls while on the job. Jeglum, 24, had been climbing towers for six weeks when he fell while working on an AT&T job in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Family man: Jeglum with his two children who were almost left fatherless by his terrifying fall . Close call: Doctors say people with injuries like the ones Jeglum sustained often do not awaken from their comas . He had received training through his employer, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., but 'he should have never been on any tower,' Regina Jeglum told the Wall Street Journal in August. Jeglum fell after he attached his harness to a part of the tower that couldn't support his weight. Tommy Jeglum is able to sit up, eat and speak to his wife and two children.

George Osborne has slapped down Vince Cable over his warning that house price rises mean Britain risks ‘repeating the mistakes of Gordon Brown’. The Chancellor dismissed the Business Secretary's criticisms and told the Cabinet that while the property market is rebounding ‘relatively quickly’ in London, there is little evidence of rapid increases elsewhere. Mr Osborne insisted ministers should be . reassuring voters that the coalition’s reforms mean that the Bank of . England has taken back responsibility to step in and deflate any . unsustainable house price bubble. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured in Downing Street today, has grown increasingly frustrated with outbursts from Business Secretary Vince Cable . Senior Liberal Democrats claim that . the Chancellor is prepared to see the housing market overheat in the . run-up to the 2015 general election, boosting economic confidence and . increasing the chances of a Conservative election victory. But . Government sources told MailOnline that Mr Osborne dismissed Mr Cable’s . warnings at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting. ‘In London prices are going up . relatively rapidly but in many parts of the country that’s simply not . the case,’ said one. ‘The Bank of England now has responsibility to look at house prices and intervene if it thinks it necessary.’ Another . source said: ‘Of course the Government has to be vigilant about any . kind of imbalance, not just in terms of housing. That’s what we have . reformed financial regulation in the way that we have. ‘Vince . and others should be out there making a virtue of the fact that we are . the Government that has given the Bank that power.’ Tougher affordability checks are coming into force following a review of the mortgage market by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. This will mean banks and building societies being required to do new ‘stress tests’ on borrowers to ensure they will still be able to afford their loans if interest rates go up. Mr Cable has spent the day at the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing at the University of Strathclyde . Figures show that house prices last month experienced their biggest monthly rise for more than four years. The . average cost of a home rose by 8.4 per cent last year, according to the . Nationwide building society. Despite the rises, the average cost of a . home, at £175,826, is still five per cent below its pre-financial crisis . peak in 2007. UK house . prices are set to rise by as much as a further eight per cent in 2014, . according to the most optimistic forecasts by economists and property . professionals. Last week Mr . Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, opened up another split . in the coalition as he described house price increases as a ‘worrying’ development that could threaten the economy. ‘The . Government has done really good work turning the economy around: we . can’t now risk it being derailed by a housing bubble repeating the . mistakes of Gordon Brown,’ Mr Cable said. Under Mr Osborne’s changes to Labour’s failed regulatory system, the Bank also has the power to rein in schemes such as Help to Buy and to demand that lenders limit mortgage borrowing. It has already scaled back the mortgage element of the Funding for Lending scheme, offering cheap credit, to focus on business lending. The Bank has held rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 and flooded billions into the financial system to keep borrowing costs down. With the economy now recovering, there is increasing speculation about when the Bank will start raising rates, with most expecting the first small increase next year.","Chancellor says ministers should reassure voters about property market .

Scroll down for video . Heading home: Former US basketball player Dennis Rodman arrives at Beijing International Airport from North Korea.  Rodman returned to China from Pyongyang after a seven-day trip where he sang Happy birthday to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un on January 8 . Apology:  Dennis Rodman said Monday that he's 'sorry' about the situation inside North Korea, but that his recent visit there with a team of fellow former NBA players was an attempt to do something good . The 52-year-old angered many people in the United States with an interview last week in which he implied that Kenneth Bae, a U.S. missionary imprisoned by North Korea, was to blame for his incarceration rather than authorities there.

Rodman was met by a throng of media as he made his way, flanked by burly bodyguards, through the airport terminal to a waiting car. 'I want to tell people that no matter what's going on in the world, for one day, just one day, not politics, not all this stuff,' he said. 'I'm not the president, I'm not an ambassador, I'm Dennis Rodman, just an individual, just showing the world a fact that we can actually get along and be happy for one day.'

Nestled in the north-east corner of the county, residents of Hart have the longest life expectancy in the country - 82.9 years for men, compared with the UK average, 79 - and are considered the UK's healthiest. People earn an average £843 a week compared with the national average of £616, and the employment rate in the area is 80 per cent - nine percentage points higher than the national average.

The region, which is centred around the town of Fleet, described as ‘a step back in time’, has 84 square-miles of green wooded landscape and Hampshire’s largest freshwater lake. But Hart residents do pay for their quality of life – with the average house price costing seven times the annual local wage – much higher than the UK average multiple, 5.8 times. Uttlesford in Essex, which came in second place, also has an average house price-to-earnings ratio of seven. Placed at number six a year ago, the district performed particularly well with its 84 per cent employment rate and weekly average earnings of £819.

Hart residents do pay for their quality of life, with the average house price costing seven times the local salary . The area is centred around the town of Fleet, which has been described as 'a step back in time' The Halifax quality of life survey, which looks at a wide range of factors such as health and life expectancy, crime rates, weather, employment and the performance of local schools. The local government district of Hart, named after the river that runs through it, is an area renowned for its quality of life. While its main town, Fleet, may be most famous for its service station, it has produced some great sporting names. Golfer Justin Rose, tennis player John Feaver and motor racing driver Jeremy Metcalfe all have ties to the area. In addition, a Sport England survey found Hart to be the fifth most active district in the country, with more than a quarter of people exercising three times a week. As well as the high income associated with the area, this sporting prowess may go some way to explaining the average high life expectancy. There are believed to be around 85,000 residents in the area, which has a Conservative-controlled council. Fleet, which is 37 miles south-west of London, has also produced actresses Juliet Aubrey and Raquel Cassidy. Nowhere in Wales or Northern Ireland made the top 50 list, but Scotland scraped in with the Orkney Islands placed at number 50. Just one area of London was included, with the City of London in 38th position. This year saw several big climbers into the top ten list of districts with the best quality of life, mainly because Halifax has started taking into account new Office for National Statistics (ONS) research into personal wellbeing. South Northamptonshire soared up 27 places to the third spot, Rushcliffe in Nottingham shot up from number 22 last year to seven and Winchester, which was placed at number 34 in 2012, is now in ninth place. The new ONS research also helped to push Uttlesford into second place. It revealed that adults in Uttlesford believe, more than anywhere else in the UK, that what they do in life is worthwhile, scoring 8.4 out of 10 on this measure. Continuing a trend, the South East dominated the top 50 list, claiming almost half of it, with a total of 24 mentions. Meanwhile, the East of England claimed 12 of the places. Southern areas tend to score more highly for weekly earnings, weather, health and life expectancy while the North fares well on education and lower house prices in relation to earnings. Uttlesford came second in the list, with an 84 per cent employment rate and weekly average earnings of £819 . Nowhere in Wales or Northern Ireland made the top 50 list, but Scotland scraped in with the Orkney Islands . Researchers found that employment is highest in Northamptonshire, at 88.9 per cent. The highest weekly average earnings are in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea at £1,323. Meanwhile, the biggest homes are in Uttlesford, Chiltern, South Buckinghamshire and Rutland, which all have an average of 6.4 habitable rooms. The smallest homes are all in central London - in the City of London, Tower Hamlets and Westminster. All these London areas have less than four habitable rooms on average. A total of 100 per cent of homes in East Ayrshire, Scotland, were found to have central heating, compared with the average of 96 per cent. The Orkney Islands has the lowest burglary rate at one per 10,000 people. Just one area of London was included, with the City of London in 38th position in the top-50 list . Castle Point in Essex has the lowest average annual rainfall at 20in (508mm), while the Isle of Wight was named as the sunniest place in the UK. Isle of Wight residents enjoy 37.4 hours of sunshine a week, compared with the national average of 29.7 hours. Martin Ellis, an economist at Halifax, said: 'The old adage of ""health, wealth and happiness"" is the traditional measure of a good quality of life. 'For the third year running Hart has delivered against a range of indicators to demonstrate its residents have the best quality of life in the UK.' The Windsor and Maidenhead district came 14th .

Britain's first female warship commander is preparing to lead the HMS Portland on a six-month patrol in the Atlantic on the hunt for enemy submarines. In 2012, Sarah West became the first woman to be put in charge of a British warship in the navy's 500 year history, and says she is proud to be at the front of defending our waters from the threat of submarines. However, the 41-year-old says that the high-octane job comes at a personal cost, revealing that the years spent away at sea mean she is still single. Sarah West stands proudly on HMS Portland as the Royal Navy's first female commander of a warship. She joined the navy after getting bored with her nine to five job as a trainee manager. The ban on women working on . submarines was only lifted in 2011 and Cdr West described her . appointment to take command of HMS Portland as the highlight of her 16 . years in the navy. However, she plays down her role in being on the frontline of helping to maintain a ring of steel around the British coastline. 'I'm not reinventing the wheel,' she told the Mirror. 'Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. It's just that I happen to be newsworthy at the moment.' As much as she enjoys the thrilling nature of her job, she admits that it has not made it easy to meet a partner. 'There are drawbacks. Years at sea probably explains why I'm single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.' She says plenty of men and women on board are missing seeing their children grow up, which makes it crucial to keep morale high. Cdr Sarah West looks through binoculars as the HMS Portland hunts a submarine in the Cumbrae Gap, Scotland. Now she is in charge of an 185-strong crew whom she leads in trying to out outmaneouvre their underwater enemies. 'Anti-submarine warfare is the military . version of chess. You must work out what the enemy is going to do before . they even think of it,' says Cdr West who is captain of HMS Portland, a . Type 23 frigate with submarine-hunting kit, Sea Wolf and Harpoon . missiles, Stingray torpedoes and a Lynx attack helicopter. They have recently been running a training exercise to catch the submarine HMS . Triumph, which bombed Libya in 2011 and now trains future Royal Navy . captain.' There is no sign of the submarine despite sending a helicopter to dip a sonar wire into the sea where it is suspected to be. But . suddenly a periscope is spotted several miles away, sparking Cdr West . into action, who shouts orders for HMS Portland to move in on the sub . and prepares for the similated launch of three Stingray torpedoes. 'Today has been a good day for submarine hunting,' says Cdr West. 'Many more countries have submarines now so there's always a threat out there. What we're doing is really important.' Commander West oversees the hunt for the submarine in the ship's operations room. 'You can have state-of-the-art kit but, without well-trained people wanting to use it, you're useless.' The ship is set to leave HM Naval Base Devonport in Plymouth for six months on patrol in the Atlantic. The crew will face threats from storms, with gale-force winds whipping up waves as high as 40ft. Warships sit high in the water for speed and cannot turn away from a storm for comfort when they have to sail somewhere urgently. Many of those suffering from seasickness will be forced to vomit into buckets while on watch. They are facing testing times as Russia is understood to be on the verge of completing a Â£1.25 billion K-329 Severodvinsk nuclear-powered submarine which could give it a crucial underwater advantage.","Navy's first female warship commander prepares to lead patrol in Atlantic .

An elderly multimillionaire hid the death of his mother from the government for more than two decades so he could cash her Social Security checks. Raymond O’Dell, 70, of both Washington and Arizona, pocketed more than $200,000 in benefits over 23 years of lies, he was sentenced to six months in prison during a Monday hearing. He did not notify authorities of his mother's death, and since the various government agencies involved do not sync their computer systems, the con artist was not caught until the state began an operation to cross-reference several cases, a U.S. Attorney's Office spokesperson told MailOnline. Taco tycoon: Raymond O'Dell owns several Taco Bell franchises in the Seattle area . O’Dell’s net worth of just under $4million did not stop him from accepting checks intended for his dead mother, prosecutors charged. The swindler is also expected to plead . guilty later this month to charges he stole about $100,000 from the Ohio . Public Employees Retirement System, according to court documents cited a . Seattle Post-Intelligencer report. He accumulated his wealth through ownership of multiple Burger King and Taco Bell franchises in the Seattle area, as well as shrewd real estate investments. ‘Social Security fraud cases often involve genuinely impoverished persons who steal to improve an otherwise desperate existence,’ U.S. Attorney Seth Wilkinson said in court papers. ‘While those circumstances do not excuse theft from social programs, they mitigate the crime. ‘Here, however, (O’Dell) has had a lucrative business career as the owner of fast food restaurants and real estate,’ Mr Wilkinson continued. The septuagenarian’s lawyer argued that he was broke when the scheme began, and that he saw the money as a way to provide for his family well getting back on his feet. Fast food royalty: He also owns more than one Burger King in the region . Mr O’Dell was ‘a desperate, but good man, who saw an opportunity to provide for his family’s health in 1989, when he was at his lowest point, and took it,’ said defense attorney Laurence Finegold. ‘Like making a deal with the devil, however, once that decision was made there was no way out for Mr. O’Dell,’ the lawyer claimed, saying that to stop taking the checks would out the millionaire as a fraud. He was further enabled through a lack of inter-agency cooperation among Social Security, law enforcement and other government entities. The . agencies began working together last year to cross-reference deaths and . benefit recipients. He had no choice but to come clean when an . investigator asked to speak with his mother, the spokesperson added. His is one of a number of similar cases brought to court in the last year, according to the spokesperson. The con artist is originally from Seattle, but recently moved to Arizona to retire with his long-time wife, potential prison time puts a serious crimp in those plans. Mr Finegold argued that paying back the ill-gotten gains will almost completely drain the more than $431,000 authorities say the retirees have in cash while leaving him likely unable to draw his own Social Security benefits. Shrewd investor: This is one of many homes owned by the convicted swindler . Entrepreneur: Another one of the several homes owned by Mr O'Dell, he'll soon be cooling his heels in prison . Mr O’Dell requested though his attorney that he be allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest, and for only 120 days, plus 200 hours of community service. He instead received six months in prison, followed by six months of house arrest, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. He will also be placed under three years supervision and has been ordered to pay $188,436.74 restitution, plus another $20,000 in fines. His declining health was cited as the main reason for the request. Authorities were not swayed. ‘The community needs to see that theft of public money on this scale results in prison time proportionate to the scale of the theft,' said Mr Wilkinson. The fast food franchisee is scheduled to be sentenced Monday for his first plea deal. The exact timing of his second plea deal has not yet been determined.","Raymond O'Dell, 70, is worth just under $4million .

Inquest: Alistair Bell who was shot dead by police officer after an armed seige where he shot and wounded a police officer . A gunman fired 34 bullets before he was fatally shot in the head by a police officer, an inquest has heard. Three unarmed police officers went to the home of Alistair Bell, 42, in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to arrest him when the man opened fire. One was wounded. Firearms officers were then deployed to the address in the village of Kirkheaton as Mr Bell continued to fire shots out of windows. He was gunned down at around 5am the following morning. He was taken to hospital and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The jury heard the man fired a total of 34 shots throughout the night - meaning he must have reloaded four times. Mr Bell was not licensed to own the pistol or a second unused firearm which was later recovered from the house. The inquest heard a 'significant' amount . of anabolic steroids was found in Mr Bell’s system on toxicological . examination - with a small number of the population susceptible to . 'irrational' or 'aggressive' behaviour from heavy use. The inquest at Bradford Crown Court is expected to continue for four weeks. Outlining the case West Yorkshire Coroner Neil Cameron said: 'You will have to determine in what circumstances arising out of that incident the deceased came by his death.' He said that police went to Mr Bell’s home on the evening of December 27 after a complaint made to them by a man who had a 'long-running dispute' with him. Ian and Amanda Davidson, claimed Mr Bell had made threats of violence to them. Three unarmed officers were deployed. Mr Davidson told police that it was a four-year disagreement between the former friends. He said Mr Bell assaulted him with an axe on one occasion and he had a resulting scar to his head. Mr Davidson claimed that threats had been made to his wife and children and he thought it was 'a real threat.' Mr Bell was said to have a known history of violence, jurors were told. One male police constable 'cautiously' entered the house after Mr Bell opened and then shut his front door. Mr Cameron said: 'Mr Bell was in the house. He opened the door briefly and then shut it again. 'One of the officers opened it and stepped in the house. He saw Alistair Bell inside holding a pistol and pointing at him.' The officer told the . inquest he was considering using his Taser but his 'blood ran cold' when . he saw Mr Bell standing in the living room doorway with a gun pointed . at him. 'I thought he was (either) going to shoot me now or I was getting out of here. He told me to ‘f*** off’, and I did. 'I ran out and shouted ‘Firearm, gun’ to one of my colleagues.' Location: Police surround the West Yorkshire house of Bell shortly after the man was shot dead . He described 'a chaotic scene' as he heard gunshots which prompted officers to run from the house. He later saw that a . colleague, known as Pc A in the proceedings, had been shot and was . sitting conscious on the ground near a bus shelter. In a statement read out to the court, Pc A said he ran away from outside the house when his colleague shouted the gun warning. He said he initially crouched behind a 4ft wall before he decided to run for better cover to a property facing opposite. 'I started to run and I heard a cracking sound. I felt something hit my back,' he said. He managed to reach the opposite house where a female colleague confirmed he had been shot. Scene: Bell  is said to have used this window to fire bullet at police officers . Pc A, who was wearing body armour, was treated for a wound near to his right shoulder blade. He said he felt 'extremely lucky' that he did not receive more serious injuries. Pc A said he did not see who fired the shot or the direction it came from. Armed officers were then sent and surrounded the house, the coroner continued. During the night Mr Bell fired a number of shots out of the window and he also made a number of phone calls and sent text messages to family members and friends, as well as a police negotiator. The inquest heard Mr Bell eventually came downstairs and was shot by an officer who fired three rounds from a carbine. One hit him in the crown of the head, which penetrated his brain, and another struck him to the left lower chest. 'The precise circumstances in which they were fired, what the officers saw and what Alistair Bell was doing, we shall hear about when the officers give evidence,' Mr Cameron said. He added: 'Alistair Bell appeared to have fired a total of 34 shots from a pistol which meant he must have reloaded at least four times. 'Many of those appear to have been fired out of windows through curtains and blinds, or from positions where it was not possible to identify any specific targets.' The only shots fired by the police were the three from the one officer, the jury was told. The hearing continues tomorrow.","Alistair Bell, 42, opened fire on unarmed officers who knocked on his door .

It took crews an entire night using an intricate pulley system to right the ship from where it ran aground . Ports are now fighting over the right to dismantle the cruise liner, a contract which could be worth Â£200m . The wreck is due to be removed in June after an unprecedented operation to right the 115 tonne boat . In the coming months, a total of 30 giant tanks will be affixed to both sides of the Concordia to float it off the false seabed where it is resting, so it can be towed to a port to be dismantled for scrap. Five Italian ports are vying for the contract, but ports in Turkey, France and even China have also submitted bids.

However, Binalakshmi Nepram, founder of the Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network, strongly objected to the weapon, which is made by the Indian Ordnance Factory (IOF) in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, an arm of the country’s Ministry of Defence. She told The Independent that it was ‘an abhorrence to [the Delhi student’s] memory’. She added: ‘Our work over the past 10 years has shown that if a woman involved in an incident has a gun on her person she is 12 times more likely to be killed.’ The .32 bore gun costs R122,360 (£1,203) – or roughly a third of the average yearly salary for an Indian worker. It’s made from titanium-alloy and IOF says it’s already had about 80 formal enquiries about it.

A crime novelist's Porsche was destroyed by arsonists in an attack that was similar to one of his storylines. Andrew Towning believes the offender was inspired to set fire to his £18,000 Porsche Carrera outside his Dorset home after reading one of his crime-thriller novels. The blaze caused a small explosion and sent flames 10ft into the air. Torched: A crime novelist's £18,000 Porsche was set alight by arsonists, pictured. The attack was similar to one of the writer's storylines in book Shroud of Concealment . Burnt: The car was parked outside Andrew Towning's home in Merley, Dorset when it was set alight . In his 2010 book Shroud of Concealment, lead character Jake Dillon has his own Porsche 911 car blown up in the street after being targeted by a underworld crime gang. Now Mr Towning fears he has been singled out by one of his readers following the attack at his home in Merley, near Wimborne, Dorset. He wrote on his Facebook page: 'Some of you may know that myself and my family were subject to an horrific arson attack. 'In terms of the attack it bears uncanny resemblance to some of the incidents in my Dillon crime thrillers. Damage: The blaze caused a small explosion which also damaged the author's wife's mini, pictured . Destroyed: One of the writer's daughters Eloise looks at the damage. The author said he was 'gutted' at the 'malicious' attack . 'In terms of my real life, it is shocking, however the police are following up numerous leads, and are confident that they will find those responsible imminently. 'I will not allow this to intrude upon my family life or the Dillon series.' He added: 'In my third book, the Shroud of Concealment, the lead character had his Porsche blown up in the street. 'I’m gutted, absolutely gutted that someone had the malicious nature to do it. I worked very hard to get that car and it is a car I would have kept forever.' Response: The author took to social media to express his concern about the copycat attack . Investigation: Police are looking in to the cause of the blaze and are appealing for witnesses . Concern: The family say the car was the novelists 'pride and joy' and were in 'pristine condition' The arson attack also caused damage to Mr Towning’s wife’s Mini Cooper car. Petrol was also thrown over his daughter’s Audi TT car parked in the drive. The writer's daughter Harriet, 24, said: 'We think it was a copycat attack because lots of Porsches are blown up in my dad’s books. 'If it was a targeted attack then the person has chosen the thing he loves the most. It was his pride and joy and was in pristine condition.' Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses who saw a man carrying a green petrol canister running away from the property. An exceptionally valuable Vermeer painting, stolen from a museum in Boston by art thieves, turns up in the private collection of the rich and powerful Charlie Hart. Former army intelligence officer Jake Dillion investigates the crime - in a hope that his connections in the underworld will lead him to the gang. But after a heated conversation with Mr Hart - where the officer not so subtly asks him where he got the painting - all hell breaks loose and his beloved Porsche 911 is blown up. More worryingly, though, is that a contract is put out on him, his lawyer girlfriend and anyone he associates with. But despite the threats, the officer begins to peel away the layers of a world of organised crime, gangs and even an unsolved heist that took place 25 years previously.","Novelist's £18,000 Porsche destroyed by arsonists outside home in Dorset .

It is often said by sports fans that they would move heaven and earth to ensure victory for their team. But on Saturday the earth literally moved for fans of the Seattle Seahawks as they celebrated a fourth quarter touchdown by Marshawn Lynch in the playoffs against the New Orleans Saints. Three seismographs set up around the CenturyLink Field stadium measured tremors which scientist think could be equivalent to a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake. Earthquake: Fans of the Seattle Seahawks managed to cause a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake while celebrating a fourth quarter Marshawn Lynch touchdown . Star player: Lynch ran in two touchdowns during the playoff game against the New Orleans Saints but it was his second 32-yard score which nearly brought the house down . Experts from The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network say the shaking could have been greater than the famous Beast Quake in 2011 which happened after another Lynch touchdown, but they will not know for sure for a few days. On that occasion a seismograph placed a block away from the stadium picked up the impact after Lynch ran in a 67-yard score, also against the Saints. Lynch's touchdown yesterday sealed a 23-15 win for the top-seeded Seahawks which puts them through to the NFL championship game for only the second time in the franchise's history. Running back Lynch also scored in the first half with a 15-yard touchdown, running a total of 140 yards during the game, while Steven Hauschka kicked three field goals. Scientists from The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network measured the crowd tremor on three seismographs around the stadium and tweeted the results .

The Saints scored two fourth quarter touchdowns, including this one by Khiry Robinson, but it was too little to late to save them from defeat . While the Seahawks offence ran riot, their defence was equally impressive, keeping the Saints off of the scoreboard until the fourth quarter. New Orleans flourished late, with two fourth quarter touchdowns, but it was too little too late. The Seahawks will be looking to bring the noise again this Sunday against the san Fransisco 49ers, who beat the Carolina Panthers 23-10. Four sacks on Panthers quarterback cam Newtown and two one-yard stops ensured a trip to Seattle for the 49ers who are hoping for a return trip to the Superbowl where they were beaten by the Baltimore Ravens last year by just three points.","Seahawks fans caused a miniature earthquake during yesterday's game .

If you want an example of a club lost in its own deluded world of self-importance, I give you Queens Park Rangers, ladies and gentlemen. After watching their well-paid . internationals get absolutely battered out of sight by Everton in the FA Cup at . Goodison Park on Saturday, I took the train back to London. Us minions waited in a . queue to board the train at Lime Street, while the Rangers players . ambled slowly along the platform to the first-class carriage at the . front of the train. Quite what made them so important that the rest of . us had to wait I’m not sure. United: A young Everton fan and young QPR supporter before the game at Goodison Park . Harsh: Queens Park Rangers fans who tried to speak to the players on the train were turned away by security . Easy street: Everton cruised through to the fourth round of the FA Cup with victory over QPR on Saturday . Once . on board some excited young QPR fans aged around nine or 10 ran towards . the front of the train, hoping to get autographs from their ‘heroes’. They were stopped and told that security would not let them through. They were then advised that once the train arrived at Euston if they . were quick they might catch the players then. Let’s . get this straight: QPR fans were still willing to idolise the players . who had been embarrassingly dreadful at Everton but were . denied that chance because those players apparently needed to be left . alone. Players are lost in a world where they think they’re really important, even when they’re actually being rubbish at their jobs. What kind of human being throws dangerous objects at a man who is lying injured on the ground right in front of them? And . what sort of disgusting individual throws coins at a man on a . stretcher? Worse than that, what kind of person throws coins knowing . they could hit and injure St John Ambulance volunteers as they carry . that stretcher? Crocked: Theo Walcott will be out of action for six months after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament . Cheeky: Walcott was pelted by coins as he mocked the Tottenham fans when he was taken off injured . I’m shocked . the debate centred on Theo Walcott’s cheeky, inoffensive reminder of . the score. Surely the question is why haven’t Spurs and/or their fans . been sanctioned for the disgraceful events on Saturday evening? I find it a bit bizarre that Arsenal decided to rule Walcott out of the World Cup. If . his operation is done this week there is an outside chance he will be . back in time for the World Cup, judging by recoveries other sportsmen . have made from the same injury. Arsenal say the operation will happen . ‘in the near future’ – there is no urgency from the club because they . wouldn’t see any benefit from a speedy operation. Instead the Gunners . will benefit from a fresh Theo Walcott who gets a full pre-season. The reality is he won’t make it to Brazil. It’s a shame because he belongs on that stage. Roy Hodgson needs Walcott; his pace and quality in front of goal make England better. I’m gutted he won’t be there. Blow: Walcott will miss the World Cup next summer in a setback for England manager Roy Hodgson (right) The massive gap between fans and their clubs was brought sharply into focus this weekend as not just the West Ham manager, but also the co-chairmen decided to completely disregard the club’s loyal supporters and its history. If I listed the years 1964, 1975 and 1980 to Sam Allardyce, David Gold and David Sullivan I wonder what their response would be. West Ham fans would, to a man, instantly know those were the years the Hammers won the FA Cup at Wembley. Bobby Moore lifting the famous trophy, Alan Taylor’s brace, and Trevor Brooking’s header. These are what memories are made of. Not what happens on Saturday at Cardiff. The Hammers’ European success in 1965 came about only because they won the FA Cup. So this competition is special to West Ham fans. They don’t expect to win it every year, and reluctantly accept there will be times they are knocked out by lower league clubs. But Sam got this one all wrong. He’s made a huge mess of his job and so West Ham find themselves in the bottom three. Because of his failure, he then decides to disrespect the FA Cup and the fans by fielding a team that could not win the tie. Worse still they got thrashed and the confidence and careers of some promising youngsters have been put in a vulnerable position. All this time there were plenty of senior players sitting around doing nothing, apparently too soft and pathetic to play three games in six days. Those players want to play in the FA Cup, they want to play in a semi-final, and they want to play at Cardiff on Saturday. So let them play. Allardyce, once a symbol of all that was good about old-school, no-nonsense English football, has got lost in the modern game, where finishing 17th is seen as something special. In short he’s lost touch with football and fans. Gold and Sullivan play the ‘lifelong Hammers fans’ card with relentless regularity. I appreciate they’ve got to balance the books, but no West Ham fan would back what Sam did at the weekend, so I find it shocking that the co-chairmen have declared they’re fully behind the manager. Fans still want to win the FA Cup. Players want to win it. Allardyce, Gold and Sullivan didn’t want to win the FA Cup this season. That’s not what West Ham are about. History: West Ham's Johnny Byrne, Bobby Moore and Peter Brabrook on a victory lap of after the 1964 final . Special: West Ham players parade the FA Cup at Newham Town Hall after beating Fulham in the 1975 final . Last time out: West Ham have not won the FA Cup since they beat Arsenal in the final in 1980 . Gold and Sullivan should be very worried by the manager’s relationship with his captain. Allardyce and Kevin Nolan go back a long way, and Sam persuaded the owners to give Nolan a massive contract in 2011 when they were in the Championship. But after his second unnecessary red card in the space of a few weeks, Nolan had Sam perplexed, unable to understand why he had been so ‘irresponsible.’ Has Sam lost the respect of his captain? Abject: West Ham were thrashed by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Sunday . Losing respect: Kevin Nolan was sent off twice in four games for West Ham . Twice in recent weeks my club Peterborough United have been denied goals because officials haven’t spotted the ball went over the line – once away to Coventry on Boxing Day, and again at Kidderminster in the FA Cup on Saturday. What made it worse was that opposition players knew the ball had crossed the line – and admitted it afterwards – but pretended it hadn’t. What do I expect? How about some honesty? What would be wrong with Coventry and Kidderminster players actually saying: ‘Fair enough, our opponents have been good enough to score a goal against us, so that goal should stand’? Naive you think? Never going to happen, you reckon? Denied: Peterborough have twice seen goals ruled out after officials did not spot the ball crossed the line . You’re probably right. But if you’re saying it’s OK for players to blatantly lie about an honest goal being scored, then you’ve got no right to moan about players diving. Don’t give mixed messages to players – you either want them to play fair and honest, or you don’t. Simple.","Young QPR fans were not allowed to meet the players on the train .

If there were any doubts of a schism inside the Republican Party, three conservatives' veiled slaps at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Wednesday should erase them. Hours before Time magazine unveiled its next weekly cover, featuring a silhouette of Christie and the headline 'The Elephant In The Room,' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer that Christie is a 'moderate ... who can win in New Jersey.' 'What that means about the national party – I'm not sure there's an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party,' he said, before insisting that 'the party in general is more conservative.' 'Moderate Republicans' are fighting words from conservatives trying to paint their rivals as weak centrists who agree with some Democrats' initiatives. Paul, like Christie, is considered a likely 2016 presidential candidate. Rand Paul said Wednesday that it was a 'conflict of interest' for federal funds to support an economic development ad campaign that included shots of Chris Christie, his presumed rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination . Christie went back to work on Thursday, greeting a troop of Girl Scouts at the state capitol in Trenton, N.J. Gov. Christie appeared briefly in several ads, paid for with federal disaster recovery dollars, which touted the New Jersey shore's recovery after Superstorm Sandy . Christie briefly found the national spotlight in 2012 as a possibly running mate for presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, but fell out of favor with many on the party's right wing after he praised President Obama following Superstorm Sandy. 'I'm a conservative,' he insisted Tuesday during a separate CNN interview. 'I've governed as a conservative in this state, and I think that's led to some people disagreeing with me in our state, because it's generally a left-of-center, blue state.' More... Chris Christie is hailed as the GOP heir apparent: Triumphant New Jersey governor gears up for certain presidential run with US road tour following landslide re-election . Moderate Republicans are the big winners on election night as Tea Party's star wanes . 'I'm on a mission': Victorious Chris Christie invokes the 'Spirit of Sandy' and vows to take on dysfunctional DC after landslide win . Romney team compiled secret dossier that showed 'Pufferfish' Christie would be a disaster for presidential campaign . 'The difference has been, is, I haven't tried to hide it or mask it as something different.' Paul has steadily pushed himself toward the tea party base, announcing Wednesday that he will move his weekly opinion column from the right-leaning Washington Times to the still more conservative Breitbart.com blog. That shift followed accusations, and admissions, related to alleged plagiarism in Paul's 2012 book 'Government Bullies' and in several of his public speeches. His criticism of Christie turned decidedly aggressive during a Senate hearing Wednesday afternoon, when he slammed a series of federally funded post-Sandy economic development ads that included brief on-screen quotes from the New Jersey governor and his family. Time's new cover, complete with elephant references, was probably meant as a Republican pun but was immediately associated with jokes about the governor's weight . The ads, which promoted the Jersey Shore's recovery, included Christie's son saying it 'looks like the word is spreading,' and the governor adding, 'We're stronger than the storm and open for everyone.' Christie was a candidate for re-election at the time. 'People running for office put their mug all over these ads while they're in the middle of a political campaign,' Paul complained to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan in a clear jab at Christie. 'In . New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running . for political office. I'm thinking there might be a conflict of . interest there. That's a real problem. And that's why, when people are . trying to do good and trying to use the taxpayer's money wisely, they're . offended to see our money spent on political ads. That's just . offensive.' At the time, however, the Center for Public Integrity's top watchdog Bill Buzenberg told USA Today that Christie's two-second cameo was no big deal. 'I can't say it's unethical,' Buzenberg . said, 'because it's not unusual for a governor to be involved in a . tourism campaign. When you drive into a state, you see the welcome signs . with the governor's picture. The pictures are usually bigger in an . election year.' Governor Christie, a self-professed conservative who has at times embraced bipartisanship, said Tuesday night that Washington politicians should look to New Jersey as an example of what's possible for the GOP . Four more years? (Two more years?) Christie is the governor until he decides not to be, an outcome that could accompany a presidential primary run in 2015 . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two more tea party-backed possible entrants into the White House sweepstakes a few years from now, also launched rhetorical mortars at Christie after his 60 per cent landslide showing in his re-election race. 'I think we need to understand that some of these races don't apply to future races,' Rubio said on CNN.  Every race is different – it has a different set of factors – but I congratulate [Christie] on his win.' 'Clearly he was able to speak to the hopes and aspirations of people within New Jersey. That's important. ... Governor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey – in states like New Jersey.' Cruz took his own veiled swipe at the New Jersey governor. Republican Senator Ted Cruz (R) is among the conservative pols linnig up to take pot shots at Chris Christie, the GOP political darling of the moment who is reveling in his brand of centrism . They keep their jobs too: Staffers in the governor's office applauded the boss after he won a second term Tuesday night in sweeping fashion . 'I think it is terrific that he is brash, that he is outspoken and that he won his race,"" he told ABC News. 'But . I think we need more leaders in Washington with the courage to stand . for principle. And in particular, Obamacare is not working.' That was a jab at Christie's decision to expand Medicaid in his state by raising the income limit for eligibility, a move made possible when the Affordable Care Act became law. During his victory speech Tuesday night, Christie showed disapproval for a perceived civil war that has pitted conservative purists against more broad-minded centrists whose appeal extends equally to independent voters. 'Listen, I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, maybe the folks in Washington, D.C. should tune in their TVs right now, see how it's done,' he said.","Rand Paul jabs Christie: 'The party in general is more conservative'

Researchers have proved that brain-training programs can significantly improve memory and language skills - especially in older people. The study from UCLA found that just 20 minutes of brain training once every four days can improve your immediate memory recall, and help you remember things for longer. Previous studies have claimed that brain training programs can delay dementia in later life but little research has been done into the immediate benefits of the software on older people. Researchers from California have found that computerised brain training programs can significantly improve memory and language skills, especially in older people. Previous studies found the games can ward off dementia in later life but the immediate benefits of the programs were relatively unknown . Evidence suggests that adults who keep their brains active by reading, listening to the radio or doing puzzles, can delay the onset of dementia. But these people may then decline more quickly when they do eventually exhibit symptoms. According to Dr Robert Wilson from Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, mentally stimulating activities may help the brain 'rewire' itself to circumvent the effects of dementia. However, once the disease is diagnosed, damage to the brain is likely to be greater than it would be in someone who was not mentally stimulated. During the 12-year study, Wilson found that mental activity appeared to delay the start of Alzheimer's and then speed up its progress, while reducing the overall amount of time a person suffers from the disease. The UCLA team studied 69 dementia-free participants, with an average age of 82. They each lived in retirement communities in southern California. Each participant played a computerized brain-fitness program called Dakim BrainFitness. The program trains the brain through more than 400 exercises in the areas of short- and long-term memory, language, visual-spatial processing, reasoning and problem-solving, and calculation skills. Of the 69 participants, 52 of them played at least 40 sessions of the game over a six-month period. Each session lasted 20 minutes. All of the 52 participants showed improvement in both immediate and delayed memory skills, as well as language skills, when compared with the 17 members from a control group. The findings suggest that older adults who participate in computerised brain training can improve their cognitive skills. According to the researchers, age-related memory decline affects approximately 40 percent of older . adults. This UCLA study is one of the first . studies to assess the cognitive effects of a computerised . memory-training program. The study's findings add to a body of research exploring whether . brain fitness tools may help improve language and memory and ultimately . help protect individuals from the cognitive decline associated with . aging and Alzheimer's disease. According to UCLA research, just 20 minutes of brain-training once every four days using software such as Dakim BrainFitness, pictured left, and Dr Kawashima's Brain Training: How Old Is Your Brain?, right, can significantly improve memory and language skills in older people . For example, they confirm the findings from London Metropolitan University, which claimed just 15 minutes a day spent on brain training exercises promotes the growth of new brain cells. The London researchers studied 64 people, aged from 20 to 71 and suffering problems including traumatic brain damage, stroke and dementia. One group of volunteers were given handheld electronic devices and asked to play a brain training game which tested short-term memory for just 15 minutes. The others carried out traditional word recall exercises using pen and paper. The researchers then tested all the participants on a traditional memory recall task, and found a significant improvement in both groups. But for those who had practised on computer games, recall had improved by 60 per cent  -  compared with 37 per cent for those who practised on paper.","Researchers from California noticed a significant improvement in memory among older people who played brain training games .

Michigan police botched an investigation into a mother's death and wrongly concluded that she had committed suicide, her devastated daughter has claimed. Michelle Romain says she has evidence to prove that her mother, JoAnn Matouk Romain, 55, was actually . murdered before her dead body was found floating in a river in Ontario in 2010. She believes that her . mother was abducted outside a church where she was going to an evening Mass, chloroformed and left in the . water near Belle Isle in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press reported. She said cops in Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe Woods made mistakes throughout the investigation and is now urging them to re-open the investigation - but so far they have not. Scroll down for video . Determined: Michelle Romain is urging police to re-open the investigation into her mother's death, which they ruled as a suicide. She claims that evidence reveals that her mother was in fact murdered . Together: Michelle Romain, left, said her mother JoAnn, right, would never have killed herself . 'My mother was murdered, pure and . simple,' she insisted in a press release. 'And I will never be at peace nor will other members of my . family, until this matter is properly investigated and her killer or . killers are brought to justice.' The battle comes exactly four years after JoAnn Romain, who had said she was concerned she was being followed, vanished after she attended an evening Mass at St Paul Catholic Church. Two months later, her body was found in the Detroit River near Amherstburg, more than 50 miles from the church. Investigators in Grosse Pointe Farms suggested that she had walked from her car and climbed over rocks to Lake St Clair, where she drowned. The investigation was then handed over to police officers in Grosse Pointe Woods, where Romain had lived. But Michelle Romain refused to . believe that her mother would have ever killed herself and has since . spent nearly $200,000 hiring her own lawyers and investigators to find . out the truth. She said she . believes her mother was killed because someone had a vendetta against . one of her uncles, to whom her mother was close, the Detroit Free Press reported. Questions: JoAnn's SUV was filled with gas before she went to church - which her daughter believes she would not have done if she was planning on killing herself later that night . Tragic scene: Two months after she vanished in 2010, her body was found in the Detroit River . Three pathologists ruled the cause of death as drowning but the manner of death as undetermined. Missed: JoAnn's daughter believes she was kidnapped by the church and dumped in the river . Attorneys filed lawsuits to get the records of the case and a retired FBI investigator gathered witness statements from the scene. They claim that JoAnn filled up her car with petrol before going to the church service - which she would have been unlikely to do if she knew she was going to kill herself. JoAnn's boots were also immaculate - apart from dirt - suggesting that she did not climb over the rocks to reach the water, and suggesting her body was carried and dumped, they say. They add that her purse was torn and that her body had bruising on the shoulder she carried it. A lead recovery diver who searched for her body told the team there was no current at the time she is believed to have waded into the water, making it impossible for her body to have drifted so far. Michelle Romain claims that police officers told her footprints led from . the vehicle to the water - but they later recanted this after realizing . the ground was dry. She . added that they also failed to pursue claims by witnesses that they saw a . man wearing black clothing and a black scarf along the edge of the . water that night.

'I am convinced that JoAnn Romain did not commit suicide,' he said. 'I think this was a murder.' But the police have so far not agreed to re-open the investigation. Grosse . Pointe Farms Public Safety Lt. Rich Rosati told the Detroit Free Press . that none of the information presented by Romain and her investigator is enough to re-open the case.

His friend, Hunter Lamoureux, 15, unintentionally got Rush in trouble by posting the 52-second video of their extreme wildlife encounter at the Whitefish Mountain Resort to Facebook. Scroll down for video... The moose is on the loose! Charlie Rush, 21, of Flathead County, is seen on his snowboard right on the tail of a galloping moose . Fined: Charlie Rush, pictured in both photographs, was fined $250 for 'animal abuse' after he snowboarded down a slope chasing behind a moose. But he says he didn't do anything wrong . It shows Rush snowboarding down the ski trail with a moose galloping in front of him. The video had the caption: ‘Just chasing a moose while snowboarding...no big deal.’ But officials did not agree. ‘We do have regulations about harassing wildlife and this video fell under that,’ forest spokesperson Wade Muehlhof told local station KRTV. Muehlhof said the citation was issued to the snowboarder chasing the moose for a learning opportunity because the fierce animal could have seriously injured one of them. ‘At the end of the video, you notice that the moose stops and turns. That could have had a very bad outcome for the snowboarder. We're very happy that neither the moose nor the snowboarder were injured,’ he said. What a rush! Charlie Rush is right behind the moose as they both hurtle down the ski slope at Whitefish Mountain Resort . 'Dangerous': Officials say the two could have got hurt by the animal which is much bigger than them and has been known to attack when it feels threatened . According to the two snowboarders, however, it was not their fault. ‘Look, . the moose was in the middle of the run where it wasn't supposed to be . and we were where we were supposed to be,’ Lamoureux wrote in a Facebook . post. ‘After waiting for it to move, it didn't. So we finished out our . run trying to slip past it. And the moose kept running.’ 'Not my fault': Rush says he plans to contest the fine to clear his name as he claims he would never hurt an animal . Huge animal: Rush says he never realised how big moose are until he was snowboarding right behind one . Rush, . who is reportedly considering contesting the citation, told CNN that he . loves moose and would never intentionally hurt an animal. ‘I never realized how big they were till I got that close to one,’ he said. John Fraley, a spokesperson for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, told the New York Daily News that these sorts of encounters ‘threaten the animals and threaten the people’. ‘Just try to minimize any contact you have with the wildlife out there,’ he said.","Charlie Rush, 21, of Flathead County, Montana, was fined $250 for animal harassment .

He found a spot to hide behind a rock, made himself as small as possible and wrapped his thick tail around him for maximum warmth. Complete camouflage: The arctic fox curls up into a ball to protect himself from the snow and wind . Wildlife photographer Jules Cox, 42, described seeing the exquisite mammals in the wild as one of his best wildlife encounters to date. He and a group of friends hired a jeep to explore the tundra wilderness of Churchill, Canada, on a ten-day trip. Mr Cox said: ‘We spotted the sleeping fox in some particularly extreme weather conditions. ‘There was a snow blizzard, high winds and low visibility. At times like these the foxes will shelter behind a rock on a snow ridge for maximum protection, and that's exactly what he had done. What does the fox say? When the wind had calmed, the male adult was ready for new adventures in Churchill, Canada . Doing a runner: The fix was spotted running over the tundra in the hunt for fun and food . ‘He knew to get out of the wind and basically use that wonderful luxurious tail as a barrier against the cold.’ Mr Cox, from Bermondsey, London, had photographed arctic foxes in captivity before but never in the wild so was delighted to see them up close. Mr Cox said: ‘Arctic foxes are the holy grail for many wildlife photographers because they are normally shy and elusive.’ ‘They're usually quite scarce but every few years, an abundance of prey boosts their numbers. ‘Luckily thanks to a boom in the lemming . population, they have had a good breeding year and we found over 20 of . these beautiful foxes over the course of the trip.' No fear: Arctic foxes are normally shy and hard to capture, but Jules Fox managed to see more than one on his trip . The species, also known as polar fox or snow fox, is well equipped with dealing with the cold . ‘At times they were only a few metres away from us, even running around our feet. ‘It was a magical experience - probably at the top of my list of special photography moments. ‘I never could have dreamt we would have had such an amazing opportunity.’ The arctic fox, also known as snow fox or polar fox, is well equipped to deal with the freezing temperatures thanks to its thick fur and high level of body fat compared to other types of foxes. As the snow melts in the spring, the fox sheds it's white coat for a brown one, in order to help in camouflage itself from its enemies and help it sneak up on its prey unnoticed.","Arctic fox escaped the cold by curling up behind a rock .

The average family drinks bill will soar by almost £100 a year under the Government’s plan for minimum pricing for alcohol, it was revealed last night. The proposed Home Office scheme will ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers. But research found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off-licences and supermarkets costs less than that level – meaning their price will go up. Increase: An average family's drinks bill will rise by almost £100 if Government plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol . A couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around £94 a year. The finding by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is a blow for the Government’s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers. Yesterday, it also emerged that Brussels may deem the scheme illegal, as European officials wrote to Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, to warn that Scotland’s own minimum price plan may contravene EU rules. They warned of possible legal action if the scheme for a 50p per unit minimum goes forward. Wine-producing nations such as France, Italy and Spain say it breaches EU law on free trade. Catherine Day, of the European Commission, explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits, and she said the plan would create ‘market distortions’. As an EU member state, the UK Government had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to Mr Salmond secret. Miss Day said: ‘The UK authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue.’ The Government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent, and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000. There will be 700 fewer alcohol-linked deaths annually, according to the predictions. However, the IFS said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises, there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers. Those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise, because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p. The IFS research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all, because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway. Home Office minister Damian Green, right, said cheap alcohol contributes to 'harmful levels of drinking' while Catherine Day, of the European Commission, said the plan would create 'market distortions' In contrast, 72 per cent of the units . in lager sold in shops, 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per . cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be . affected. They found that . if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises, the . minimum price will simply transfer £1.4billion from consumers to . off-licences and supermarkets. Miles Beale, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: ‘Minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the UK, while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder. ‘Alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country.’ The report confirms that low-income families will see the largest increases in prices, because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol. And they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking. ‘The most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy,’ the report said. ‘That will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is, and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about.’ Ministers claim a minimum price will save hundreds of lives every year, and save the taxpayer millions of pounds a year by cutting crime and health problems linked to binge drinking. Home Office minister Damian Green told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking. It can’t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p. ‘Too many of us have seen city centres on a Friday and Saturday night often become a vision of hell. A lot of this is fuelled by very cheap, very strong alcohol.’","Government wants to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p a unit .

Harrowing family photographs have revealed how a Virginia father posed with his newborn son just weeks before he began the relentless abuse that led to the infant's death four months later. Cory Daniel Walls, 24, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and felony child abuse Thursday after admitting there was enough evidence to prove he killed little Shane Daniel Walls. Little Shane was born prematurely and spent much of his 120 day-life in hospital, initially because he was so underweight and then from injuries his father inflicted. Tragic: This harrowing family photograph shows Cory Walls, right, posed with his newborn son just weeks before he began the relentless abuse that led to the infant's death four months later . The photos show the baby in his mother's arms with Walls leaning over, hugging the woman. The child's mother - Walls' girlfriend - hasn't been named and her whereabouts are unknown. Another image shows Walls asleep with the baby in his arms. Walls faces 20 years in prison when he's sentenced later this year. In testimony, he was described as a brutal caregiver, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The baby weighed just 14 pounds when he died.

He told 911 responders and emergency room doctors that the child was having breathing problems, was crying and kept vomiting, but never mentioned his rough treatment of his son. Either he or his girlfriend confessing to the abuse would have led to scans that would have revealed the child's brain damage, Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Nancy Oglesby said in court Thursday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:07 EST, 12 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:20 EST, 12 January 2014 . Tipping the scales at less than six stone and dangerously thin, Ollie Orchard, now 22, was struggling with anorexia when he first joined a gym at the age of 18. Four years later, Mr Orchard, from Bristol, has turned his life around and is now a fighting fit bodybuilder after using the sport to beat the eating disorder. He now weighs a beefy 18-stone, has dedicated himself to pursuing a career in the sport and happily munches his way through 5,000 calories a day in order to maintain his new physique. Recovery: Ollie weighed less than six stone at the age of 18 but has now recovered to become a bodybuilder . Speaking about his life-saving passion for the sport, Mr Orchard said: 'I shaved my hair off, took out my piercings and started lifting weights, it was a move that saved my life.' His battle against the eating disorder began at the age of 14, when he was a self-described 'Emo kid' and began starving himself to fit in. 'It started when I was about 14 years-old with anorexia and as it progressed it just got uglier,' he explains. 'I was an Emo kid with long hair and piercings and I was going to be as skinny as I could. Not eating was part of the fashion, it's a big thing, it dictates a lifestyle.' Although he often fainted because of his restricted diet, Mr Orchard managed to convince himself that all was well, despite the danger he was putting himself in. 'I was disgusted by food, it repulsed me,' he confesses. 'I picked up on the sound of people eating. If I saw people eating I would wonder how they could do it. Winner: Since overcoming anorexia, Ollie has become an enormously successful bodybuilder . Looking good: Ollie came second in his first competition and says bodybuilding is his new addiction . Emo is a type of rock music characterised by confessional lyrics and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. Its popularity peaked in the early noughties, courtesy of platinum selling bands Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional. Like punk and grunge, emo is also associated with fashion, in this case low-slung, colourful skinny jeans worn with band t-shirts, multiple piercings and rainbow-coloured hair. The genre has been criticised for its angsty outlook and has been linked to a number of teen suicides. 'For me it was all about being as small as I could. It was a form of control. It was an addiction.' He added: 'It was weird. I enjoyed it, I revelled in it. It was about pushing myself as far as I could. I would pass out through lack of eating but I would convince myself it was fine. Nobody could convince me otherwise.' Salvation came in the shape of a visit to the gym at the age of 18 on the advice of his doctor and a former girlfriend. There he met a strength coach who encouraged him to take up the sport, and after gaining some weight, he began lifting weights in earnest. Today he eats 5,000 calories a day six days a week and up to 10,000 calories on a Sunday when he treats himself to fast food. He added: 'You are very alienated with anorexia and although there are people in the gym it is still very much a personal journey. 'I started by barely being able to lift 5kg because I was so small so I had to first work at putting some meat back on my bones. 'I started reading body building mags and based my diet around that so would eat things like oats and egg whites but also started eating food like ice cream. 'It was tough on my stomach because it had been so small but I was determined to put weight on.' During the first year of training, Mr Orchard gained 10 stone and managed to achieve second place in his first bodybuilding competition before going on to compete in the British finals. 'I'm fit and healthy and focussing on doing something to my body that does not put my life at risk,' he added. 'Eating disorders are a bigger problem than people realise and all I would say is try and find something that can give you the same control and satisfaction. 'For me it was bodybuilding because I need the focus of the training and meals but anything that helps you beat it can only be a good thing.'","Ollie Orchard weighed less than six stone when he took up bodybuilding .

And now Lee Ryan's Blue bandmate Duncan James has opened up about the singer's philandering with both glamour model Casey Batchelor and US actress Jasmine Waltz inside the house. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Duncan said he believes that Lee is still entirely unaware of how he is coming across on screen. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Duncan James has spoken exclusively to MailOnline about Lee Ryan's actions inside the Celebrity Big Brother house . He said: 'The thing about Lee is, and no disrespect . to him, he's not a player in the sense that he's calculating, playing . somebody at a game because he's not that smart to think that, in that . respect. He just goes with what he feels. And in his head he probably . didn't think he was doing anything wrong. In his head he probably . thought, ""Oh well, I've been handcuffed to this girl Casey and she's . really sweet and we had a little kiss and a cuddle"", and in his head . that's normal, that's fine. 'But his d**k is probably telling him , ""Oh . that Jasmine, she's really fit, I really like that one"", but I . think his heart is more in with Casey and his d**k is more thinking . about Jasmine if I'm honest. But he's a typical lad like that. I think . Jasmine's the kind of girl that he'd want to take out and have lots of . dirty sex with, and Casey's the kind of girl that he could take home to . his mum and kiss and cuddle in the morning.' Duncan also insisted that Casey isn't doing . herself any favours by 'playing the victim' when it comes to Lee, and is . portraying herself as something of a 'bunny boiler'. Unaware: Duncan insisted Lee is not aware of the way he is coming across on screen, kissing both Jasmine Waltz (pictured) and glamour model Casey Batchelor . Can't make up his mind: Duncan said Lee is 'thinking with his d**k when it comes to Jasmine and his heart with Casey' He said: 'Casey, . she's acting like a bunny boiler if I must say so myself. And she must . have known what Lee is like, all you have to do is Google Lee Ryan and . see what he's been like in the past. She's not that dumb - she's a . 26-year-old girl and I'm sure she's heard about Lee Ryan before. 'And I'm . sure she's read many many stories about what he's like. So don't be . playing the victim and say, ""Oh, I really like you"". I just think you're . a grown woman, you're not a child, you should be in control of your . emotions at that age and know... And then for her to go back into that . botlhole and be like, ""Oh I've got no knickers on, how do I kiss, do I . kiss good?"" 'Selling out': Duncan also spoke about Lee's ex Sammi Miller selling her story on him this weekend . 'It's like, come on girl, you know what you're doing, you . know what you're playing. So don't make out that you're this poor . heartbroken victim and then go in the toilets and kiss him again - you . just make yourself look stupid.' Duncan added that Lee entering the house alongside both Jasmine and Casey has seen him act like a 'kid in a sweetshop', but also revealed that it has been frustrating to watch his bandmate's actions in the house so far. He said: 'Seeing him in the house, really liking . this Jasmine girl and getting into bed with Casey, it's just a bit like, . ""Oh God Lee, come on mate!"" It's frustrating for me to watch him . because I'm like, ""Come on mate, you're 30 now, you've got a couple of . kids, you don't need to be... "" But he wears his heart on his sleeve, he . gets into the moment and he thinks that he's in love so quickly - he . just wants desperately to meet somebody and be happy, because he has had . really difficult times in his last relationships and he just wants to . meet someone know and be happy, because he's at that age now where he . really wants that. 'But in that Big Brother house he's like a kid in a . sweetshop, it's like, what sweet do you go for? And you're in a surreal . surroundings in a house with people that you've never met and you're all . thrown together and it's just a really bizarre experience I can only . imagine.' Duncan's comments about Lee's actions in the house come as he revealed the real reason for the singer making the decision to take part in the show - to raise money to put his children, son Rain and daughter Blubelle, through private education. Duncan explained: 'Lee's always wanted to have that . family where the mum and dad are together and it's unity and security . within the household. And Lee was taken around various different . schools, got kicked out of various schools, was bullied because he was . dyslexic, he didn't feel that he had the education that he needed . because a lot of people misunderstood him and he was thrown out rather . than being helped. And because of the fact that he was dyslexic as a . kid, he was bullied with people calling him thick, and he had a really . really hard time as a kid doing that. 'So for him, the most important . thing is that his children don't go through the same pattern that he . went through. And I think that he's always wanted to make sure his kids . have a great education, they're taught the best way, and they don't have . to be bullied or tormented because they may have an impairment like . dyslexia and that kind of stuff. For Lee, it's important that he . puts his kids through good eduction and they're having a good schooling . because he doesn't want history to repeat itself. Proud father: Lee decided to sign up for CBB so that he can finance his children's private education. Here, he is pictured with five-year-old son Rain . Motivated: Duncan said Lee doesn't want Rain and his daughter Blubelle to have the same school life he did . 'So for Lee, that is . why he was so adamant about doing this, because his kids are at an age . where they're about to start school and he just wants the best for his . children. And I completely understand that because my daughter's eight, . and I got her into an amazing grammar school and now it looks like she's . going to be getting into the Royal Ballet School. I think as a parent, . it's important to give your kids the best start in life and that is . second to none for Lee - he wants that more than anything.' Duncan's interview with MailOnline came after Sammi Miller, the mother of Lee's five-year-old son Rain, slammed the singer for encouraging the little boy to tune in to his raunchy antics on the show. She was quoted as saying: 'What kind of father tells his five-year-old to watch him on TV and then behaves like a porn star?' But Duncan insisted that while Lee was fully prepared for stories to come out when he was in the house, the fact that his ex has sold out on him will still be devastating for him. Daring to bare: Lee sported just a pair of tiny PVC pants for the 18 Certificate task on the show on Sunday night . R-rated: Lee did some pole dancing with Luisa Zissman during the task . He said: 'He was always prepared that stories were . going to hit when he went in the house. And that was one of the things . that he actually was worried about and I knew that he was concerned . about certain people selling out on him, but the fact of the matter is, . I've been in a similar situation to Lee. 'I've got a daughter which I'm . not in a relationship with the mother but even still, the mother of my . child would never sell out on me, because our child would have to see . that. It doesn't matter how old she is, she's going to grow up and see . that, and it's like, why would Mummy and Daddy do that to each other and . air each other's dirty laundry for all the world to see - that should . be private, that should be between you two. 'And I know because of the . conversations I have with Claire, who is the mother of my child, that we . are like, we would never do that to each other, to harm our child. But I . think unfortunately, certain people that Lee's been involved with don't . think that way. And that's very sad to me because I have a completely . different ethos and I know Lee does as well - Lee's the kind of person . that would never spill dirt on something that's so private like his . family. 'And it's just very sad that in the past there has been stories . and I'm sure there are going to be more stories coming out and that . breaks my heart more than anything, because it's about the children here . and people forget that. The kids need to be put first, in all respects, . for everything. 'It's like, you don't sell out on somebody for money . because it's like you're selling your kid, and it's completely . disgusting and wrong. But that's my own personal view.'

Safe car: As this car concertinas against a wall, it's hard to imaging how anyone inside would survive such a wreckage... But apparently they would . The electric hatchback has already won 'Car of the Year' from Motor Trend magazine while Consumer Reports said it was the best car it has ever tested. The accolade will be seen as a boost to the fledgling car maker after it was revealed half of a dozen popular small cars tested for how they would stand up to a crash did not fare well, an influential road safety group found. Six of the cars tested, most of which were 2013 models, were rated ‘poor’ or ‘marginal.’ Top Tesla: The video was recorded during recent crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that where the electric Tesla Model S come out as the surprise winner . So car so good: The rechargeable car aced every category with a five-star performance in the front-end crash, the side crash and the rollover crash . General Motors Co's Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze each received marginal scores, while Kia Motors Corp's Soul and 2014 Forte were rated ‘poor’ in the results released Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Nissan Motor Co's Sentra also got a poor rating, while Volkswagen AG's Beetle was ranked ‘marginal.’ Two redesigned Honda Civic models, the 2-door and the 4-door, were the only small cars to get the top rating in stringent front-end crash tests performed by the insurance industry group. Cushioned: The airbag appears to cushion the crash test dummy's head perfectly as it smashes into a wall at high speed . All-round winner: The electric hatchback has already won 'Car of the Year' from Motor Trend magazine while Consumer Reports said it was the best car it has ever tested . In the worst cases with the small cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel, and side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection, IIHS chief research officer David Zuby said. Of the 12 models tested, the Kia Forte fared the worst, the institute said in a press release. Its seat belt allowed too much slack, and the side curtain airbag deployed but didn’t provide enough protection. The crash dummy’s head hit the windshield pillar and instrument panel. In the test of the VW Beetle, the steering column moved nearly 5 inches to the right as the test dummy’s upper body moved forward and to the left. Smashed: Six of the 12 small cars tested by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most of which were 2013 models, were rated 'poor' or 'marginal,' among them Kia Soul (pictured) Intense: As part of the test, small vehicles were crashed at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side . Worst-case scenario: In cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel . ‘The rotation meant that the dummy’s head barely contacted the front airbag,’ the institute reported. ‘At the same time, the safety belt spooled out too much, allowing the dummy to move forward 13 inches and hit its head on the dashboard. The side airbag didn’t deploy.’ By comparison, the Civics sustained only minimal intrusion into the occupant compartment, providing ‘survival space for the dummy,’ which remained well-protected from impact. The IIHS increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. The insurance group said nearly a fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve only a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole. The IIHS continues to score vehicles on side, rear, rollover and front-end crashes that impact more than just a corner.","The video was recorded by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .

A street performer dressed as Woody from the popular Toy Story film series has been arrested for molesting women in New York's Times Square. José Vasquez was arrested on Friday night after undercover detectives allegedly saw him grab the buttocks of two women who were having their picture taken with him. The Times Square Alliance has called for greater regulation of the costumed performers after the 44-year-old was charged with multiple counts of sex abuse and forcible touching. Arrest: José Vasquez is facing sex abuse charges after allegedly groping two women . There are calls for the street performers, who pose with tourists in return for tips, to be licensed after a spate of similar cases. 'This is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated,' Alliance president Tim Tompkins told CBS New York. Gia Storms, who is also part of the Alliance, added that up to 60 unregulated characters can be found in the popular tourist destination each day. 'Some of them can be up in your face. There a little bit of pushing and shoving to try and get tips,' she said. In the most recent case, Vasquez was handcuffed and taken to a police station while still dressed in the outfit based on the animated character voiced by Tom Hanks. The women he is accused of touching inappropriately have not filed a complaint, but Vasquez had his bond set at $1,500 and is due back in court on January 21. In other incidents, a man dressed as Cookie Monster from Sesame Street allegedly shoved a two-year-old boy in June last year because his mother was slow to tip. Regulations: The Times Square Alliance wants the street performers, who dress as characters from popular children's shows such as Buzz and Woody, above, to be licensed . An Elmo character from the same series was arrested in 2012 for shouting anti-Semitic slurs and a performer dressed as Spider-Man was arrested in February for allegedly punching a tourist who didn't tip, according to the New York Post. Some of those who wear the costumes, making up to $50 a shift, say business has been slow because the arrested performers were giving everyone else a bad name. Mr Tompkins plans to work with the city's new administration to find a solution to regulating the performers, who are protected under the First Amendment.","José Vasquez faces charges of sex abuse and forcible touching .

The scathing resignation letter that a Goldman Sachs executive published this morning has become an internet sensation.

Published in the op-ed pages of The New York Times, the letter was bound to garner attention no matter what. The fact that he included specific grievances only helped to fan the flame of Wall Street-bashing. 'I can honestly say that the environment now is as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it,' writes Smith, who headed the firm's U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 'To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of the client continue to be side-lined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making money.' Since the incendiary letter was published this morning, a number of alternative versions have gone public as well, showing a more cheeky side than anything else. One site published a revised version of Mr Smith's letter, though this time it was written by Darth Vader who decided to leave the Empire. Vader strikes back: One internet hit was a satirical version of Mr Smith's letter written from the point of view of Darth Vader who had decided to leave the Empire because it had changed during his time there . In mimicking Mr Smith's points and questions about the evolution of Goldman Sachs, a firm he claimed to have loved so much, the fictional Mr Vader did the same about his once-feared Empire. 'For more than a decade I recruited and mentored candidates, some of whom were my secret children, through our gruelling interview process,' the letter reads. 'How did we get here? The Empire changed the way it thought about leadership. Leadership used to be about ideas, setting an example and killing your former mentor with a light sabre. Today, if you make enough money you will be promoted into a position of influence, even if you have a disturbing lack of faith.' Predictably, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who Mr Smith specifically named as a root cause for the firm's supposed decline, put out a statement both to the press and to employees where he tried to discredit Mr Smith's claims and calm nervous clients. The real Lloyd Blankfein: Comedian Andy Borowitz (right) wrote a satirical letter mocking the one written by Mr Blankfein (left) in response to the resignation letter Mr Smith wrote for The Times . 'Needless to say, we were disappointed to read the assertions made by this individual that do not reflect our values, our culture and how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients,' Mr Blankfein wrote. Comedian Andy Borowitz wrote his own version of Mr Blankfein's letter, clearly siding with Mr Smith. 'At Goldman, we pride ourselves on our ability to scour the worldâ€™s universities and business schools for the finest sociopaths money will buy.  Once in our internship program, these youths are subjected to rigorous evaluations to root out even the slightest evidence of a soul,' Mr Borowitz wrote pretending to be Mr Blankfein. 'But, as the case of Mr. Smith shows, even the most time-tested system for detecting shreds of humanity can blow a gasket now and then.  For that, we can only offer you our deepest apology and the reassurance that one good apple wonâ€™t spoil the whole bunch.' The letter, and the ensuing internet firestorm, obviously made it a bad public relations day for the bank, and their share price dropped 3.4 per cent as a result. 'Greedy': In the letter, Smith claims the money-obsessed attitude will be the downfall of the investment bank .","Executive director Greg Smith quits in open letter in the New York Times .

This week, she sets out to master her cravings for sweet food. We are what we eat, so they say, and so I am eight parts chocolate and two parts Mini Cheddars. I have to confess my appetite and sugar cravings have been hard to control since the menopause, so I jumped at the chance to meet Dr Marilyn Glenville, a leading expert in nutritional health for women. New Year's resolution: Mandy is ignoring her sugar cravings and adopting healthier habits . Our meeting has galvanised me to adopt healthier habits. This will be the year of miso, chickpeas, lentils, beans, seeds, oily fish, berries, nuts, fruit and veg - all key foods, Dr Glenville says, at this stage of life. I'll also drink eight glasses of filtered water a day and take supplements including vitamins B, C and omega-3 fish oils. My body will become a temple, and cease to be a skip. I'll never bring myself to eat soy or tofu (menopause-friendly foods), but I am set on giving up chocolate, crisps, cake, ready-meals, caffeine, sugar in drinks and Diet Coke. Dr Glenville says middle-aged women also need exercise, seven to eight hours' sleep a night, stress control, some exposure to sunshine (for vitamin D to absorb calcium and aid bone growth) and to bring blood sugar under control by eating well. She is reassuringly positive about the menopause, seeing it not as a medical condition, but a natural transition that moves women into a new stage of life. She also reveals heartening news that we burn more than 50,000 calories a year doing household chores, equal to 57 hours of running. For women like me who don't like the gym but do enjoy housework, this is music to my ears. So many things during the menopause are outside our control, so it makes sense to act wisely when it comes to those we can control - such as what we eat and drink. Here's to that. Here's to this year being the best yet.","Mandy has a sweet tooth which has got even stronger since the change .

Many have been locked up for theft, violence and even murder, yet convicts believe they have better morals and are kinder and more generous than those in the outside world, according to new research. Prisoners believe themselves to have more 'pro-social characteristics' - such as kindness, morality, self-control, and generosity - than non-prisoners, psychologists said. The research found that while prisoners did not rate themselves as more law-abiding than non-prisoners, they did rate themselves as equal. Prisoners believe themselves to have more pro-social characteristics - such as kindness, morality, self-control, and generosity - than non-prisoners, psychologists said . The University of Southampton study specifically looked at the 'better than average effect' (BTAE), according to which people consistently evaluate themselves more favourably than the average person on a varity of traits. 'These findings are some of the most compelling demonstrations of self-enhancement,' said Constantine Sedikides, professor of . social and personality psychology and director of the centre for . research on self and identity at the university. 'If the prisoners self-enhanced by considering themselves superior to fellow inmates or community members on ""macho"" traits, such as toughness, I would not be surprised. 'However, they self-enhanced on pro-social traits, on which they could demonstrably be inferior to others. That is, they were inferior on those traits to community members and were not necessarily superior to other prisoners. They ignored, to a large degree, reality. Seventy-nine prisoners from a jail in southern England (illustrated) were asked to rate themselves in comparison to the average prisoner and the average member of the community . 'Virtually by definition, people who are incarcerated have shown a lack of respect for their peers and have violated a legal pact: to adhere to the laws of the community. 'Although non-incarcerated people do this also, it is highly likely that incarcerated people ""cheat"" their fellow community members more than the non-incarcerated do. 'To evaluate themselves more favourably than the non-incarcerated on virtually every social characteristic stretches reality to the breaking point,' he said. During the study, which was published in the British Journal Of Social Psychology, 79 prisoners from a jail in southern England filled out a questionnaire, which asked them to rate themselves in comparison to the average prisoner and the average member of the community on nine traits. These were: morality, kindness to others, trustworthiness, honesty, dependability, compassion, generosity, self-control, and the ability to abide by the law. A Southampton University spokesman said: 'Participants rated themselves as superior to the average prisoner on all traits. 'Surprisingly, they rated themselves superior to the average community member on all traits as well, with one exception. Prisoners considered themselves as law-abiding as the average community member.' Professor Sedikides said: 'Prisoners are strongly influenced by the self-enhancement motive (i.e, the desire to see themselves in a positive light). It is because of this motive that they believe they are more law-abiding than other prisoners and they are equally abiding as community members. Both - especially the latter - are unlikely. 'The results showcase how potent the self-enhancement motive is. It is very important for people to consider themselves good, valued, and esteemed, no matter what objective circumstances might be. For anyone who doubts this, ask them if they think that their children are perfectly average.' Prisoners rated themselves superior to the average community member on all traits with one exception.

The prisoners scored themselves to have more pro-social characteristics than non-prisoners. They also said they were as law-abiding as people who are not in prison. A psychologist said the surprising results show that prisoners are strongly motivated by the self-enhancement motive - the desire to see themselves in a positive light. It is because of this motive that they believe they are more law abiding then other prisoners and as equally abiding as community members, he said. Professor Sedikides explained that the . 'better than average effects' could have an impact on a prisoner's . common prediction that they are less likely to commit future crimes, . when official data indicates that approximately half of them re-offend . within a year of release from prison. He said: 'Perhaps a reason for their inaccurate predictions is their over-confidence. Feeling good about themselves relative to others (prisoners or community members) may bias their judgments toward believing that they could stay out of trouble when released from prison. 'Prison-based interventions, which rely on efforts to enhance thinking skills, already aim to challenge misconceptions that offenders may have about their offence and the impact their behaviour has had on society. 'However, prisoners also need to be encouraged to explore the reality of life after release from prison while also being offered support to overcome the individual and societal barriers that can prevent a successful reintegration into the community and the ability to desist from future crime.' The study also included researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London and Ohio University.","Study found that prisoners believe themselves .

A blind pensioner who has raised thousands for national charity Guide Dogs for the Blind has been refused a replacement dog following her previous dog's retirement, and she says its because the charity say 'she walks too slowly'. Shirley Waller, 80, from Market Deeping in Lincolnshire had her guide dog Alfie retired by the charity after it chewed and swallowed part of a wool glove and required surgery have it removed from its stomach. The pensioner, who has lived with guide dogs for 25 years, now has to learn to use a white cane, and must be taken out for walks by a sighted volunteer. Shirley now has to learn how to use a white cane after 25 years of using guide dogs to help her day-to-day life, following the confiscation of her guide dog Alfie (in picture left) While Alfie was having surgery, Waller asked for a retired guide dog to keep her company, but the charity refused. After this, she was told that not only will Alfie not be returned, but she will also not be provided another guide dog. She said: 'They said they were taking Alfie away because I couldn't look after him. 'They said I couldn't have another dog because I walk too slowly. 'I can't get my head around it. I feel after 25 years of being able to go out and about, now I can't because I have had to revert back to a white cane. 'I am 80 and learning to use a white cane is not an easy task. 'My walking has suffered because I have not been able to get out and about. I'm stuck at home waiting for any kind of person to come and take me for a walk.' Shirley and Alfie display Olympic pride in July 2012, when she was nominated to carry the Olympic torch through her town . Waller spent years raising money for Guide Dogs for the Blind, and in July 2012 was nominated to carry the Olympic torch through her home town. Since losing her guide dog, she has been unable to do work for the charity, such as speaking at schools, because she doesn't have a guide dog to accompany her. She said: 'I feel completely and utterly let down. I have worked for the charity in all weathers collecting, doing talks to raise awareness. 'I was so happy to do it because they had got me out of this dark world, but now they have pushed me back into it. I'm not the person I was.' A spokesman for the charity said: 'We care very deeply about the health and well being of our guide dogs and, as Mrs Waller’s dog was experiencing health issues, we made the difficult decision to retire him early. 'We understand that losing her guide dog has been a very tough for Mrs Waller. Guide dogs are life-changing for their owners and so to be parted from one can be difficult. 'In circumstances such as these, we assess the our service user’s needs individually to see if there are other ways we can help them to get out and about on their own terms, and we’re now supporting Mrs Waller with long cane training and our My Guide sighted guiding service. In happier days: Shirley Waller is devastated that her dog has been confiscated . 'For someone to qualify with a guide dog we need to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog, have appropriate living conditions and would be able to care for their dog accordingly.' 'A guide dog has to act as a mobility aid to its owner and needs to have a sufficient work load.' 'Before anyone can be matched with a new guide dog, regardless of whether they have had one before or not, they need to be individually assessed. For someone to qualify for a guide dog the charity needs to know that they would be getting out and about on a regular basis with their dog. The are also in charge of making sure the dogs have appropriate living conditions and that the owners would be able to care for their dog accordingly.

A 'bright and beautiful' girl died from anorexia after she was given full control of her own treatment when she turned 18, an inquest heard. Laura Willmott, 18, had battled anorexia nervosa for five years before she collapsed and died from a cardiac arrest after starving herself to barely five stones in weight. She was admitted to hospital when her weight dropped so low she was unable to walk, but doctors discharged her after 11 days - deeming her 'physically fit' to return home. Miss Willmott's parents have condemned the authorities that allowed her full control of her own treatment, which they could not contest, as the mental health system classed her as an 'adult'. The inquest heard Laura's weight plummeted following discharge as she refused to follow a diet plan she had agreed with doctors before leaving the ward. Flax Bourton Coroner's Court heard Laura collapsed at home just two weeks later and was readmitted to hospital, where she suffered a cardiac arrest that led to a fatal brain injury. The inquest heard how Laura, of Redland, Bristol, was given autonomy on her treatment shortly before her 18th birthday in February 2011 - leaving her parents 'in the dark'. In a statement read to the court, her devastated mother Vickie Townsend, said Laura was 'doomed' after gaining control over her treatment. She said: 'I do not believe she was in a fit state to make decisions herself for any treatment. 'I really struggle to see how Laura was any different at 17 years and 364 days than she was at 18 years and one day. 'She was doomed from this point, she went down hill quite rapidly, she had dropped 13kg (2st) in nine months, she weighed just 45kg (7st). 'Laura became frailer and frailer and expressed a fear to me that she thought she was going to die. 'She would do whatever it took not to take in nutrition, her levels of deceit was breathtaking. Laura collapsed and died from a cardiac arrest after starving herself to barely five stone . 'Even as she deteriorated right in front of our eyes she was considered able to make decisions about her treatment.' Laura began receiving treatment for anorexia in 2007 and reached a 'low but manageable weight' aged 17 thanks to regular professional help. She transferred units when her regular doctor at the Child and Mental Health Unit (CAMHS) went on maternity leave in June 2010. The new team decided that Laura should be classed as an adult as she was close to her 18th birthday and gave her autonomy to make medical decisions. This meant her parents were no longer copied in on Laura's care - and were unaware she attended just three appointments before cancelling future treatment. At the end of 2010, she had visited one nurse since the August. Mrs Townsend added: 'Laura gave the CAMHs team the impression that their involvement was no longer necessary and she was discharged on January 18 2011, just weeks before her 18th birthday. 'By September 2011 she could barely walk. She looked thinner and her hair was thinning out.' Laura was admitted to Frenchay Hospital, Bristol (pictured), in October 2011, after her weight dropped so low that she was unable to walk . Laura was admitted to Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, in October 2011, after her weight dropped so low that she was unable to walk. Doctors recorded her Body Mass Index (BMI) at just 12.5 - well below the healthy level - and Laura was treated on a specialist ward for 11 to stabilise her. She was discharged after 11 days, when doctors deemed her 'physically fit' and Laura promised to follow a diet of including nutrient drinks each day. Mrs Townsend added: 'She had to be discharged when they were physically fit, whether or not they had regained the mental facility to make treatment decisions. 'I was deeply unhappy she had to be discharged and didn't feel she was any better than when she had started and was of no fit health to agree to stay.' Dr Hugh Herzig, a consultant psychiatrist who worked with Laura in hospital, said he was reluctant to take all decision making powers away from her. He said: 'I didn't know how sending her home would go but I felt it was an experiment, to use that word, that was quite an important step to take. 'The decision to take all the trust away from the patient is a very grave one. When re-admitted to the hospital, she tricked nurses by soaking her nutrition drinks into tissue and later suffered a cardiac arrest and brain injury . 'Laura's thinking and her emotions were coloured by her long-standing eating disorder but she could consider and believed the evidence that was in front of her.' Laura's weight dropped at home and she was readmitted to Frenchay Hospital two weeks later, on November 23, with severe malnourishment and hypoglycaemia, weighing barely five stones. She tricked nurses by soaking her nutrition drinks into tissue and suffered a cardiac arrest on December 12 - leading to a hypoxic brain injury - and passed away one week later. Terence Moore, assistant deputy coroner for Avon, said he would be using his powers under Rule 43 to write to health services about his findings. He said: 'I will write to the PCT to raise the issue as to whether the opportunity for re-feeding could take a patient beyond simple medical fitness to a state where they are more able to participate in decision making processes. 'I will also write to the AWP to ask if it is able that a summary is given to clinicians where mental health patients are put in their care of any thing that might help in their treatment."" Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Townsend described her daughter as 'wonderful' and 'a very talented and supremely caring human being'. She said: 'Laura wanted to be a nurse and I am sure that she would say that if anything positive could come out of her experience it would be that where there might be deficits or policy failings in the care system for anorexia they should be attended to so that future sufferers might do better. 'I am not trying to accuse or blame anyone but it is clear the system of transition from adolescence to adult care at 18 is not working. 'We need to ensure the transitional period is seamless with the importance of providing safety for our young.'","Laura Willmott, 18, had endured a five-year battle with the disease .

Ford has put its biggest-selling pickup truck on a radical diet before launching it today - stripping more than 700lbs from it compared to previous versions. The F-150 - one of which sold every 41 seconds during 2013 making a $7.6 billion profit in the U.S. alone - is almost entirely made from lightweight aluminum. The redesign is an attempt to improve the trucks fuel economy after the U.S. government ordered manufacturers to make cars and trucks with a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Scroll down for video . All new: Ford has totally redesigned its best-selling F-150 pickup truck, shedding 700lbs on the previous model . It was unveiled today at the North American International Auto Show at the Cobo Center in Detroit. The use of light alloys in 97 per cent of the construction is a revolutionary change for a vehicle known for its heft and an industry still heavily reliant on steel. The truck is Ford's response to small-business owners' desire for a more fuel-efficient and nimble truck - and stricter government requirements on fuel economy. And it sprang from a challenge by Ford's CEO to move beyond the traditional design for a full-size pickup. Unveiling: Ford Motor Company Group Vice President Raj Nair introduces the new F-150 pickup truck at the North American International Auto Show at the Cobo Center in Detroit, today . Chief Executive Alan Mulally said: 'You're either moving ahead and you're improving and you're making it more valuable and more useful to the customer or you're not.' F-Series trucks - which include the F-150 and heavier duty models like the F-250 - have been the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. for the last 32 years. But while the construction techniques and material are ground-breaking, the F-Series still bears a striking resemblance to previous models which date bake to 1948. The key question for Ford, and the . people who sell its trucks, is: Will customers embrace such a radical . change? Dealers who have seen the new F-150 say they expect to encounter . some skepticism, but the change had to be made. 'We're . aggressive, stretching the envelope,' said Sam Pack, owner of four Ford . dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 'I think you have to do . that. If you don't, then you get into that predicament of being a ""me . too"" vehicle.' Still, it's a . big risk. Ford makes an estimated $10,000 profit on every F-Series . truck it sells, making trucks a $7.6 billion profit center in the U.S. alone last year. Drawing a crowd: Journalists surround the new F-150 with a body built almost entirely out of aluminum at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, today . And the company has had some quality issues with recent vehicle launches, adding to dealers' worries. The 2013 Escape small SUV has been the subject of seven recalls. The 2015 F-150 goes on sale late this . year. While aluminum is more expensive that steel, Ford truck marketing . chief Doug Scott says the F-Series will stay within the current price . range. F-Series trucks now range from a starting price of $24,445 for a base model to $50,405 for a top-of-the-line Limited. It's difficult to calculate how much more aluminum costs, since there are different grades of aluminum and steel. Pete . Reyes, the F-150's chief engineer, said Ford expects to make up the . premium by reducing its recycling costs, since there will be less metal . to recycle, and by slimming down the engine and other components, since . they won't have to move so much weight. Launch: A Ford 2015 F-150 truck is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange in the Manhattan borough of New York, today . Refinement: Ford has redesigned the F-Series range under pressure from the Government to improve their fuel efficiency . Aluminum was used on cars even before the first F-Series went on sale in 1948. It's widely used on sporty, low-volume cars now, like the Tesla Model S electric sedan and the Land Rover Evoque. U.S. Postal Service trucks are also made of aluminum. Ford has spent decades researching the metal. Twenty years ago, the company built a fleet of 20 all-aluminum experimental sedans. Later, it used aluminum on exotic cars . from Aston-Martin and Jaguar, brands it used to own. But up to now, . Ford limited the aluminum on its trucks to the hoods and used steel for . the rest. New government . fuel economy requirements, which mandate that automakers' cars and . trucks get a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, are speeding the . switch to aluminum. Chrysler's Ram is currently the most fuel-efficient pickup, getting 25 mpg on the highway. The . current F-150 gets as much as 23 mpg. Ford won't say what the new . truck's fuel economy will be, but says it will trump the competition. Success story: Ford unveils the new F-150 with a body built almost entirely out of aluminum which it hopes will win over a new legion of customers . Profit: 2009 Ford F-100 Pickup is part of the F-Series range which has helped the company book considerable profits . That could be an especially important . incentive for landscapers, carpenters and other small business owners . focused on their bottom line. 'I . think that's going to outweigh the aluminum part of it,' said Brian . Jarrett, a Ford dealer in Winter Haven, Fla., who hasn't yet seen the . new truck. Improvements in . aluminum are also driving the change. Three years ago, for example, . Alcoa Inc. - one of Ford's suppliers for the F-150 - figured out a way . to pretreat aluminum so it would be more durable when parts are bonded . together. Changing with the times: The latest F-150 still takes some of its styling from previous models, such as this 1980 Ford F-150 Pickup . Style: Ford sold an F-Series truck every 41 seconds last year and has been producing the model for decades. Pictured is a 1987 Ford F-150 Pickup . Carmakers can now use three or four . rivets to piece together parts that would have needed 10 rivets before, . Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said. And . Ford is able to take more risks. When the F-150 was last redesigned, in . the mid-2000s, Ford was losing billions each year and resources were . spread thin. But by . 2010, when the company gave the green light to an all-aluminum truck, . Ford was making money again. CEO Alan Mulally, a former Boeing Co. executive who joined Ford in 2006, encouraged his team to think bigger. After . all, it was Mulally who led early development of Boeing's Dreamliner, . which replaced aluminum with even lighter-weight plastics to be more . efficient and fly further. 'Everything . becomes more efficient once you take the weight out,' Mulally says. He . expects aluminum to be used across Ford's model lineup in the future. In the genes: The F-Series trucks have been one of Ford's most profitable models, including this 1967 F-100 . Design classic: Since being launched 66 years ago, Ford has redesigned the F-Series pickup, of which a 1957 F-100 model is pictured, 12 times . Ford is convinced truck buyers will accept the change. The company says the new truck will tow more and haul more, since the engine doesn't have to account for so much weight. It can also accelerate and stop more quickly. Aluminum doesn't rust, Ford says, and it's more resistant to dents. Reyes says the company planted prototype F-150s with three companies - in mining, construction and power - for two years without revealing they were aluminum. The companies didn't notice a difference. Mulally says Ford's customers have already shown a willingness to adopt new technology. Forty percent of the F-Series trucks sold last year had Ford's more efficient EcoBoost engines, for example, which were introduced just three years ago. And Mulally says owners trust Ford. Ford will still have a tough time wresting customers from the competition, mainly Chevrolet, GMC and Ram, says Jesse Toprak, an independent auto industry consultant in Los Angeles. 'Movement between brands in the full-size truck segment is extremely minimal,' Toprak says. 'It's the strongest loyalty of any segment.' Hit: The F-Series trucks, a 1948 F-1 model pictured, has been a hit with American customers since it was launched 66 years ago . Still, about 20 per cent of pickup buyers traditionally are open to jumping from brand to brand based on features or price, Toprak said. The company with the newest, most advanced truck has the advantage in getting those customers, plus those who are new to the market, Toprak says. Some steel remains on the truck. The frame beneath it is built primarily of high-strength steel, which Ford says will make it tougher and stiffer than the current frame. There's also steel in the front dashboard, because Ford thought steel was better at dampening nose from the engine. In all, a four-door F-150 has 660 pounds of aluminum, or nearly double the average use of aluminum per vehicle used now, according to Drive Aluminum, an aluminum industry Web site. If the Ford truck is a success, use of aluminum could expand rapidly at the expense of steel. 'People are beginning to truly understand the value that aluminum can bring to the table,' Lowery said. Ford is expecting some issues with the design or the manufacturing as it makes the change, Mulally said. But the company is working hard to troubleshoot. 'I think the attitude is, expect the unexpected and expect to deal with it,' he says. 'Sometimes I think our core competency is scrambling. That's not unique to Ford.'","Vehicle is 97 per cent made from the light weight metal .

There's no doubting 2013 was the year of the selfie but a young designer from Colorado took the craze of taking your own photo one step further. Kyle Warfield, 23, took a selfie every day of the year, and then turned all 365 photos into a gif, or moving, film-type image. The result is this astonishing piece of footage, entitled Last Year Of Selfies, which it is almost impossible to tear your eyes away from. Mr Warfield, a graduate in communication design, says he did it as a commentary about the sort of 'hungry for attention' people who spend hours posing to achieve the perfect selfie. Mr Warfield, from Arvada, Denver, took his picture each day with his Nikon camera on a tripod and then put used the photoshop programme to move his picture to ensure his eyes were lined up with the previous day's picture. The resulting gif starts off as you would expect, with picture after picture of him staring expressionless at the camera. But as the gif unfolds, he spits, tears his t-shirt off, pulls it over his head, turns around 360 degrees, and finally - thanks to yet more computer trickery - appears to 'melt' in front of the camera. Mr Warfield, a graduate from Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD), said he created the footage as a commentary on people who take photographs of themselves. He said it was a commentary on, specifically, 'those people that constantly post different photos of themselves but consistently make the same exact gesture in each one.' Selfie: Kyle Warfield, 23, took his own picture every day of 2013 and put all the photos together in a gif . The graduate in communication design said his project was a commentary on people who pose for selfies . He added: 'I think this type of person is hungry for attention and requires some kind of validation of themselves by acquiring likes and comments.' Mr Warfield said: 'There is a selfie-formula for these people. And they take the photos with intentionality, often spending far too long to get the perfect self shot, to accentuate their best features. In doing this, they unconsciously generate a facade of themselves. 'This is not how they look on a regular day, and it is far from authentic. For my project, I tried to do the opposite, and make some of the ugliest faces I could. Mr Warfield said he wanted to show himself as he is, instead of posing to take the perfect, flattering shot . As the year went on, the designer became more adventurous, turning around and pulling his shirt over his head . 'I tried to demonstrate the broad range of expressions my face can conjure, instead of posting a singular image of me at my best.' Mr Warfield, who says he is single, told fans on reddit that making the gif was hard work. 'Some days I got lucky, with just the right amount of change from one photo to the next, but some days I'd have to reshoot my face over and over to get it right,' he said. 'It took forever to accurately capture the spit part. And where my shirt came down my face....I had to attach a string to my shirt with a safety pin, holding the other end of the string with my hand, and then photoshop out the string. Changing appearance: In some pictures Mr Warfield is more hirsute, while in others he is cleanly shaven .

He is Pittsburgh's 'street doctor' whose office is his backpack and who treats people where they live. For 22 years, Dr. Jim Withers has been walking under bridges and venturing into abandoned buildings dressed as a homeless man to care for the city’s rough sleepers free-of-charge. Now, his extraordinary outreach has grown into a national network of medical trainees and volunteers who help the helpless about five-nights-a-week. Scroll down for video . 'The Street Doctor': Dr Jim Withers has been treating homeless people in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for free since 1992 dressed as a rough sleeper . Generous: Dr Jim Withers (center) with a volunteer trainee doctor treating a homeless man in Pittsburgh . 'The first thing that hit me was the . number of people squirreled away under bridges and campsites. The level . of fear and bitterness towards the medical community and general . community hit me full blast,' Withers told The Huffington Post. 'As I began to look at the . medical issues, I began to realize there were people with bad wounds, . unhealed ulcers, cancers and all kinds of things that weren't being . addressed.' Withers' incredible labor of love began in 1992 when he was a hospital specialist. While he had a strong desire to help Pennsylvania's poor and homeless, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine graduate lacked the street nous to approach them. After a long search, he teamed up with a formerly homeless man, Mike Sallows, who helped him build trust with the homeless population. Dr. Withers still remembers Sallows' forceful advice: 'Don't dress like a doctor and don't act like a jerk'. So disguised as homeless men and carrying backpacks with free medicine from drug reps, the duo offered their services. Their story has been beautifully documented by filmmaker Julie Sokolow, which debuted on the website NationSwell on Thursday. Dr. Jim Withers on the streets of Pittsburgh . Kindhearted: Dr Jim Withers (left) and formerly homeless man Mike Sallows (right) began their extraordinary outreach on the dark streets of Pittsburgh in 1992 . Wide reach: Dr Jim Withers estimates he has treated more than 26,400 rough sleepers over 22 years, including this homeless person . 'Literally, I . started dressing like a homeless person and sneaking out at night with a . guy who used to be homeless. As far as why, that had a lot more to do . with my concern for the way we treated other people,' Dr. Withers told The . Huffington Post. 'As a medical educator, if I could find a new classroom . where we could be forced to come to grips with people outside the . system, for me, that required a complete plunge.' Dr. Withers said he initially faced some resistance from his peers who believed he was risking his standing in the medical community for the sake of his . vision. But to the visionary doctor, the need for his services was too great. He has treated an 85-year-old paranoid man whose legs were so infected, maggots grew inside them; a woman who was diagnosed with cancer several times; and an elderly man who risked losing his eyesight to a treatable condition. Dr. Withers, a father-of-four, doesn't need to dress like a homeless man anymore. He has become a hero on the streets of Pittsburgh, and is welcomed by the city's struggling population. With the support of his loving wife Gayathri, who he married in 1984, Dr. Withers estimates he has treated more than 26,000 people since 1992 and has become well-loved in the local community.

Sound advice: Before former homeless man Mike Sallows (right) began working with Dr Jim Withers (left), he advised the kind medical practitioner, 'Don't dress like a doctor and don't act like a jerk' Preparation: Dr Withers packs a range of medications and devices before he hits the road, including cold and flu pills, vitamins and inhalers . Since his initial outreach more than . two decades ago, the humble doctor has grown his nightly service into . the nonprofit Operation Safety Net, part of Pittsburgh Mercy Health . System and one of the nation’s first full-time street medicine programs. Dr. Withers and .

The team has reportedly assisted 75 percent of the people they've treated get health insurance and more than 500 into homes. They have regular patients who are always happy to see them. Dr. Withers founded the organization in 1993 with a $50,000 start-up grant from the Sisters of Mercy, Pittsburgh Magazine reported. 'It’s kind of an ongoing adventure to figure out how to make something like this work,' Dr. Withers, an internal medical physician, said. More than 90 countries have developed similar street medicine units. Dr. Withers said the free service helps ease pressure on under-resourced emergency medical services and hospitals, while honoring the rights of the disadvantaged. Inspired by his physician father's missionary work in North America and his idol Mother Teresa,  Dr. Withers believes his work will never be done. 'The power of health care goes way beyond medicine. It changes all the people involved: the homeless become more empowered and they get the courage to get off the streets,' Withers said. 'I think healing is really the formation of community, a community that sees each person as having value. We’re all in this together.'","Dr. Jim Withers has been treating homeless people in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for free since 1992 .

Passengers heard not one but two chilling announcements on a recent United Airlines flight from Des Moines to Denver, after their pilot suffered a heart attack at 30,000 feet. Quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, from Camarillo, California, rushed to respond when crew asked over the loud speaker if any passengers had medical training. But as she was administering aid to the 'mumbling and incoherent' pilot, another, distinctly more terrifying plea was heard: 'Does anyone in the cabin have flight experience?' Thankfully, the co-pilot managed to safely land the plane at an airport in Omaha, but not before the unusual request thoroughly frightened all on board. Scroll down for video . Hero: Quick-thinking nurse Linda Alweiss, pictured left and right, rushed to respond when the pilot suffered a heart-attack mid-flight . The drama began about 20 minutes into the December 30 flight. Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation. When the first announcement was made the registered nurse with decades of experience was first to respond. She said she found the pilot slumped over in the cockpit. 'He was sick and mumbling and was just incoherent,' she told KTLA. The pediatric intensive care nurse, who only recently re-certified her advanced cardiac life support accreditation, noticed his heart was beating irregularly and determined he'd probably suffered a blood clot or a heart-attack. Scary: Mrs Alweiss was flying home via Denver with her husband and 16-year-old daughter from a Christmas vacation when the two frightening announcements were made . Another nurse, Amy Sorenson, of Wyoming, also volunteered to assist and the pair, with the help of other passengers, pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley so they had more room to work. The nurses set up a diagnostic defibrillator and administered an IV. After the co-pilot took control of the airplane, Mrs Alweiss said she turned to the woman and asked, 'You know how to land the plane, right?' And she said 'yes.' 'I felt immediately comfortable. That was just one thing I didn't have to think about, so I could focus more on what was going on with the patient,' Mrs Alweiss recounted to KTLA. But a second announcement was made, asking if there were any pilots in the cabin. 'That kind of changed the story a little bit,' Mrs Alweiss' husband, Alan, explained with a laugh. Room to work: Alweiss and another nurse, Amy Sorenson, pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley, pictured, and after the flight landed safely he was met by paramedics, right, on the tarmac . The co-pilot managed to land the plane without trouble and paramedics were waiting to treat the pilot on the tarmac. 'United flight 1637, a Boeing 737 . operating between Des Moines and Denver Monday evening, landed safely in . Omaha after the captain became ill,' the airline said in a statement. 'United accommodated the customers overnight, and they continued to Denver the next day.' On the rescheduled flight the following day, Mrs Alweiss sat next to the co-pilot who informed her the pilot had survived and was being treated in the cardiac unit of an Omaha hospital. 'She did her job,' Mr Alweiss proudly told KTLV of his wife. 'She jumped at the opportunity, didn't hesitate. And she did it at 30,000 feet, knowing that the person who was supposed to be flying the plane was her patient.'","Passengers heard the chilling announcement on a December 30 United Airlines flight from Des Moines to Denver after the pilot had a heart attack .

But Vonn cheered herself up a day later by bringing home Leo, a 9-month-old boxer mix, from a Florida animal shelter. Since then she's happily mentioned the new addition many times. Puppy love! Lindsey Vonn swaps the snowy slopes for a sunny Florida beach as she walks her newly adopted dog Leo . Pick-me-up: A day after Vonn announced that her injured knee would keep her out of the Olympics next month, the skier went out and adopted a homeless dog which also has a bad knee . Comfort: Vonn wrote on Instagram. I adopted Leo today from an animal shelter and he has cheered me up so much! He was hit by a car and has a bad knee. Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother #bumkneebuddies . On Friday Vonn posted a picture of the excited puppy running next to the waves and wrote: Morning walk on the beach with Leo. He seems very happy to be out of his cage! 'Can't wait to take him home to Vail and show him snow for the first time! #iloveleo #happydistraction' the injury-plagued skier added. The same day Vonn paid a Twitter tribute to how much Leo is helping her mood. 'My new puppy is helping me so much. It's . hard to not get down right now but he is getting me through it. #puppylove #whoisresucuingwho,' she wrote. Upset: In a Facebook posting last week, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level' Together: Vonn instagrammed this photo on Friday with the caption: 'Morning walk on the beach with Leo. I think he's happy to be out of his cage :) #excitedpuppy' Companionship: 'Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother,' Vonn joked on Instagram, adding that Leo has cheered her up so much . 'He has a bad knee, just like me,' a limping Vonn told reporters as she led the pup from a Jupiter, Florida, shelter on Wednesday. Vonn first saw the injured dog the day before Christmas Eve, according to WPBF. At the time, her high-profile boyfriend, golfer Tiger Woods wanted a different dog. But workers at Furry Friends in Jupiter said she came back announcing 'I won!' before adopting Leo. Down in the dumps Vonn posted a photo of herself with the dog on Twitter Wednesday evening. 'Leo brightened my day,' she wrote. 'Has a bum knee bc a car hit him #bumkneebuddies #puppylove.' 'Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother,' Vonn joked on Instagram, adding that Leo has cheered her up so much. She explained on Facebook that Leo 'has a bad knee from being hit by a . car when he was a puppy and no one wanted him...but I do!! Adoption: Vonn explained on Facebook that Leo 'has a bad knee from being hit by a car when he was a puppy and no one wanted him...but I do!! Help: 'I encourage anyone looking for an animal to adopt from a shelter and save a life!' Vonn urged . 'I encourage . anyone looking for an animal to adopt from a shelter and save a life!' she continued. Vonn is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time, but a February 2013 knee injury while skiing in Austria has since seriously sidetracked her career. Until last Tuesday, Vonn had remained upbeat nonetheless. Less than two weeks after . reconstructive right knee surgery in February 2013, she was already sounding a positive note, saying she was 'really looking forward to . Sochi' and defending her Olympic downhill gold medal. Along . the way to the next Winter Games, though, Vonn began facing more . setbacks. As she'd move past one, another would surface. In the end, it . was too much, even for Vonn, the most accomplished U.S. ski racer in . history. Expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming Games, . Vonn announced Tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony — . she won't be able to race in Russia . 'He has a bad knee, just like me': The dog Vonn chose was hit by a car and has since needed surgery on his leg .

Friends: 'He has a bad knee, just like me,' a limping Vonn told reporters when she first got the pup from a Florida animal shelter . In a Facebook posting, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.' Like many in her risk-filled sport, Vonn has dealt with injuries often, particularly at major events. She withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion. She raced with a severely bruised shin at the last Olympics. She skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle. She hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds. She took a scary fall during training at the 2006 Olympics, then left the hospital to compete. 'She's come back. She'll be back,' Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said in a telephone interview. 'You'll see a lot of Lindsey Vonn in the future.' Vonn left the 2010 Vancouver Games with two medals: the first Olympic downhill gold for an American woman, and a bronze in the super-G. She is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, by far the most recognized name in Alpine skiing at the moment — and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods. Withdrawal: Lindsey Vonn and her partner Tiger Woods were together the day before Christmas Eve when the skier first met the kindred spirit canine . Add it all up, and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in Sochi, certainly a main character in NBC's coverage for a U.S. audience. 'Lindsey gives you great promotional value, and she's an amazing athlete and an amazing story,' said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics. 'But there are amazing athletes that are going to be in Sochi, many of which we know, some of which we haven't identified yet.' To those in the world of skiing, there's no doubt about the sport's most important athlete of late. 'Without Lindsey Vonn, the races are . just not the same,' Canadian women's Alpine coach Hugues Ansermoz said . last month. 'She just attracts so much interest. When Lindsey Vonn is . here, there are more people coming to watch the race, there is more . interest on TV, more journalists are interested.

The star delivered a cringe-worthy TV moment after being named Best Supporting Actress in a TV Show, Miniseries or TV Movie for her BBC drama Dancing on the Edge. She beat out rivals Janet McTeer (White Queen), Hayden Panettiere (Nashville), Monica Potter (Parenthood) and Sofia Vergara (Modern Family) for the gong. Scroll down for video . Cringe: Jacqueline Bisset won the award for the most excruciating acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in LA on Sunday . When she first appeared on stage she was speechless for what seemed an age, before spluttering into a weird stream of consciousness ramble. 'I'm stunned,' she said, and went on to leave the audience and viewers rather gobsmacked too by her ramblings. In a car crash speech that was punctuated by long pauses, she swore and said she wanted to thank those who had given her 'pleasure and sh*t'. Shock: Bisset seemed genuinely surprised to win which may account for the strange incoherent speech . Tears: The actress was off her game from the beginning of the speech that started with a few tears . 'Bonkers' Bisset's incoherent speech sent the Twitterverse into a spin . The reaction on Twitter was swift and merciless, with some branding it 'bonkers' and the 'maddest acceptance speech in awards history'. Ellen DeGeneres quipped: 'I helped write Jacqueline Bisset's speech. Did you like it?' British TV writer Boyd Hilton wrote: 'Really hoping Bisset is still on stage silently staring when the show resumes after this ad break #GoldenGlobes' 'Bissett had such a long walk to the stage she dropped her marbles on the way. #GoldenGlobes,' Jack Guinness quipped mercilessly. Kate Walsh couldn't stand to watch and admitted: 'I ❤️Jacqueline bissett but I had to leave the room.' She won it: Jacqueline displayed her trophy for Dancing On The Edge . Gamut of emotions: Bisset was thrown by the win and her speech never came together . She's got it together: Bisset was altogether more composed as she showed off her trophy backstage . 'Oh sh**!' Elisabeth Moss made a blooper when she accepted her Best Actress in a Mini Series award . Piers Morgan chipped in to brand Bisset 'bonkers' and added: 'Maddest acceptance speech in awards history.

Making fun: Emma Thompson sent up awards show disasters by arriving on stage with shoes in one hand and a martini in the other . Emma Thompson parodied a stage disaster by arriving on stage with her heels in hand and a martini in another to present the Best Screenplay gong to Spike Jonze for Her. She threw her heels over one shoulder to present the cult favourite with his trophy for the Siri-based love story. Thompson, who looked stunning in gold, was obviously following P Diddy's advice that it'll be fine and over soon, as long as people 'keep drinking' as featured in this hilarious vine https://vine.co/v/hLKtWMIY3u3. Somebody who could probably have done with a stiff drink after he presented Best Actress to Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine, was Leo DiCaprio. Floored by Poehler and Fey's encouragement that the crowd should give him a warm welcome 'just like a supermodel's vagina' he pronounced Steve Coogan's Philomena as Phil-O-Mania, which drew a laugh at the Hilton and immediately started trending on Twitter.

Apple proved a smartphone camera can rival some of the features of professional devices when it released its iPhone 5S, and now the firm has taken a step further by acquiring photography app SnappyCam. Reports claim the Californian-tech giant bought the popular, high-end photography app over the new year, but the cost of the deal has not yet been announced. The 69p app, which has since been removed from the app store, features a professional ‘burst mode’ and up to six times zoom. Reports claim Apple has bought the popular, high-end photography app SnappyCam for an undisclosed amount. The 69p app, which has since been removed from the app store, features a professional 'burst mode' and up to six times zoom . An Apple patent filed in November detailed a system capable of capturing low-resolution images that can be refocused even after they’ve been taken and processed. It would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image, similar to the technology seen in Lytro cameras, meaning the shots appear in 3D rather than 2D. According to patent papers, . which were originally filed in 2011, photographers could take an image . and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different . shots. These images would be taken through what’s called a microlens array. According . to Apple's patent, this array would be detachable and could be removed . when the user wanted to take a traditional high-resolution photo. Burst mode lets users take multiple photos in one take and then select the best image. It’s predominantly used in professional photography to capture action shots in sport, for example. However, since the likes of Samsung and Apple have introduced the feature in their latest handsets, it is becoming more popular among amateur photographers. Apple added burst mode to its iSight camera with the release of its iPhone 5S last year. It can capture 10 photos per second. By comparison, SnappyCam’s burst mode can capture 20 photos per second. This is because it captures between 20 and 30 frames per second, and in certain models of phone is said to be capable of up to 60 frames per second. SnappyCam also captures these images at a full resolution of 8-megapixels. Elsewhere, Apple’s iPhone 5S zoom is only half the capability of SnappyCam’s. Apple's vice president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller, pictured, unveiled the improved iSight camera of the iPhone 5S last year. Apple added burst mode to this camera, which captures 10 photos per second. By comparison, SnappyCam's burst mode can capture 20 photos per second . SnappyCam, pictured, topped the Apple's App Store list in 16 countries during 2013 . Samsung’s S4 shoots up 20 pictures continuously at full-sensor resolution, but each photo is taken at 0.1333 seconds apart, according to SnappyCam, which averages out at 7.5 photos per second. By acquiring SnappyCam, Apple may be looking to add the app’s super-fast and professional features to future models of its iPhone and iPad. The acquisition could also improve Apple’s video recording capabilities. It added slow-motion video to its iPhone 5S that  records at 120 frames per second and SnappyCam could help improve the quality of this, too. In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said: ‘Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.’ SnappyCam topped the Apple’s App Store list in 16 countries during 2013 and is run by its founder John Papandriopoulos.","SnappyCam adds professional photography features to smartphones .

Two sixth-form lovers have jetted off to the Caribbean after sneaking out of their public school in the middle of the night. The 16-year-olds told friends they were sick of the rain and cold after returning to their £30,000-a-year school  after the Christmas holidays. As fellow pupils and staff at Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, slept, they took a taxi to Manchester airport and were last seen in the terminal before flying to the Dominican Republic. Sneaked out: The sixth-formers, who are said to be dating, left the Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, at night after telling friends they were sick of the rainy weather . Now the pair – who are understood to have been dating each other at the school – are being sought by their parents and police on the island. It is understood the pupils booked tickets online, then told close friends they were going to leave late on Sunday night for a romantic break in the Caribbean. They waited until staff on night duty had gone to bed and fellow pupils were asleep in their dorms before grabbing their bags and sneaking out. They are believed to have walked out of the school gates and down the road before ordering a taxi to the airport, where they boarded an indirect flight to Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. Sources said their parents were sick with worry, but were trying to resolve the drama with minimal police involvement. They are said to be trying to contact the runaway pair and may fly out to bring them back to school. Lancashire Police said last night: ‘We are making inquiries with the authorities to trace the two missing pupils. Escape to paradise: They booked flights to the Dominican Republic online . ‘Efforts are being made to establish they are safe and well, though at this stage an international hunt has not been launched.’ Andrew Johnson, headmaster of Stonyhurst, said: ‘Two of our sixth formers left the college during the course of Monday morning. We have been working with their families and the police, who believe they may now have traced their location. We await further news from the police.’ Stonyhurst College, originally founded in 1593 in France, is a Catholic school that accepts pupils from other Christian traditions. Many who board at the school, which has more than 300 boys and 130 girls, come from overseas. Past pupils include Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and actor Charles Laughton. Spotted: The two pupils were last seen in the terminal building at Manchester Airport . Last night a source said: ‘It’s the talk of the school. It’s astonishing that, although they are only 16, they could afford to splash out on flights to the Caribbean, but a lot of the pupils at Stonyhurst come from very wealthy families. ‘Many are from overseas and their parents give them credit cards with unlimited credit.’ Traditionalists were outraged when girls were admitted to the school for the first time in 1999. In 2009 a girl and a boy, aged 16 and 17, were expelled after they were caught in bed together. Later that year, head of English Terence Bell, 46, was jailed over a seven-month affair with a 17-year-old pupil at the school. He was caught after another pupil found him and the girl in a passionate clinch in a classroom. Bell later confessed to police,  saying: ‘The game’s up, isn’t it? Love is a powerful thing.’ He was jailed for 20 weeks on a charge of being in a position of trust and intentionally causing or inciting a girl of 17 to engage in sexual activity.

Britain's longest-serving soap actor used his fame to sexually assault starstruck girls after inviting them to his Coronation Street dressing room, a court heard yesterday. William Roache, 81, who has played Ken Barlow on ITV for five decades, preyed on fans in the 1960s, confident his celebrity status meant they would not complain, it was claimed. One 14-year-old was attending a talent contest when Roache led her into the men’s toilet and made her perform a sex act on him, Preston Crown Court was told. He later wrote her a letter enclosing a signed photograph to secure her loyalty. Scroll down for video . End of day one: Bill Roache leaves Preston crown Court with his sons James, Linus, and daughter Verity today, where he is accused of raping a child and five other sex offences . But following the exposure of serial . sex offender Jimmy Savile in 2012, a jury heard that five women, who . were aged between 12 and 16 at the time of the alleged offences, finally . felt confident enough to come forward. ‘You . may well conclude by the end of this trial that William Roache’s fame . and popularity provided not only the opportunity for his offending but . that it is one of the predominant reasons for his victims’ decades of . silence,’ prosecutor Anne Whyte, QC, told the jury. The . twice-married father-of-four went on trial yesterday accused of twice . raping a 15-year-old girl who lived close to his then home in . Lancashire. In addition, he is accused of indecently assaulting four young girls he met at Granada Studios in Manchester. In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years . Another . said Roache pushed his hands up her jumper, while two sisters – one as . young as 11 or 12 – who were invited into his dressing room, and given . lifts in his silver Rolls-Royce, claimed they were also sexually . assaulted. Immaculately . dressed in a dark blue three-piece suit and striped tie and with his . grey hair neatly trimmed, the widower arrived at court flanked by . his 49-year-old son, Linus, and his two children by his late . second wife Sara – 32-year-old Verity and her brother James, 28. Famous: Roache, pictured with youngest daughter Verity, is probably Britain's best known soap star, and the jury were asked to ignore what they know about his character Ken Barlow . At . the start of the trial, the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, told jurors . they were likely to be familiar with Ken Barlow from television but must . distinguish between the character and the actor. Witnesses will include . fellow cast members Anne Kirkbride, who plays his on-screen wife . Deirdre, Chris Gascoyne, who plays his son Peter, and Helen Worth, who . plays Gail Platt, later Gail Tilsley. The . actor first attacked a 14-year-old who was attending a talent contest . at Granada Studios in 1965 and was invited to a dressing room by Roache . and other cast members, said Miss Whyte. She . alleged Roache – then 33 – led her into the men’s toilet and, without . speaking, made her perform a sex act on him before they returned to the . dressing room. He asked for the schoolgirl’s address and later sent her a letter and a signed photograph which she still has, the court heard. Later . that year, she claims Roache gave her a lift in his car where she . ‘believes’ another sex act took place. The same year, a 16-year-old girl . was at Granada Studios when Roache approached her in the ladies’ toilets and started to ‘fondle’ her breast, Miss Whyte said. In . 1967, the court heard, a 15-year-old girl who lived near Roache’s then . home was led by the actor into the bungalow he shared with first wife . Anna Cropper, forced on to a double bed and raped. Later that year, she agreed to go into a cottage he owned and once inside he allegedly raped her again. The . 15-year-old alleged rape victim was a virgin and told police she felt . ‘panic-stricken’ at Roache’s actions, which came with no attempts to . ‘kiss or sweet talk her’. Then . between 1968 and 1971, Roache allegedly groomed the two sisters . initially aged around 12 and 14 who would wait outside the studios. The . elder sister claims that one day Roache – still wearing make-up and . stage clothes from playing Ken Barlow – invited her into his dressing . room and without warning put his hand up her skirt. On . the same occasion, the jury was told actor Neville Buswell, who played . Ray Langton, asked the younger sister to touch him sexually, but she . refused. He has denied these claims. Case: Prosecutor Anne Whyte, centre, told the court Roache, behind her, had used his fame to attack young girls . Later, . Roache allegedly gave the younger sister, now 57, and a friend a lift . in his silver Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and made her perform a sex act on . him. At one point, she told police, she stopped when a double-decker . bus drove past, but he replaced her hand and made her continue, later . giving her half a crown to get a bus home as he dropped them off. Miss . Whyte said all five kept quiet until an interview Roache gave to New . Zealand television in March last year. The husband of the younger sister . interpreted  comments Roache made in the interview as suggesting that . ‘in the old days young girls were throwing themselves at him and they . were all sexually active’. Allegations: The actor allegedly attacked two of the young girls in the toilets at Granada Studios in Manchester, the court heard . Attacks: The prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place, 'using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification' Entrance: The star's security were forced to clear path through a crowd as he arrived at Preston Crown Court this morning . Arrival: Coronation Street Star Bill Roache walks to Preston Crown Court with children Linus (behind left), James (next left) and Verity (right) for the start of his trial, where he is accused of historical sexual offences . Support: Roache - who has played Ken Barlow for decades - arrived flanked by his security in front and his children behind . Roache’s comments ‘grated’ and he contacted a Sunday newspaper with a view to selling her story, the court heard. Meanwhile . the alleged rape victim contacted police that month after a . conversation in which her grown-up son expressed disbelief about victims . of Savile and former MP Cyril Smith taking so long to come forward, . Miss Whyte said. She told . him Roache had raped her as a schoolgirl and, at his insistence, she . formally reported it to police. Roache was arrested and charged with two . counts of rape, and following publicity over his court appearance the . other four alleged victims contacted police. 'The youngest told police . she had felt ‘intimidated’ because people ‘feel he is some kind of super . actor and they think he’s lovely and always “William Roache what a good . man he is”, you know, you don’t stand a chance if you went forward’. Roache, . who was arrested last May, denies any sexual contact with the girls, . telling police he had slept with many women but always with consent and . none was underage. On screen: The actor's on screen wife, Deidre, played by Anne Kirkbride, will give evidence during the four week trial, the court heard . However . Miss Whyte said the jury may be struck by the fact that while the women . did not know each other – apart from the sisters – they gave strikingly . similar accounts. Roache, of . Wilmslow, Cheshire, who has not appeared on Coronation Street since he . was charged, denies five counts of indecent assault and two of rape . involving five girls then aged between 12 and 16.

With £2 million to spend, a house buyer might expect to be able to find something rather spectacular. But those shopping around the Kensington area of West London should think again. These pictures show the £2 million, two-bedroom home which even estate agents admit is a 'wreck'. This West London property, which even estate agents admit is a 'wreck', went on the market for £2 million . While it may look respectable from the front - situated at the end of a tidy row of terraced homes near Hyde Park - the inside of the home tells a different story. Behind the smart front door, potential buyers are met with exposed brickwork, tired floorboards and crumbling plaster. Even the estate agent, Crayson, described the house as ‘wrecksville’ and warned potential buyers that it would cost a fortune to renovate. For the same price, a nine-bedroom, Grade II-listed home could be bought with Savills in Somerset. In Manchester, meanwhile, a collection of 37 properties are being offered to buyers for the same price by one business. And in Bristol, a two-bedroom home requiring full restoration would set a buyer back approximately £100,000. But despite the home costing 11 times the average across England and Wales, there was said to be no shortage of interest. Behind the front door, guests are met with exposed brickwork, tired floorboards and crumbling plaster . While it may look respectable from the front - situated at the end of a tidy row of terraced homes near to Hyde Park - the inside tells a different story . The home, on Abingdon Road, is just off Kensington High Street and a short distance from Hyde Park and some of London's best-known areas. Floorplans show it currently has two bedrooms and three reception rooms. Crayson described the property as a ‘complete wreck in one of London's great residential areas and everything to play for’. The advert added: ‘The property represents an epic opportunity to buy a shell, create the perfect space and live somewhere that is actually made for you. ‘It's the sort of house where you can imagine retiring and pottering about in the village vibe that, amazingly, still exists in the quiet back streets of Kensington.’ While the front may look appealing, the view from the back garden gives a better indication of what lies inside . Crayson described it as a 'complete wreck in one of London's great residential areas and everything to play for' The property is still advertised on the website of Crayson and Zoopla with a 'sold' sign. However, it is understood the owner has now decided to take the property off the market and renovate it themselves. Last year, 193 houses in Kensington sold for more than £1 million with an average price of £2.87 million. Car parking spaces alone sell for £300,000 in the area. Zoopla figures show the average asking price in 'W8' is £5.1 million.","West London house may look appealing from the front, but the inside and back garden tell a different story .

Fat-burning diet pills which have caused 60 deaths worldwide should be banned in the UK, victims’ families have urged. Campaigners have called for DNP pills to be classified as a class-C drug so possession of the pills would be a crime. Four British people have been killed from taking the drug, and more than 60 deaths have been attributed to DNP worldwide. Campaigners have called for DNP diet pills - which have killed 60 people worldwide - to be banned in the UK . DNP - dinitrophenol - is readily available on the internet in £30 or £50 batches. It causes the body’s metabolism to speed up, burning fat while causing drastic overheating. Warnings online such as ‘the excessive and improper use of DNP can lead to death!’ often do not deter dieters. On one site, a user said: ‘DNP is pure hell. Body temp can spike as high as 105-108 degrees… any higher and your brain will fry and you’d better be prepared to make funeral arrangements.’ DNP user Chris Mapletoft, 18, died in June 2013 just one day after taking his last A-level exam. His mother, Lesley, believes that if the drug had been criminalised her son would have been put off. She told The Guardian: ‘Chris was not a wayward child. I’m sure he would not have taken it if he knew it was an illegal drug. He was very against drugs. He didn’t smoke, didn’t really drink.’ DNP user Chris Mapletoft, 18, died in June 2013 just one day after taking his last A-level exam . Mrs Mapletoft said although her son was sporty, he was not a body builder and she believes he took DNP in order to look ‘perfect’ for a holiday to Ayia Napa with his peers. Police told her that if they tracked down the owner of the website who sold the pills to her son they may be able to caution them. She added: ‘And you just think, sorry, our son has died and other people have died – caution? That’s something you get if you nick a bar of chocolate, isn’t it?’ Other British victims include Sean Cleathero, a 28-year-old father who died last March; Sarmad Alladin, an 18-year-old bodybuilder who died in February; and Sarah Houston, a medicine student who died in September 2012. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority is powerless to ban use of DNP as a drug because it is not a pharmaceutical. The Food Standards Agency can step in if DNP is sold for human consumption, but as the horsemeat scandal showed, enforcement against overseas suppliers is problematic. Cheryl Gillan, MP for Chesham and Amersham, met with families and representatives of the police and regulatory authorities about the best course of action. She said: ‘I’m looking at whether it will be helpful to have DNP brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act [as a class-C]. My aim would be to make sure that this drug is not marketed as a weight-loss drug.’ Another victim: Sarah Houston, a medicine student from Leeds University, died in September 2012 .","Campaigners call for DNP pills to be become known as a class-C drug .

Lord Tebbit insisted people ought to know that if they 'stuff themselves silly' they will get fat . Lord Tebbit says fat people have only themselves to blame for their obesity if they insist on ‘stuffing themselves silly’. The former Tory chairman said people’s ‘stupid actions’ in eating ‘rubbish’ foods all day was behind the rise in obesity. He was cheered in the House of Lords when he told peers that rather than setting up government initiatives to persuade  people to eat more healthily, ministers should simply tell them that weight is a matter of individual responsibility. Scientists say that by 2050, half of women, almost two-thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese. But earlier this week the National Obesity Forum said these predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’. Former employment secretary Lord Tebbit said: ‘People ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly with high-calorie rubbish foods, they will get fat. ‘It’s their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely trying to divorce  people from the consequences of their own stupid actions.’ As some peers cheered Lord Tebbit’s comments, Health Minister Earl Howe appeared to agree with him. He said: ‘You are absolutely right to place your finger on this central point – that it is in the end up to individuals themselves to take responsibility for their own state of health.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week called for ‘some real national soul-searching’ about how the UK can ‘grip this problem’.’ The NHS has warned that the statistics . paint ‘an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in . England shows no signs of abating anytime soon’. People had to stop eating 'rubbish' and understand the consequences of their 'own stupid actions', Lord Tebbit added . A national obesity forum report yesterday suggested forecasts that half the UK population will be obese by 2050 may ‘underestimate’ the problem. Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon University Hospitals, South London, said obesity was ‘the greatest threat to health worldwide’. He said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol combined, and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘denial’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products. Dr Malhotra said the companies were using the same tactics as those used by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that smoking caused lung cancer. ‘Junk food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary drinks, with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of society, including children,’ he said.","Ex-Tory party chairman dismisses obesity 'forums and nonsense'

Death: An inquest jury found Mark Duggan was lawfully killed, sparking anger among his supporters . The angry mob who ran amok after the Mark Duggan inquest will face no charges, a senior officer revealed last night. Supporters of the gangster hurled abuse and threats inside and outside the court last week after a jury returned a verdict of lawful killing. Yesterday, MPs questioned whether failing to take legal action against those responsible for the ‘hail of spittle and abuse’ would ‘bring the law and police enforcement into disrepute’. But Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told Westminster’s Home Affairs committee ‘emotions’ had been running high after the verdict and he did not plan to pursue ‘every minor offence’. Only a single incident of throwing a missile outside the court is being investigated. Supporters of father-of-six Duggan reacted furiously after a jury ruled he was lawfully killed by police officers who stopped his taxi in August 2011. His death sparked days of riots in London and other cities and police fear further disorder following the verdict. After a three-month inquest, the jury decided last Wednesday that Duggan was unarmed when he was killed but police were right to use lethal force. There were cries of ‘murderers’ from the public gallery and abuse was aimed at jurors. Outbursts continued in the corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice and some supporters smashed a door. Outside, Mr Rowley struggled to be heard on the steps of the court as the crowd shouted ‘murdering scum’. He admitted that some jurors had felt threatened, saying: ‘The intensity of emotion was of concern to some of them.’ But he said no arrests would be made in relation to scenes inside the court. The officer said the Coroner had raised no prospect of action for contempt of court. Emotions running high: Protestors allegedly spat and shouted abuse outside the Royal Courts of Justice as Assistant Met Police Commissioner Mark Rowley (centre) tried to deliver a statement on Mark Duggan's death . Anger: Tensions ran high outside the court, where dozens of journalists and supporters of Duggan gathered . After the verdict, Mark Duggan's aunt Carole (centre) told reporters her nephew had been 'executed' But Tory MP Mark Reckless asked: ‘Is there not a requirement to be seen to uphold the law? If people see on their TV screens an officer being spat at and no action is taken, does that not bring the law and police enforcement into disrepute?’ Mr Rowley said he had never before faced such a ‘hail of spittle and abuse’ but added: ‘The shouting and the spitting – we left it. I am not going to follow up every minor offence. I was the prime victim.’ He criticised ‘some public figures [who] have questioned the jury’s verdict’ – an apparent reference to Labour MP Diane Abbott, who called the conclusion ‘baffling’. The officer revealed that some gangsters had ‘chanced their luck’ after the verdict, believing the Met would go soft on gun crime. ‘They were wrong and some will go to prison as a result,’ Mr Rowley said. He added that the Met will have a senior officer in charge of ‘community relations’ by the end of the week.","Shooting victim's supporters hurled abuse at members of the inquest jury .

The announcement, made on an account believed to have been set up by the disgraced 63-year-old, came as it also emerged Flowers was still being paid a church salary of more than £11,000, despite being suspended. Flowers, a Methodist minister for more than 40 years, was questioned by police for four hours over alleged drugs offences yesterday. He was bailed after the interview in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Under the username @PaulFlowersRVD, Flowers is believed to have tweeted: 'Going to write a book on my recent exploits, A no holds barred version of events' (sic). MailOnline previously reported how Flowers was understood to have taken to Twitter to apologise for his antics and to pledge to go to rehab. Although Flowers did not respond to requests to confirm that he was behind the account on the social networking sites, sources close to the minister said that it was genuine. The cleric also used the same photograph of him standing beside a Christmas tree as on his newly-created Facebook account. A spokesman for the Methodist Church meanwhile has confirmed the former preacher is still being paid for his role as a minister in the Bradford South Methodist Circuit despite not carrying out any of his duties while he is suspended.

A Texas hunting group has announced it will auction off a permit to kill an endangered black rhinoceros - with proceeds going to the cause of saving the black rhinoceros. It's a plan that even the Dallas Safari Club (DSC) has admitted seems 'counterintuitive' and has raised ire among wildlife organizations. Ben Carter, the DSC's executive director, says Namibia has an annual quota to kill five black rhinos and has 'selected' the club to auction one of them. Endangered: Only about 5,000 black rhinos remain in Africa and around 1,795 live in Namibia, where the DSC winner will to shoot one . Ridicule: The idea of killing an animal in order to save it has drawn widespread scorn . 'First and foremost, this is about saving the black rhino,' said Ben Carter, DSC executive director. “ . 'There is a biological reason for this hunt, and it’s based on a fundamental premise of modern wildlife management: populations matter; individuals don’t. By removing counterproductive individuals from a herd, rhino populations can actually grow.' Namibia has a black rhino population of 1,795 animals. The critically endangered species has been decimated by poachers who hunt it for its valuable horn, and habitat loss. Since the mid-1970s, the population has been reduced by about 90 per cent. The DSC says the auction could generate up to $1 million for rhino conservation. Decimated: Black rhinos are hunted for their horn, which is in high demand in China for traditional medical treatments . The idea of hunting an endangered species in order to preserve it has drawn widespread scorn. 'It's like the old saying, If you love something, set it free. Then, when it has a bit of a head start, open fire,' Colbert said. He suggested facetiously that instead . of killing one rhino, all 5,000 remaining black rhinos should be shot, . which would raise $3.7 billion which could be used to keep one remaining . rhino safely confined. 'I believe this is the only practical way to save the species,' Colbert said. The black rhino hunt permit will be auctioned in January, but there is already a petition against it. 'It . is bad enough that paid poachers kill for the horn's imaginary . medicinal properties, but what is far worse is that the thoughtless pay . for sport hunting resulting in yet one more dead endangered animal just . so they can hang the decapitated head on their wall only to puff about . it over cocktails,' writes Cindy Arent, the originator of the petition. Al Jazeera reports that poachers in South Africa kill at least one rhino every day. 'Poachers . come by helicopter and dart a rhino from the air with a powerful . tranquilizer, a drug three thousand times more powerful than morphine. 'As [the rhino] succumbs to deep sedation, they take a chainsaw to her face. The machine's sharp teeth tear into her skull, removing her nasal cavities, exposing parts of her brain. [The horn] will be sold to a middle man for a small fortune.' Powdered black rhino horn is highly sought after in China, where it is used to treat various ailments.","The Dallas Safari Club will auction of a permit to kill a black rhino in Namibia .

From Bombay to Buckingham Palace, from the Highlands to the Taj Mahal, there was only one way to describe the news. Well... Goodness Gracious Me, Prince William is descended from Indian ancestors. The genetic link emerged after painstaking research going back two centuries to the story of a Scottish merchant’s love for the Indian sweetheart who became his wife. Their liaison began a DNA trail which eventually led to Princess Diana, and will ultimately produce Britain’s first part-Indian king when William ascends to the throne. The revelation was greeted with delight in some circles in India yesterday – followed by calls for William to capitalise on his newly revealed heritage by paying his first royal visit to the former colony. But 6,000 miles away, in a tiny village in Herefordshire, one woman already knew the secret. Sarah Drury was told decades ago she was related to royalty through Diana’s DNA chain – and never bothered to speak about it outside her family. Her grandmother revealed the link to Lady Diana Spencer, as she then was, before she became a queen-in-waiting by marrying the Prince of Wales. ‘I was only young at the time and it didn’t mean a great deal to me,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘My grandmother explained that her mother had six daughters, and that one of those daughters was the great grandmother of Frances Shand Kydd, Diana’s mother. I didn’t really know who Frances Shand Kydd was at the time because I only heard the name when Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer married.’ In the know: Sarah Jane Drury shares an Indian gene with the late Dianna Princess of Wales . Mrs Drury, a 66-year-old retired interior design company executive and her husband Charles, a former stockbroker, now run a B&B in Turnastone, near Hereford. Late last year she was contacted by genetic expert Professor Jim Wilson, from Edinburgh University, to invite her to help track Prince William’s lineage. He believed Mrs Drury was a distant cousin of the Prince after investigating a line that led to Bombay, the western port city of Surat, and Eliza Kewark, whom he traced as the prince’s great, great, great, great, great grandmother. The DNA type that revealed the link is passed on by females and provides ‘unassailable’  evidence, according to Prof Wilson. ‘I got an email out of the blue and he asked me if I would spit into a bottle for him,’ Mrs Drury said. ‘He came back and told me the link. Although I knew there was this connection with Princess Diana I didn’t know until then what the relationship was.’ History: Joan Heather Powell (1917-1994), mother of Sarah Jane Gofton-Salmond, now Sarah Jane Drury. They share an Indian gene with the late Dianna Princess of Wales . She said she was pleased to unravel the precise link – and proud to discover her Indian heritage, although she has never visited. ‘It fits into place because my brother and I both had very black hair and we both tan very easily. We always made a bit of a joke about a mystery ancestor and where it all came from.’ She added: ‘I’m delighted to be associated with India … perhaps I should visit now.’ The clue in the family tree was in her grandmother’s name of Forbes. Some 204 years ago a 21-year-old East India Company merchant called Theodore Forbes arrived in Surat. There he met Eliza, an Indian of Armenian extraction, the sister-in-law of his agent there. They fell in love and are believed to have married in 1812. The partnership produced a daughter, Katherine, known as Kitty, later that year. Their son Alexander was born two years later; a second son, Fraser, followed – but he died at the age of six months. If some of the names are familiar now, incidentally, it is because generations later, Diana’s brother Earl Spencer would name two of his daughters Eliza and Kitty. Theodore got a job through a relative with Forbes and Co, a trading company based in Bombay. The distance from Surat – plus changing social attitudes that frowned on relationships between white traders and local women – meant the couple led separate lives. Eliza pleaded in a series of letters to be allowed to join her husband. A friend advised Theodore to despatch Kitty, then six, to the Forbes family home in Boyndlie, Aberdeenshire, which he did. But two years later, after Theodore decided to return to Britain, he died on the voyage. Further evidence of the DNA link came from another cousin, 79-year-old retired journalist and TV scriptwriter Robin Dewhurst, from Petersfield,  in Hampshire. The father-of-two said he too received an unexpected letter last year from Prof Wilson asking him to provide a saliva sample for testing, which he did. He then received a letter back informing him he was probably 1/64th Indian. He added: ‘All this past has been revealed just by spitting into a test tube. It’s fascinating how through DNA you can recapture the past.’","Sarah Drury discovered she was related to Prince through Diana's DNA .

An obese mother-of-three lost half her body weight and dropped eight dress sizes after swapping unhealthy eating habits for a healthy meal plan. Maria Doherty, 46, who once tipped the scales at 22st, struggled to climb stairs, and was on the cusp of diabetes, shed 10 stone and turned her life around after getting a wake-up call about the consequences of her unhealthy diet. Today, weighing in at 11st and having taken up long-distance running, she says her experience should encourage anyone who fears they are too overweight to begin living healthily. Maria pictured in 2002, once tipped the scales at 22st and struggled to climb stairs as doctors warned her she was on the edge of diabetes . Maria has now dropped an amazing 10 stone from a size 28 and 22st (left) to 11st and a fit size 12 (right) She said: 'I never imagined I would get this far. Now I love my life. I feel as if there’s nothing I can’t do.' Maria saw her weight steadily increase due to her habit of choosing unhealthy, high calorie options for evening meals. She said: 'My weakness was junk food. I would always sort out dinner for the children and wait until later to arrange my own meal, by which time it was easier to order a takeaway. 'I would only have one square meal a day. I tricked myself into overeating at that meal because I wasn’t sure how long it would be until I ate again.' Maria was ordered to wear a blood pressure monitor by doctors concerned about her deteriorating health . Maria's size increased in tandem with her age and while at age 16, Maria was wearing size 16 clothes by the time she reached 18, she could only fit into size 18. By the time she was 40, she wore size 28 clothes and weighed 22 stone and found her weight was beginning to seriously impact her well-being. In late 2009 she was ordered to wear a blood pressure monitor by doctors concerned about her deteriorating health. She said: 'I was in the first stages of diabetes, and there was talk of putting me on blood pressure tablets permanently. It was a wake-up call. Maria's weight slowly increased through out her teens and by the time she was 40 she was a 28 and suffering as a result of her size . 'I was challenged by everything I did. Walking upstairs left me red-faced and struggling for breath.' By 2010 Mrs Doherty’s sons had left the family home and she had the opportunity to undertake an intensive exercise regime. She said: 'I was daunted. I thought I was too far gone to lose weight - that my health was too damaged. My goal was to get down to a size 20 and shed three or four stone. 'I cleared out the cupboard of all my unhealthy snacks and started eating three times a day.' Maria, pictured at her wedding in November 2003, says her husband and two sons were very supportive during her weight loss . Before beginning her weight loss journey, Maria an office manager, rarely ate breakfast, and binged on fatty foods at either lunch or dinner time. Her new healthy lifestyle involves a typical breakfast of a grain bar or cereal, followed by salad for lunch and pre-prepared calorie-controlled meals such as baked salmon for dinner, with apples for snacks during the day. She said: 'There were times when I had real cravings, but as people complimented me for losing the weight, it spurred me on.' She was encouraged in her efforts by her husband of ten years Dave, 47, who works as a design engineer, and her sons Ian, 26, Christopher, 23 and Stephen, 20. Maria shows off her incredible transformation holding up her old size 28 trousers, having now lost 10 stone . She said: 'Dave was fantastic. He adores me as I am but knew I was losing weight for the right reasons.' After the first week of her new diet Mrs Doherty had lost 9lbs. Ten months later, she had lost an impressive 5st. She . said: 'I realised that if I didn’t exercise, the excess skin would just . hang, so I started visiting the gym four times and week and found a . personal trainer.' Keiron . O’Donnell, her personal trainer at the Shaw Hill Leisure Club in . Chorley, surprised her in August 2011, when she was 14st, by announcing . that he had entered her for the London Marathon. She . said: 'I was petrified. I thought: ‘I’m 45 years old, I’ve abused my . body for so many years, how on earth can someone who was on the brink of . diabetes even consider running a marathon?’ 'I was terrified I would have a heart attack - I wasn’t aware that your heart regenerates if you look after it.' Maria proudly holds an award commemorating her London Marathon achievement, after completely the race in just under 5 hours 10 minutes . Maria is now healthy and happy, and running has become a huge part of her life. She hopes her transformation will inspire others who feel they are too unhealthy or overweight to make changes . She ran the race in 2012 raising £3,000 for the Carer’s Trust, completing the course in just under 5h10m. Today Maria, of Chorley, Lancashire weighs 11st and is a healthy size 12 but is still careful to visit the gym regularly and maintain a healthy diet. She said: 'It felt amazing to have achieved so much and have raised so much for charity. I would like my next big race to be the Venice marathon. 'In my wildest dreams I never imagined I would be smaller than I was when I was at school. 'The world is my oyster, but I need to be vigilant. I need to be careful about my eating habits and avoiding yo-yoing in weight. 'To anyone worried that their lives are too unhealthy for them to do anything about it, if they’re worried they’ll never be able to change, I would say ‘anything’s possible’. A slimming club and friends can be useful for giving you support. 'I never would have believed I could this far, but I’m proof that if you stick at something, you can achieve your goals.'","Erratic eating and penchant for junk food saw her weight steadily rise .

The recession appears to have had an impact on our health with both hospital admissions and minor issues increasing during the period. Google searches for stomach ulcers and headache symptoms increased during the recession, as well as hernia and chest pain. Bad times: Google searches for stomach ulcer symptoms increased by 228 per cent and headache symptoms nearly tripled during the recession . By analysing online queries between December 2008 and December 2011, researchers found a significant rise in searches for stress-related illnesses. The US study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, saw an increase in Google searches for stomach ulcer symptoms by 228 per cent and headache symptoms by 193 per cent. It also found that U.S. Google queries for psychological distress increased by 16 per cent for each one per cent increase in home foreclosures month-on-month. ‘By the end of the great recession in 2011, queries were still substantially higher than before the recession,’ Author Dr John W. Ayers, a research professor at San Diego State University, said. ‘People were not getting better with the economy. People were potentially much sicker.’ Sickening figures: It also found that U.S. Google queries for psychological distress increased by 16 per cent for each one per cent increase in home foreclosures month-on-month . Another US study has found that hospital admissions increase when stock market drops. Finance professors Joseph Engelberg and Christopher Parsons at U.C. San Diego compared the state of the market with California hospital data between 1983 and 2011. People admitted during economic downturns particularly complained about anxiety, depression or other conditions of mental or emotional stress, KMBZ reported. The study found that ‘one standard deviation drop in U.S. stock prices (roughly -1.5 per cent) increases admissions to California hospitals by about 0.26 percent over the next two days.' A third study in North Carolina from 2010 showed that the market crash in 2008 was associated with a large increase in heart attacks, concluding that the state of recession also had an impact on our physical health.","Google searches for stress-related illnesses rose during the recession .

The most comprehensive study of its kind concluded that babies born as a result of fertility treatment are more likely to be severely underweight, stillborn, born prematurely or die only a few weeks after birth. Scientists analysed records from more than 300,000 births that took place in Australia between 1986 and 2002.

Researchers found that women who had any kind of fertility treatment were roughly twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth, a premature birth, have a very underweight baby or a child that died in the first month as the ones who conceived naturally. And when IVF was looked at exclusively, they discovered that the likelihood of complications was up to five times higher. The riskiest births of all involved women who had suffered fertility problems but then managed to conceive naturally. Although these women tended not to have been treated at a fertility clinic, many could have been prescribed fertility-boosting drugs by their GP – or may have bought them over the internet in their desperation to start a family. Complications: An analysis of 300,000 births in Australia found babies born as a result of fertility treatment were more likely to be underweight, stillborn, born prematurely or die after a few weeks . This meant they could have been taking more than the recommended dose, and would not have benefited from the regular, intensive health checks that a clinic would have provided. The team of scientists from Adelaide University said the complications could have been caused by the drugs used during treatment, or by the medical problems that had originally led the women to use IVF. Complications could be caused by the drugs used during fertility treatment, researchers from Adelaide University found.

And he explained that the powerful drugs used to boost the number of eggs a woman produces create a ‘hormonal hang-over’ which can affect both the womb and the placenta. Professor Davies also warned that there is an ‘urgent need’ to track the long-term health of babies born through IVF. He added: ‘It is appropriate that we are informed of the risks associated with the therapy and the source of that risk, so we can make informed decisions.’ Around 50,000 women in the UK have IVF each year leading to 17,000 births. Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the London Create fertility clinic, said doctors should make IVF ‘as safe as possible’ by not using high doses of drugs. But Dr Dagan Wells, an Oxford University fertility expert, said: ‘Although this study suggests the risk of some adverse outcomes is higher in pregnancies conceived using IVF, the overall risk of these problems remains low. ‘As such, I doubt that these findings will deter many infertile couples from using IVF.’","Scientists analysed records from more than 300,000 births .
