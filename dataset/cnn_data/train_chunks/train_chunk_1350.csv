"Pro-vaccination campaigners have taken to social media to express their outrage over a prolific U.S. osteopath, who believes in not immunising children, coming to Australian shores. Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney in February and March. The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally, and Birth, Baby and Beyond. Scroll down for video . Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring Australia in February and March . People will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high-profile anti-vaccination campaigner, with tickets ranging from $125 to $200. On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'. Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'. But Dr Tenpenny's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message, with Stop the AVN - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge. The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond, and will be held in Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Victoria . Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site . Stop the AVN's Dave Hawkes told Daily Mail Australia the group's concern was Dr Tenpenny 'peddled misinformation'. 'She’s giving information that's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children,' he said. Dr Hawkes - who has a PhD in HIV research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining Dr Tenpenny, like Isaac Goldman, were spruiking homeopathic vaccines, which are 'essentially water'. 'The evidence shows they don’t work… and leaves their kids susceptible,' Dr Hawkes said. 'Recently a seven-month-old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough.' One of Stop the AVN's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention. 'I'm writing to the Hons Sussan Ley and Fiona Nash (health minister and assistant health minister). Vaccines are recommended by every state body in Australia. They are incentivised by our federal govt,' one woman said on Facebook. People have taken to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign . Some have even taken to the Facebook pages of venues slamming them for holding the events . While others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars. 'I am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in March... Children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation, is the small amount of money you are going to get... worth it?' a Facebook user wrote on Melbourne's Bayview Eden page. Another wrote: 'Cannot believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in March, disgusting. Never staying here, ever.' This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'. 'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said. 'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.' Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases. He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'. 'It’s just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.","Sherri Tenpenny is a osteopath who believes in not vaccinating children .

"A Townsville grandmother had been living in fear of some family members before she was brutally murdered in her home. Ruth Dodd, 71, was stabbed to death at her house in Heatley, a suburb of Townsville, on Friday. The well-liked community volunteer had been warned by relatives to leave her home once and for all after threats and harassment from other family members. On Saturday police questioned a woman and a man over the murder. ‘(The woman being questioned) was a high drug user. She was always after money,’ one of Ms Dodd's relatives told The Sunday Mail. Scroll down for video . Ruth Dodd was brutally stabbed to death in her home at Heatley, a suburb of Townsville. She had allegedly been 'threatened' by relatives in the past . ‘(Ms Dodd) kept telling her ‘no more, no more’. ‘I know they always chased her for money. She has been threatened time and time again. ‘We’ve been trying to talk her into packing up and leaving for quite some time. We also spoke to her about taking out restraining orders.’ It was also alleged by the relative that Ms Dodd had been under pressure from someone who wanted her home. A focus of the police investigation was her Astra hatchback car found at Aitkenvale. On Saturday police questioned a woman and a man over the murder . Ms Dodd is pictured in a WIN TV news story in 2006 about the environment. She was a volunteer for the Royal Flying Doctor Service . A heated argument was heard at Ms Dodd's house by neighbours before the murder, with one local resident knocking on her door, but nobody answered. Police were called and made the grim discovery. In 2010 she appeared in the Townsville Bulletin newspaper concerning a story about her house being broken into on eight separate times. A relative alleged that Ms Dodd knew who was breaking in, but although she took security measures to stop people from breaking in, it made no difference. ‘She said to me one day she didn’t think the police were taking her seriously,’ the relative told the told The Sunday Mail. The brutal murder shocked local residents as Ms Dodd, a mother of five, had lived in Townsville since the 1970s . ‘I said ‘if you don’t do anything you’re going to wake up and find yourself dead one day’. ‘They smashed her window, her kitchen bench. They even entered the house through the back through the toilet window. ‘They smashed the front door down. I saw all that when I was up there one day. It was always getting broken into.’ The brutal murder shocked local residents as Ms Dodd, a mother of five, had lived in Townsville since the 1970s and was a volunteer for the Royal Flying Doctor Service for whom she had won many awards and accolades.

"Doctors who cannot speak 'very good English' should be banned from practising in the UK, Nigel Farage said. The Ukip leader said it was 'scandalous' that not enough doctors and nurses were being trained in Britain, meaning thousands are brought in from overseas. And he insisted that major savings could be made in the NHS budget 'without any shadow of a doubt there is'. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage said it was 'scandalous' that not enough doctors and nurses were being trained in Britain, meaning thousands are brought in from overseas . Mr Farage revealed that over the coming months senior Ukip figures will use a series of speeches to set out a raft of new policies, to counter the impression that the party is a one-man band obsessed with immigration and Europe. In the first major announcement, he called for a ban on doctors being hired in the NHS if they cannot speak English. But speaking on Sunday he appeared unaware that two years ago the General Medical Council announced new checks to be carried out on the language skills of medical staff. All NHS doctors have to pass a language test. Amid a crackdown on poor language skills, it emerged in July that 43 per cent of doctors sanctioned by the GMC were from overseas. The GMC has released a list of the 476 doctors in the UK ‘on undertakings’ after concerns were raised about their conduct, seen as a ‘final chance’ rather than strike doctors off the Medical Register. In July last year it emerged that 43 per cent of doctors sanctioned by the GMC were from overseas . Almost everywhere he went in 2014, Mr Farage was seen with a pint . Nigel Farage has given up drinking alcohol for January, he admitted. The Ukip leader, who has built his reputation on being seen with a pint glass in his hand, wearily conceded that after a festive season of boozing: 'I need a break.' He plans to spend the rest of the month supping orange juice, but refused to give up his treasured cigarettes. Almost everywhere he went in 2014, Mr Farage was seen with a pint, but now he has confessed that his body needs a respite from downing pints of ale. 'I started before the new year,' he told Sky News. 'I am not being particularly virtuous about this. I just… I need a break. It does us all good to have a break every now and again.' Asked if it was a total break from alcohol, he replied: 'Oh yes, absolutely. But pressed on whether he has also given up smoking, he admitted defeat: 'Oh no, I will think about that later in the year. In total 135 (28 per cent) of the doctors are from countries outside Europe, 66 (14 per cent) from EU countries, six from non-EU European counties (one per cent) and 269 (57 per cent) from the UK. The NHS careers website clearly states that registered doctors must pass a test under the International English Language Testing System. But Mr Farage insisted the problem continues, and voters were concerned about it. He told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: 'Don't we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? 'And isn't it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country? 'I don't know about you, whether you've ever been to a GP that didn't speak very good English, and it's something that people out there are talking about. 'The whole point about immigration, whether it impacts on the health service or elsewhere, is that we have to have proper integration.' The NHS careers website which sets out the requirements for foreign doctors working in the health service clearly states that they must demonstrate a command of the English language before registering with the General Medical Council (GMC). The website states: 'Applicants who register with the GMC must also demonstrate competence in the English language by achieving a specific mark in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).' Mr Farage said people who do not speak English should not be employed in the NHS but refused to commit to sacking those already working in the service. Asked whether he would sack non-English speakers in the NHS, the Ukip leader said: 'If people don't speak English and they are dealing with English-speaking patients then surely they shouldn't be employed in the first place.' Mr Farage also said Ukip would set out policies for saving money within the NHS, suggesting that middle management staff could be cut. But he acknowledged that overall health spending would have to rise to deal with Britain's ageing population. Asked whether there is scope for savings within the NHS, Mr Farage said: 'Without any shadow of a doubt there is, although overall health spending is going to go up over the next few years because our population is rising so rapidly. 'So there's no way around that - this is going to be costing us more money in a few years' time than it is now. That doesn't mean that it can't be more efficient. 'The savings are clear, aren't they, in the sense that the growth of middle management staff in the NHS since 1997, it's gone up by 48 per cent. 'Don't tell me there aren't efficiencies that can't be made, there are.'","Ukip leader says it is 'scandalous' that Britain doesn't train enough doctors .

"Selma, the civil rights movie about Martin Luther King, was made without using any direct quotation from the man for fear of being sued by his family, it has emerged. The Hollywood film, starring David Oyelowo as King, features setpiece orations from the events around his marches from Selma, Alabama, to state capital Montgomery - but they are deliberate approximations rather than his actual words. Filmmakers Paramount, who released the movie on December 25 in the U.S., wanted to use his actual words, but studiously avoided it so they would not be sued by his famously litigious descendants. Scroll down for video . Not quite word perfect: Selma, starring David Oyelowo (above) as Martin Luther King, does not use the activists's exact words in its script . The dream: King, pictured above giving his I Have A Dream speech in 1963, would have been 'scandalized' by his family's determination to make money out of his work, according to his biographer . King's speeches are protected under copyright, and the rights to use them has already been licensed to Steven Spielberg for a film which is yet to be produced, Britain's Sunday Times reported. As a result key parts of the pivotal protests marches in 1965 have been rewritten to dodge the rights issue. For instance, King's chant of 'Give us the ballot' was tweaked to be 'Give us the vote'. While an accusing demand spoken over the body of a protester is rendered in the film as  'Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?' - in reality he asked 'Who killed him?' An earlier account by the Hollywood Reporter said that Paramount tried to negotiate rights from Dreamworks and Warner Bros, who are linked to the Spielberg project, but failed. They did not approach King's descendants directly, the Reporter said, realizing it was a lost cause. A spokesman for the film said: 'There were no negotiations, - the film does not use any copyrighted material.' King's family, who run Intellectual Properties Management Inc to protect and license his work, have previous sued USA Today and CBS for reproducing parts of his speeches without paying for rights first. Litigious: King's children Dexter (left) Bernice (second left) and Martin Luther III (right), pictured with their mother Coretta Scott King (center) have successfully sued media outlets for using King's words without permission, and levies an $800,000 fee for a statue of him on the National Mall . When the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation was fundraising to install a statue in King's honor in Washington, D.C.'s National Mall, they were charged a total of more than $800,000 to inscribe some of his writings into the marble. Historian and King biographer David Garrow has previously said the civil rights leader would be 'absolutely scandalized by the profiteering behavior of his children'. However, he said that the changes did not seriously compromise Selma, which he said 'captures him very nicely, while evading the clutches of the greedy family'.","Film, about 1965 civil rights marches in Alabama, doesn't quote directly .

"Mike Penning, the Justice Minister, will close a legal loophole to ensure driving bans for those jailed for causing deaths start when they are released . Dangerous drivers who have killed on the roads in the UK will banned from getting behind the wheel for longer under new plans being considered by the Government. At the moment driving bans begin as soon as sentences begin, which means most people jailed for causing death by dangerous driving serve out their bans while in prison. But under a new scheme announced by Mike Penning, the Justice Minister, the bans will only come into force once offenders have left prison - keeping dangerous drivers off the roads for longer. He called the current system - allowing offenders to get behind the wheel soon after being released - was 'abhorrent.' 'If you have lost a loved one to a motorist who was drunk, driving recklessly or using a mobile phone, it is nothing short of an insult to see the killer leave prison and get straight behind the wheel of a car again,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. The new measures will build on a pledge by ministers to allow judges to extend the period that dangerous drivers who cause deaths are kept off the roads. Campaign group RoadPeace said that fewer than one in 10 drivers who caused deaths are banned from getting back behind the wheel for more than three years. Mr Penning said he plans to use powers in the 2009 Coroners and Justice Act to ensure driving bans for dangerous drivers who cause deaths begin only on the day they leave prison. He said the rules could be in force in weeks. Campaigners have also called for reckless drivers to be given longer sentences, with around just two thirds of drivers convicted of causing death by dangerous or careless driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol being jailed for five years or less. The maximum sentence is 14 years in prison. Government plans to give judges more powers to impose longer driving bans have stalled recently and have been stuck during debate stages at the House of Lords and House of Commons. The new regulations could affect the sentences of dangerous drivers like Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) who was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right) The new rules could affect drivers like Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 who killed a young solicitors clerk when he got behind the wheel drunk, and was texting as he drove along. Eccleston-Todd, of Newport in the Isle of Wight, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into 28-year-old Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. She later died of her injuries. He was jailed for six years and banned from driving for eight, after which he will have to complete an extended driving test.","Drivers who cause death on the roads to be banned from driving for longer .

"A former top model is among several women who have refused to answer questions about their dealings with Jeffrey Epstein under oath, including whether Prince Andrew was involved with under-age girls. Adriana Ross, who moved to Florida from her native Poland in 2002, was hired to work at billionaire Epstein’s Florida mansion and helped to organise his diary. She was interviewed on video in March 2010 by a lawyer for alleged abuse victims as part of civil proceedings against the paedophile financier. But she repeatedly invoked the US constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which protects people against incriminating themselves. Miss Ross was asked: ‘Has Prince Andrew ever been involved with under-age minor females to your knowledge?’ She replied: ‘I refuse to answer.’ Scroll down for video . Diary organiser: Former top model Adriana Ross (right) is among several women who have refused to answer questions about their dealings with Jeffrey Epstein (left) No comment: Nadia Marcinkova, left, and Sarah Kellen, right, pleaded the Fifth Amendment when asked about Prince Andrew . The former model gave the same response when asked if she had ever met Prince Andrew or flown on Epstein’s plane with the royal. Miss Ross did not answer any other questions about her involvement with Epstein. She was one of four women who worked for the billionaire who were named as ‘potential co-conspirators’ in a plea bargain agreement in which they and Epstein were given immunity from future federal prosecution in the US. Two of the others – Epstein’s personal assistant Sarah Kellen and his Yugoslav model girlfriend Nadia Marcinkova – also refused to answer questions. Miss Kellen has been accused in US legal documents of bringing Epstein a succession of under-age girls for sex. During the civil proceedings, she was asked by a lawyer: ‘Would you agree with me that Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein used to share under-aged girls for sexual relations?’ She replied: ‘On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege.’ Miss Marcinkova was asked: ‘Have you ever been made to perform sexually on Prince Andrew?’ She answered simply: ‘Fifth.’ Other women said to have been present when Epstein abused under-age girls have not commented on the latest claims about Andrew. Actress Emmy Tayler (pictured), who was said to be close to Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has also refused to comment . The women have refused to answer questions on whether Prince Andrew (pictured with Epstein, left) was involved with under-age girls. Right, the Prince with Virginia Roberts . They include Johanna Sjoberg, one of the financier’s young personal masseuses, who has previously claimed that she allowed the prince to put his hand on her breast for a photograph in 2001. British-born aspiring actress Emmy Tayler, 40, who was said to be close to Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has refused to comment on her relationship with the billionaire. This weekend there was no answer at an address linked to her in Oxford. A close acquaintance of Andrew last night said his predilection for the high life lies at the root of many of his public travails, and those of his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. ‘The fact is that both Andrew and Sarah love to live a millionaire lifestyle, without having the actually millions to fund it,’ the family friend told the Mail. ‘They are, therefore, drawn to people that can.’ The Duke of York and his ever-present duchess have nurtured a group of eye-wateringly rich friends and acquaintances who can bankroll their love of swanky foreign resorts and private jets. In 2011, Andrew was the guest of Saudi billionaire Mohammed Abdul Laif Jameel on a super yacht moored off Corsica, while in 2010, he was seen on another yacht said to be chartered by a ‘millionaire friend’ – this time in Sardinia.

"The number of homeless Romanians in London has nearly trebled in a year, it was reported today. Some 490 people from the country were seen sleeping rough in the capital’s streets or parks from June to September last year - a sharp increase from the 173 observed in the final quarter of 2013. The figures from the Greater London Authority’s Chain database reveal the rise since European Union restrictions on migration to Britain from Romania were lifted in January 2014. Scroll down for video . Homeless: Romanian migrants pictured camping in an underpass in Park Lane, central London, last October . Alp Mehmet, from campaign group MigrationWatch, told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘This backs up everything we have said about the rise in Romanian arrivals since the lifting of the restrictions. ‘The requirement that migrants, including EU migrants, must be able to support themselves remains in force and should be enforced.’ The figures in a report by journalist Andrew Gilligan included the dozens of Roma beggars known to congregate at Marble Arch, but also show 70 Romanians now sleep rough in the borough of Brent. In addition, they reveal that nearly a fifth of homeless people in London are now Romanian - and the number of Romanian rough sleepers in outer London is up 600 per cent since the end of 2013. Popular area: The figures include the dozens of Roma beggars known to congregate at Marble Arch (pictured) The report follows a Mail on Sunday article last June quoting Westminster Council figures that showed the number of homeless Romanians in central London had tripled from January to May. And last month the newspaper reported how a police notice deterring pickpockets had gone up outside the busy Covent Garden London Underground station - written in Romanian. Meanwhile last October MailOnline reported how a 40-strong group of Romanian beggars sleeping rough under Park Lane in central London demanded: 'We're EU citizens, give us houses'. EU migrants can claim a council house in certain circumstances, but Westminster Council says the problem of the Park Lane camps is currently costing the taxpayer £500,000 a year. Complaints from local residents and businesses include reports of Eastern European gangs begging, washing in fountains, dumping rubbish and defecating in public. Staying in London: European Union restrictions on migration to Britain from Romania were lifted last January . Last year politicians dismissed predictions that there would be a fresh wave of immigration when Bulgarians and Romanians were given unrestricted rights to work in the UK in January 2014. In May, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander called warnings of a rise in Eastern European migration ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ and ‘scaremongering’. His comments came in response to figures showing the number of Bulgarians and Romanians working in the UK had fallen by 4,000 in the three months since employment restrictions were lifted. But the Daily Mail reported last week how more than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure up by almost 50,000 in the past 12 months. The number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years. Data now shows about one in five working-age migrants from Romania and Bulgaria are not in work – a total of 46,000.","490 Romanians sleeping rough in London from June to September 2014 .

"It'll look like a typical winter when bitterly cold temperatures invade parts of the U.S. this week. The good news is that is won't be accompanied by precipitation that turned much of the southern states into a skating rink and it won't be cold enough to freeze your eyeballs or - maybe worse for parents - close schools. First, it will be cold. Chicago will see the tail end of a storm that could leave up to as much as five inches of snow by early Tuesday. After that, Arctic temperatures like those seen in North Dakota and Minnesota on Sunday will rush in — with highs in the single digits. Snow brewing: Chicago is set to be hit by another round of snow early this week - above Sal Evola of the Arlington Heights suburb cleans up his driveway . Slipping into the chill: Steve Drecoll, above, cycles through the Illinois cold, which is set to get even more intense . It'll be a similar story in New York, where rain showers will give way to cold air. By Thursday, 'New York City will be lucky if it hits 20' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees, according to Michael Musher with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. The chill will move south, too. Atlanta will see low temperatures down to about 15 degrees Monday and Tuesday — but there won't be any ice to accompany it. And in the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the Seattle area — and could mean substantial snowfall in the Cascades. Further south in San Francisco - a part of the country that desperately needs the rain - skies will be sunny. A dip in the jet stream means cold air from Canada and points north is plummeting into the eastern two-thirds of the United States. Getting cold: New York City will be lucky to get any warmer than 20 degrees, forecasters said, while parts of Georgia will hit 15 . Wrap up! J.J. Heredia is already braced for the chilly weather in Wichita, Kansas, where he spent Sunday sledding . But forecasters are shying away from calling it a 'polar vortex' - the phrase which took on a life of its own last year, and was blamed for everything from ice storms to the inability of the New York Giants to score touchdowns. But the National Weather Service is skittish about going anywhere near the words that start with P and end with X. The forthcoming cold can be linked to the vortex, Musher pointed out, as the air is coming from near the north pole. But the low-pressure system itself isn't going to sink into the United States this year, just the temperatures that precede it. Meteorologists have a technical term for what the country is now experiencing: Winter. What should people do to prepare for the temperatures? Bundle up. For much of the country, this is the first true taste of winter, so there's a chance people aren't prepared. Dress properly and remember that below-freezing temperatures can cause hypothermia, Musher said. A bright spot: There doesn't seem to be any huge winter storms poised to strike, meaning travel won't be more difficult than it usually is this time of year. Temperatures are expected to be lower than normal for a good chunk of the week, Musher said, but they could rise a bit by the end of the week. But then again, it's only January.","New York City will be 'lucky' to see temperatures above 20 degrees .

"A ride at Lunar Park has left residents of the surrounding areas outraged, prompting some to make submissions to North Sydney Council to have the ride removed. The Hair Raiser, a 37-metre tall ride opened in late 2013 without council approval, has infuriated neighbours due to its height and resulting noise pollution. Neighbours have claimed the ride beams into their apartments and prompts loud screams that are depriving them of sleep, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . The Hair Raiser is a 37-metre tall ride opened in late 2013 without council approval . Neighbours have claimed the ride beams into their apartments and prompts loud screams that are depriving them of sleep . Operators, who argue that thrilling rides have been pivotal to the Luna Park experience since the 1980's, are currently seeking planning approval for the ride. In an application, they have claimed the ride did not have any 'significant adverse impacts' and was helping the park remain in operation. Hair Raiser allows patrons to be elevated to the top of the tower, witnessing sweeping views of the harbour, before plunging at more than 80km/h. It was revealed last year that the operators never obtained the required approvals to erect the ride. North Sydney Council have claimed the ride is 'visually offensive' and unsuitable for its location. Hair Raiser allows patrons to be elevated to the top of the tower, witnessing sweeping views of the harbour, before plunging at more than 80km/h .

"The price of olive oil is expected to soar because of a shortage of olives due to the warm spring weather . The price of olive oil is set to rise because of a period of intensely hot weather in Spain, which affected the harvest. Growers have said 2014 was the worst year for olives in 15 years and a bottle of olive oil could now prove more costly than a bottle of expensive wine. A combination of the poor harvest, as well as large flocks of starlings and insects that eat olives, has created a shortfall of olives and has led experts to dub it a 'black year.' 'This is the worst year in memory,' Pietro Sandali, head of the Italian olive growers consortium, Unaprol, told the Observer. Harvests are down between 40 and 50 per cent on last year in some of the key olive growing regions of Italy, Morocco and Tunisia. In Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean, an exceptionally warm May and June has affected the blooming of trees and the subsequent harvest. During this time moisture is vital to ensure olives grow. The problem was exacerbated in Spain where trees were already under stress after a higher than average harvest last year. The International Olive Council (IOC) said production will hit its lowest level in 15 years and supply was down by almost a third. Prices from producers have increased by more than 100 per cent since the same period last year. Olive trees have also been hit by insects and bacterial blight which can wipe out strong crops. The olive fruit fly or Bactrocera oleae, lays its eggs in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit. Olive trees have been affected by the unseasonably warm weather in May and June as well as insects . In December commodity analysts Mintec said olive oil prices had increased by 30 per cent in just one month. Spain is the largest producer of olive oil while Italy is the largest exporter.","A hot Spring in Mediterranean has adversely affected olive tree growth .

"Herded like cattle into the rusty hull of an ageing merchant vessel, these are the desperate migrants abandoned by people traffickers to drift helplessly at sea. Grainy photos taken on board freighter Blue Sky M reveal how 796 migrants, including women and children, were packed together in squalor on the freezing metal floor. One image was taken by a 35-year-old Syrian, who claims he paid almost £11,000 for himself and his pregnant wife to make the journey. Scroll down for video . Desperate: Photos from the 'ghost ship' Blue Sky M show nearly 800 migrants packed tightly on the floor . And on board a second so-called ghost ship, authorities this week found 359 people shivering and starving who had been crammed into freezing livestock holds on a 50-year-old freighter called Ezadeen. With nowhere to sit or sleep, the migrants were forced to squeeze between metal bars designed to contain cattle and sheep and huddle together in the filthy pens. The passengers, including 54 women – several of whom were pregnant – and 74 children, eight of whom were unaccompanied, endured a miserable ten-day voyage before they were rescued on Friday night. They ran out of food, drink and fuel after five days, when the smugglers apparently locked them in the decaying vessel and escaped on a lifeboat. Police believe the traffickers made almost £2million from the ‘socially well-off’ illegal migrants, believed to be from war-torn Syria, who would have each paid between £2,000 and £5,000 for their place on the perilous journey. The passengers included 54 women, several of whom were pregnant, and 74 children, eight unaccompanied . Desperate: Migrants including women and young children were crammed into the freezing hold in decaying cargo ship the Blue Sky M. This photo was taken by a Syrian man who said he paid £11,000 for the journey . The smugglers’ tactic appears to be to point a cargo ship full of migrants towards Italy, before abandoning the ship and letting the coastguard pick it up. The gangs buy rusty vessels at the end of their life for around £100,000 before selling spots to hundreds of migrants. Ezadeen, a Sierra Leone-flagged ship, was the 15th to reach Italy in just three months. It was towed to port by a coastguard ship on Friday night after a female migrant managed to operate the radio to tell them the ship had been abandoned by the crew. Save the Children spokesman Giovanna di Benedetto said: ‘They left ten days ago from Turkey and they had five days without food or drink. 'They told us the crossing was very, very difficult and very, very dangerous.’ Horror ship: Nearly 800 migrants had been packed onto the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M cargo ship which was then abandoned at sea by its human trafficker crew and set on a crash course towards Italy . The migrants will now be taken to immigration centres and assessed to see if they have a valid claim for asylum. Before they can be granted asylum they must persuade authorities that they are fleeing persecution and would face harm or death if sent back to their country of origin. Illegal migration to the EU has been fuelled by the civil war in Syria, which has driven people to seek asylum in Europe. The police chief of Cosenza province, Luigi Liguori, said criminal gangs are now attracting better-off, more middle-class migrants. ‘We’ve noticed a change in the make-up of the Syrian refugees on board,’ he said, adding: ‘They are socially well off. They wear better clothes and are better organised.’ Last year it is estimated that nearly 3,500 refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean while another 200,000 were rescued. Migrants look out from Ezadeen, where they had been kept in livestock pens  with few supplies .

"The leader of the Liberal Democrat group on a local council who said an alleged rape victim was too ugly to be sexually assaulted has resigned from the party. Philip Drury, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, made the comment on Facebook about 21-year-old fashion student Serena Bowes, who claimed she was raped in Italy. 'Not sure anyone would want to even think about it looking at her lol,' the senior local politician posted in response to a thread discussing Miss Bowes' case. 'Offensive': Philip Drury, left, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, said no one would want to rape fashion student Serena Bowes, right, who claimed she was sexually assaulted in Italy . 'Vile': A grab from Facebook shows the thread in which Mr Drury made the comments . Mr Drury stepped down from his Lib Dem position after a council investigation found no action should be taken against him because he was acting in a private capacity. Maintaining he made the decision to stand down as a result of work pressures, he remains a councillor for Whitehill's Hogmoor ward but now sits on the council as an independent. Mr Drury put his comment, which was immediately slammed as 'awful' and 'vile' by others on Facebook, down to tiredness following a business trip in China. He was quoted as saying by Solent News Agency: 'I was excessively tired and was working nights. I had just come back from an excessive Chinese business trip - I was tired. I will remain on the council. 'That is all I want to say until I release a press release.' Other Facebook users reacted with fury, with one labelling Mr Drury a ‘pitiful excuse for a human being’ and another saying they would not want to be represented by a councillor who made the comment. Councillor Ferris Cowper, Conservative leader of East Hampshire District Council, said Mr Drury’s comment was regarded ‘offensive'. He called the council’s decision to allow him to stay ‘deeply disappointing’. 'For the record and as you would expect, this council finds the crime of rape to be deeply deplorable not only because of the physical invasion but also the lasting psychological consequences,' Mr Cowper said. 'Our only interest as a council would be to offer the victim all the sympathy and assistance possible. 'Although EHDC has now exhausted its legal options, the Council remains disappointed both with the actions of the councillor and also the effectiveness of the regulatory regime.' Miss Bowers in Florence: The second-year Newcastle College student, who is hoping to join the Army when she graduates, had been on a trip to the city as part of her fashion course when she said she was raped . Alleged rape victim Miss Bowes, 21, who waived her right to anonymity, is now facing extradition and a possible 12 years in jail because Italian police believe she may have made up the incident. Alexander Tahiri asked police to open a case of slander against Miss Bowers after officers decided not to charge him following an investigation . The second-year Newcastle College student, who is hoping to join the Army when she graduates, had been on a trip to Florence last May as part of her fashion course. She had visited the nightclub in the city's Via della Vigna Vecchia with a group of friends, and says she had started talking to Alexander Aveiro Tahiri, 23, inside. She claims that as the the pair were made their way to the VIP area of the club, she was taken to the unisex toilet and attacked. The alleged assault was reported to police, and gave statements to officers, as well as being examined in hospital. Italian news reports from the time the allegations were made said police had watched CCTV images which showed Miss Bowes leaving the bathroom together with Mr Tahiri, who was employed by the nightclub. He faced no further action. He later lost his job with the club as a result of the allegation after bosses said 'having sex in the toilets is not what he is being paid for.' Miss Bowes returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police, which she took to a nearby police station to be translated. She expected to hear that her alleged attacker was to be prosecuted. Instead she was served notice that she will go on trial for ‘slander’ against Mr Tahiri. Under the Italian justice system if Miss Bowes is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial. If she were convicted she would be automatically entitled to two appeals. If she lost those appeals, judges could then start extradition proceedings although this is very unlikely as in Italy most sentences are suspended, except for very serious crimes.","Philip Drury made the comment on Facebook about Serena Bowes, 21 .

"A set of conjoined twins in Florida on Friday underwent the first of two surgeries intended to separate them. The surgery gave Conner and Carter Mirabal, born joined at the belly December 12, two distinct small intestines. The boys have two distinct livers that will be separated--along with the twins themselves--in a second and final surgery in six months. Separating: On Friday, a first of two surgeries gave Conner and Carter Mirabal, born joined at the belly December 12, two distinct small intestines . More to come: The surgery separated the boys' small intestine, which they shared. They have two distinct livers, which are connected and must be separated before the twins are fully separated . 'It's all worth it; it's going to be worth it in the end,' the boys' aunt Jasmine Mirabal told WJXT. 'It's worth it now, but it's really going to be worth it when they're home.' Michelle Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal were shocked when they discovered they had conceived just six months after their Gage was born. After 34 intense weeks of medical complications, Carter and Conner, connected at the abdomen and facing each other, were born weighing 5lbs each. The boys required immediate surgery to repair damage to their stomachs but emerged from the operating room in good condition. Michelle Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal had become parents to Gage (right) just months before learning Michelle was pregnant with conjoined twins . Anxious: Here, the northern Florida family gathers at the Jacksonville hospital on the day of the first of two separation surgeries . Conner and Carter were lucky to have been born each with nearly all of their own organs. Friday's surgery separated the small intestine which they shared .

Adorable: Their foot prints were taken as Ms Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal celebrated the successful birth . Surprised! Ms Brantley shared a picture of her ballooning pregnant belly just days before her water broke . The boys were delivered in Jacksonville after Brantley was rushed to a hospital a month before the original due date and five days before a recently-scheduled c-section. Shortly before midnight, she and Mr Mirabal welcomed their sons into the world - baby brothers for their first child Gage. And despite suffering minor heart complications at first, Carter's heart is strengthening. The survival rate for conjoined twins is between five and 25 per cent. Ms Brantley and Mr Mirabal have spent the pregnancy in constant contact with Atlanta couple Robin and Michael Hamby, whose conjoined twin sons died the day they were born on December 5. Elated: Michelle Brantley was rushed to hospital early to give birth just 11 months after delivering her first son . The Hamby boys - Asa and Eli - survived just 34 hours before developing an atrial flutter - where the heart beats of of sync - which sent their heart rate to 300 beats a minute. Doctors tried to regulate the rhythm with drugs, but ultimately could not save the boys. Ms Brantley wrote a tribute to the Hamby family on Facebook: 'Our hearts go out to the Hamby family, although yalls precious baby boys only spent one day on earth, they will spend a life time watching over you guys from heaven above. 'We're praying for your family now and forever. Please everyone pray for the Hamby family, they need your prayers. R.I.P Angel babies! ‪#‎teamHamby‬.'

"Brussels are set to impose a maximum power limit on gas and electric ovens next month which could threaten the Sunday roast. An EU ruling will require 'new energy efficiency requirements for ovens, hobs and range hoods' by next month. Officials insist it will cut waste and improve value for money, but critics fear it will take longer to warm up ovens to cook the Sunday joint. New measures will be brought on February 26 for electric and gas-fired ovens. Shops will still be able to sell existing models, but an eco-design directive will be introduced over several years. Scroll down for video . Critics fear the planned maximum power limit on ovens mean it will take longer to cook the Sunday roast . Eurocrats say all changes will save an average household about £32 a year. But the measures have been criticised by some MEPs who say it is further evidence of EU chiefs meddling in our everyday lives. Tory MEP Daniel Hannan told the Sun on Sunday: 'If people want a low or high-powered oven, they're quite capable of deciding for themselves. 'If we banned all household appliances in Europe, it would still only cut carbon emissions by 0.5 per cent.' The planned changes follow a string of controversial energy-saving measures brought in by the EU and aim to cut costs, improve competitiveness and reduce carbon emissions. New energy efficiency measures will be brought on February 26 for electric and gas-fired ovens (stock) Energy efficiency limit for cavities of domestic ovens: . Within one year - less than 146 . Within two years - less than 121 . Within five years - less than 96 . For domestic (electric) hobs: . Within one year - 210 Watt-Hour . Within three years - 200 Watt-Hour . Within five years - 195 Watt-Hour . New measures came into effect on January 1 which demand that everything from computer modems to 'smart' televisions must have the ability to go into standby mode if no task is performed for several minutes. Although coffee machines bought at Christmas are likely to be exempt from the ruling, new ones must meet the stringent EU energy regulations. But it could prompt another retail frenzy as people rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes. The European Commission says the changes will save consumers money on their electricity bills and be better for the environment, but critics say it will leave people with cold coffee. The new rules state that drip filter coffee machines that have insulated jugs to keep the drink warm must power down their heated plate or element five minutes after brewing. Those with non-insulated jugs must go on standby within 40 minutes of use. Espresso machines should turn off after half an hour. MEP Daniel Hannan said: 'If people want a low or high-powered oven, they're quite capable of deciding for themselves' UK Independence Party MEP Roger Helmer told the Daily Express: 'This is another example of how we are losing control over the smallest details of our affairs. 'The EU should really find something better to do. All consumers want more efficiency from household appliances to cut their energy bills but there is already enormous pressure from the market on firms to provide that. 'EU officials apply these blanket regulations from Brussels without looking into the problems. 'This really should be a matter for the industry, the market and, perhaps, national legislation rather than yet more interference from Brussels.' Elsewhere, traditional lightbulbs have been axed and Europe barred powerful vacuum cleaners in September in what was later dubbed 'Hoovergate' and which sparked a stampede to buy high-power models in the UK. The directive banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and this will be further reduced to 900 watts by 2017. The EU is also expected to impose limits on high-power hairdryers, irons, kettles, toasters and even lawn mowers. A spokesman for the European Commission said: 'These policies save money, help tackle climate change and reduce energy imports from Russia and the Middle East.'","EU will introduce new energy efficiency requirements for ovens and hobs .

"David Cameron's daughter Nancy is set to attend a top state secondary school from September. Staff at the Grey Coat Hospital academy, a short walk from Downing Street, have been told that the Prime Minister will be offered a place within weeks. It would make Mr Cameron the first Tory premier while in power to send his child to a state school, which is also attended by Michael Gove's daughter. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha Cameron hope to send their daughter Nancy, 10, to a state school and will hear the final decision in March . No final decision has yet been made on Nancy's future, and an official announcement is not due until March. Like thousands of parents across the country, the Camerons are waiting to hear where they have been given a place. Last year demand for secondary school places in London rose 5 per cent. Some 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice school – up slightly on a year earlier. Mr Cameron was famously educated at exclusive fee-paying Eton, something which is often used by his opponents as proof he is out of touch. Mr Cameron and wife Samantha have sent Nancy, 10, and son Arthur, 7, to a Church of England primary school in Kensington. Staff at Grey Coat, a girls' school in Westminster, have been told that Nancy will be enrolled, according to a report in the Sunday Times. A source close to the Camerons sad: 'Like thousands of other parents, Mr and Mrs Cameron are in the process of applying for a secondary school place for their daughter. They will find out in the Spring which schools have offered her a place.' Staff at Grey Coat Hospital school have been told Nancy Cameron will be enrolled in September, according to reports . Founded in 1698, the Greay Coat school specialises in the teaching of languages and encourages first year pupils to learn at least two, with the option of studying Latin and Greek. Judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted in 2009, the school, which has strong links with Westminster Abbey, is typically at least five times oversubscribed for its 150 places. It places pupils in ability bands to allocate places as well as prioritising church-going families. The uniform at the school includes a grey coat, as the name suggests, costing between £65 and £85. According to the 2009 report, two-thirds of pupils are from ethnic minority backgrounds and one third speak English as a second language. In March last year tens of thousands of ten and 11-year-olds found they had missed out as allocations were announced by councils across the country. Many areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice schools. In the London boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham 42 per cent missed out on their first choice with 41 per cent in Wandsworth. In Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013. Michael Gove, then Education Secretary, last year sent his daughter Beatrice to Grey Coat. His wife Sarah Vine, a Daily Mail columnist, said at the time: 'Let's be clear: the Grey Coat Hospital (in Westminster) is not exactly Sinkhouse High.' She added: 'I want to support the state sector not just because, as a UK taxpayer and a tight-wad, I would resent paying twice for my children's education. 'Or because, having watched my friends go through the hell of trying to get their offspring into high-flying private schools, I decided to spare mine the anguish. 'But mostly because I believe that at state school Beatrice will receive a far more comprehensive education - in every sense of the phrase - than at any private establishment.' Grey Coat Hospital admits 151 girls a year into year 7 (age 11) from ‘within the full age range of ability and from a wide range of backgrounds’. Up to 15 places are offered to girls solely on the strength of their ‘aptitude for languages’. Up to 80 places will be given to girls from practising Church of England families living within the dioceses of London and Southwark – and must be supported by a clergy reference. Then up to 28 places are given to families active in other churches, which must also be backed up by a reference. Applicants are ranked according to their church commitment with marks for having a parent who holds elected church office, and regular attendance of church services and Sunday school. The rest of the places, up to 28, are ‘open places’ with no religious criteria.","Staff at school have been told Nancy Cameron, 10, will enrol in September .

"Moors murderer Myra Hindley was so addicted to Valium that she wrote to the Home Secretary begging him not to cut her supply. Secret letters published today for the first time reveal the dark chapter in the killer's final years behind bars. The notes also show how Hindley asked for permission to be hypnotised so that she could remember the location of the grave of her final victim - 12-year-old Keith Bennett. Scroll down for video . Hooked on drug: Moors murderer Myra Hindley was so addicted to Valium that she wrote to the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd in 1989 begging him not to cut her supply . In 1987 the child killer turned to doctors for help after police took her to the scene of her murders. But officials later became concerned with her dependence on Valium - and described her appearance as 'doped up to the eyeballs'. Her daily prescription to the drug was cut two years later - prompting her to write a six-page letter to the then Tory Home Secretary Douglas Hurd - saying how Valium helped to relieve 'pressure and trauma' in prison. 'I have used it many times into my sentence, particularly when there have been major crises,' she wrote, 23 years into her life term. She adds: 'Since I'm not asking to be released there's no particular point in preserving my body for a healthy and ripe old age in prison. She goes on to describe how Valium is the only thing that kept her going in jail. Uncovered: Her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died in Kent's Cookham Wood Prison in 2002. It was only recently unearthed by a Sheffield University academic . Read killer's letter: Home secretary in 1989, Douglas Hurd, received a six-page handwritten letter from child murderer Myra Hindley asking she be supplied with Valium again . The killer, who murdered at least five children with evil lover Ian Brady, even moaned about 'a series of upsetting and disturbing letters' from Winnie Johnson - mother of Keith Bennett, who was still missing at the time. The letter to Lord Hurd was dated March 1 1989 and hypocritically appealed to the home secretary to end Mrs Johnson's ordeal. She asked Lord Hurd if she could be hypnotised to help locate the murdered boy's remains. But the former home secretary was warned that evidence obtained might not be admissible in law and could lead to other undesirable requests. Killer and final victim: Pictured left, Ian Brady, who killed at least five children in the 1960s with lover Myra Hindley, including 12-year-old Keith Bennett, right . He also did not believe the hypnosis would work and rejected her request. Later the government went back on the decision - but by that point Hindley was too ill for any form of therapy. Her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died aged 60 in Kent's Cookham Wood Prison in 2002. The prison confirmed she used Valium in 1987 and 1988, when her father Bob died. Dr Tom Clark, a Sheffield University academic researching a book about Hindley, recently uncovered the letters amid a pile of jumbled documents at the National Archives in London. Hindley's records are said to fill 20ft of shelves. Wrote to Hindley: Winnie Johnson, the mother of murdered 12-year-old Keith Bennett, wrote to Hindley in prison asking her to tell police where to find the remains of her son. She died in 2012 . Hindley wrote the letter to the Home Secretary from Cookham Wood Prison in Kent (above) in 1989 . Dr Clark told The Sun on Sunday: 'They give a fascinating insight into Hindley's last few years and her reliance on Valium. At no stage does she show remorse - quite the opposite.' Speaking to the Sunday Express, he adds: 'Like many of Hindley's writings, the the letter totally ignores the gravity of what she did. 'The tone is quite strange. It is quite self-righteous, as if someone else has committed the murders and she was helping solve them.'","Secret letter  reveals how killer used drug to escape 'pressure and trauma'

"Two men arrested in connection with the murder of Tanis Bhandari, a builder who was axed to death after a New Year's Eve party, have been charged. Donald Pemberton and Ryan Williams, aged 20 and 21 respectively, were arrested for the 27-year-old's murder at around 2am on Thursday. The pair from St Budeaux, Plymouth, were have been charged with murder and possession of knives and an axe. Donald Pemberton, 20,  (left) and Ryan Williams, 21,  (right) have been charged with the murder of Tanis Bhandari who was killed on New Year's Eve with an axe . They will appear before magistrates in Plymouth tomorrow. Mr Bhandari was with friends at the King's Arms on New Year's Eve when the group were attacked on their way home at around 1.30am. Tributes have been paid to the 'lovely' builder, who, it was reported, was killed after stepping in front of a female friend to shield her from harm. It was claimed the disruption may have started over a request for a cigarette, though Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm this account. Officers said last week Mr Bhandari and his friends had been the victims of an 'unprovoked, indiscriminate' attack. Today, announcing the charges, Detective Inspector Gregg Dawe, Senior Investigating Officer, said: 'An axe and knives have been recovered and searches are continuing in the Milford Lane area for any further knives that may have been used. 'I want to thank everyone who has assisted us with the police investigation so far. Tanis Bhandari, 27, was murdered outside the Kings Arms pub on New Year's Eve. Relatives have paid tribute to the 'lovely' man . More than 100 people gathered outside the pub to lay tributes of flowers and cards on Friday morning . Mourners gathered outside the green where the group of men were attacked today to pay their respects . 'Searches and enquiries are continuing in relation to this incident.' More than 100 mourners gathered outside the pub where Mr Bhandari, a former member of the Royal Navy, was killed to lay tributes. Flowers and Liverpool FC scarves were placed on the small village green where he is believed to have been killed. Devon and Cornwall Police had been appealing to residents in the sleepy village to check their gardens for a knife used in the attack. An axe-like weapon was recovered shortly after the attack last week. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook, describing him as an 'amazing friend'. Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’ Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. 'Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’ Forensics officers scoured the rural village over the weekend following the arrests of two men . Police are still appealing for information about the attack which took place in the early hours of Thursday morning . A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub. 'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement. 'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.' Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy. 'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' Others shared their grief on Facebook. 'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.'

"'Risking lives': Lancashire County Council has been slammed by road safety experts after it admitted dimming its street lights to save money . A council has been slammed by MPs and furious road safety campaigners - after admitting dimming its street lights to save money. Cash-strapped Lancashire County Council has cut a number jobs over the last year in a desperate bid to save £300m. Now they have come up with a new covert scheme to save vital funds - by dimming their street lights at night. Their plan has been criticised by MPs and road campaigners the AA - who claim darker streets cause car and pedestrian accidents and leave people 'vulnerable in their own communities'. Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association (AA), said: 'New official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads are not getting better. 'In fact, on 40mph roads, they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather. 'This is the type of road where most of the fatalities, for which coroners blamed street-light switch-offs as a contributory factor, happened.' Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle blasted the council and suggested it must find efficiency savings in other areas. The Liberal Democrat said: 'It's not just about people feeling vulnerable in their homes, but on the streets of their own communities. 'Surely there is greater risk of robbery and burglary on darker streets. 'My argument would be that if the council was more efficient then they wouldn't need to turn lights off or dim them. 'I agree with the AA. It's far more dangerous with the lights off.' Councillor Alyson Barnes, Labour member for Rossendale North, said the authority had to strike a 'balancing act'. She said: 'There is going to be less light as a consequence but the council has to meet energy targets and this will mean less light pollution. 'I accept that in the circumstances some people won't feel as safe but in the main I think it balances out all those needs. 'Where there are increases of burglaries or accidents that needs to be reviewed.' Criticism: Road safety campaigners claim darker streets cause car and pedestrian accidents and leave people 'vulnerable in their own communities' Lancashire County Council (HQ above) admitted some lights are even being switched off completely as part of their controversial plan to save vital funds . Andy resident Colin Hooper, 58, said: 'It is ridiculous to dim the lights to save money as car accidents, or burglaries, end up costing the council money in other areas.' Teresa Caning, 72, said: 'I don't feel very safe at the moment in winter walking down the pavement as the new LED lights feel dimmer even when they are on full. Nationally, a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed, compared with 148,000 in May 2010. 'I would definitely not want to leave my home if they were dimmed further. 'The council are being a bunch of dimwits and surely this cannot be saving them that much money.' A county council spokesman admitted lamps were being dimmed from time to time but that it was also carrying out a five-year maintenance cycle as part of a £10million investment in LED lamps. The spokesman admitted some lights are even being switched off completely - but those were only on a short section of the M65 between Burnley and Colne. He said: 'The authority has a programme to install energy saving measures to streetlights which began in 2009 by fitting LED lamps to streetlights and fitting controls which allow them to be turned down or 'dimmed'. Warning: Councillor Alyson Barnes, Labour member for Rossendale North, said the authority must strike a 'balancing act' between safety and saving money . 'Lancashire County Council is responsible for around 148,000 streetlights of which 62,000 are able to be turned.' However, neighbouring Blackburn with Darwen Council said it was investing £9.9million over two years in LED lights and had 'no plans' to dim them. Coun Jim Smith, environment boss at Blackburn with Darwen Council, said: 'We are currently undergoing a major refit of our street lights by introducing new energy efficient and long-lasting LED lanterns across the borough and they have been installed in many areas already. 'The new lights are equipped with dimmer switches but we have no plans to do it. The lights are different, not dimmer. 'It is a different kind of light because it is white light. It is a better quality light and it works a lot better than yellow light for things like CCTV as it allows you to see colours. 'In the future, we will actually save money. 'By getting on top of the roads and changing the lights, over a 20-year period, we will save £20million which will mean the project will pay for itself as well as give us a big saving.' Nationally, a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed, compared with 148,000 in May 2010.","Lancashire County Council is desperately trying to save £300million .

"A reptile handler has had his thumb bitten off during a crocodile attack at a Queensland wildlife park. Ian Jenkins, the 58-year-old reptile park owner, was attacked at the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers, south of Bundaberg, on Sunday afternoon in front of a large crowd of mostly families. Mr Jenkins is 'very, very lucky to be alive' according to paramedics, after the crocodile dragged the reptile enthusiast into the water and attempted to do a 'death roll'. Scroll down for video . Ian Jenkins (left), the owner of Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo, had his thumb ripped off and suffered head injuries when a crocodile grapped him and took him into the water . Jenkin's thumb was bitten off and also suffered head injuries and was airlifted to hospital in stable condition . Ian Jenkins with crocodile 'Macca' during one of his crocodile shows . It is understood the man was visiting the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers in Queensland . Paramedics received a call about the incident just before 1pm local time, a Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) spokesman said. The zoo's website says the saltwater crocodile feeding and commentary session is held at 12.30pm. The RACQ Careflight Bundaberg rescue helicopter was also sent to the scene. Mr Jenkins was attempting to gain the attention of a crocodile by holding a chicken in his right hand when the incident happened, an RACQ Careflight spokesman said. 'He's taken his hat off and was holding his hat in his left hand, when the crocodile jumped up and grabbed his hat and his left hand,' the spokesman told AAP. 'The crocodile has bitten his left hand and amputated his left thumb.' A section of his left hand was torn down to the wrist . He was airlifted to the Bundaberg Base Hospital in a stable condition. He was administered significant pain relief for his injury. However, the modest animal-lover supposedly apologised profusely to the paramedics for 'causing such a fuss'.

The victim, Ian Jenkins (second from left, pictured with family) was airlifted to Bundaberg Base Hospital and underwent surgery . He also suffered a head injury during the incident, the QAS said. Ian Jenkins will undergo surgery on Sunday. This is far from his first serious injury inflicted on the job. Five years ago, Mr Jenkins survived an eastern brown snake bite, which left him fighting for his life. He was also bitten by a king brown in 2003 and two black snakes before that. In January 2010, he was preparing an eastern brown snake for an educational show when he was bitten through a bag, causing the father to collapse and lose consciousness. The then 51-year-old was transported by air to Bundaberg Base Hospital, placed in intensive care and treated with two doses of anti-venom. He was back performing his snake show just hours after discharging himself from hospital. Paramedics were called to the zoo at 12.55pm local time, a Queensland Ambulance Service spokesman told Daily Mail Australia . The 58-year-old reptile park owner was attacked at the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo on Sunday . The crocodile attack follows a record number of deadly crocodile attacks in the Northern Territory . Mr Jenkins previously said that his primary concern is his family and that he hates to cause them distress when he suffers an animal-inflicted injury. ""Its something that I'm not very pleased about, because I don't like to put my family through that sort of worry,' he told ABC in 2010 when asked about his snake bite. His love of reptiles was born during his childhood in Kenya. He has been a much-loved member of the Childers community for more than 30 years. The crocodile attack follows a record number of deadly crocodile attacks in the Northern Territory. In 2014, four people died from a saltwater crocodile mauling them to death in the Top End. It was the deadliest year since 1974 when records started to be kept. There were also a significant number of saltwater crocodiles were captured by the NT Parks and Wildlife Commission. Last year, the crocodile management team removed 287 of the reptiles from the territory's waterways, up from 226 in 2013. Wildlife ranger Tom Nichols said last year's number was close to toppling the most number of crocodiles ever caught, which is 318 in 2012.","A 58-year-old man was airlifted by helicopter to Bundaberg Base Hospital .

"Ched Evans, pictured outside his home with his pet dog today, is thought to be on the verge of signing with Oldham Athletic . A protest against Oldham Athletic potentially signing convicted rapist Ched Evans has become one of the fastest growing petitions online. More than one person per second signed the petition in the first thirty minutes after its launch earlier today. It came after news broke that Oldham set to make an announcement tomorrow that they have signed Evans to their team. Addressed to Simon Corney, the chairman of Oldham Athletic FC, the petition reads: We do believe he[Ched Evans] has the right to work. 'We believe that it does not have to be in a role where he influences views about sexual violence, and his presence on your pitch will do this.' The petition, which currently has 11,000 signatures, is one of the fastest growing petitions ever on Change.org, i100.co.uk reports. It's understood that the former Sheffield United striker will train with Oldham on Monday morning ahead of a move to the League One football club. Evans was released from prison in October after having served two-and-a-half years of a five year prison sentence for rape. He was found guilty in 2011 of the rape of a 19-year-old woman, but continues to protest his innocence. Evans, who is staying in a hotel nearby, wants a return to football after being released from prison in October. A club source said a deal is '50-50'. The developments represent a dramatic U-turn by Oldham, who insisted they had no intention of landing the 26-year-old last month. A statement on December 1 read: 'The Board of Directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for Ched Evans to train with Oldham Athletic nor will we be offering him a contract. 'The club will not be making any further comment on this subject.' Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire. Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later. The Welsh international's most recent set-back came this weekend, when a move to Malta was blocked . Evans could be in line for a return to football and it's believed Oldham Athletic may sign him . Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge. Since his release, Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, 26, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended is actions and the pair are now engaged. Ms Massey has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. Since a November 29 defeat, Oldham have suffered a dramatic downturn and have lost four games in a row. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said there would be a press conference at an unnamed League One club, but it's understood there is not one planned. 'The club are due to hold the press conference tomorrow and I've made it clear to them that I cannot attend tomorrow,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. According to one board member of Trust Oldham, the official club supporters trust, they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of Ched Evans. The trust has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player’s wages. Ched Evans and his fiancee Natasha Massey, pictured in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, last year . Evans (pictured in Cheshire last year) has continued to claim he is innocent despite by found guilty in court . But Ray Coverley said he knew nothing of Evans joining the club. Speaking personally and not on behalf of Trust Oldham, he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – Evans was entitled to return to work as a footballer. 'We haven’t discussed it,’ said Mr Coverley. 'But speaking personally I’m of the opinion that if he has served his sentence we can’t keep going on about it. Ched Evans (pictured) served two-and-a-half years of a five year prison sentence after being found guilty of rape . 'I understand the emotional point, but taking that aside he’s now entitled to play football again.' Senior officials at the club are known to believe Evans' side of the story. They spoke to the player in late November but decided against making a move amid fears it would  tarnish the club's image. Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday it had offered Evans a deal for the remainder of the season, but that move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice as Evans is not allowed to work abroad. He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players union the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer. Television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team. Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk. Sheffield United retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction. In November, Evans was linked with a move to Tranmere Rovers after club chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from his associates. Mr Taylor has warned that any move for the 26-year-old striker had to be for the right reasons. 'Bearing in mind what happened with his release and then of course the furore that we had at Sheffield United we feel that any club wishing to sign him needs to be 100 per cent committed to signing him for proper and legitimate football reasons,' Mr Taylor added. Evans' attempts to return have so far been fruitless, with clubs turning down the chance to employ him . Any move to sign Evans is likely to lead to public outcry, but Mr Taylor was keen to avoid a similar situation to the one that engulfed Sheffield United after they made their offer to the player. 'I don't want to create a replica-type situation that we had at Sheffield (United) because I'm a little bit concerned that we need press conference and that will invite, of course, many antagonists,' he said. Mr Taylor said the PFA appreciated the situation was 'very sensitive', but reiterated its stance that Evans deserved the chance to resume his career following his release from prison. 'We've made it clear in our statements that we feel he's been unable to say much because of the appeals process, but he has served his time and the job of society is to look to rehabilitate. Any move abroad for Evans is unlikely to materialise given Britain's tough regime in managing sex offenders. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims. 'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad. 'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.' Oldham declined to comment. A women's campaign group are 'appalled'  at rumours a Division One football club was poised to finally sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Sex offender Evans, 25, was released from prison last October, halfway through his five year sentence for raping a 19 year-old woman in a hotel room in May 2011. Already a number of clubs, such as Sheffield United and Hartlepool, who showed interest in signing the shamed striker later changed their mind - after huge backlashes. Today Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'We are appalled by any football club which signs an unrepentant convicted rapist. 'Ched Evans has shown no remorse for his crime and has actually used his profile to persistently claim his 'innocence' in the media and to re-traumatise his own and many other victims. 'We would ask the owners and the manager of any club thinking of signing Ched Evans - please consider seriously the message you will send to the survivors of sexual violence who are among your fans, and to your whole local community, as well as to football fans as a whole. 'If you sign him you will give him a new platform to continue denying the crime he committed. 'Please reconsider and show that your club has zero tolerance of sexual violence and of attitudes which trivialise or condone it.' Ms Green said they always feared this January a club would ignore public opinion and try to sign the rapist. She added: 'As we are in the transfer window it feels this matter will not go away. It is time for the FA to step up and make its views known. Fan associations should urgently do the same. 'The Government estimates that around 85,000 women are raped in England and Wales every year. Rape is not a marginal issue. 'All of us know survivors of rape. The police and courts cannot sanction and deter it alone. 'Everyone, including sports clubs, need to be involved in challenging the attitudes which make excuses for rape and let perpetrators think they can get away with it.'","League One football club Oldham Athletic are set to sign rapist Ched Evans .

"A convicted felon is suing television host Maury Povich after claiming that watching his seven-year-old daughter 'being exploited' on his tabloid talk show  caused him to develop suicidal thoughts. Alan Griffin, an inmate at Columbia Correctional Institution in Lake City, Florida, was watching 'Maury' (or 'The Maury Povich Show') on a prison television when his only child, Lanique, came on-screen. During her appearance, Lanique - who was broadcast in the December 2010 episode alongside Griffin's ex-wife, Sherilitra Nash - spoke about her father and his status as an attempted murderer. The youngster's 'exploitation' reportedly caused Griffin such 'great emotional shock, grief and shame' that he developed suicidal thoughts and was placed in a 72-hour mental health hold.

"She is one of the fastest long-distance runners in the United States. But at the end of every race, 18-year-old Kayla Montgomery collapses, crying for help, unable to feel her legs. She has Multiple Sclerosis. Incredible: Kayla Montgomery, 18, cannot feel her legs when she runs because she has Multiple Sclerosis . Debilitating: She collapses at the end of every race, begging for water and ice to cool her body down . The degenerative disease damages nerve endings, which disrupts communication between the body and brain, resulting in loss of muscle control. As Kayla's body warms up, her legs fall completely numb. It is not until she covers her body in ice and cold water that her symptoms subside. Incredibly, that doesn't stop her from competing in national level tournaments, as revealed in a Catching Kayla, an ESPN documentary. At the age of 14 Kayla was an avid soccer player about to start her freshman year at Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when she collapsed and felt a tingling sensation in her toes. 'When I run everything is ok': Kayla is one of the fastest runners her age in the US with the help of medication . Price she's willing to pay: She said she will do anything to be able to use her legs while she can . Ordeal: When her body heats up, her symptoms worsen. When she cools down, she can feel her legs again . Journey: When Patrick Cromwell met Kayla she was a very slow runner. Now she is a champion . A scan revealed early signs of MS. For eight months, she lost all feeling in her body. Her mother, a care worker, said the diagnosis made her feel sick. Kayla locked herself in her room. She said: 'I didn't let anybody in my room I just wanted to be alone. 'And I was mad. I was just really mad. I couldn't see why this had happened to me. Growing up: Kayla was quiet, shy and creative as a child before getting into athletics and contact sports . Avid soccer player: Kayla loved soccer as a young teen before she fell during a game at the age of 14 . Diagnosis: Scans done in October 2010 showed she had Multiple Sclerosis and lost all feeling for eight months . 'I couldn't think of anything I'd done wrong. Why should I be punished? Why was this happening?' Medication enabled Kayla to stem the onset of the disease's debilitating effects. She was forced to give up contact sports like soccer. But, unsure how long the treatment will last, she knew one thing: she wanted to run. Fast. 'She was average at best,' her coach, Patrick Cromwell, explains. Determined: With the help of treatment she was able to start non-contact sports like running . Training: Kayla was distraught at first, then told her coach to push her as far as she could go . Disadvantage: Despite feeling no pain, the sensation when she runs is strange and difficult to compute . Fall: In the North Carolina State Championships this year she fell (circled) during the first lap . Success! Despite tumbling to the ground, she got up and ended up winning the race . That soon changed. And on the final race of her high school career, at the North Carolina State Championships in May, she won - despite collapsing in the first lap.

"The world's rich and famous will soon have their very own 24-hour VIP airport terminal worth $30 million to fly into on their plush private jets when travelling Down Under. Businessman Paul Little is building a VIP jet base at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport after forking out around $10 million for a precinct at the airbase. Over the next 18-24 months the hub will be upgraded and transformed into a luxurious terminal targeting super-rich Asian businesspeople and global superstars. In 2014, A-list stars like Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, the Rolling Stones, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus all flew into Melbourne and around Australia on private jets. Scroll down for video .

Mr Little, who boasts an $880 million dollar fortune of his own thanks to his former role as CEO of logistics group Toll Holdings, told the Australian Financial Review: 'We have entertainers, sports people, everyone from the Prime Minister down.' Although Australia already has private jet terminals, Mr Little believes his will be 'globally of a higher-standard.' Murray Rance, the managing director of Melbourne Aviation Precinct where the base will be located, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘What it’s going to do is offer a world class facility that isn't available in Australia… it will be a far more professional in bound and out bound experience.’ Miley Cyrus landed at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport and walked straight off her private jet and into a waiting car . Katy Perry hopped off her private jet in Brisbane wearing comfy clothes and drinking a energy drink . ‘It will have customs clearance, check in, all the normal things you would have. Plus guest lounges, boardroom facilities, and things like bathrooms for people to have showers in. ‘These sort of people want to get in and out,’ he added. Mr Rance revealed the private jet base will have the ability to park around 10 to 15 jets at one time. Mr Little's company has been given the go-ahead for its plans and construction on the facility will start within six months. James Packer, seen here arriving into Melbourne airport on his private jet, will reportedly use the VIP service for his high-rolling customers at the Crown Casino .

The private jet terminal will boast pilot accommodation as well as hangarage and refuelling services for the jets. The terminal will not have a curfew like nearby Essendon airport and Sydney airport, something which Mr Little believes will give his super-rich services an advantage. Currently, Essendon airport in Melbourne captures 80 per cent of the private jet market. Mr Little, who has his own Gulfstream 550 jet, said: ‘People who spend $60 million on an aircraft – what they want is all the impediments removed. ‘You want to land where you get the best treatment.’ Taylor Swift enjoys the luxury of a private jet so she can fly with her cat .

"The search for a missing 3-week-old baby has come to a tragic close, after her body was found in an dumpster two hours away from the home where she disappeared. Baby Eliza Delacruz was first reported missing Saturday night, after a shooting at her family's Long Beach, California home left her parents and uncle injured. Sunday night, authorities confirmed that a body found inside a dumpster in Imperial Beach, just south of San Diego, was Eliza. Scroll down for video . Missing: Eliza Delacruz, who is three weeks old and weighs 10lbs, went missing on Saturday after a shooting at her family's home in Long Beach, California . Sunday afternoon, a baby's body was found in a dumpster two hours south in Imperial beach, California, near the Mexican border. Detectives are working to identify whether the baby is Eliza . A man was reportedly sifting through a shopping center dumpster around 1:25pm when he came across a trash bag containing the body and called police. Imperial Beach is less than 20 minutes from the U.S.-Mexico border. Earlier in the day Sunday, police asked the public's help in finding missing Eliza, saying at the time that they don't know who took the 10-pound baby girl, but that the kidnapping did not appear to be random. Baby Eliza was first reported missing Saturday night, just after 6pm, when police responded to calls of a shooting at the family's home on the 100 block of West 51st Street in Long Beach. 'I heard two shots. No noises, nothing else,' neighbor Maria Rodriguez told NBC Los Angeles. Who took her? Baby Eliza's parents and uncle were injured in the shooting at the family's Long Beach, California home. Police believe the baby girl was kidnapped by the shooter. Above, an officer pictured near the scene of the crime after the Saturday night shooting . They believe the suspect ran off with the baby, and hope someone has information which will lead them to the kidnapped girl. Arrona says it appears the kidnapping was not random since there is no sign of forced entry at the house. Neighbors say several family members live at the home; police added that they will be looking into the backgrounds of the residents at the address. The child's parents and uncle have not yet been able to give police a detailed description of the suspect. The suspect has only been described as an Hispanic or African-American male. 'We believe this is not a random act,' Lt Lloyd Cox said. 'It appears to be very personal. Whoever came here for it, based on limited info, it was not a random act to kidnap an infant from.' As of Sunday, the child's father had been released from the hospital, but the man's wife and brother were still listed in critical but stable condition. Both underwent surgery for their injuries. He did not speak with reporters as he was checked out of the hospital. Anyone with information is urged to call the LAPD on 565-435-6711.

"Sir Peter Morrison at Downing Street: A man has come forward with allegations that the former aide to Margaret Thatcher raped him when he was 14 . One of Margaret Thatcher’s closest aides raped a boy of 14 but escaped justice after police lied about prosecuting him, it was claimed yesterday. Scotland Yard is investigating fresh claims that former Tory MP Sir Peter Morrison abused the teenager at the notorious Elm Guest House linked to an alleged VIP paedophile ring. Yesterday the alleged victim’s father said he allowed the boy to go with the barrister – later Lady Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary and Conservative Party deputy chairman – because he ‘seemed nice’. Hours after the reported attack in 1982, the father phoned police who arranged for the boy to be medically examined. But the father claims Scotland Yard lied, telling him his son’s attacker had been jailed. The alleged victim, now 46 and a married businessman, is the first to publicly accuse the Chester MP who died in 1995 aged 51. Morrison – first linked to child abuse in 1998 – was never charged. Now the unnamed man is preparing to take legal action against Scotland Yard, which he claims ‘hushed the whole thing up’. He says he was yards from his home in Harting, West Sussex when he met the MP. He said Morrison offered him money if he would help him restart his car and then invited him to his ‘nice big house in London for the weekend’. The alleged victim told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘He wore a pin-striped suit and was very well dressed, so I didn’t think anything was wrong. I suppose I was quite impressed, in a way.’ He later agreed to go with Morrison after the MP phoned him repeatedly. The boy’s father also recalled meeting the politician, saying: ‘The guy said he had homes in Chester and London, but he never told us he was an MP. He seemed nice – very well spoken and nicely presented. I allowed my son to go … I suppose you just trusted people more in those days.’ But when the chauffeur-driven car set off, his son claims Morrison began sexually assaulting him. ‘Before long, he had my trousers off … we stopped for petrol, and I thought about running out of the car,’ he said. ‘But … the doors had some sort of child lock and I couldn’t get out. I was so frightened.’ Morrison allegedly plied him with beer and wine before taking him to a house he believes was the Elm Guest House in Barnes. ‘I was assaulted and raped for … at least an hour,’ he said. ‘It was the most horrendous experience of my life … he told me I’d be sleeping in his bed that night.’ The alleged victim said the MP told him they would take a sauna together before a ‘party’. But he managed to escape and take a train home where he told his father what had happened. Confidant: Morrison with Baroness Thatcher. He was her parliamentary private secretary when she was PM . House of abuse: Sir Peter, who was Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, allegedly lured the 14-year-old from Sussex to the now notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London, where he raped him . He was taken to a police doctor in Bognor Regis the next day who confirmed the boy had ‘certainly been sexually abused’. Two Scotland Yard detectives allegedly took a statement. But the family claim they received no paperwork and say officers took nearly a year to return the boy’s clothing. The father said: ‘They told me the guy had been convicted at a court in Chelsea and that he’d been sent to prison for two years … I did think it was odd that my son hadn’t been called to give evidence but … I thought that was the end of that and we could start to forget about the whole thing.’ Years later, the alleged victim recognised Morrison as an MP and learned he had not been convicted. The man said: ‘Either the police were paid off or they hushed it up because he was an MP. I was never the same … he ruined my life.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman was unable to say whether Morrison had been investigated at the time, but said Operation Fairbank – set up to examine child abuse allegations involving high-profile figures – was looking into the claims.","Alleged victim says he was targeted by Sir Peter Morrison as a 14-year-old .

"A British man has drowned after being swept away by a strong current in a river in the Philippines as he tried to save his girlfriend's sons. Mark Selby, 45, who moved from Stroud in Gloucestershire to the South-Asian country with his girlfriend Mary Anne Cruz and her children, got into trouble in the Balanac River on Monday. The computer programmer was with the boys and the family dog when they were caught by a surge and dragged away. Mark Selby, 45, drowned after getting swept away by a strong current in a river in the Philippines as he tried to save his girlfriend's sons (pictured with their mother, Mary Anne Cruz, centre, in the same river, the day before he died) Ms Cruz's 10-year-old son, who has not been named, was holding on to Mr Selby's right shoulder when a lifeguard swam out to rescue them. Mr Selby was able to push their dog Molly and encourage her to return to shore, but he was unable to swim back himself, despite being a strong swimmer. He was pulled from the water and died in Pagsanjan, Laguna on Monday afternoon. The family were reportedly staying at the Villa Socorro Agri-Eco Village and Farm Resort in Barangay Dingin for two days. Mr Selby's sister, Debbie Poulter, 46, said: 'Basically they were all swimming in the river and they all got caught up in the current. 'The chap at the resort watches over the water and he realised they were in trouble, they were caught up in the current. Mark Selby, pictured with his sister's Debbie (left) and Dawn (right), died in Pagsanjan, Laguna on Monday . Mr Selby, with his son Steve (left), had returned to Britain before Christmas and flew back to South East Asia a week before he passed away . 'Mark had one of the lads on his shoulder and he passed him to the guy who came to help. 'Then he pushed the dog towards shore, as if to help her out, but then he disappeared under the water. He died saving the others. 'He was very skilled, very clever when it came to computers - his job took him all over the world.' Mr Selby grew up in Stroud before moving out to work in the Filipino capital Manila, where he met Ms Cruz. He briefly returned to Britain before Christmas and flew back out to South East Asia on December 22, intending to make a permanent move to live with his girlfriend. Ms Poulter said: 'He had gone back over to the Philippines on the 22nd of December. Mr Selby was swimming with his girlfriend's two sons and their dog in the Balanac River in Pagsanjan, Laguna on Monday when they got into trouble. The boys were rescued but Mr Selby couldn't swim back . 'He decided to go back to buy a house with Mary Anne and her children. She's lovely and he was so happy. 'I think they had gone on holiday together. They'd gone to this resort for a few days.' Friends in Stroud, who knew him from his schooldays at the Paganhill Secondary school described Mark as a 'good looking chap, really fit and healthy.' Writing on an online work profile, Mr Selby, said: 'Away from the computer you will likely find me climbing volcanoes, riding horses, swimming, boat riding, cycling, cooking, scuba diving, sampling beer or sleeping.' The Phillipines National Bureau of Investigation is conducting an investigation into his death. The Gloucestershire Coroner's office said they had not yet been informed of the death.","Mark Selby, 45, moved from Stroud, Gloucestershire to Phillippines .

"A message in a bottle has been found more than 3,000 miles away - 42 years after it was thrown from a fishing boat into the North Sea. Scottish fisherman John Souter, 66, flung the old Hay's lemonade bottle into the North Sea in 1973, and it was discovered by a German tourist on a beach during a trip to the coast of New York. The visitor, Michael Scholz, took the bottle and its note back to his home in Cologne - before posting it to 66-year-old Mr Souter’s former address in Lossiemouth, Moray. Forgot about it: Scottish fisherman John Souter (pictured) flung the old Hay's lemonade bottle into the North Sea in 1973, and it has now been found by a German tourist on a beach during a trip to the coast of New York . In total, the bottle has now travelled at least 8,000 miles - from Scotland to the US, then to Germany and finally back to Scotland - since it was tossed into the sea on June 7, 1973. Mr Souter wrote the message while sailing with his father and late brother-in-law, Bill Stewart. It was on a torn-out page from a previous year's fishing almanac. He said: ‘I remember doing it. I was aboard my father's fishing boat. I tore a bit of paper out of an old fishing almanac on board and wrote my name, address and the date on it, before putting it inside an old Hay's lemonade bottle and throwing it into the sea. ‘Bill did the same thing. He heard from someone who found his note within a year, but I'd completely forgotten about mine. It's amazing to think how far it travelled.' Across the Atlantic Ocean: The bottle drifted 3,300 miles from the North Sea to Jones Beach in New York . The bottle drifted around 3,300 miles to Jones Beach in Nassau County, New York, before it was found by Mr Scholz. He then took it 3,760 miles home with him to Cologne, in Germany, before posting it 960 miles back to Lossiemouth. Along with the returned note, Mr Scholz wrote a letter saying: ‘I have found your message in a bottle. But I didn't find your message in Germany. Recently I visited New York. ‘During a trip to the coast about 30 miles from John F. Kennedy Airport, I found your message. More than 40 years was your bottle on the go. Wow. It's a long time. This is fantastic. I'm very impressed.’ Mr Souter, who worked as a fisherman for more than 30 years, said he and his wife Eileen sent Mr Scholz a Christmas card to thank him - and they plan to get in touch with him in the coming weeks.","Fisherman John Souter threw old lemonade bottle into North Sea in 1973 .

Etihad, a national airline of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, said in a statement on its website that fog had delayed flights and caused airport congestion. The airline apologized for travelers' inconvenience but said the delays were beyond its control. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Etihad Airways has apologised to passengers  for the significant delay they experienced during the unprecedented fog disruption at Abu Dhabi Airport. 'During the time on the ground, awaiting permission to take-off, passengers were provided with refreshments and were updated about the reasons for the rolling delay caused by the extreme weather conditions. Delay: Girl Lilikoi, who was on a different delayed flight, tweeted: 'It has been 6hrs and we are still stranded' 'Passengers remained on the aircraft as all efforts were being made to secure a new departure time. The delay was then compounded by the requirement to replace the aircraft’s ultra-long haul operating crew who had exceeded their flight time limitations. 'Etihad Airways always strives to deliver the highest standards of customer service and on this occasion our ability to do so was impacted by circumstances  largely beyond our control.'

"At 21st 9lbs, Sam Akerman always felt as though strangers were judging her and that she was second best compared to slimmer women. The civil servant, 29, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, also found herself the butt of jokes about her size. On a night out before starting her fitness regime, dropping 6st 9lb to 15st in two years, Sam reveals she was made a laughing stock by a man who was ‘on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could’. Scroll down for video . Sam Akerman, pictured before losing the weight, was the victim of a cruel joke on a night out . She said: ‘I was part of a hockey team sports tour. ‘We were on a night out and I was approached by this guy who it turns out was on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could and he then took pictures as evidence.’ Weighing in at her heaviest at 21st 9lb meant that Sam stood out, but this was ‘really horrible, I just wanted to be treated the same as everyone else’, she said. ‘Other people noticed the humiliation. I just laughed it off and my friends were laughing it off because that is how I was dealing with it but I just wanted the ground to swallow me up. ‘It was a joke but it made me a joke. I was just on a night out with the girls.’ Sam is now two years into her health, fitness and weight loss programme which involves regular trips to the gym with a friend for support and work with Slimming World. Sam is pictured here before and after her dramatic weight loss, she lost 6.5 stone since starting a health and fitness weight loss programme two years ago with Slimming World . However, she says that being shamed on her night out with the girls did not help her to rethink her life - it was only wanting to be healthier that made her do that. ‘The thing is, food was my security blanket,’ she said. ‘I loved cooking and it is my comfort zone. If friends are going out you just want to feel part of it and to feel normal. ‘If that situation happened again now I know I could deal with it with my head held high.’ She has noticed a greater self-confidence since losing weight and does not tell people about her dramatic change in size unless they ‘react positively to me in the first place’. She said: ‘Before, I had no control over how I looked or how people were treating me, but now I have lost the weight I have found the confidence from somewhere.’ Sam said it helps that people have contacted her to say they are inspired to try to be healthier and lose weight after seeing how successful she has been. She said: ‘When I was overweight and went out I always felt judged and always felt like I was second best, say when I was queuing for a drink at a bar. ‘I feel more confident now. I have still got a long way to go on this journey, but it is a start.’ Breakfast - Bacon and sausage bap on white bread . Mid-morning - Packet of crisps . Lunch - A sausage roll, chips and beans .

"More than half of British families will have just one child by 2022, experts predict. The number of single-child families has grown by almost 12 per cent in the last decade, according to official figures. This means the proportion of parents stopping at one child is already at 47 per cent. By 2021, 50 per cent of number of UK families with have one child. The number rose from 42 per cent in 2003, to 47 percent in 2013. Having one child continues the bloodline but means less commitment . And sociologists warn it is inevitable that the figure will soon pass the 50 per cent mark. Professor Frank Furedi, a sociologist at Kent University and author of Paranoid Parenting, said: ‘The number of families with one child in Britain will be more than half within seven years. ‘For many people, having one child is like an insurance policy. ‘It fulfils their need to carry on the bloodline without having to make as much commitment.’ The figures, from the Office for National Statistics’ study on families and households, show the trend is affecting all types of families. The proportion of married couples with one child grew from 37 per cent to 40 per cent from 2003 to 2013. First-borns have long been thought to be the most successful child in a family. But new research suggests their younger siblings actually do better – because they are spurred on to top their achievements. Researchers from the University of Essex examined primary school test results and GCSE scores to see how the success of first-born children in school affected their younger brothers and sisters. They found having an older sibling boosted a child’s learning by as much as spending an extra £670 on schooling could achieve. The effect is even more pronounced in less well-off families. Study authors Cheti Nicoletti and Birgitta Rabe said older children can pass on their knowledge, help with homework, or give tips about school and teachers, for which parents might have less experience. Some youngsters succeed by imitating a high-achieving older sibling, for example by copying their work style, while others do better by trying to be different. The ‘sibling spillover effect’ could even explain why Ed Miliband, for example, beat older brother David to become Labour party leader. Unmarried cohabiting couples with one child grew from 51 per cent to 53 per cent in the same period, and single parents with one child jumped from 52 per cent to 58 per cent. James Davis, 37, and his wife Sal Thomas, 39, who live in Manchester with their son Edgar, 22 months, said they decided to stop at one child because it would give all three of them the best quality of life. ‘Sometimes I feel there’s quite a lot of pressure to get a sibling for your child,’ said Mr Davis. ‘People tend to frown on it and some have even told us we are being cruel. We have created a good work-life balance and we are very lucky to have a great child. ‘Introducing a new character into the mix could change that. We are conscious that we have to get him socialised. We take him to play group almost every day and arrange at least one play date at the weekend.’ Freelance writer Vicky Charles, 33, from Salisbury, who is raising her two-year-old daughter Samaire on her own, told the Sunday Times: ‘Being a single parent with an only child, there’s not a lot of space for little emperors. ‘Samaire still sleeps in my bed and we have a close bond ... I would hate her to feel pushed out. If I had another child there’s a chance she would feel like that.’ Academics think that some small families do better because they do not have to share resources – but there are drawbacks. Professor Ann Buchanan, an expert in social work at Oxford University, said: ‘Research in China has shown that most children from single child families do exceedingly well. ‘However, there is concern about higher suicide rates. The pressure on lone children is greater and this can lead to mental health problems.’ Single child families aren't rare - they are already the most normal size for a family in Britain - but the figure is rapidly on the rise . Hand-me-downs and shared bedrooms will soon be a thing of the past for most - within the next decade, half of all families will have just one child.","In seven years, 50 per cent of UK families will have just one child .

"A California woman's road rage landed her in jail twice in just five days. Deidre Orozco, 50, is back in Roseville Jail after she allegedly attempted to run two young women off I-80 just northeast of Sacramento on Saturday. Days earlier, she had been arrested and released because of another hit-and-run accident. The victims of Saturday's event filmed Orozco yelling and honking as she swerved her huge silver truck into the women's tiny Mazda. At one point, the video shows Orozco pulling her car in front of the victims — forcing them to stop — and claiming to be a highway deputy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on video: Deidre Orozco, 50, is seen pushing two young women in California off the road and then blocking their path with her huge silver truck . Orozco got out of her vehicle and tried to convince the victims that she was a highway deputy (left). She was later arrested by the real cops and booked on traffic charges for the second time in five days (right) One of the victims, passenger Delanie Strykul, says the incident started after Orozco cut them off twice, then slowed down to drive alongside their car. 'When she did that, I threw up my hands and flipped her off,' Strykul told CBS Sacramento. That got Orozco enraged, said the women, who 'feared for their lives.' 'She pulls in front of us and then pulls her car horizontal and stops us,' Strykul told CBS. The woman then gets out of her car and repeatedly knocks on Strykul's window, claiming to work in law enforcement. The young women manage to pull away — but Orozco gets back in the truck and begins to follow them, they said. 'She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,' Strykul told CBS. Orozco allegedly hit the women's car and tried to push them off the road, but they were able to get away again. 'We were so scared,' Strykul told CBS. 'If she had a gun it would have been way worse.' Passenger Delanie Strykul (left) filmed the scary incident with Orozco and was eventually able to find the real cops to assist her (right) They eventually called 911 and were told where a California Highway Patrol officer would be waiting for them. Orozco followed them off the road and was arrested, CBS reported. She's charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon. Five days earlier, Orozco had been arrested for an alleged hit-and-run in nearby Roseville. After the accident, police told the Auburn Journal, Orozco 'proceeded to drive to her relatives’ house where she threw rocks through the windows, vandalizing the home and issuing threats of bodily harm.'

"A teenage punk has been charged with supplying a dangerous batch of 'Superman' ecstasy drugs, believed to have claimed the lives of four men. Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich in Suffolk has been remanded in custody and will appear before magistrates tomorrow to face counts of supplying the drug and possession with intent to supply. A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were also arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation. Labourer, John Hocking, 20, (left) died after taking the drug on New Year's Eve while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas, was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich . The arrest comes after the deaths of three men from Suffolk were linked to the rogue batch of pills, as well as a fourth man from Shropshire. A fifth man was taken to hospital on New Year's Day and is making a recovery, Suffolk Police added. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. The reddish tablets are embossed with an 'S' Superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape . They are investigating the possibility the pair's death is linked to that of John Hocking, a 20-year-old labourer from Rendlesham in Suffolk - who also died on New Year's Day. The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - who died hours after Mr Hocking, is also believed to have been connected. All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman 'S' logo. Suffolk Police took the unprecedented move of offering an amnesty to anyone who handed in the tablets, in a desperate attempt to get them off the streets. Police believe the deaths of the three men in Ipswich may be linked after they were called to three addresses across the town in the space of one week (pictured) Officers said the drugs are similar to some found in the Netherlands which contained a very high amount of the substance PMMA. This gives the pills a delayed effect and users often overdose accidentally because they think the drug is not working, leading to a fatal rise in body temperature. Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths. The pills are described as red and triangular  with a Superman logo printed on them (pictured) 'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them. 'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.' Meanwhile, Suffolk Police said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Ipswich town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a 'Superman' pill. He was taken to Ipswich Hospital but has since been discharged. Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'It is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation. 'I would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills, please do not take them or pass them on, please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed. 'Our number one priority is to remove these drugs from our communities and prevent any further harm.'

"Threatened with arrest: Amal Clooney was warned by Egyptian officials that she risked arrest for exposes flaws in the country's judicial system . Amal Clooney's claims that she had been threatened with arrest by Egyptian officials after criticising the country's judicial system, has been disputed by government representatives. The human rights lawyer said she was warned after presenting a report identifying cracks in the judiciary that led to the conviction of three Al Jazeera journalists last year. Today, Egypt's interior ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif denied the allegations from Mrs Clooney, demanding she reveal who threatened her. 'She should say exactly who said that,' Abdel Latif said. 'Why not specify from the start who told her that?' 'We have nothing against her,' he said. Mrs Clooney's report, which was written before she became involved in the Al-Jazeera case, was considered highly controversial for its criticisms of Egypt's courts. Speaking to The Guardian after the Al Jazeera journalists' appeal hearing this week, she said: 'When I went to launch the report, first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo. 'They said ""does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government?"" We said ""well, yes"". They said ""well then, you're risking arrest"".' The report, compiled on behalf of the International Bar Association, suggested Egypt's judicial system was insufficiently independent. It highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors. Mrs Clooney, , who recently married Hollywood star George Clooney, and her team recommended the practice that allows Egyptian officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop. She added: 'That recommendation wasn't followed, and we've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts.' The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney are Peter Greste, Baher Mohamed, and Mohamed Fahmy. The group was initially sentenced to between seven and ten years in prison last June by the controversial Egyptian judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata. Scroll down for video . Stuck in jail: The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney (L-R) Baher Mohamed,  Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste . 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial . Mr Shehata earned global notoriety during the journalists' trial after mocking Mr Fahmy's fiancee and rarely removing his sunglasses during proceedings. A few months later he gained further infamy after sentencing 188 people to death in one mass trial. The three journalists launched a new appeal yesterday - but Mrs Clooney suggested she fears the flaws highlighted in her report will prevent the group from receiving a fair trial. The men have been held since December 2013 - with their arrests coming after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member. One of the defendants, Baher Mohamed, hold an Egyptian passport - and must pin his hopes on his sentence being overturned by the Egyptian courts. But Clooney's other clients, Mr Fahmy, a Canadian citizen, and his Australian colleague Mr Greste, are still hoping for deportation to their home countries. Both have applied to Egypt's chief prosecutor to demand they be sent to Canada and Australia  under the terms of a new presidential decree that gives foreign prisoners such an option. Inside Egypt, Mr Fahmy's appeals team was led by an Egyptian lawyer with contributions from Clooney that related to international law - but outside the country she is the one leading the efforts to win deportation.

"A French mayor was accused of 'racism and xenophobia' today after refusing to allow a dead Roma gipsy baby to be buried in a municipal cemetery. It follows the country's Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, infamously calling for entire Roma communities to be deported because they 'cannot integrate'. This time it is Christian Leclerc, the conservative mayor of Champlan, the Paris commuter town, who has sparked a nationwide controversy. The Roma baby was refused burial at Champlan's municipal cemetery (pictured) after the town's mayor said the few available plots were reserved for those who paid their taxes . When a Roma family living in an illegal camp said they wanted to give their two-and-a-half month old child, identified as Maria Francesca, a proper burial, he said no. Mr Leclerc insisted his local cemetery had 'very few available plots' and that 'priority is given to those who pay their taxes.' But Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France. 'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day. Maria Francesca's parents are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools. Now the mother and father are hoping to see their child buried in Wissous, another town nearby, after Richard Trinquier, the local major, said it was a 'question of humanity'. Mr Trinqueir said: 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened.' Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water of electricity in Champlan, and there are frequent calls for their camp to be razed. The baby's mother and father are now hoping their child will be buried in the nearby town of Wissous, after its mayor Richard Trinquier (pictured) sympathized with their plight . Pictured is Wissous cemetery, where the baby will be buried after it was denied a plot in nearby Champlan . They are part of community of some 20,000 mainly Romanian and Bulgarian gipsies in France who are regularly linked with crime and anti-social behaviour. Mr Valls, the notoriously reactionary Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who want to see them deported. As Interior Minister, he regularly approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families, saying: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.' In August, Gilles Bourdouleix, another French mayor, was fined after saying that Adolf Hitler 'maybe did not kill enough' Roma during the Second World War.","French mayor accused of racism after refusing Roma gipsy baby burial .

"Asylum seekers are being allowed into Britain without background searches to check if they are murderers, rapists or child abusers. Ministers admit that criminal records are not examined when someone applies to live in Britain in case it causes problems for them in their home country. The gaping loophole in immigration policy was last night described as ‘nonsense on stilts’. Checks on asylum seekers do not include criminal convictions in case it causes problems for them in their home country . Last month it emerged border inspectors unearthed one case in which staff accepted an application from an asylum-seeker – unaware that he had admitted a fatal stabbing in his homeland. Home Office minister Lord Bates told peers in a debate that it was the 'intention' to carry out checks on the background of asylum applicants. But in a letter sent a month later, he admitted that while names are checked against UK and EU police databases, information is not sought from the country individuals are fleeing from. During the debate Labour peer Lord Martin, the former Commons Speaker, raised concerns about the ease with which individuals became asylum seekers. He said: 'My Lords, when I served as a Member of Parliament, I had a large proportion of asylum seekers in my constituency of Glasgow Springburn. Labour MP Frank Field called on Home Secretary Theresa May to ensure everyone seeking asylum has their criminal record checked . 'What would happen was that the asylum seeker would say, 'I seek asylum' and therefore they were looked at. 'Can I get the assurance that when asylum seekers are seeking asylum, they are checked to see whether they have been serious offenders in their previous country?' Lord Bates replied: 'That is certainly the intention and the process.' He added that he would check on the details. In a letter to peers he admitted: 'Upon claiming asylum, the Home Office conducts a series of checks against databases including our immigration fingerpint database, Eurodac (a European wide database) and the Police National Computer (PNC) in order to identify any known criminal or security issues. 'We do not currently check overseas criminal records in asylum cases because, in some instances, by disclosing an application has been made could put an applicant at risk or jeopardise the liberty and security of family members still living in the country of origin, potentially strengthening their claim for asylum.' The loophole means someone convicted or wanted for a serious offence outside Europe would not be picked up, and could be granted the right to stay in the UK. The admission has sparked calls for an urgent review of the policy. It comes after the outcry last year when 14-year-old Alice Gross was murdered by Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, who had served seven years for murdering his wife. Labour MP Frank Field told The Sunday Times the policy of not looking at the criminal past of asylum seekers was 'shocking' and 'nonsense on stilts'. He added: 'People have been murdered by asylum seekers. 'A slightly late new year's resolution for the home secretary should be to ensure everyone seeking asylum has their criminal record checked.'","Home Office challenged over checks made on people seeking asylum .

"Leading online movie and TV service Netflix has been accused of beginning to block Australian users from accessing the site ahead of its official launch Down Under in March. Some of the reported 200,000 Aussies already accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network (VPN) technology, which alters their IP address, have reported access problems recently. It’s been claimed the difficulties are due to a planned crackdown on Australian VPN users by Netflix. Scroll down for video . Online viewing service Netflix, which boasts signature show House of Cards, is coming to Australia in March. There have been reports users are now being blocked from accessing it with VPNs . ‘I have a sneaking suspicion that Netflix may be testing these new IP blocking methods temporarily in certain markets. At this time the blocks do not seem aggressive and may only be targeted at IP ranges that exceed too many simultaneous logins,’ TorGuard’s Ben Van der Pelt told TorrentFreak. However, Netflix has denied any new lockdown, telling Cnet: ‘There have been no changes to our VPN policies.’ While visiting Australia Netflix Director of Corporate Communications and Technology Cliff Edwards reportedly said recently: ‘VPNs violate the terms of our service, and we believe very much so that anybody who licenses content should get paid for their content.’ In November, Netflix announced its service will become legally available in March 2015 to users in Australia and New Zealand who subscribe to the network. The service will allow them to instantly watch a selection of popular movies and TV shows in high-definition . But it has not yet been confirmed whether or not Netflix will be bringing over its signature shows such House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black. Netflix is behind shows such as American comedy-drama series Orange Is The New Black . The popular award-winning show stars Taylor Schilling (right) and Laura Prepon (left) The announcement of the launch ends months of speculation about the local plans for the company. The online service, which first launched in 2007, boasts some 53 million subscribers in dozens of countries. The platform will be available on smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, set-top boxes and consoles, with high-definition and 4K available. A Netflix spokesman told Daily Mail Australia it has been unconfirmed whether shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black will be available as they are still in 'internal discussions'. Pricing has not been disclosed but the Daily Telegraph reports it is expected to cost about $10 to $15 a month. The announcement comes months after Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax Media revealed they will be launching a new Australian subscription service next year. DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien will be available to Australian and New Zealand viewers . Marco Polo is also one of Neflix's original series, which is set to be available in Australia and New Zealand . Other launch titles include upcoming US television series Marvel's Daredevil . StreamCo is expected to launch during the 2015 financial year. The Netflix launch is expected to ramp up the pressure on pay-TV services such as Foxtel, which recently slashed prices in anticipation. Yet the antipodean version is likely to lag the US version given Foxtel owns exclusive local rights to shows such as Game of Thrones. Launch titles will include original series such as Marco Polo, BoJack Horseman and All Hail King Julien, with others such as Bloodline and Marvel's Daredevil to come later in the year. The US-based company has also gained Australian subscription video on-demand rights to superhero television series Gotham, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. However Nine Entertainment currently holds the broadcast, first-run, and in-season catch up rights to the Batman prequel. As a result, Netflix will not be able to air the new show until 12 months after it has premiered on Nine.

Hannah will have a 'Winter Wonderland' theme, while Danielle will have a 'Sugar Plum Fairy' one. Mrs Reed said her daughters are growing up well, saying: 'They’re just perfect. They're healthy. They have eight teeth each. Danny's crawling and around here, and Hannah's well on her way.'

"Alun Jones (pictured) said separating boys and girls in state school could prevent boys falling behind . Teenage boys should be taught in single-sex classes to protect them from being intimidated by ‘bright and articulate’ girls, an education boss says. Separate lessons for boys aged 11 to 16 in state schools could stop them falling behind in exam results, according to the first male president of the Girls’ Schools Association. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: ‘If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability. ‘The result is that boys don’t put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.’ Mr Jones told the Sunday Times: ‘Boys will put their hand up if they feel safe; they won’t if they are in fear of being ridiculed or humiliated. Boys fear failure just like girls do.’ The former choral scholar – who has been principal of St Gabriel’s girls’ school in Newbury, Berkshire, since 2001 – is calling for boys to be taught under the ‘diamond model’ to improve their academic results. The model sees boys and girls educated together until the age of 11, before being taught separately until 16 and then returned to mixed classes in sixth form. ‘In the most formative years when adolescence is hitting with a vengeance, boys should be educated separately. ‘More single-sex classes for boys in state schools might halt the decline in boys’ achievement,’ Mr Jones explained. ‘I think that every state school should consider introducing the diamond model and experiment with teaching boys and girls separately especially in subjects like English, maths and sciences.’ Fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by Department for Education figures released in October, which showed girls striding ahead in GCSE results. Some 61 per cent of girls in state schools scored at least five C grades last year – including English and maths. However among boys this figure drops to just 51 per cent. The average for both sexes was 56 per cent. 'Boys will put their hand up if they feel safe; they won't if they are in fear of being ridiculed or humiliated.' Fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by Department for Education figures released in October, which showed girls striding ahead in GCSE results. Above, file image . He called on boys to be educated separately from girls in the formative years of adolescence, and suggested more single-sex classes for boys in state schools could improve boys' achievement. Fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by Department for Education statistics released in October which showed 61.2 per cent of girls at state schools scored at least five C grades including English and maths last year, compared with 50.8 per cent of boys. But at A-level, boys did better than girls with 12.3 per cent of male students gaining three A*-A grades, compared with 11.1 per cent of female classmates. Mr Jones' comments come as its revealed a huge gender divide in the A-levels chosen by sixth-formers is likely to continue as girls continue to shun 'masculine' subjects like physics, it is suggested. Despite a number of schemes aimed at encouraging young women to take the science after age 16, there has been little impact on take-up so far, headteachers and academics said.","Alun Jones claims boys should be educated separately until the age of 16 .

"With his wife and child close at hand, Army Maj. Chad Wriglesworth battled skin cancer for more than a year before dying at age 37. 'It was long and painful and awful,' said Aimee Wriglesworth, who believes the cancer resulted from exposure to toxic fumes in Iraq. Yet the 28-year-old widow from Bristow, Virginia, seized a chance to recount the ordeal and its aftermath to a researcher, hoping that input from her and her 6-year-old daughter might be useful to other grieving military families. This Dec. 16, 2014 photo shows the wedding photo of Army widow, Aimee Wriglesworth, and her late husband, Chad, on display in her home in Bristow, Va. She is one of hundreds of widows sharing their stories of bereavement for a new study . 'To be able to study what we felt and what we're going through - maybe this will help people down the line,' Wriglesworth said. By the hundreds, other widows, widowers, parents, siblings and children are sharing accounts of their grief as part of the largest study ever of America's military families as they go through bereavement. About 2,000 people have participated over the past three years, and one-on-one interviews will continue through February. The federally funded project is being conducted by the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress at the Maryland-based Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. The study is open to families of the more than 19,000 service members from all branches of the military who have died on active duty since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, regardless of whether the death resulted from combat, accident, illness, suicide or other causes. 'We've been impressed by how many people who've had this experience really want to let us know about it,' said the leader of the study, Dr. Stephen Cozza. 'They want to talk about what happened - to provide information that will help them and people like them in the future.' Aimee Wriglesworth is hopeful that the study will provide new insight on how best to support young families like hers. 'A lot of things that are helping us now come from Vietnam, Korea, World War II,' she said of existing assistance programs. 'But now it's a whole new world of military losses. Studying us is really important.' About half of the participants are providing saliva samples that will be used for genetic research, aimed at determining if certain genetic makeups correlate with the duration of the grieving process and the levels of stress and depression experienced as it unfolds. Some previous research has suggested that a certain gene variation is associated with greater risk of 'complicated grief,' especially in women. Cozza said a final report isn't expected until 2017, and he is encouraging more survivors to sign up for interviews before the cutoff date in late February. 'Our interest is understanding what these families need,' he said. 'Recognizing the need will allow us to make better policy recommendations as to what sort of services would be appropriate for them.' The questionnaires and face-to-face interviews are being handled by eight field researchers based in regions spanning the country. Jill Harrington, the senior field researcher, said the team members are experienced in dealing with grief and well-versed in military culture. ""For the families of the fallen, whoever they talk to, they want to be able to trust,"" Harrington said. ""We have a highly trained group of folks who know how to listen and how to be patient."" Army widow, Aimee Wriglesworth, poses for a photo next to a display of some of her late husband's awards and artifacts in her home in Bristow, Va. While bereaved military families share much in common with other grieving families, there are distinctive aspects to many military deaths. Whether in combat, or by accident or suicide, they often occur suddenly, and many of the deceased are in their 20s or 30s. 'These are young families - a lot of single parents raising kids alone,' said Harrington. 'When someone dies young, there's a loss of the future. How do you live with that loss in your life?' Some insight on that question will be provided by the roughly 100 children, ages 6 to 18, who are participating in the study. Most are the sons or daughters of deceased service members; a few are younger siblings. 'Many of these children, when their parent died, were very young and didn't know them well,' said Cozza. According to preliminary findings, he said, a factor helping them weather the loss was having pride in their departed parent's military service. The web site for the study encourages bereaved parents to let their children participate, while acknowledging that the one-on-one interviews, lasting 90 minutes to three hours, cover sensitive matters. 'The field researchers are trained to recognize when a child is upset and will periodically ask your child if he/she is okay to continue,' the web site says. 'If your child becomes upset, he/she can decide to stop the interview at any time.' Among the children taking part is Aimee Wriglesworth's daughter, Savannah, who was 5 when her father died at home on Nov. 20, 2013. Family photos from the preceding days show Savannah cuddling up with him as he lay stricken in bed. Chad Wriglesworth initially joined the Air Force and was deployed to Iraq in 2008. He transferred to the Army in 2009, and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011. According to his wife, he began reporting lumps on various parts of his body starting in 2011 and was diagnosed in 2012 with Stage 4 melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. The military, without being more specific, ruled that the major's death occurred in the line of duty; his wife believes the cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic fumes fromopen-air 'burn pits' in Iraq that were used to destroy waste at U.S. bases. Another study participant is Ryan Manion Borek, whose brother, Marine Lt. Travis Manion, was killed in combat in Iraq in 2007. Borek now heads a foundation named after her brother, which seeks to assist veterans, as well as families of fallen service members. A stuffed animal wearing the dog tags of the late Army Major Chad Wriglesworth on the chair where he died of cancer in Bristow after returning from deployment in Afghanistan . Borek expressed hope that the study's findings will reflect the wide range of ways in which survivors respond to the deaths of their loved ones. 'We don't all fit into the same box,' she said. 'That's the beauty of doing a study like this - we can begin to understand all the different ways people are dealing with their loss.' A video produced by the research team conveys the breadth of the study, featuring brief interviews with some of the survivors who decided to participate. They include a Marine Corps officer, Lisa Doring, whose Marine husband died in a helicopter crash near their base in Iraq; a mother whose only son, an Army private, was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan; and a couple whose son, serving in the Coast Guard, committed suicide after what they described as sustained bullying and harassment. Of all the active-duty deaths in the period being studied, about 13 percent were suicides. Accidents accounted for 35 per cent, combat 30 per cent, illness 15 per cent and homicide 3 per cent, according to Cozza. One of the major partners for the study is the Arlington, Virginia-based support group known as TAPS - the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. It was founded in 1994 by Bonnie Carroll two years after her husband, a brigadier general, died in an Army plane crash. Carroll said she was heartened that the study encompassed all types of deaths, even including service members responsible for murder-suicides. 'Regardless of how the person died, at some point in their life they stepped forward to raise their right hand and say `I will protect this nation,'' Carroll said.","About 2,000 people have participated over the past three years, and one-on-one interviews will continue through February .

"One man has finished off the festive season carrying an extra 2,500 pounds... after shedding 70lbs. At the beginning of 2014, Patrick Barnes bet William Hill that he would lose five stone by the end of the year. The bookmakers gave him odds of 25-1 that he wouldn't shift the flab and Patrick decided to put £100 on the wager. Scroll down for video . Patrick Barnes, 31, from Birmingham placed £100 on a 25-1 wager with William Hill last January. The bookmakers have now paid out £2,500 after Patrick succeeded in bet that he'd lose five stone in a year (Patrick pictured after losing the weight - left, and before - right) But the betting office didn't bank on Patrick's secret weapon - playing darts. The real estate manager from Erdington, Birmingham hit his heaviest weight of 21st 3lbs after getting married in 2013 to his girlfriend Rebecca. After piling on the pounds during a honeymoon to Las Vegas, the 31-year-old set his sights on a slimmer stomach by January 2015. As an incentive, he placed his £100 bet on losing 70lbs by this Christmas at the bookmakers twelve months ago, then started his diet. But he also took up a sport in the shape of darts and despite stereotypical images of porky players, the pounds fell off. The bookmakers gave him odds of 25-1 that he wouldn't shift the flab and Patrick decided to put £100 on the wager . 5ft 9ins tall Patrick lost six stone in 12 months on a diet of healthy food and exercise, slimming down to a trim 15st 4lbs. He said: 'It was all about exercise and healthy eating. 'But my secret weapon was playing darts - with weight loss they always say take up a sport, but I used the dart board to keep me moving in the evenings. 'It keeps you walking about at night when you are not playing squash or other things. It also helps take your mind off food as you are counting the dart score and not the calories. 'I'd seen a story in the papers about a man who placed a bet to lose his weight and that's when I decided to do the same.

"Dozens of demonstrators today stormed  restaurants and targeted white diners in New York and California as part of a 'Black Brunch' protest against alleged police violence.

"When Kim Kardashian was announced as the face of the new issue of fashion bible LOVE magazine, complete with edgy bleached brows, it signaled the end of her transformation from super eek to super chic. The metamorphosis has been no mean feat, for while she might now be a firm  favourite with designers, Kim's initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for none other than Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. In fact, a pre-fame Kim also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and troubled film star. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian, 34, is on the new cover of Katie Grand's LOVE magazine. It signals the end of her transition from lowly stylist to fashion favourite, that included a Vogue cover and the announcement of an ad campaign for Balmain . Battle of the brows: Kim posed with Cara Delevingne last year shortly after the shoot had taken place . It wasn't just her lack of A-list quality that forced Kim into the fashion doldrums though, despite her day job, back in the mid-noughties, her personal style left a lot to be desired. From bright gold dresses to garish satin, she rarely made a 'best-dressed' list in the early part of her career. But fast forward nearly ten years and it's a completely different story. To say Kim has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent Fashion Weeks she has been front row in Paris, New York, London and Milan. Not only that, she and her husband Kanye West were recently revealed as the new faces of Balmain and she counts Givenchy's Creative Director Ricardo Tisci as a close personal friend. It hasn't been an easy transition though,  for a long time Kim was shunned by the designers who now adore her. Just over two years ago, during a photoshoot for ELLE magazine at the end of 2012, many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star. Pals with Paris: Before she found global fame, Kim worked as Paris Hilton's stylist and personal shopper. She also worked with Lindsay Lohan . Not her best: Kim was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits . What Kanye says goes: In 2012 Kanye cleared out Kim's wardrobe and gave a complete image overhaul . Nicola Formichetti, artistic director at Diesel, styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high-end samples was a 'challenge.' He said: 'People wouldn’t lend me the clothes. But that’s fashion snobbery.' Nicola, who is now good friends with Kim, revealed that the top designers didn't want their designs featured on a woman who had, 'less-than-model-like-proportions.' However, he rightfully predicted at the time, 'She's not the It Girl yet, but she will be.' Stylish couple: Kim and Kanye are regulars at Fashion Week . Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation. Kim has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper-come-designer's influence over her wardrobe choices. In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look. And it seemed his help worked - just under a year after the ELLE shoot and Kim, who was heavily pregnant with North at the time, showed the first signs of being ingratiated into the fashion world. She was asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book. Kim was photographed for the cover picture by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and the shoot was art directed by Ricardo Tisci. Pretty and pregnant: Kim looking stunning in a shoot for CR Fashion Book . Blooming lovely: Kim posed pregnant for Karl Lagerfeld, with Carine describing her as the best model . Friends: Kim and Carine share a laugh on the set of Kim's big shoot . It was a controversial choice at the time, but that worked in Kim's favour, as Carine later explained to Time Out. She said: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people.' She went on to praise the reality star, saying: 'She was brave. . . with Karl Lagerfeld shooting. 'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything. 'I don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she said yes to everything. 'She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.' Oh baby: When North was born Kim took to Instagram to show the clothes she had been gifted for North including items from Lanvin and Alexander Wang . Wonderful in white: Maison Martin Margiela gifted North this white outfit . It was following North's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular Kim was becoming with the world's biggest fashion houses though, from the flood of designers sent clothes for her new arrival, all duly documented on Kim's Instagram page. From Givenchy to Celine and Maison Martin Margiela to Alexander Wang, Kim shared photographs of North's adorable new wardrobe, signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her. The biggest coup came in April 2014 though, when she and Kanye landed a joint Vogue cover ahead of their May wedding. Their first big cover: Kim and Kanye covered the April 2014 issue of Vogue having won the approval of editor  Anna Wintour . Fashionable family: Kim and Kanye took North to the Chloe show in September 2014 with Kim choosing to dress their daughter in an outfit matching hers . The news caused outrage among some of the magazine's subscribers, but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year. That magazine sold 500,000 copies, beating both Beyonce and Michelle Obama's Vogue covers. Anna Wintour said of the cover: 'Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it. 'I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. 'As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover. 'He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn't true.' Since then, Kim has sat from row (with North in tow) at some of the biggest shows at fashion week. She also became part of Olivier Rousteng's Balmain army, later posing as a model for him. Kim now counts designers like Lagerfeld and Valentino as friends and is regularly pictured on nights out with supermodels like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. It truly seems that Formichetti's prediction has come true... Kim has become the ultimate fashion It girl.","The 34-year-old is on the new cover of Katie Grand's LOVE magazine .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has pledged $5 million in aid to Iraq as he reaffirmed his commitment to tackling Islamic State militants in the country. During an unannounced secret visit to Baghdad, Mr Abbott vowed Australia will stand with Iraq in their fight against the terrorists as he held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. ‘This is an important struggle. It's a struggle not just for the people of Iraq, and not just for the people of this region, but for the whole world - because the Daesh death cult, the ISIL death cult, has declared war against the world,’ Mr Abbot said.

"AirAsia has downplayed an incident that saw one of its planes turned back before takeoff in Indonesia, a week after another of its jets crashed into the Java Sea with 162 on board. Indonesia AirAsia flight 7633 was taxiing in preparation for takeoff on Saturday at Surabaya airport - where last week's doomed flight also took off - when a power unit used to start the plane shut down, an airline official said. As a result, the pilot turned back to the gate, Raden Achmad Sadikin, director of Safety and Security at Indonesia AirAsia, told reporters. Scroll down for video . About 90 per cent of passengers refused to get back on an AirAsia plane after an engine struck a problem on Saturday, it was reported (file picture) Local media in Indonesia and Malaysia had reported the Bandung-bound plane's engine had cut out after emitting a loud bang that terrified passengers, but AirAsia stressed it was a minor incident. 'It's not that the engine failed. The plane wanted to take off but the APU [auxiliary power unit], which is the equipment that helped to start the engine, suddenly shut down,' Mr Sadikin said. The plane later landed safely at its destination in West Java after undergoing a check, Indonesia AirAsia chief executive Sunu Widyatmoko was quoted by local media as saying. Meanwhile, AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes lashed out at the initial media reports, calling the headlines 'sensational' and 'silly'. 'Silly headlines in Malaysia. AirAsia Indonesia aircraft did not have a stalled engine. An APU which is ground power had to be restarted,' he said. Mr Fernandes urged staff to remain strong. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes lashed out at the initial media reports, calling the headlines 'sensational' and 'silly' The aircraft had taxied just 3 metres at Surabaya’s Juanda International Airport (pictured) when one of the engines died with a loud bang . 'Facts will come out. As I have said we are calm, will take the hits now as our focus is families. But time will show what AirAsia is all about,' he tweeted. The aircraft had taxied just three metres when passengers heard a loud bang, Indonesia's Metro TV reported. The plane, bound for Bandung, Indonesia, made it back to the gate without any further problems and the 120 passengers were asked to disembark. Passenger Yusuf Fitriadi told the TV station a man wearing a pilots’ uniform said to passengers the starter monitor had malfunctioned. ‘The plane was ready and moved, but suddenly a loud sound was heard, the sound of the engine disappeared and the plane moved backwards,’ Mr Fitriadi said. ‘We were shocked and panicked.’ Mr Fitriadi said the airline told passengers later the flight would be resumed after the problem had been addressed. But he claimed about 90 per cent of the passengers refused to get back on board, fearing that the fault would re-occur during the flight. Those who declined to get back on the plane had their fares refunded, Metro TV said. Meanwhile, Indonesian officials said weather was the 'triggering factor' in last week's crash of AirAsia flight 8501, with icing likely causing engine damage after it flew into a storm. As search teams reporting seeing a fifth large object at the bottom of the Java Sea which might be parts of the missing plane, the new drama involving an engine was the kind of news the airline did not want. Another three bodies were recovered from flight QZ8501 on Monday, bringing the total number so far to 34.","Aircraft had taxied just 3 metres when one of the engines died with a bang .

"Procedures used by Gwyneth Paltrow could cost around £14,000 a month but a new report suggests same effects can be had for £150 . The idea of chewing on a selection of garden weeds with a sprinkling of crushed seeds is enough to put most of us off our supper. But for health-obsessed actress Gwyneth Paltrow, these are key ingredients in her January detox diet. The Oscar-winner, 42, has released a bizarre seven-day meal plan through her lifestyle website Goop. She promises that, when paired with colonic irrigation and trips to infra-red saunas, the diet will help devotees lose weight and remove ‘heavy metals and pesticides’ from the body. But this weekend, two of her areas of expertise - food and skincare - have been criticised in the press. One national newspaper has suggested her multi-thousand pound skincare routine can be bought for a fraction of the price, while another has reported that her detox could leave users out of pocket and possibly unable to sleep from hunger. Gwyneth has long been admired for her youthful complexion - the 42-year-old could easily pass for a woman ten years younger on any day. Unsurprisingly though, sipping from the fountain of youth doesn't come cheap and last week, the Daily Mail revealed the star's  beauty regime costs an eye-watering £14,000-a-month. But a new report has suggested that it is possible to roll back the years like Gwyneth, for as little as £150 every four weeks. According to the Sunday Times, Gwyneth's luxury skin therapies can be bought for much less from high street stores. From holistic treatments to weekly facials, not to mention the services of a hair stylist and make-up artist for personal appearances, Miss Paltrow’s regime does not come cheap. The mother-of-two is said to enjoy Reiki stress reduction massage on a monthly basis, which typically costs £185 for 90 minutes, resulting in an annual spend of as much as £2,220. But Pilates classes claim to have similar benefits. For just £80 a month in many towns across the UK, Pilates teachers claim their classes help with not just stress relief, but also alignment, strength, flexibility, tone and endurance. From holistic treatments to weekly facials, not to mention the services of a hair stylist and make-up artist for personal appearances, Miss Paltrow’s regime does not come cheap . The Oscar-winning actress is also said to be a fan of the intravenous vitamin therapy at the Be Hive of Healing centre in Los Angeles. Costing up to £289 per session, it is estimated Miss Paltrow has at least one a month and could easily hand over as much as £3,500 a year. The Goop diet: Two 'detox days' from the diet . The Sunday Times claim that many of the same benefits can be had from a packet of vitamin supplements that costs roughly £5 a month from any local supermarket. The Iron Man star, whose net worth is estimated at £40 million, is also believed to indulge twice a year in Thermage laser treatment on her face, brows and neck, thought to cost almost £17,000. In between these sessions, Miss Paltrow – who split from Coldplay’s Chris Martin last year – heads to Tracie Martyn for facials when she is in New York, where she thinks nothing of paying almost £1,500 a year for microdermabrasion, electronic muscle stimulation and oxygen-mist treatment. She is also believed to enjoy an apple stem cell facial – at around £300 a session or £12,000 a year at Sonya Dakar in LA. But according to award-winning beauty blogger Mikhila McDaid, low cost beauty products can be just as effective as the more expensive items. She told the paper that Montagne Jeunesse  mud pacs, which can be bought from high street chemist Boots for £1 a sachet, cause the skin to glow in a similar way to many costly beauty treatments. The newspaper also took aim at the hair salon treatments and trims that are estimated to cost Miss Paltrow around £6,000 a year. Before she invested in a chain of blow-dry bars this year, she was also paying for weekly blow drys, which were thought to cost her almost £100 each – or around £5,000 a year. Gwyneth's expensive beauty regime isn't the only part of her maintenance routine coming under fire though.Her January detox, which has recently been published on her lifestyle blog Goop , has now been criticised by nutritionists . They pointed out that it is easy to find a salon that does a cut and blow-dry for £45 a session and that they only need to be topped up every six weeks at the most. In fact, a set of highlights, followed by a cut and blow dry can be found for as little as £29 is using a voucher website like Groupon. Gwyneth's expensive beauty regime isn't the only part of her maintenance routine coming under fire though. Her January detox, which has recently been published on her lifestyle blog Goop, has now been criticised by nutritionists. The detailed seven-day plan, which is designed to rid the body of Christmas toxins, recommends beetroot and coriander juice for breakfast, red lentil soup for lunch and chicken salad for dinner on day one, with a snack of rice cakes and almond butter. Day three suggests smoothie for breakfast, soup and half a baked sweet potato for lunch and Seared Halibut with Lentils, Kale, and Salsa Verde for dinner, with more rice cakes for a snack. But the Sunday Telegraph reports that the diet could leave people too hungry to sleep and also out of pocket if they try to buy the rare ingredients involved in some of the recipes. Dr Carina Norris, a registered nutritionist, told the paper: 'If you are not used to this kind of eating you would find yourself hungry at times you wouldn't expect and it could be very hard to sustain and end up falling off the wagon altogether and eating a whole packet of biscuits or reaching for a tub of ice cream. 'The whole detox idea is not necessary because if your liver and kidneys are in good working order, they are your detox organs.'","Procedures used by Gwyneth Paltrow could cost around £14,000 a month .

"This breathtaking image offers a rare glimpse of a comet hurtling through space and leaving a magnificent trail of ice and gas in its wake. Comet Lovejoy is currently shooting north as it passes Earth - and photographers around the world are itching to capture its incredible green glowing tail. The comet is getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the Northern Hemisphere to spot, and  views of the celestial body are expected to be at their best in around a week's time. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: Comet Lovejoy is currently whizzing northwards past Earth, leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake . Comet Lovejoy, is currently around 43 million miles from Earth and is thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second. The comet, also known as C/2014 Q2, was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers. To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory. It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. Stunning: Views of the comet are expected to be best in around a week's time when it will be visible 'from light-polluted city suburbs' This graph shows how Comet Lovejoy's trajectory is taking it northwards outside our planet's orbit - it will be closest to us on January 7 . Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice. As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight. They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth’s orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers. As the graph shows though, the comet's trajectory does not take it inside the Earth's orbit. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult. A comet's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale, lower numbers indicate more intense brightness. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult . It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks was  dramatically captured on camera by stargazers in Japan, above . Lovejoy started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5, the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope. As National Geographic reports, comet Lovejoy should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-January, which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet 'from light-polluted city suburbs'. Some observers were able to spot Lovejoy in late December as it reached magnitude 5.3. Lovejoy's  striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet: cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green when sunlight passes through them. According to CBS News, Lovejoy will be closest to Earth on Jan 7 - after this time, it will start to move away from Earth and lose its intensity.

"A family was handed a £400 parking charge for taking too long to eat their Christmas lunch at a pub. Tina Hoskins and 23 of her relatives descended on the Brewers Fayre in Bristol for their annual festive meal in December. The family left the pub after spending around three hours there, having waited more than 45 minutes for their pre-booked food. Tina Hoskins (left) was told to face charges of up to £100 for overstaying her limit in the car park of a pub . Later Mrs Hoskins, 34, and three others in the party were sent a letter ordering them to pay £60 for overstaying their welcome in the pub's car park where vehicles are limited to three hours. If not paid within two weeks, the family was told charges would increase to £100 per car. 'I was livid when the bill came through,' said Mrs Hoskins, a teacher. 'I am outraged that they can charge you to park, especially considering the amount the party spent. 'I will not be paying this parking fine as I believe it to be a disgrace. Instead I will advise my family of a more friendly establishment for next year.' The family later learned the pub insists that customers using their parking facilities give a note of their registration number to bar staff on arrival. But Mrs Hoskins said she was never made aware of such rules, and that the family were only there for three hours as their food had taken so long to prepare. 'My youngest son was very tired, so we asked for chips quickly so he could eat before he fell asleep. 'However, they took an extremely long time and he fell asleep. The food for everyone was served at around 1pm. Then after my son woke up, he had chips before we left. 'It was lovely to see the family, but this meal has now been ruined by parking fines.' 'If the food had been on time, none of us would have exceeded the three-hour time limit.' Brewers Fayre has decided not to pursue the charges, and said it would welcome the family back. The pub in Bristol said it asked customers to enter their registration numbers upon arrival to enforce the rules . Mrs Hoskins said she did not know she had to enter her car details to avoid facing the charges. Above, instructions from on a sign in the car park . The pub in Bristol said it would not be pursuing the charges issued to the family, and would welcome them back in the future . 'We were sorry to hear about the car parking fines faced by Ms Hoskins and her party while visiting the Bristol Concord Brewers Fayre in early December,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'Whilst there is signage in the shared car park – which is managed by a third party - as well as our restaurant, which clearly states the maximum length of stay and also highlights the option to sign-up for a further two hours of free parking for our guests, we appreciate this is a substantial fine that has marred an otherwise enjoyable dining experience. 'With this in mind, in this particular instance we would like to cover the cost of the fines as a gesture of goodwill to the party and look forward to welcoming them back to the restaurant in 2015. Experts have warned against unsolicited parking fines and charges brought by private companies. According to Money Supermarket, such letters are not enforceable fines but mere invoices. 'If you get an unfair private ticket, DON'T just pay it!' advice on the company's website reads. 'Trying to reclaim cash already paid isn't easy, so it's far easier to dispute it. Beating an unfair ticket isn't an exact science. 'These companies have no official right to fine you, though they may try to make you think they do. 'All they're doing is sending you a notice for what they deem to be a breach of contract.'","Tina Hoskins and  her relatives had lunch at Brewers Faye pub in Bristol .

"2015 has arrived with a bang, bringing with it new opportunities to explore the hidden gems and beautiful landscapes Australia has to offer. Daily Mail Australia spoke to the top travel bloggers around the country, using their inside knowledge of the nation's sunburnt backyard to find the ten best holiday hideaways to visit this year. From tropical rainforests and quaint fishing ports, to tiny towns and hiking trails, the only tough decision to make will be where to travel to first. Scroll down for video . Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory: spectacular waterfalls, gorges, Aboriginal rock art, and an abundance of wildlife and natural beauty . The Gunlum Falls waterhole is just one of many treasured spots to visit in Kakadu National Park . Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory . Mudgee, NSW . Bright, Victoria . Town of 1770, Queensland . Broome, Western Australia . Kuranda, Queensland . The Pinnacles, Western Australia . Robe, South Australia . The Grampians, Victoria . Sunshine Coast Hinterland, Queensland . Caz and Craig Makepeace, the professional adventurers behind YTravel Blog, describe themselves as 'serial travel addicts'. The couple, who originally hail from the Central Coast in NSW, said that they like to 'call the world their home', having lived in five countries and visited a staggering 52. Caz Makepeace listed Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory as one of their absolute favourite spots in the country. 'A national park that offers spectacular waterfalls, gorges, Aboriginal rock art, and an abundance of wildlife and natural beauty,' said Caz. 'Stay a while and soak up its spiritual essence,' she advised. The pair are also a fan of Mudgee, a town in the central west of NSW, about 250 kilometres away from Sydney. 'What's not to like about the country charm of a town that has wide streets, heritage buildings, amazing food, craft breweries and wineries you can easily cycle between?' asked Caz. The town is well-loved for it's plethora of bed and breakfast establishments, and has an ever-growing winery selection to sweeten the deal. Mudgee, New South Wales: Fields of purple lavender are reminiscent of the provincial countryside in France . 'What's not to like about the country charm of a town that has wide streets, heritage buildings, amazing food, craft breweries and wineries you can easily cycle between?' asked Caz, from YTravel Blog says of Mudgee . Bright, northeast Victoria: The stunning  parkland beside the Ovens River during Autumn . Springtime is just as beautiful in Mudgee which boasts festivals all year round, and is a hotspot for paragliding and hang gliding . The unusually named Bright, in northeast Victoria makes the cut for as well. A beacon for activity despite a small population, Bright boasts the annual Autumn Festival and frequent paragliding and hang gliding festivals. 'You can't beat a summer in the high country of Victoria,' said Caz. 'Spend your days cycling through the valleys and then cooling off in the rivers that run through it after. This region has some of Australia's best craft brews!' The list gets historical with the Town of 1770, in Queensland. Built on the site of Captain James Cook's second landing, the town holds a re-enactment of the momentous event each year. Caz describes 1770 as a 'sleepy and quiet town that brims over with stunning landscapes, amazing beaches, nearby reefs and plenty of adventure.' Town of 1770, Queensland: Built on the site of Captain James Cook's second landing, the twon holds a re-enactment of the momentous event each year . The town of 1170 is described as a 'sleepy and quiet town that brims over with stunning landscapes, amazing beaches, nearby reefs and plenty of adventure.' Broome, Western Australia: The popular tourist destination triples in population during the peak period . 'It offers the best mix of everything that is special about Australia: a rich indigenous culture with wonderful Aboriginal art at galleries dotted around town; the world's finest stretch of sand at Cable Beach,' Lara says . Lastly, the travel enthusiasts list Broome as a must-see. In the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the town is a popular tourist destination, growing from a population of 15,000 to 45,000 in peak season. 'It’s the exotic flavour of Asia, mixed with the rugged Australian outback, and the chilled out Aussie beach living,' said Caz. 'It's also a great base to explore one of Australia's most incredible regions: The Kimberley.' Lara Dunston, one half of the well-loved Grantourismo Travel blog, also lists Broome as a 'must-see'. 'While it's no secret, of course, it always surprises us how few Australians get here; more Aussies have probably been to Bali than to Broome,' said Lara. 'Broome offers the best mix of everything that is special about Australia: a rich indigenous culture with wonderful Aboriginal art at galleries dotted around town; the world's finest stretch of sand at Cable Beach,' 'Fantastic seafood to be feasted at good local restaurants, washed down with local brews; an Asian flavour thanks to Broome's fascinating history; and ruggedly beautiful landscapes and natural attractions on the doorstep.' Kuranda, Queensland: The butterfly farm (left) and Barron Falls (right) are two gems to visit in the tropical rainforest of Atherton Tablelands . Kuranda is only 25km from Cairns and can be reached by a scenic railway . James Clark, the mastermind behind Nomadic Notes, calls himself a 'digital nomad', fueling his love for travelling into several travel businesses, as well as his blog. A location independent entrepreneur originally from Melbourne, James has been living as a digital nomad since 2003. The 'perpetual traveller' said that while a lot of visitors to Northern Queensland are drawn to explore the Great Barrier Reef, he would recommend making a side trip to Kuranda. 'While it is only 25km from Cairns it feels like another world away,' he said. 'Kuranda in the tropical rainforest of the Atherton Tableland and it feels cooler and less humid than sea-level Cairns.' 'The most memorable way to arrive is by the Kuranda Scenic Railway.' The Aussie Nomad, aka Chris Richardson, recommends the Grampians, in Victoria. The Grampians in Victoria: 'With varying degrees of hiking trails and waterfalls to see it can be a great escape for a family to get away, see a kangaroo or emu and just enjoy the views,' said Chris Richardson (Mckenzie Falls pictured) Mckenzie Falls look as idyllic as a postcard and is certainly well worth swimming under . Robe, South Australia: Stunning turquoise water, beaches for miles and a really relaxed vibe to the town. What more can you ask for when looking at a summer getaway?' Chris asks . On Chris's expansive list is Robe - a spot where he and his loves ones have holidayed 'for as long as I can remember' The ex-pat has been exploring the world since 2010, but said he thinks the enormous national park is a must for those looking to explore 'what mother nature gave us'. 'With varying degrees of hiking trails and waterfalls to see it can be a great escape for a family to get away, see a kangaroo or emu and just enjoy the views,' said Chris. 'I can highly recommend McKenzie Falls if you are looking for a swim under a waterfall. There's even a small shop at the top to grab a drink or ice cream on a hot day.' Chris said he started off a budget traveller, but said he views travel as the 'ultimate investment,' something that he encourages people to 'invest in often and in large amounts'. On Chris's expansive list is Robe, in South Australia, a spot where he and his loves ones have holidayed 'for as long as I can remember.' 'It was only after I visited for myself did I understand the appeal of it. Stunning turquoise water, beaches for miles and a really relaxed vibe to the town. What more can you ask for when looking at a summer getaway?' The Pinnacles, Western Australia: 'A strange sight are these limestone formations just poking out of the sand,' Chris says . Visiting The Pinnacles is best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the sun's golden hours emphasise the colour and shape of the mystical formations . Sunshine Coast Hinterland, Queensland: Bangalow Palms is one of the many amazing places to explore . The Aussie Nomad said that the Sunshine Coast has more to offer than just well-known Noosa, including bush walking the Kondalilla National Park and wandering through the hinterland . Robe is a distinctively historical town, with a tiny population of just over 1000, in stark contrast to his next recommendation- Queensland's Sunshine Coast. 'When talking of the Sunshine Coast many immediately think Noosa and well you can't fault them for that, it's a beautiful place to relax,' said Chris. 'The greater Sunshine Coast area however has a lot to offer. Be it a romantic getaway near the Glass Mountains, bush walking through the Kondalilla National Park and hinterland of the Sunshine Coast or just taking in a market or two like the Eumundi Markets,' he said. 'It's a great area to take the car on a road trip and explore.' Exploring seems to be the key to the Aussie Nomad's heart, listing The Pinnacles, about two hours north of Perth, in Western Australia, as his next pick. 'A strange sight are these limestone formations just poking out of the sand,' said Chris. 'Visiting them is best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the sun's golden hours emphasise the colour and shape of these mystical formations.'","The top travel bloggers in the country reveal the ten best spots to visit in 2015 .

"Are the days of the traditional builder’s brew numbered? Our enthusiasm for herbal and fruit teas means that Twinings is challenging PG Tips for the title of Britain’s most popular tea brand. The company has already overtaken Tetley to bag second place, after its sales grew by 5 per cent to £107m in a year — compared to £149m worth of PG Tips. No more builders: As the sales of black tea declines, Twinings is challenging PG Tips as Britain's most popular tea brand . Twinings has an Everyday range of traditional tea bags, but most of its growth has been driven by its herbal infusions and speciality blends, including green tea flavours such as popcorn, apple and elderflower and mango tango. Te Grocer magazine said: ‘It’s a world apart from a cup of builder’s. The market average price of tea is about 2p a bag — this stuff sells for upwards of 29p.’ But people haven’t gone too potty on posh tea. Yorkshire Tea and Typhoo were fourth and fifth. This follows a report from September last year, which showed that whilee sales of ordinary black tea bags have dropped by nearly five per cent in the past year, demand for green tea has rocketed by eight per cent. Twinings has already overtaken Tetley to bag second place, after its sales grew by 5 per cent to £107m in a year — compared to £149m worth of PG Tips . Fans of the fruit and herbal infusions are opting for upmarket brands such as Twinings, Teapigs and Clipper and the biggest buyers are younger consumers who see them as beneficial for health and wellbeing. Over the past two years more traditional tea brands such as PG Tips, Tetley and Taylors have now introduced fruit, green, herbal and decaffeinated teas to their range to cater for the nation's evolving taste in tea . PG Tips said health concerns and the average age of tea drinkers is driving a decline in sales of traditional builders' tea. Kate Tilbury, head of beverages at PG Tips' owner Unilever adds that customers are opting for news flavours to make their drinking experience more interesting. 'The health issue is the most overriding trend. We need to drink a certain amount every day and there's a finite amount people will drink, so people switch beverages.'","Twinings may overtake PG Tips as Britain's most popular tea brand .

"Shocking: Retired teacher Margaret Jones, 82, was found by her daughter in hospital covered in food . A retired teacher was found dehydrated and groping for food in hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind, her horrified daughter has said. Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, has apologised for 'fundamental failings' in its care of 82-year-old Margaret Jones after she was admitted following a fall in June. Staff were told the pensioner's eyes could only pick out light and dark after suffering almost total blindness triggered by arteriosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries which restricts blood flow. But when her daughter Rosalind Waite-Jones re-visited her on June 27 - just ten days after she was admitted - she discovered her mother dishevelled, dehydrated and covered in food. It was the result of Mrs Jones desperately groping for items she could not see. 'They have a red tray policy,' said Mrs Waite-Jones, 46. 'A red tray for those visually impaired. That was never implemented. 'We were horrified to see food and pots of medication left out of mum's reach. 'How medical professionals can fail to realise someone is virtually sightless simply beggars belief.' On the same visit, said Mrs Waite-Jones, the whiteboard behind her mother's bed which should have shown details of her nurse was blank. She has now raised the case with Sutton Coldfield MP Andrew Mitchell, who has also received a letter directly from the pensioners' nine-year-old granddaughter Florence. 'Grandma will never be the same and she used to do lovely things, like make jelly with us,' Florence told the MP. 'Some of the nurses have been very good but some of them were not. 'They forgot my grandma was blind, which wasn't very good, and made me and my sister Hope not very happy at all. Desperation: The pensioner, who can only see shades of light and dark, with her head in her hands . 'Worst of all, Hope and I haven't seen our grandma since July and that was just through a hospital window.' Mr Mitchell has now pledged to investigate the case. Despite the horror discovery just ten days into her stay on the orthopaedic Ward 14, widow Mrs Jones spent another 62 days in hospital because she suffered an infection - which her daughter believes was septic shock. She survived the life-threatening infection but it had a permanent effect on her brain function, and she can no longer recognise her family. The 82-year-old entered the hospital 'coherent and alert' but is now confined to a nursing home for life. Previously she had lived independently in an adapted home with talking clocks, coloured hobs and visits from helpers three times a day. Mrs Waite-Jones, who regularly makes the 350-mile round trip to see her mother from her home in Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'Her cognition has gone and that is the most distressing thing. Complaint: The hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, made a full apology after the family's complaint . 'She doesn't recognise me now. Mum taught for a time in Liverpool and spends a lot of time believing she is still there. 'This is a woman who went on holiday with us in May. Yes, she was reliant on a Zimmer frame, but she had all her faculties. 'I firmly believe my mother is alive not because of the efforts of Ward 14, but because of family and friends who gave her food and fluids. Holiday: Margaret Jones with her daughter Rosalind and granddaughters Florence and Hope . 'She pulled through despite the care of Good Hope.' The pensioner's daughter has a string of other complaints against the hospital, including that over-stretched staff described a shift as 'bonkers, manic and very stressful' on Facebook. She was also initially told her mother's infection was a sickness and diarrhoea bug, she added. Within days, Mrs Jones had deteriorated to the extent where she was classified as 'critically ill'. Discharge papers wrongly referred to the pensioner as a stroke victim, and another letter received during the complaints process even described her as dead. All this was despite Mrs Jones, who taught in schools in the Birmingham area for 40 years, having a good experience during a previous stay. 'It has been a farce, an absolute farce,' said her daughter. 'Florence Nightingale famously said ""the very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm"". My mother is in a far, far worse state than when she went into Good Hope.' Hospital staff have apologised for the care they gave to Mrs Jones. Unplanned Care general manager Karen Hope told her family in a letter: 'I would absolutely concur all the concerns you have raised are absolutely valid and the response you received initially was not acceptable in terms of actions and accountability. 'There are fundamental failings that, as a Trust, are being addressed and are ongoing.' As a result of the case Good Hope will introduce a 'visually impaired' policy, the letter pledged. Richard Parker, the hospital's managing director, added: 'We are very sorry to learn of the concerns raised by Mrs Jones' family. 'We have offered a full apology because this is not the standard of care we expect for our patients. Holiday: Mrs Jones with her granddaughters. Her last holiday was just a month before she was admitted . 'We are sorry that Mrs Jones did not receive the highest standards of care in June when she was treated at Good Hope Hospital. 'We are keen to meet with family members to ensure that all of their issues are addressed and that we personally apologise for the poor care that Mrs Jones received. 'We have also taken steps to address the points raised so that we can improve the standards of care for all our patients.' It comes less than a month after Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, was named as one of the worst in the country for patient complaints. Latest figures show that 5,518 patients waited more than the four-hour target at Heartlands, Good Hope and Solihull hospitals, which are all run by the Trust, compared to 1,619 in 2009-10 – an increase of 240 per cent.","Margaret Jones, 82, was admitted to hospital following a fall in June .

"Nearly 17 years after the show ended, the neurotic New Yorkers of classic sitcom Seinfeld are being used as a teaching tool for med students at a New Jersey hospital. The tool, 'Psy-feld,' is helping students both identify and discuss psychiatric disorders with episodes of the show as a reference point. Third- and fourth-year medical students must watch the 6 p.m. rerun of Seinfeld on TBS ever Monday and Thursday, then talk about what they saw over the next day's rounds. The training was created by Anthony Tobia, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, in 2009 for what he calls 'Psy-feld' One of third-year student Marlene Wang's observation's overheard by a NJ.com reporter: And he just couldn’t live with the idea of this person not liking him.' The training was created by Anthony Tobia, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, in 2009 for what he calls 'Psy-feld.' 'You have a very diverse group of personality traits that are maladaptive on the individual level,' he said. 'When you get these friends together the dynamic is such that it literally creates a plot: Jerry’s obsessive compulsive traits combined with Kramer’s schizoid traits, with Elaine’s inability to forge meaningful relationships and with George being egocentric.' He says he got the idea after talking with students about the last episodes of their favorite shows, and one mentioned using 'Lost's' characters as teaching tools. Third- and fourth-year medical students must watch the 6 p.m. rerun of Seinfeld on TBS ever Monday and Thursday, then talk about what they saw over the next day's rounds . 'You cannot possibly pitch this idea to administration at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School without getting buy in from your chairman, and that’s not easy,' he said. 'Which is why most courses will start with what is traditional and allow course directors and teachers to reference film.' He's gone so far as to create a database for every episode of the show. Five of Elaine's boyfriends show how men display core character traits matching delusional disorder - or at least that's what Tobia wrote in a paper on the show. Then there are character's like Newman, who are simply 'very sick.' Tobia is accustomed to using television and films to make his point, screening the movie 'Fargo' for students to live-tweet thoughts on the character's disorders . 'Newman’s sense of self, his meaning in life, is to ensure that he frustrates Jerry,' Tobia told NJ.com. 'We actually have talked about Newman in that context and related him to Erik in 'The Phantom of the Opera.' The Phantom, while he starts out as being the tutor to the Prima Donna, actually has his life change and he is bent on revenge and that becomes who he is… and that’s Newman.' While some students said they had difficulty seeing beyond the comedy of the show, they said that after they were used to the idea they found more helpful than just textbooks in identifying pathology. Tobia is accustomed to using television and films to make his point, screening the movie 'Fargo' for students to live-tweet thoughts on the character's disorders. 'In order for a surgeon to teach from a movie or TV show, there has to be surgery,' he said. 'In order for an internist to teach from a movie or TV show, there has to be the portrayal of an illness. Well, every movie, every TV show has human behavior, so a psychiatrist should be able to teach.'","The tool, 'Psy-feld,' is helping students both identify and discuss psychiatric disorders with episodes of the show as a reference point .

"A four-year-old boy is in a critical condition after nearly drowning in a cruise ship wave pool. The youngster was 'swept under' while swimming in the Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas off the coast of Florida and is believed to have been submerged for between five and 10 minutes. He was initially treated by the ship's on-board medical staff before the boat altered course and transported him to the Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Launderdale in Florida.

"A teen who was seriously injured in a January 2014 school shooting in New Mexico has spoken out about the terrifying ordeal that has left her body riddled with 150 lead pellets. Despite the horrific pain she endured and her continued health concerns in the wake of the shooting, Kendal Sanders, now 14, tells People that she's managed to forgive her shooter Mason Campbell, 13. Sanders also described the paralyzing  moment she realized she and her 11-year-old schoolmate Nathaniel Tavare had been shot. Reliving the terror: Sanders has described the paralyzing moment she realized she and her 11-year-old schoolmate Nathaniel Tavare had been shot at their middle school . Not the intended victims: Kendal and her schoolmate were shot full of lead pellets when Mason Campbell, then 12, brought a shotgun to school to kill his bully . 'I looked at Mason, and he caught my eye. I guess because of all the adrenaline running through me, I didn't feel the pain of getting shot,' she told People. The pain soon came, however. And Kendal, at just 13, had a brush with death followed by surgeries and the ongoing risks of lead slowly leeching into her body. Through all that, Kendal has managed to forgive Campbell. 'I know it wasn't to hurt me, and I understand where he's coming from,' she said, referring to Campbell's journal entries found after the shooting that detailed the bullied child's reasoning when he decided to show up to school with a shotgun. Under New Mexico law, the state can charge minors as adults only if they are at least 14. Campbell received the maximum allowable punishment for his crime, which will see him in juvenile custody until he's 21. 'He did something that's going to continuously, for the rest of my life, challenge me,' Sanders told People. 'And after he gets out, he's done. But I'm never going to be completely normal, like everyone else.' Tavarez also bears scars both physical and emotional. Forever changed: 'He did something that's going to continuously, for the rest of my life, challenge me,' Sanders told People. 'And after he gets out, he's done. But I'm never going to be completely normal, like everyone else' Permanently injured: Tavarez also bears scars both physical and emotional.He spent weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers for treatment of wounds to his chest, heart, face and head. His vision in both eyes has been severely diminished. He spent weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers for treatment of wounds to his chest, heart, face and head. His vision in both eyes has been severely diminished. Both he and Sanders testified at Campbell's trial and urged that he receive the maximum sentence. Sanders revealed during the trial that she has more than 150 lead pellets in her body and might never be able to have children. The pellets cause lead poisoning and make her ill and tired. 'I have to see those scars every single day for the rest of my life,' she wrote. '(He) will be able to live the rest of his life the way he wants, even have a family.' In May, the boy pleaded no contest to three counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and one count of carrying a firearm on school premises. His lawyers had asked that he be placed in treatment for two years and then be released if doctors determined he was no longer a danger.

"Baljit Singh was found dead in a basement of a house after he went missing on December 23 . A homeless man has been charged with the murder of a father who went missing after going out to buy his son a birthday cake. Baljit Singh, 50, was found dead in a basement of a house in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, on New Year's Day - more than a week after he failed to show up to collect the treat. West Midlands police said 32-year-old Stuart Millership, of no fixed address, was charged with the murder, after he was arrested in New Year's Eve at an address in Kingswinford, near Dudley. A 27-year-old woman was also arrested at the same address in connection with the disappearance and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. A postmortem examination revealed Mr Singh died of head injuries and a knife wound to the neck. He was reported missing after he left his home on the afternoon of December 23 and was thought to have gone for a drink at a nearby pub, the Red Cow. Detectives believe he left the pub in his grey 58-plate Range Rover but made an appeal to the public for information after he failed to return home. Millership and the 27-year-old woman were initially arrested on suspicion of stealing Mr Singh's car. Two other people arrested on suspicion of theft - a 28-year-old man and 23-year-old woman from Kingswinford - have been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

"Labour will hit families with billions more in taxes and borrowing if it wins the election, George Osborne will warn today. The Chancellor will today publish a ‘dossier’ on Labour’s spending commitments for 2015/6. Sources say it will show Labour will run up a black hole of ‘many billions of pounds’ within months of taking office. And David Cameron yesterday said the recovery was ‘at risk from politicians who learned nothing from the last five years and who would borrow, spend and tax all over again, taking us right back to square one’. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne launching the Conservatives first poster of the election campaign last week. Today he will warn if Labour win the election, families face millions more in taxes . Today Mr Miliband will hit back at the launch of Labour’s election campaign in Manchester. ‘The Tories damaged the NHS in five years,’ he will say. ‘Give them five more and the NHS as we know it won’t be there.’ But former Labour welfare minister Frank Field yesterday said his leader was ‘scared to tell the truth’ about the NHS. Mr Field, who is campaigning for a one per cent rise in National Insurance to head off a looming financial crisis in the NHS, went on to say that Mr Miliband was in denial about the scale of the challenge, and that neither Labour nor the Tories had produced a credible plan to avert ‘catastrophe’. Labour activists have also been ordered to knock on four million doors during the campaign – twice as many as in 2010. And Mr Miliband will pledge to hold weekly ‘People’s Question Times’ in offices and factories across Britain. Today Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to pledge that he will hold weekly 'People's Question Times every week in the lead up to the election . Speaking just 48 hours after Labour launched a controversial poster attacking Tory spending plans, Mr Miliband will say: ‘We will win this election, not by buying up thousands of poster sites, but by having millions of conversations.’ In a clear sign that the election campaign is underway, Mr Osborne will hold an extraordinary joint press conference with Theresa May, William Hague, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to attack Labour’s spending plans on the day of Mr Miliband’s election launch. A Tory source said the study of Labour’s plans, which has taken months to compile, has revealed a huge black hole. The source said: ‘When we took office four and a half years ago, we were left a note by the Labour Party saying simply: “There’s no money left”. ‘The evidence we will produce shows that Labour have not demonstrated the fiscal discipline or economic competence that earns an opposition the credibility to form a government. 'The chaos of unfunded spending promises, higher taxes and more borrowing offered by Labour is a risk to economic recovery.’ Nick Clegg will also attempt to get his voice heard, by telling voters that a vote for the Liberal Democrats provides the greatest prospect of another coalition government. The Lib Dem leader will describe Labour as a ‘clear and present danger’ to the economy. But he will also attack the Tories for taking an ‘ideological’ approach to spending cuts.","Chancellor says Labour government would run up black hole of billions .

"Thousands of people were forced to go through security queues at Stansted Airport twice after an apparent 'mix up' which confused arriving passengers with those waiting to board flights. Staff insisted on evacuating the entire international departures lounge when a 'small number' of passengers who had just landed on a Ryanair flight from Lisbon on Sunday mistakenly entered it through the wrong door. Huge queues formed throughout the airport, with crowds bemoaning having to wait up to two hours in security queues to be let back through to their gates. Thousands were delayed and forced to queue for security again after a 'mix-up' at Stansted Airport . The departure's lounge was left empty for around 90 minutes, thwarting scores of flights due to take off. Staff said the confusion came about when passengers on the Lisbon flight walked through the wrong door, leading them to the departures lounge rather than the arrivals gate. 'The crew of this flight correctly directed disembarking customers to the assigned gate, however they entered the airport through a door which had been left open in error,' a spokesman for the airline said on Monday. 'Ryanair fully cooperated with Stansted Airport as it rescreened departing passengers. A number of flights were delayed throughout the day due to earlier issues with deicing facilities. The incident will be the subject of an investigation, he added. Disgruntled passengers took to Twitter to complain about the delays which offset scores of journeys . Disgruntled passengers took to social media to share their fury, with some complaining of queues of two hours. 'Ongoing security ""issue"" at Stansted Airport. Massive queues as no one can get through security. Communication over PA has not been great,' said Duncan McKay. James Carter added: 'Massive security queues at Stansted, again.

Duval said he had no money while going through a divorce, but he also didn't want to take the second best option — going to jail for a few days in exchange for having his debt cleared. All he had was a pair of $85 Nike sneakers he got for Christmas. Judge Stoddart didn't hesitate. 'OK, we'll take them,' he told Duval, according to the Daily News. Duval can get his shoes back if he pays the court $100 in four weekly installments beginning on Jan. 13. Stoddart said he'd also give the sneakers back if Duval completes 10 hours of community service, according to the newspaper. Duval's $85 sneakers (not pictured) were a Christmas gift.

Anger: An official in Kim Jong un's government slammed the US's 'groundless' sanctions against North Korea . It warned that the new sanctions - leveled against government officials and the nation's defense industry - would not weaken the country's military might. The state-run TV station quoted an official as saying: 'The policy persistently pursued by the US to stifle the DPRK [North Korea], groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards it, would only harden its will and resolution to defend the sovereignty of the country. 'The persistent and unilateral action taken by the White House to slap 'sanctions' against the DPRK patently proves that it is still not away from inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the DPRK.'

"Bryan Ferry’s youngest son was last night fighting for his life after a horrific head-on car crash just days before Christmas. It took more than 45 minutes for firemen to extract Merlin, 24, from the wreckage of his car after the three-vehicle horror smash in a country lane on Monday evening. His 69-year-old father was believed to be at his hospital bedside with the rest of his family yesterday as Merlin remained in a ‘critical’ condition. The former Marlborough College pupil suffered multiple fractures and a head injury in the crash in Shropshire, which left his silver Volvo saloon unidentifiable. Family affair: Merlin (circled) with brothers Isaac, Otis and Tara as their father Bryan received the CBE in 2011 . One of the other vehicles in the tangled wreck had erupted in flames while Merlin was still trapped in his car, but a passer-by was able to quickly put out the dangerous blaze. Merlin was taken by ambulance to the major trauma centre at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The guitarist, who has performed with his singer father, was said to have regained consciousness yesterday morning but was in a daze believing he had missed Christmas. He was later sent to theatre for a life-saving operation and is currently being treated at the hospital’s critical care unit. Merlin, who narrowly escaped jail in 2013 after he was found carrying a knife for a second time, is one of four sons the Roxy Music star has with his ex-wife, former model Lucy Helmore. Yesterday, Merlin’s eldest brother, Eton-educated Otis, informed his followers of the crash and updated them on his sibling’s condition via his public Instagram page. After uploading a picture of the crash scene, he said: ‘He had a head-on collision, has lots of broken bones and is having an operation on his heart as we speak. The crash, which took place on the A458 near Cressage, Shropshire, left Merlin's silver Volvo saloon (left) looking like 'a mangled box of tin'. The wreckage also involved a red Mercedes (right) ‘He was conscious before he went into theatre and his biggest concern was that he had missed Christmas! He is in the best possible hospital for this type of procedure.’ Otis, who is master of the South Shropshire Hunt and has in the past been arrested for his pro-hunting activism, also thanked firefighters for freeing his brother from the wreck. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Thank you for extracting my brother alive from what looks like a mangled box of tin. We are all continuing to pray.’ Merlin had been travelling along the A458 about half a mile north-west of the village of Cressage, in Shropshire, at the time of the collision. Bryan, 69 (left), is said to be at the hospital bedside as his son (right) remains in a 'critical' condition . His car and a red Mercedes, which was travelling in the opposite direction, had collided head-on at around 6.40pm. The 49-year-old Mercedes driver from Kidderminster escaped with minor injuries. A third vehicle, a Scania lorry, which was travelling in the same direction as the Mercedes was also involved but little damage was caused to it. The driver was uninjured. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘On arrival, crews found two cars that had suffered massive damage after a collision. The trapped man was in the first car. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis, left arm and had a head injury. ‘Working with firefighters, ambulance staff very carefully freed him. He was assessed at the scene and had splints put in place along with advanced pain relief before being taken to the major trauma centre.’ Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘Crews worked hard for 45 minutes to free the man which was a difficult extrication due to the impact involved.’ Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses. No arrests have been made. Ferry’s 21-year marriage to Merlin’s mother ended in divorce in 2003. His second marriage to PR executive Amanda Sheppard, who is 38 years his junior, also ended in divorce earlier this year. The couple had separated in August last year after being married for two years.","Former Marlborough College pupil injured in head-on-crash in Shropshire .

"CCTV footage capture Sammy Almahri on film on the night of Miss Aburas's suspected murder. It is believed he has not fled to Tanzania . An international manhunt is underway for a ‘dangerous and resourceful’ man after his online girlfriend was found dead in a hotel room on New Year's Eve. The body of Nadine Aburas, 28, was discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff hours after New-York based suspect Sammy Almahri, 44, fled from Heathrow Airport. The 44-year-old American flew out of the UK in the middle of the night – and is now the subject of a manhunt on four continents, suspected of her murder. Police in the UK, United States, Bahrain and East Africa are all involved in the hunt for Almahri. Today, police released a new picture showing Almahri, when he was captured on CCTV on the night of the murder. Yesterday, South Wales Police were checking Miss Aburas's computer for any clues over their online romance, including Facebook chats and emails between his home in New York City and her apartment in Cardiff Bay, South Wales. Miss Aburas had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but it is believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain. It is thought he flew into the UK on Boxing Day and booked a £135-a-night room at the Future Inn hotel for December 30 and New Year's Eve. He checked into the hotel with Miss Aburas, which is less than a mile away from her flat at 8.25pm on December 30. The pair went out for an hour before returning at about 11pm. But police say Almahri left at 3am on New Year’s Eve and hours later at around noon, the injured body of Miss Aburas was found by hotel staff. Detectives then discovered Almahri had quickly booked a flight and flew from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am on New Year’s Eve. He then went to Doha in Qatar before moving on to Tanzania. Detective Superintent Paul Hurley from South Wales Police said: 'It was clear to us that Nadine was murdered but we waiting for the results of a post mortem examination before we give more details. 'But we are aware that Almahri is resourceful and dangerous. He has the resources to support himself and people may be sheltering him. 'We are working with law enforcement agencies in all the countries involved to try to trace him. 'We are aware that their relationship went back some three years and that Nadine had been to New York to meet him. Scroll down for video . An international manhunt has been launched for Almahr, who police have described as 'resourceful and dangerous' Nadine Aburas was found dead in a guest room at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff on New Year's Eve . 'He had pre-booked the room at the hotel but only booked the flights out of the country on the day he left. 'We are appealing for information from hotel guests or visitors to the hotel may have seen them together. 'We have been working closely with our counterparts in both NYPD and police officers in Tanzania. 'From our inquiries we have discovered that Almahri is very resourceful and has access to funds, which may further assist his evasion from law enforcement agencies. 'It is difficult to establish what he does for a living but he has access to financial resources. I consider this man to be a dangerous individual. He is not to be approached.' South Wales Police say they do not know why he went to Tanzania, adding it may be a case of him getting on the first available flight to escape capture. Miss Aburas's mother Andrea, 58, and her family are being supported by police as they worked with the National Crime Agency to co-ordinate the international hunt. Her mother, who also lives less than a mile from the hotel, said: 'Nadine was a lovely, bubbly girl and unique and talented woman. She always wanted to help people and everybody loved her. The body of Miss Aburas was discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel (pictured) in Cardiff on New Year's Eve . 'She has left such a massive hole in our family and we will miss her so much. The family respectfully request that they be left to grieve privately.' Almahri is believed to have 'distinctive injuries to his face' which are not linked to the killing but police did not speculate how they were caused. Police are checking his credit and debit card spending in a bid to trace his movements across the continents and are working with the National Crime Agency. An inquest is due to be opened by Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley later this week where the results of the post mortem examination are due to be released. Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Body of Nadine Aburas discovered by staff at the Future Inn hotel in Cardiff .

"It was anything but a welcome return to work for thousands of Sydneysiders on Monday, with road closures in the city centre delaying the trip in for up to three hours in some cases. The working year was off a slow start for many unsuspecting employees, who were unaware that roadworks were continuing in the Sydney CBD, leading to serious delays for city-bound buses travelling over the Harbour Bridge. Some reported 90 minute delays, others taking to social media to suggest their travel time blew out to three hours. Scroll down for video . On a bridge to nowhere! Traffic on Sydney's iconic bridge came to a standstill on Monday as work crews continued construction on a light rail project, closing off George Street in the heart of the city to all traffic .

"The trial of marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can begin as scheduled on Monday in Boston after a federal appeals court ruled that the defense had not met the 'extraordinary' standard required to justify its intervention. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals announced its decision on Saturday. Tsarnaev's lawyer had asked the court to delay the trial and move it out of Massachusetts, saying he couldn't get a fair trial in a place where so many were affected by the bombings. The appeals court ruled 2-1 to avoid intervening in the trial's timing and location. Trial begins Monday: The trial of marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can begin a on Monday in Boston after a federal appeals court ruled that the defense could not prove why it should be moved or delayed . 'The judges in the majority are satisfied that full consideration has been given to the issues raised by the petition, and it is clear that the petition falls short of meeting the requirements for issuing the extraordinary writ of mandamus,' two judges said in the majority opinion. One judge dissented, saying he didn't have enough time to carefully consider the petition filed Wednesday. One of Tsarnaev's attorneys, Miriam Conrad, declined to comment Saturday. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges connected to the April 2013 explosions that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. Some of the charges carry the death penalty. On Friday, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who is presiding over Tsarnaev's case, said jury selection should start as scheduled because it would be too inconvenient to delay it. He had denied a defense request Dec. 29 for a delay. O'Toole said Friday that delaying the start 'would cause some unknown degree of disruption' to the more than 1,200 people called as potential jurors and to the court. He had granted a two-month trial delay last fall and also rejected a previous request to move it.

The passengers spent two nights at the airport, however some families were believed to have been so desperate to leave, they paid up to £5,000 to get home. One of those stranded at the airport was Sean Read, the keyboard player for the Manic Street Preachers, the Rockingbirds and Chrissie Hynde. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Read said: 'After waiting all day looks like we've been abandoned for the night by British Airways again. 'Among the left behind; a wheelchair bound woman, a cancer patient and several small children. 'Some families have given up and paid up to £5,000 just to get home. We haven't slept for 36 hours now. We were offered a hotel earlier today but horror stories of not being let back into airport without tickets put us off. 'We would take a hotel tonight rather than sleep rough again but no British Airways staff around to apply to now.' He tweeted that there had been a 'massive shouting match' between BA and Air India staff over who was to blame for the hiccup. Another passenger tweeted that none of the staff had been seen since. Mr Read then posted a photo of members of his group curled up on the airport floor among their luggage, before writing 'no hotel no food no flight'. Simon Fisher posted updates on Twitter appealing to BA over a period of several hours . The musician added that Turkish Airlines had offered the passengers seven spaces on one of its flights - but that BA staff had not been around to approve it. Other passengers also took to Twitter to air their frustrations and appeal to British Airways, but many of their tweets appeared to go without a response from the airline. Simon Fisher posted a picture of people sleeping on the floor, writing: 'Our kids asleep on the FLOOR at Mumbai airport. #britishairways @british_airways sort this out now'. He continued with updates over several hours and at one point accused the airline of ignoring the stranded passengers. Sandi Dunn, from Hackney, London, whose daughter Lisa is stranded at the airport, told MailOnline: 'BA staff were literally shouting at Air India staff over what had happened. 'Now everyone has left them there after telling them they might be stuck there for eight days because all the flights are overbooked. He added that Turkish Airlines had offered seven seats to the stranded passengers but that no one from BA was there to accept them . One passenger said they were 'desperate for help and sanity' after BA staff went home and left them stranded . Another said they were 'starving cold and have been sleeping on floors' 'They had been on a two-week holiday and just missed the connection, through no fault of their own. BA wouldn't hold the flight and now can't get them home. I just cannot get over that BA would leave them there like that - it is a first world airline.' Ms Dunn says her daughter, a director-producer for the BBC, is due to be at work today but has no way of knowing when she will be home. She added that several of the group - made up of six adults and six children - could not contact their insurance companies until today, due to the time difference. BA issued a statement saying: 'Our staff in Mumbai worked hard to assist customers who missed their connection from Mumbai to London. Samuel Hagger helped a friend book an alternative flight after she became stranded in Mumbai . A friend of stranded passengers also messaged comedian David Walliams in an attempt to drum up support . 'Our flights from Mumbai are incredibly busy at this time of year, and in order to get customers on their way as quickly as possible we booked those affected onto flights operated by both British Airways and other airlines.' The airline was unable to confirm how many passengers had been booked onto alternative flights, saying the situation was ever-changing. Adding to the difficulty was the fact that customers had booked the flights using differing methods, and so BA and Air India had to work together to come to a resolution. They did however later tell MailOnline Travel that the last remaining passengers are now travelling back to the UK having worked with other airlines to ensure safe arrival back to Heathrow. A BA spokesperson added: 'When things go wrong it is our duty to ensure our passengers are looked after as best as possible despite this being a particularly difficult time. 'It's not nice for our passengers but I am pleased to say that they have left India now, if not already arrived at home.'","38 holidaymakers due to catch flight from Mumbai to London Heathrow .

"A customer who rented a car for a one-day trip in Virginia wound up with a $3,374 bill thanks to a blown tire, while another was hit with a $780 charge for a broken bumper he had no idea about. A third was charged an extra five days in rental fees after bringing her car back after-hours - because they say it took them that long to find the vehicle. The fat fees are cautionary tales against straying from the fine print in rental agreements, which can lead to huge fines for what seem like minor offenses. Rough ride: Roy Bonney's ride from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C. almost cost him $3,374 . Roy Bonney, the driver whose flat tire struck at the worst possible time, had banked on paying Budget just $96 for his trip from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., where he was due to catch a plane. But, according to dailyfinance.com, Bonney found himself with a flat - and no spare - while he parked in Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling within D.C. He tried to summon the company's assistance vehicle and drive off in another car - but the company said the rescue would take so long he'd miss his flight home to Alaska. So instead he called Budget and asked to leave the car where it was for them to pick up, while he headed off himself. Claims: Bonney thought Budget had taken back responsibility for a car after he left it in a military base after a tire blew - but they couldn't reach it for weeks, and charged him . Don't be late: Another driver from Manchester, Maryland (pictured) was charged $785 for a broken bumper that wasn't there when he dropped off his car . But when the tow truck arrived, after Bonney had set off, it wasn't allowed on base and was kept away for weeks - resulting in the huge fee for him. In another case, a 33-year-old man from Manchester, Maryland, took an Alamo car back after business hours, assuming he would be charged the regular fee - or for a late return at worst. But instead he was contacted by the company saying the car had been 'rear-ended' while technically in his possession - and sent photos of the vehicle with a mangled bumper. He was hit with a $785 charge to cover the repairs, because the vehicle was his responsibility until it had been officially given back. A further, unnamed woman was hit with five extra days of fees on her rental after returning a car at 3am. The rental company said they took five days to locate the car, all of which she had to pay for. A rental industry spokesman said it was the consumer's responsibility to protect themselves from accidents - and make sure their agreements are honored. The representative, for the American Car Rental Association, said: 'The rule of thumb is that the unit you rented is still on rent and is your responsibility until the office opens and the car is inspected. If damage is found at that time, the renter is charged.' Although after vigorous complaints, Bonney and the Maryland resident had their jumbo charges waived, experts warn that unless renters stick to the small print religiously, they could be next.","Roy Bonney drove from Virginia to D.C. - but ended up being bill $3,374 .

"Nigel Farage has given up drinking alcohol for January, he admitted today. The Ukip leader, who has built his reputation on being seen with a pint glass in his hand, wearily conceded that after a festive season of boozing: 'I need a break.' He plans to spend the rest of the month supping orange juice, but refused to give up his treasured cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage has revealed he has given up drinking alcohol for January, shedding his image for posing with a pint glass . Almost everywhere he went in 2014, Mr Farage was seen with a pint, including in Belfast (left) and London . Mr Farage has previously argued that the works so hard as an MEP in Brussels that he is 'entitled' to a lunchtime pint. But now he has confessed that his body needs a respite from downing pints of ale. 'I started before the new year,' he told Sky News. 'I am not being particularly virtuous about this. I just… I need a break. It does us all good to have a break every now and again.' Asked if it was a total break from alcohol, he replied: 'Oh yes, absolutely.' During a visit to Yarm in April he even went behind the bar to pull his own pint while campaigning in the European elections, with Ukip went on to win . But pressed on whether he has also given up smoking, he admitted defeat: 'Oh no, I will think about that later in the year. In the last year he was frequently pictured in celebratory mood, raising a glass – or several – to the latest Ukip triumphs. His party won the Euro elections in May, secured two defections from the Tories in the summer and went on to win two seats in the Commons for the first time. The pubs of Clacton and Rochester did well out of visits from Mr Farage on the campaign trail. Last month Mr Farage appeared on a Channel 4 show with Gogglebox favourites Steph and Dom Parker, where the trio quaffed champagne, beer and wine . Last month he appeared on a Channel 4 show with Gogglebox favourites Steph and Dom Parker, where the trio quaffed champagne, beer and wine. Mr Farage had to change his trousers after smashing a glass and spilling his drink and ended up borrowing a pair of Mr Parker's ripped jeans. During a 'rip-roaring' evening, he told the Radio Times he had 'two pints, about five or six glasses' of wine and champagne during the encounter. 'I like a drink, but crikey, these guys are professionals,' he said.","Ukip leader reveals he has gone teetotal for the whole of January .

"When I told my daughter that for the first time in her life I would not be going to an office every day, she looked delighted. But what she said next astonished me. ‘Does that mean you can pick me up from school in the afternoons?’ Now, my daughter is not seven, the age when children come out of class anxiously scanning the waiting crowd for Mum or Dad. No, Lydia is 14. Daisy Goodwin is pictured here with her daughter Lydia, 14. Daisy has realised how important it is to Lydia that she's there to collect her from school each day . The last thing I’d expect a teenager to want is her mother standing at the school-gates — but my daughter does, seemingly as much as the reception-age kids who hurtle out of school straight into their parent’s arms. I’ve been turning up to collect her for six weeks, ever since giving up my office-based job in TV to concentrate on writing at home. And when I ask why my presence in the playground means so much to her, I receive another startling — and worrying — reply. ‘When I see you, Mum,’ she says, ‘I know that I’m safe.’ It’s been a startling revelation to realise that my teenage daughter needs me just as much now as she did when she was tiny. Daisy, pictured here with Lydia as a baby, believes all parents should be taking some time out during their child's teenage years . When she was born, I took a year’s leave and spent those precious early months bonding with her. I felt terrible going back to work and leaving her when she was a toddler — I still vividly remember trying to sneak out of the house so she wouldn’t notice, hoping to avoid a heart-wrenching crying fit. But seeing her now, I suddenly understand with a shudder of anxiety just how difficult life is for teens today, and that it’s during these later years — not her earliest — that she really requires her mother’s presence. And I don’t think she is unusual. Indeed, as well as maternity leave, I believe there should be a period of ‘time off’ enshrined in law for the parents of teenagers — we could call it ‘teenternity leave’. 14 per cent of the 340,000 women who go on . maternity leave each year find their jobs at . threat when they try to return. I think all teenage girls and boys would benefit from closer parental guidance during this most delicate of phases. I’ve noticed a number of changes in my daughter in the six weeks since I’ve been at home. She seems happier and calmer. Her homework gets done with less fuss. She eats more tomatoes and fewer crisps. She goes to bed at a reasonable hour. In other words, everything I’ve been striving to encourage her to do over the past few years. Of course, it’s always been tough being a teenager. I remember well the shame of being the only girl in the class still wearing Clarks sandals, for example. But I wouldn’t want to be a 14-year-old girl in 2015 for all the money in the world. Modern teens have it harder than ever. The pressure to fit in is so much greater. At least when I came home from school in the Seventies, I could escape from the mean-girl chorus of disapproval. But today — thanks to social media — there is no escape from the judgment of others. Today’s teenagers don’t come home from school and spend an hour on the sofa watching The Waltons. They are too busy sending images of themselves via the online photo-sharing app Snapchat to 50 of their closest friends. Daisy (right) thinks modern teens, like Lydia (left), have it 'harder than ever' with the constant pressures of social media . Lydia’s phone is never silent; it cheeps, rings and bellows all day and all night long. At her age I was also in touch with my friends while at home — I used to spend hours on the phone dissecting the events of the day. But going through the minutiae of who said what to whom was a good deal less appealing with my brother and father listening in. For my daughter’s generation, there are no such limits. As the person who pays her phone bill, I can see that there have been nights where she’s been texting and ‘chirpsing’ (a kind of digital flirting or chatting up) way into the small hours, which horrifies me. Today’s teens are also not restricted, as we were, to spending time with friends only in the flesh; you can have a virtual party with all your closest pals on Whatsapp — a messaging service — whenever you like. Worse, you can chat online with perfect strangers at any hour of the day or night. Daisy (right) is pictured here with her mother, Jocasta Innes (left) and her oldest daughter Ottilie in 1991. Daisy thinks even Ottilie had it easier as a teenager just ten years ago . The problem is that if you are feeling a little bit vulnerable, there is no escape from the feeling of being scrutinised. Of course, plenty of teenagers are supportive of each other, but there are plenty more who fasten on evidence of vulnerability like piranha fish on a gaping wound. Now that I’m at home, I realise just how much time my daughter has been spending in this parallel digital universe, and how badly it can affect her self-esteem. I also realise how hard it has been for her to come back to an empty house for years with nothing to do before her parents get back from work but bare her soul on social media. I have an older daughter, too — ten years older. In the space of that decade, teenage life has to my mind become far more difficult. She could talk to friends, but there was no shared ‘space’ for them to meet virtually. There was no teen-only media; nowhere to swap no-holds-barred opinions without adult supervision. But now I’ve seen what has been going on in my own home, I feel that parents nowadays need to be as vigilant with their teenagers as they are with toddlers. It’s mental harm you must protect against, not physical danger — but both ages require constant attention, and the careful calibration of house rules, as psychotherapist Philippa Perry points out: ‘There are two periods in a child’s life when it is most crucial for parents to set effective boundaries: when they first become physically active and again in adolescence,’ she says. ‘It’s vital for children to know where the limits are. And it’s equally vital parents learn when to move those boundaries as children gain in competence.’ Policing a digitally savvy teenager is not easy. But after some discussion, my daughter and I have a new common ground. We have agreed on a ‘no screens after 9pm’ rule, since there is some scientific evidence to show that looking at a computer or phone screen before you go to bed can interfere with the quality of your sleep. And after months of complaining that she can’t sleep, Lydia is able to get a good night’s rest in a bedroom that is not humming with digital chatter. Daisy pictured (left) with her mother and sister Tabitha. Daisy says at Lydia's age she was also in touch with her friends while at home spending hours on the phone each day after school . Still, the only way I can enforce this, and fully remove temptation, is to confiscate the phone every night at 9pm — and lock it away until the morning. I also have to unplug the router. Of course, this means that my own social media addictions are also curtailed at 9pm, but we all sleep better as a result. I won’t pretend my daughter is always delighted by my new stance. There is always ‘just one more’ text she has to send. But I can stand a bit of door slamming if it means she gets the chance to switch off. Of course, I wouldn’t have known any of this had I not made a change to my working patterns. And I find that worrying. What if I’d gone on working all hours regardless? Would Lydia have muddled through? Or would the apparent lack of safety she felt without me have caused real damage? Lydia (right) says she feels safe when she sees her mum Daisy (left) standing at the school gates each day . Although teenagers appear to be self-absorbed and self-sufficient, they are just as needy as toddlers. They just aren’t as ready or able to show it. I would warn any parent of an early adolescent not to underestimate the importance of paying attention to your children, even if it appears that they would far rather talk to their screens. We can’t disconnect our children or ourselves from the siren call of the digital world, but it is up to us to make sure they have time when they can relax. I’m horrified now at how close I came to missing this crucial window in my daughter’s life and I say to you — take a look a your child’s phone bills. If they are texting in the small hours, it may be time to spend more time at home. I can assure you, you’ll all sleep better at night.","Daisy realised her daughter needs her as much now as when she was little .

"An elementary school teacher has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder after she ran over a grandmother while driving drunk. Erica Kristine Flynn knocked down and killed Kathleen Searcy, 66, in Chandler, Arizona, at 10.30pm on December 27 while she was three times over the legal alcohol limit.

"BMW says it's taking the extraordinary step of unveiling the entire range of its next generation 6-series in one fell swoop later this month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. That includes the new drop-top BMW 6 Series Convertible as well as the Coupe and Gran Coupe versions. They will be unveiled simultaneously on January 9 in freezing Motown before becoming the centrepieces of the BMW stand. Top speeds are limited electronically to 155mph but the cabriolet will sprint from rest to 62 mph in just 5.5 seconds while the M6 version will knock that down to 4.3 seconds. BMW have taken an extraordinary step by announcing that they will unveil the entire range of next generation 6 series, including the convertible (pictured), at the North American International Auto Show later this month . All three body styles have a choice of highly efficient twinpower turbo six-cylinder and V8 engines linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 3-litre 313 bhp turbodiesel in the 640d models and 3-litre 320 bhp petrol unit in the 640i version are low in emission, as low as 139g/km for the 640d SE Coupe. The 650i models feature 4.4-litre V8 bi-turbo engines. Ultimate performance is from the 560bhp V8-engined M6 variant. All petrol models have a sportstuned exhaust system with a switch to provide a soundtrack to match the car's performance. Suspension systems have been honed and can be personalised. Full LED headlights are standard. There are new 18 in alloy wheels for the Coupe and Convertible, and five new metallic paint finishes . Dakota, Nappa or Merino leather trim will be standard in the UK, depending on model. The 6 Series and its M equivalents are on sale here from March 1, from £50,000 to £100,000. Mini unveils its new souped-up John Cooper Works edition in Detroit, while Audi is taking the wraps off its new-generation Q7 sports utility vehicle. Legendary former Jaguar test driver and works racer Norman Dewis — whose epic through-the-night driving feat from Coventry to Geneva helped launch the original E-Type — has received an OBE in the New Year Honours List. The sprightly 94-year-old spent 33 years at Jaguar and is widely regarded as Britain's greatest test driver. He helped develop 25 of its most famous models, including the Le Mans-winning D-type and influential E-type and also set a land speed record for Jaguar and competed in many races for the marque during the Fifties. Former Jaguar test drives Norman Dewis (pictured) has received an OBE in the New Year Honours List . Dewis is one of the last living links to the post-war golden era of the British motor industry, when Jaguar rebuilt itself into a champion sports car maker. During his career, he completed more than a million test miles at an average speed of 100 mph-plus and survived high-speed crashes in the days before seatbelts, without ever breaking a single bone. He played a vital role in developing the revolutionary Dunlop disc brake and was Sir Stirling Moss's co-driver in a C-type in the 1952 Mille Miglia. In 1953 he set a 172.412 mph production car speed record in a modified Jaguar XK 120 in Belgium. Of all the cars he worked on, he considers the D-type to be the best: 'I got that car up to 192 mph on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans.'

"A six-year-old girl with cerebral palsy is finally able to walk after her father raised £50,000 to pay for treatment in America. Lily Ketteringham, of Benton, North Tyneside, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two and for a while, her future looked bleak. But a chance meeting between her father Steve, 43, and a woman whose child had received similar treatment in the US has changed Lily's life. Lily Ketteringham, of Benton, North Tyneside, can walk for the first time after her father Steve, right, raised £50,000 for treatment in America . Mr Ketteringham, who works in the engineering industry, said: 'We were told that Lily would miss many milestones, that she would have trouble with her speech, and that it was possible she would never walk. 'But I was determined for her to fulfill her potential.' He came across a specially adapted trike on eBay and decided to buy it for Lily. And when he went round to collect it, the owner told him that her child had also got cerebral palsy but had greatly improved since having Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) surgery. Mr Ketteringham researched the pioneering surgery which stimulates muscles in the spine and unscrambles mixed messages sent from the brain to the limbs. He then applied to the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri, which accepted that Lily would benefit from the procedure. However, there was one problem - the treatment would cost £37,000. The six-year-old, of Benton, North Tyneside, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. Pictured, at St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri last January . A chance meeting between her father Steve and a woman whose child had received similar treatment in the US has changed Lily's life . He added: 'Nothing was going to stop be from raising that money for Lily. 'I knew she needed this treatment and that it would give her the best possible chance of walking. 'I ran the Great North Run, did the coast to coast, friends and family got involved and eventually I made it and had the money to pay for the operation and the trip over to America.' In the end, he smashed his target and raised £50,000, with the extra money helping to pay for travel costs and other expenses. Lily and her father spent around a month in America between January and February last year. The treatment appears to have been successful and Lily is now using special canes to walk, and is also able to stand up on her own for the first time. Mr Ketteringham added: 'I am so happy Lily has undergone this procedure. It was the best possible thing we could have done. 'It has been hard for her though, she has had to put in a lot of work to get to where she is now. 'I am hoping she will be able to walk completely on her own in the next year. I think that is a realistic goal. 'I am so proud of Lily. Despite everything she has been through she is a very happy, smiley and sociable little girl.'

"Women looking to cheat on their partners consider a sense of humour as more of a turn-on than oral sex, a survey reveals. Victoria Milan, a dating website for attached people looking to cheat, analysed the dating profiles of 616,080 of its cheating female members from all over the globe and found that the majority are more attracted to someone who makes them laugh than the physical chemistry. While Aussie women prefer a good laugh, intelligence and confidence over foreplay - even if it is only a one-night stand - Brazilian women rank oral sex as as the most essential skill for a man to acquire. Scroll down for video . A sense of humour came out on top as the biggest turn-on in for more than half of the Aussie women surveyed . The study revealed cheating women from 15 of 21 countries, including Australia, find humour as more alluring than having brains or being skilled in the bedroom. Almost half of the Aussie women in the survey saw possessing a wit as an absolute winner (44.37%) with self-confidence (39.61%) and intelligence (38.21%) deemed the next most important. It's no surprise that the down-to-earth characteristic made it into the top 5 with Aussies known for this trait when living in the land Down Under. The playful act of teasing made it in at number five above any sexual acts with the Aussie ladies. Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, a happily married man who started the site in 2010, said that the results show the majority of women look for qualities outside of the physical – even if it's just a casual fling. 'Good looks will fade, and sex drive may diminish – but seeing the light side of life is a quality that never gets old,' Mr Vedal said. 'A great sense of humour is a must for the majority of cheating women – even if it's just for a fun fling,' Although the study shows that most women across the globe prefer a funny man, there's always an exception to the rule with Brazilian women voted for oral sex as being the most important skill among man. German and Polish women rank intelligence over hilarity, while Peruvian and Mexican women want their men playful and experimental. Countries included in the study include Australia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, France, Portugal, New Zealand, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Belgium, Austria, United Kingdom, Italy and Czech Republic.

"Ann Salter: The former BBC presenter, pictured, falsely claimed that she was too ill to work . A former BBC presenter faces a possible jail sentence for falsely claiming more than £65,000 in benefits while insisting she was unable to work. Ann Salter said she was suffering from depression, but was caught after she posted a showreel online as part of a curriculum vitae covering her work on television and radio. The 49-year-old, who described herself as an ‘experienced and glamorous presenter’, recorded her jobs including hosting motorsports coverage on Channel 5 and working as an anchor on Setanta Sports News. The list included guest presenting on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and BBC Radio 5 Live, as well as work on The Travel Channel and Sky Sports. She also boasted about jobs at ‘red carpet soirees’ and Armani fashion shows, and hosting car launches in Cannes. Miss Salter, who said she had a ‘love of the fast-moving, exotic and challenging’, wrote that her career began in regional television news. According to her presenting profile, which described her as an ‘accomplished journalist’, she has ‘undertaken fearless, ground-breaking investigations’. The presenter, who lives in Shepperton, Surrey, with her partner, had told the Department for Work and Pensions and Spelthorne Borough Council that she was unfit for work because of depression. But she posted videos online showcasing some of her television work, as well as clips of her as the voiceover on a number of adverts. Miss Salter pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court to falsely claiming £65,478.95 in benefits since 2005 and will be sentenced later this month. She wrongly received £30,127.91 in housing benefit, £28,126.90 in income support and £7,224.15 in council tax benefit – and will have to pay back all the money. It comes as Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said yesterday that the welfare state has been seen by criminals as a ‘money-making scam’ and warned benefit cheats they will not get away with it. Figures show £1.2billion was lost to fraud last year, a figure which has remained stubbornly high. Ministers argue that the move to Universal Credit – combining several benefits into one, with live updates on personal circumstances – will make it easier to catch benefit cheats. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘We know that the vast majority of people play by the rules. However, benefit fraud is a serious crime and I’m determined to root out the unscrupulous minority who are cheating money out of hardworking taxpayers and diverting it from those who need it most. False claims: The presenter, pictured, was caught after she posted a showreel online as part of a CV covering her work on television and radio. The list included guest presenting on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour . Swindle: Miss Salter pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court, above, to falsely claiming £65,478.95 in benefits and will be sentenced later this month. She will also have to pay back all the money she wrongly received . ‘Some people see the welfare state as a money-making scam, but I have a simple message for them: you will not get away with it. ‘Last year we recouped over a billion pounds, but we want to go further to toughen up the system giving our fraud investigators greater powers. Universal Credit will make it harder to commit benefit fraud in the first place and easier to detect.’ Work and Pensions minister Mark Harper added: ‘Most people claiming benefits are honest and play by the rules, but as with cases like [Miss Salter’s], it’s astonishing that some people shamelessly abuse our welfare system, diverting funds from the people who need it most.’ Richard West, of the DWP fraud and error service, said: ‘Anyone found guilty of fraud will have to pay the stolen money back and under tougher new rules they will have to do so more quickly – that’s on top of any prison sentence or fine … . ‘These cases send a clear message to any criminals cheating the system that we have the means to catch them and bring them to justice.’","Anne Salter, 49, said that she was unfit for work because of depression .

"Pictures have emerged of a mother-of-three who died after she is believed to have jumped from the back of a fast moving four-wheel-drive in rural Queensland just after midnight on New Years Eve. Rinabel Tiglao, 44, has been named as the victim of the mysterious tragedy where police believe she may have thrown herself from the black 2014 Nissan Navara dual cab, which was travelling at 100k/h, at an unsealed section of Fitzroy Development Rd at Middlemount, reports The Courier Mail. She was critically injured and taken to Dysart Hospital then airlifted to Townsville Hospital, where she died.

Investigations into the incident are underway, with the 39-year-old driver of the Nissan assisting police with their inquiries. The car, as well as a residence in Middlemount, is undergoing forensic searches. Detective Acting Superintendent Bruce McNab said police have serious concerns why the woman was led to jump from the vehicle. 'What we need to find out is what would make someone do this. We have grave concerns about the circumstances surrounding this incident,' he told the newspaper. Ms Tiglao's nephew Jerdan Igot Tiglao spoke of his heartache about the tragic death of his auntie who had just visited him last year. He said he usually heard from her everyday except for last month because she was visiting her family in Brisbane. 'She used to tell me every (story) in her life, ups and downs, problems, happiness, even secrets,' he told The Courier Mail. 'She (was) supposed to give a call this first week of January but since I found out (from) her friend what (has) happened I am really (in) shock and don't know how to deal with it.' Ms Tiglao's nephew expressed his shock at the tragic news of his auntie who he usually hears from everyday .

"He was so desperate to join the army he lied about his age to become part of the Royal Engineers. At the tender age of 17 Ted Young was part of the D-Day landings at Juno beach in France, and helped to push the Nazis out of the country and liberate it. Now, 70 years on and one of the youngest surviving veterans of the D-Day invasions, Mr Young has finally been honoured for his efforts with the highest decoration France can bestow. Ted Young has been made a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur after he helped liberate France from Germany . Mr Young, 91, has been awarded the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur - the highest decoration in France - after he served in the Royal Engineers during the D-Day landings on Juno beach. He was awarded the medal following a pledge by president Francois Hollande to honour those that helped liberate his country. The veteran, from Poole, Dorset, was a sapper in the Royal Engineers on June 6, 1944 after he lied about his age - pretending to be 19 when he was actually 17. Mr Young had been rejected from the army once before when he tried to join up when he was 15-years-old. He landed on Juno beach alongside British and Canadian troops on D-Day and went on to help build bridges and Spitfire airstrips as the Allieds pushed the Nazis out of France. Mr Young was part of the Royal Engineers who landed at Juno Beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944 . The veteran is now one of the youngest surviving of the D-Day landings after he lied about his age to join up . Mr Young served in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany before being invalided home with a crushed ankle when a tank rolled over him. The veteran was presented with the medal by honorary French consul Annie Burnside at a poignant ceremony in Bristol. Irene Richards, his daughter, said: 'I am very proud of him. One of the most touching moment last year was when a boy of about 12 came up and shook Dad's hand and said, ""Thank you for giving me the life I have today.""' Mr Young also wears his uncle William Young’s three WWI medals which includes the Mons Star, with the original ribbons. The National Order of the Legion of Honour is the highest decoration in France. It was established in May 1802 by Napoleon. Technically membership of the Legion d'Honneur is restricted to French nationals and Foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds. However, foreigners who have served France may receive a distinction of the Legion, which is almost the same. The order was created as a non-egalitarian award, with people being admitted to a degree regardless of their birth or religion. It was intended as a general military and civil order of merit. It is divided into five degrees; Chevalier (Knight), Officier (Officer), Commandeur (Commander), Grand Officier (Grand Officer), and Grand Croix (Grand Cross). The highest order, Grand Cross, is limited to 80 members while the rank of Chevalier is unlimited. Famous . British recipients include Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince . Charles, Prince of Wales and the late Lord Mountbatten, author Graham . Greene, actor Laurence Olivier and Sir Stuart Bell MP. Last year Phyllis Latour Doyle, a British spy who parachuted behind enemy lines to collect intelligence on enemy positions ahead of the D-Day landings, was awarded the honour. In 2010 the membership consisted of; 67 Grand Cross, 314 Grand Officers, 3,009 Commanders, 17,032 Officers and 74,384 Knights.","Ted Young lied about his age so he could sign up to join the army in 1940s .

"Retailers affected by the Sydney siege are anxiously waiting to find out if the government declares the 16-hour hostage situation a terrorism event. Shops in Sydney’s central business district have claimed their sales slumped by 70 per cent on December 15 - the day of the siege - as the streets around the Lindt café in Martin Place, where 18 people were being held at gunpoint by Man Haron Monis, were locked down by police. Some insurance companies are reportedly holding back on making any decisions on payouts until Treasurer Joe Hockey has announced whether the tragic event was a terrorism event, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Sydney's centre went into lockdown during the Martin Place siege at the Lindt cafe . Police cordoned off areas to protect the public resulting in some shops filing insurance claims for the trade they lost out on . If Mr Hockey declares it a terrorism event then insurers will be assisted by a federally funded group, the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, to help limit the amount they have to pay out possibly saving them thousands of dollars. The siege happened in the week leading up to Christmas, a time when the Australian National Retailers predicted consumers would spend $8.3 billion. Director of the ANR, Russell Zimmerman, told the paper the siege slowed sales 'right off'. A spokesperson for Mr Hockey told SMH: ‘We are also working closely with relevant agencies as they carry out their investigations. If required, any decision on declaring a terrorism incident would likely be made in the coming weeks.’ On Sunday, it emerged highly-trained police officers were more concerned about the contents of the Man Haron Monis' backpack than his firearm when they stormed the Lindt cafe in the chilling final seconds of the Sydney siege. Man Haron Monis held 18 hostages up at gunpoint for 16-hours on December 15 . Some insurance companies are reportedly holding back on making any decisions on payouts until Treasurer Joe Hockey has announced whether the tragic event was a terrorism event . The Lindt cafe where the siege took place is seen closed off after the tragic event . The six State Protection Group officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place building immediately after cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot in the head by the gunman, reports the Daily Telegraph. The crucial movements of the SPG officers have been praised as 'text book entry' by those within the police force, as the specially-trained squad displayed a calm and composed nature despite their suspicions that Monis was strapped with an explosive. Six State Protection Group officers believed the gunman had a bomb strapped to his back as they stormed the Lindt cafe on December 16 . Officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place cafe after Monis (left) shot cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) 'They (the SPG) knew as soon the hostage was shot … that they would be going through that door,' a senior police source told The Daily Telegraph. 'The team who went through the doors still thought there were bombs (inside). They were more worried about the backpack than the gun.' 'They were confronted by a man with what they think is a bomb strapped to him and firing a gun at them as they’re going in.' Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children . Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16 . Once Monis was killed, the next concern for the officers was getting the remainder of the female hostages out of the building as safely as possible. It was only then that the officers had time to think about themselves and fled the cafe as the contents of the backpack attached to the gunman's back were still unknown. The Bomb Squad then entered the building and discovered that despite wires hanging out of Monis' backpack - it did not contain explosives. The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne.","Treasurer Joe Hockey will decide if the event was act of terrorism .

"A leading neuroscientist has backed an opt-in system for online pornography, saying extreme images may cause long-term harm to children’s brains. Baroness Susan Greenfield urged ministers to respect parents’ concerns over uncontrolled internet access. The Oxford University professor said the developing brain was ‘vulnerable’ and that children needed to be protected from premature sexualisation. Concerns: Oxford University professor Baroness Susan Greenfield said children need to be protected from premature sexualisation . Already, she said, young people she had spoken to believed ‘relationships are for losers’ and that having multiple sexual partners would impress their friends. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn unless over-18s specifically ask their internet service providers to let them see such material, following strict age verification. Baroness Greenfield said: ‘If I had to choose between unfettered internet access, and having children potentially harmed psychologically or worse by porn sites, then for me the decision is an easy one. ‘This [opt in] seems to be the simplest and something simple is easiest for people to deal with. We know that the young brain, because it is still developing, is vulnerable. It is so easily influenced, exposing young people to extreme behaviours like that, might influence it in a way that could be long term.’ Baroness Greenfield said children’s brains may be vulnerable to pornography, as well as suicide and eating disorder sites, on the back of evidence from studies on drug use, video games and criminal behaviour, showing long-term effects from early exposure. On Thursday, a petition signed by 115,000 – including 140 MPs – was handed in to Downing Street, demanding that internet service providers block online porn. It came as a Government consultation on controls for online porn ended after receiving 2,000 responses. Baroness Greenfield expressed concern it may not give enough weight to parents, as anyone could take part. She said: ‘We have to find out what people think and bow to the majority, and it’s hard to imagine the majority of parents saying they don’t mind their children accessing porn sites. 'Unfettered access': Baroness Greenfield said young people felt 'low-grade anxiety engendered by Facebook and the like' ‘What concerns me is that a young person without children doesn’t have the same concerns as a parent would have, so I would like to see parents having a voice.’ Baroness Greenfield, who was axed from scientific body the Royal Institution, has courted controversy in the past by claiming social networking sites can ‘rewire’ our brains. And speaking at the British Science Festival in Aberdeen this week, she said: ‘I’ve spoken to young people about this and they say there’s this low grade anxiety all the time, engendered by Facebook and the like that you must be completely beautiful, and have all the friends. ‘Another thing I’ve heard is that only losers have real relationships, because if you’re attractive you can have all manner of suitors and partners. This notion of a relationship where you know someone well, talk to them face to face, spend time with them, perhaps those things are less important now, than being seen to be a commodity.’ Thursday’s petition, organised by campaign group Safetynet was handed in by Tory MP Claire Perry, who chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the issue earlier this year. Earlier this week the Archbishop of York also warned of the dangers of online pornography, which he said caused ‘immeasurable misery’ and made boys see girls as ‘sex objects’. Miranda Suit, from the Safetynet campaign, welcomed the comments. She said: ‘Children’s charities have joined our campaign, senior church leaders are backing us and now we have a respected scientist warning of the dangers. ‘An opt-in filter enjoys widespread support, and the harm to children is becoming obvious now to every sector of society.’","Baroness Greenfield has backed opt-in system for online pornography .

"A futuristic trimaran yacht designed by London-based architect Dr Margot Krasojevic will operate 100 per cent self-sufficiently with power generated by solar panels on the wingsail and cost an estimated £9-£10million. The Fresnel Hydrofoil Trimaran, set for construction starting April this year, has been designed for Holden Manz wine estate in Franschoek, South Africa. Dr Krasojevic, who splits her time between London, Beijing and Belgrade, says the clients are racing fans, but will also use the yacht for cruising. The boat’s most striking feature is a carbon fibre sail frame that curves around to form part of the hull, with a retractable Kevlar sail. The wing sail features solar panels that collect the sun's rays, helped by fresnel lens and holographic film on the outrigger that project further rays on the panels. The Fresnel Hydrofoil Trimaran is a solar-powered, perpetual motion yacht designed by Dr Margot Krasojevic . The sail's frame is a mechanical structure similar to an airplane wing made of carbon fibre with a retractable Kevlar sail . The yacht has a folding wingsail that allows a more efficient lift to drag ratio . 'The fresnel lens and holographic film clad outrigger has never been used before as a means of running off concentrated solar power along with the form of the main hull, which acts as one unit,' Dr Krasojevic tells MailOnline. 'The wingsail (the main rigid sail) wraps into the main body of the hull so it is a continuous surface which, as a result of the motorised mast, can change the shape of the sail allowing it to catch more wind. This also hasn’t been done before.' When there is sun and no wind, the solar cells can be turned upwards to catch rays while when there’s wind it harnesses the best of both forms of energy. The double section vacuum bonded PVC-constructed outrigger hulls are detachable from the main hull . 'The trimaran harnesses wind, solar and kinetic energy to run the motors as and when necessary,' says Dr Krasojevic . When in monohull mode, a set of fold-out hydrofoils can be deployed to lift the main hull out of the water, reducing water resistance by up to 80 per cent and creating a faster and smoother ride. ‘The yacht attempts to run self sufficiently,’ Dr Krasojevic says. ‘The smart materials and vacuum formed PVcU cladding is currently being tested for solar efficiency with the aim of starting build in April 2015. ‘The boat transforms from racing multihull Trimaran to a cruise boat for leisure it harnesses renewable energy to run its motors. When in monohull mode a set of fold-out hydrofoils can be deployed to lift the main hull out of the water . The outrigger hulls are lined with Fresnel lenses and holographic film that focus the light back onto the sandwiched solar cells . The wingsail with rotatable solar cells and Kevlar-carbon fibre composite can be configured to best harness nature's energy . ‘The next stage of the design attempt to use kinetic movement to contribute to running the yacht as well as recycling the carbon fibre materials to reduce the environmental damage caused during curing.’ Unique, green energy-harnessing innovations are Dr Krasojevic’s specialty with other projects including a floating wine bar in Paris that harnesses natural light and boasts etched glass to resemble a bottle of bubbles. She’s also designed a ‘jetway hotel’ that can be wheeled up to the door of a private jet so the owner need not leave the airfield for short stays and a vertical prison in the middle of the ocean that produces hydroelectricity with its own waterfall.","The Fresnel Hydrofoil Trimaran has been designed by architect Dr Margot Krasojevic .

"Mark Zuckerberg is attempting to add a little more 'book' to Facebook. The Facebook founder and CEO announced on his page recently that he has vowed to read a book every other week in 2015, with an emphasis on learning about different beliefs and cultures. Zuckerberg created a 'Year of Book Books' page and urged his friends to join him in the project. As of Sunday afternoon, it had more than 89,000 likes. Challenge: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to read a book every two weeks as part of his personal challenge for 2015 . The first book in his program, Moises Naim's 'The End of Power,' was out of stock Sunday on Amazon.com and had a sales ranking of No. 203. The book was first published in 2013 and according to its description on Amazon, it 'illuminates the struggle between once-dominant megaplayers and the new micropowers challenging them in every field of human endeavor.' Oprah Winfrey remains the gold standard for choosing books, though clubs have been started by 'Good Morning America' and the 'Today' show, among others. Lucky author: Amazon quickly sold out of Moises Naim's book The End of Power after Zuckerberg's announcement . My challenge for 2015 is to read a new book every other week -- with an emphasis on learning about different cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies. Thank you to all 50,000 of you in our community who gave me suggestions for different challenges. Many of you proposed reading challenges. Cynthia Greco suggested I read one book a month that another person chooses -- and got 1,900 likes on her suggestion. Rachel Brown, Bill Munns, Marlo Kanipe and others suggested I read the Bible. My friend and colleague Amin Zoufonoun suggested I read and learn everything I can about a new country each week. I'm excited for my reading challenge. I've found reading books very intellectually fulfilling. Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today. I'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books. If you want to follow along on my challenge and read the same books I do, I've created a page, A Year of Books, where I'll post what I'm reading. Please only participate in the discussions if you've actually read the books and have relevant points to add. The group will be moderated to keep it focused. Our first book of the year will be The End of Power by Moisés Naím. It's a book that explores how the world is shifting to give individual people more power that was traditionally only held by large governments, militaries and other organizations. The trend towards giving people more power is one I believe in deeply, and I'm looking forward to reading this book and exploring this in more detail. I appreciated all of your other suggestions for possible challenges as well. Many of you suggested I give money to help people in need -- and Priscilla and I fully intend to keep doing that through our philanthropic work. We'll have more to discuss there soon. Some of you suggested that I meet a new person every day. That was actually my challenge in 2013. Others suggested I teach a class. I've done that too, and I'd love to do it again and get more involved in education in the coming year. Thanks again for all of your suggestions, and I'm looking forward to a year of books! via Facebook .","The billionaire's resolution for 2015 is to read a new book every two weeks and he's invited 30 million people to join him .

"A Romanian princess accused of running cockfights at her Oregon ranch has pleaded guilty to running an illegal gambling business with her husband. Irina Walker admitted to the gambling charges on Wednesday under a plea deal in which charges of animal fighting and conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act were dismissed. Walker, whose father King Michael I was forced to abdicate by communists in 1947 and raise his family in exile, was arrested last summer. Plea deal: Romanian princess Irina Walker, left, and her husband John Walker, a retired sheriff's deputy, right, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to running an illegal gambling business . In court yesterday the 61-year-old admitted that she had profited from the fights in which roosters had knives strapped to their legs and then fought to the death. 'I provided food and beverage, your honor, and the location.' she told district judge Michael Mosman. Walker and her husband John, a retired sheriff's deputy, were accused of hosting at least ten cockfighting fights in a barn at their Irrigon ranch, which is about 175 miles from Portland. Assistant U.S. attorney Stephen Peifer said the Walkers charged spectators $20 to enter, and attracted crowds of more than 100. Peifer said that Irina Walker had initially provided food for the spectators, but her husband brought in outside catering to provide tacos when her dishes proved unpopular. Her 68-year-old husband, who worked for the Coos County sheriff's office from 1998 to 2008, told the judge an experienced cockfighting referee had approached him about staging fights. Exile: Irina Walker's father, former King of Romania Michael I, with his wife and some of his daughters in 1955 . Regal past: Before Walker's family were forced into exile by communists, they lived in several palaces including Peles Castle, which was used as a summer residence by the Romanian royals from 1883 to 1947 . At first the fights were held outside, but later Walker had a barn-like structure built, which he told the judge had been for hay. Walker, who owned several guns, was allegedly in charge of security, and also arranged for a company to provide portable rest rooms. The people who brought . roosters to fight paid $1,000 to enter, and the pool ranged from $10,000 . to $18,000. The person whose roosters won the most fights took home the . money, except for the 10 percent takeout kept by the referees. More . than a dozen other people were indicted in the case. Charges against . the woman who made the Mexican food were later dropped and two . defendants - Ruben Saltos Godina, known as Chino; and . Antonio Dominguez Robles, known as Tono - have not yet been caught. Everyone else pleaded guilty, either in Oregon or Washington state. Walker and her husband John, had accepted plea deals in the case, and are due to be sentenced on October 22. They were released to await sentencing. Accusations: The Walkers are accused of staging cockfights at their ranch, in which spectators paid $20 to watch the barbaric sport . According to Oregon Live, as part of the deal they couple must sell part of their ranch by November 2015 and forfeit $200,000 to the government. The government has recommended a sentence of probation for the couple, along with the forfeiture of $200,000. Irina Walker moved to the U.S. from Switzerland in the 1980s, her daughter Angelica Kreuger, from a previous marriage, told AP last year. Kreuger said her mother had enjoyed horse riding and gardening while she raised her two children. She later married John, who was a family friend and neighbor, and they moved to rural Irrigon.","Irina Walker admits providing food and beverage to crowds of spectators .

"The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has stepped in to prevent convicted rapist Ched Evans resuming his football career overseas. The Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday that they had offered the 26-year-old former Sheffield United and Wales striker a deal for the remainder of the season. But in a statement, the MoJ said that, as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was effectively barred from working abroad. Ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims,' said an MoJ spokesman. 'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad. 'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.' The announcement is a further setback to Evans who has been seeking to return to football following his release from prison in October after serving two-and-half of a five year sentence for rape. Malta prime minister Joseph Muscat has warned Hibernians about signing convicted rapist Evans . He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players union the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer. Since then, Tranmere, Oldham and Hartlepool have all turned down the opportunity to sign him. The offer by Hibernians - who currently lead Malta's domestic league by 15 points - had appeared to open up the prospect of a way back into the game. But even on the Mediterranean island the move was controversial, with prime minister Joseph Muscat warning that it could damage the country's reputation. Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans . Evans recently released a video statement claiming his innocence alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) A tweet on the verified Twitter account of his office stated: 'Footballers are role models. Hibs' decision will define them and to an extent Malta. I hope (management) understand this clearly before final decision.' In contrast, Maltese justice minister Owen Bonnici said that he believed Evans should be given the opportunity to resurrect his career. 'Ched Evans should be given a second chance. If we believe in rehabilitation of ex-prisoners we should practise what we preach,' he said. Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The player denied the offence, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.

"Back in the 1890s, the Hurtigruten Mail ships used to ferry passengers and supplies along Norway’s rugged coastline. And the tradition continues today, with human cargo transported from Bergen to Kirkenes and all ports in between.

Lots of places call themselves ‘the gateway to...’, but Tromso really is a frontier town, where you can feel the full force of the Arctic. I’m enjoying wandering around in layers of wool. I must look the part because two builders pull over in their truck to ask me directions. I feel chuffed. And then suddenly my ship comes in.

Father Brown and Harry Potter star Mark Williams . The Kong Harald completely dominates the quayside - and on we trundle. It’s straight to the cabin to unpack. Ship cabins are marvellous for stowage because everything has to be secure to avoid breakage, so if you enjoy a cubby-hole, you’ll love this. There’s no TV, no radio, and a porthole the size of a bathmat. The beds are single with a patent couchette system so the sofa spins over and underneath is the mattress, with crisp linen and a proper Scandinavian duvet. It’s time for a sundowner before we leave port. Arvid runs the bar. He’s been at sea all his life. The captain may think he rules this ship, but it’s Arvid’s home, and we are his guests. Like all great barmen he makes people feel comfortable enough to drink and relax, but not comfortable enough to misbehave. At 18.15 we’re off. North. I ask a chatty man if there is a difference between the northern and southern Norwegian accents and he answers: ‘Yes, in the south the endings of the words go up, and in the north the endings of the words go down.’ The Kong Harald cruise ship, the vessel for the five-day voyage, where Arvid's bar really is the hub . A five-day Arctic Highlights Voyage with Travel Club Elite (travelclubelite.com, 0121 213 0012) costs from £799pp including flights, transfers and half-board accommodation. The food is good on board. We have cauliflower soup (tasty and comforting), Arctic char (perfectly cooked fish), rice pudding and some delicious wine. I have an Austrian Grüner Veltliner. Suddenly, there’s an announcement from the bridge, followed by a mini stampede to the promenade deck. It’s dark and cloudy, but there’s something behind the clouds. They clear, and there above us all are the Northern Lights. Much brighter than I had imagined, extra-terrestrial, silent, solemn and very beautiful. Imagine you have never seen a rainbow before, and then you do. I feel blessed, as the light pulsates, moves, dances. Extraordinary. The Northern Lights 'pulsate, move and dance, Williams writes, as seen from the deck of the Hurtigruten . It’s March - and grey. But Norway does grey like England does green. I never get bored watching that beautiful sea through my porthole, the wave crests, gulls, snow, cliffs, seals and clouds, all grey turning always to silver when lit. At one point, there’s a knot-tying class on deck, after which I opt to go on a dog-sled excursion in Kirkenes, on the borders of Russia and Finland. Here there is a local freedom of movement so the Norwegians go to Russia to shop for vodka and the Russians come to Norway to shop for nappies. Kirkenes is also a centre for the sport of dog-sledding, and husky teams are a status symbol. There are about 50 private teams and the major races are a big deal. A team of huskies lead a sled through the snow of Kirkenes, on the borders of Russia and Finland . When you see photos of the great polar explorers with their sled teams, the animals are big. Here, they were trim and athletic. It’s much faster than I imagined. The dogs are keen to run, and stopping them can be a problem. We are nomadic, some of us more than others. A journey is a marvellous thing and this one made me want to go further north to see the polar bears of Svalbard; to stand on the ice that floats on the top of the world, to see a Narwhal or a sea lion not in a zoo. There is nothing as restful as curiosity.","Mark Williams took an Arctic Highlights Voyage with Travel Club Elite .

"A woman has spoken out about the pain she suffered after slimming down from 300 pounds to 135. Andie Mitchell, 29, was addicted to food at the age of 20 when she vowed to change. But on the other side of the fence, the grass was not as green as she had hoped. In a moving new memoir, It Was Me All Along, Mitchell describes how her life became a prison of calorie-counting, cravings and self-consciousness until she found a comfortable weight. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Andie Mitchell, 29, was 268 pounds at the age of 20 (left) then dropped to 135 pounds (right) but it was tough . 'It was a very hard time for me,' Mitchell told the New York Post. 'Food is fun. Food makes up some of my best memories, and I was changing my relationship to food and it changed my relationship with everyone else. 'It led to depression. I was like, ""This is me. I've changed"". And it really hurt my family.' Food was already a big part of 12-year-old Mitchell's life when her 350-pound father died of a stroke at the age of 40. She instantly gained 27 pounds, and from there ballooned. 'I was always the fat girl': Mitchell said it took her years to realize she ate instead of mourning her dad's death . Change: Mitchell used the mantra 'can you do it just for today?' to stop binge eating to reach 135 pounds . Painful: Despite dropping all the weight she wanted to, she then felt a pressure and didn't feel happy . On her 20th birthday, at almost 300 pounds, she spent the morning baking a sour cream fudge cake - only to eat all but one slice immediately. She ate entire packets of McDonald's french fries, which she doesn't like the taste of. Her first high school dance required a custom-made dress. Finally, she stepped on a set of scales. 'I was 268 pounds. This was a really scary moment for me. Terrifying,' Mitchell told the Post. 'I just saw that my dad was 350, I knew that there were future versions of me that were bigger and bigger. Yearning: She yearned to return to the optimism she had before that thinness would bring happiness . Low points: One day she spent the morning making a cream fudge cake then ate all but a slice immediately . 'I was 20 years old. I didn't want to turn 21 having never felt good about myself.' She started keeping a food diary, walking everywhere, cutting out sugar. It was painful. 'I felt that deep longing for sweets. Come 8 or 9 pm, my stomach felt hollow. I wanted cake. I wanted chocolate. I couldn't watch television without looking at my lap, where I wished there could be a bowl of crunchy something,' her memoir describes. Within a summer, she lost 30 pounds. The next step was surgery to remove the excess fat. Memoirs: This is the cover of Mitchell's book about her journey, which comes out on January 6 . She felt 'attractive and desirable and valuable in a way that I wasn't before. And that made me sad.' In a TEDx talk about her memoir, she said: 'I started to realize that all of this attention came with its own baggage. 'When that newness and that fun started to fade, I felt this pressure to maintain, a pressure to be normal. 'The pressure was on all of these levels. One was on an eating level. My family and my friends believe this motto: 'eating big means living big'. They'd say to me: 'Cut the cr** with dieting Andie, eat half a calzone, that's fine'. 'I didn't even know how to introduce calzones into my life again. 'On another level, a personal one, I thought my anxiety, my depression, my crippling self-doubt were because of my fatness; that they'd have gone away now. But they didn't because I was still the same person. 'I just wanted to go back to the same optimism I had that thinness was the answer.' Now, after undergoing therapy sessions, Mitchell has decided to practice moderation in everything - and reached a comfortable weight of 150 pounds. 'It's taken me 10 years to find a weight where I feel like, ""I'm good here"". It's the weight where you don't have to struggle. It's when you don't have to turn down an Oreo,' she told the Post. Taking to the web, she charted every move of her journey in weight loss, weight gain and therapy to share with others having the same experience on the blog Can You Stay For Dinner?. In the process, Mitchell realized her addiction to food was a way of grieving for her father. She shared the pain of breaking up with her long-term boyfriend. She shared her passion for food - and has now compiled a cookbook of healthy recipes. 'It was a catharsis that I didn't know I needed. It turned it into something meaningful,' she said. 'It's never just about the food, it's the way I'm using it to tell the story.'","Andie Mitchell was 268 pounds at the age of 20, panicked and went on diet .

"When convicted killer Michael Ibrahim got shot in the shoulder after bullets were fired at him in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD on Sunday night, it was just another chapter in his family’s colourful history. Originally from a poor immigrant Lebanese background they are a family whose fame and notoriety precedes them in Sydney. Before the shooting took place at around 10.30pm on Sunday night Michael Ibrahim had already been in the news. Scroll down for video . (From left to right) brothers Sam, Michael and John Ibrahim enjoy a night out on the town together . A bullet was removed from this tree as police investigate the shooting of Michael Ibrahim outside his Sydney city residence on Monday . John Ibrahim's life is apparently now the basis for a new $15 million TV series . Family members outside at St Vincent's Hospital on Monday after visiting shooting victim Michael Ibrahim . Police are hunting for a gunman after Michael Ibrahim was shot while standing on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night . A crime scene remained on Monday outside Michaels Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home where he has lived since he left prison in August 2014 . At 36 years old he is the youngest of the family and was jailed for the killing of Robin Nassour in 2006, but released on parole in August last year. He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years for his role in the fatal stabbing. At his August 2014 parole hearing Michael Ibrahim vowed to move on with his life. He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the ‘most stringent’ parole conditions. Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a 'wake up call', he told the parole board. He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney. But he’d been trouble with the law before. In 2012 he was acquitted of conspiring to murder nightclub owner John Macris, who he believed was responsible for gunning down his brother, Fadi Ibrahim. Fadi was lucky to survive this attempt on his life. The 40-year-old was shot five times and spent three weeks in a coma after he was ambushed by a gunman as he sat in a black Lamborghini outside his Castle Cove home in June 2009. No one has ever been charged with the shooting. Fadi Ibrahim was lucky to survive an attempt on his life when he was shot five times in June 2009 . Sam Ibrahim is the former Parramatta chapter president of the Nomads bikie gang . Several shots were fired, with a bullet removed from this tree at the scene of the shooting, but Michael Ibrahim was only shot by one bullet to the shoulder . Michael Ibrahim was sentenced to a maximum nine years and four months behind bars for his role in the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006. He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years . Eldest brother Sam Ibrahim is the former Parramatta chapter president of the Nomads bikie gang. The 48-year-old was shot twice in the legs in a January 2011 drive-by shooting. He has been behind bars on firearms charges since his bail was revoked in July last year. But the most famous of the clan is John Ibrahim, 44, also known as the ‘King of the Cross’, for the number of establishments he owns in the nightclub district. He has never been convicted of a serious offence. However, in 2004, a police bail submission presented to court on a charge of threatening a witness described Ibrahim as ‘a major organised crime figure’ who was ‘the subject of 546 police intelligence reports in relation to his involvement in drugs, organised crime and association with outlaw motorcycle gangs’. His life is apparently now the basis for a new $15 million TV series. Sisters, Armani Stelio, 39, and Jazz Dior, 43, both had run-ins with the police in recent years too. Macquarie Street was closed between Bridge and Bent streets as police scoured the area for bullet casings . Police were called to the area at about 10.30pm on Sunday after reports shots had been fired . The cause of the shooting is not yet clear and police will continue to investigate . Stellio's home in Ryde was sprayed with more than 20 bullets only a few weeks after she moved into it in November 2010. Six months later she was arrested along with her brother Sam, the family body guard Semi 'Tongan Sam' Ngata and a fourth person on allegations they kidnapped a man, drove him to an ANZ Bank at Ryde and ordered him to withdraw $100,000. Police later dropped the case against all four accused. Dior was found not guilty in December 2011 of offences relating to almost $3 million that was found in the ceiling of her South Wentworthville home in 95 vacuum-sealed plastic bags. She did not know how the money came to be there. Armani Stelio's home in Ryde was sprayed with more than 20 bullets only a few weeks after she moved into it in November 2010 . On Monday John Ibrahim visited his brother Michael in St Vincent’s Hospital, while detectives reportedly continued investigating whether the shooting was linked to a feud between the Ibrahims and other notorious criminal families. Family, friends and associates flocked to the hospital during the course of Monday where Michael has been recovering since the shooting on Sunday night. He had been sitting up in bed, was in good spirits and in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon. Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery. Meanwhile, police continued their investigation at the scene of the attack on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments. They are looking for at least two attackers and a white, possibly late model, Audi. But whether the police make arrests or not, one thing is for certain – the folklore surrounding the Ibrahim family goes on and it's unlikely to stop here.","Convicted killer Michael Ibrahim suffered a gunshot wound to shoulder after bullets were fired at him on Sunday night .

"This is the shocking moment a knife-wielding robber jacked a woman's car in a Spanish parking lot before making off with her baby sat on the back seat. Terrifying CCTV footage shows the 34-year-old, named by his initials JAL, jumping into the passenger side as the woman clips herself into her seat belt outside the Parquesur shopping mall in Leganes, south of Madrid. Police said he then ordered her to 'give him the car or else.' Scroll down for video . A woman was threatened by a knife-wielding carjacker who stole her car with her baby on the back seat. Pictured is the mother loading her 16-month-old's pram into the car boot . The woman then steps into the car, parked outside the Parquesur shopping mall in Leganes . The carjacker, named by his initials JAL, then approaches the vehicle holding a knife . Reasoning he could take the car after she'd removed her 16-month-old son from the rear, the woman reportedly tried to calm her attacker down. When her request fell on death ears, however, she started screaming for help. A fight broke out between the two and the man eventually succeeded in ejecting the woman from the vehicle, reports ABC. With passersby coming to her rescue, the mother desperately clung to the door to try and stop the man from driving away. The mother and the man, 34, fight until the woman leaves the vehicle, desperately holding on to the door as passers-by come to her rescue . Hearing the woman's screams, more strangers run to the woman's assistance as the man reverses . The thief reverses the car back, narrowly missing another driver with the mother still clinging on to the door . One man is seen kicking the vehicle, while another thrusts his hand through the window to try and wrestle control of the steering wheel. The thief, however, managed to drive off and pick up his girlfriend - a 29-year-old woman named only as TRL - outside the car park. The pair then drove off, with the baby still inside, but abandoned the vehicle just a mile away. Three men look on helplessly as the man drives away with the baby in the back. The thief and his girlfriend were arrested following the incident in December . National Police officers found the car, with the unharmed baby still inside, some minutes later. Agents arrested the duo the following day after the incident in December - after identifying the man from fingerprints left inside the car.

"The French president today called for the lifting of the West's economic sanctions on Russia, saying: 'Mr Putin does not want to annex eastern Ukraine. He has told me that.' Saying the sanctions 'must stop now', Francois Hollande said he was expecting progress on a resolution to the Ukraine crisis at international talks in Kazakhstan in 10 days. The crisis in Ukraine has prevented cash-strapped France from completing the delivery of two Mistral-class warships to Russia, a deal left in limbo since accusations Russia has interfered in Ukraine's civil war. French President Francois Hollande, left, today called for the lifting of economic sanctions on Russia, saying that Russia's President Vladimir Putin, right, had told him he had no intention of annexing east Ukraine . France, already struggling economically, could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2-billion-euro contract. 'I think the sanctions must stop now,' President Hollande said during a wide-ranging two-hour interview with France Inter radio station. 'They must be lifted if there is progress. If there is no progress the sanctions will remain.' Ukraine's Western-backed leader Petro Poroshenko is to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin at a meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana in ten days, which will also be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Hollande said: 'I am going to Astana on January 15 on one condition, that there be fresh progress. And I think there will be. If it is to meet and talk without making headway, it is not worth it.' The French president said that while Europe should keep lines of communication open with President Putin, 'he must know where to stop, and it has been costly for him.' Sanctions imposed by the European Union and the U.S., along with plunging oil prices, have sent the rouble crashing by some 40 per cent against the dollar. The punitive measures were slapped on Ukraine's former Soviet stablemate after Moscow annexed Crimea, and was subsequently accused of stoking separatist conflict in the east of the country. Moscow denies it has backed the conflict which has left over 4,700 dead, as well as a charge it has supplied weapons and troops to rebels. Pointing out that Mr Putin had told him he had no intention of annexing east Ukraine, Mr Hollande said: 'What he wants is to remain influential. What he wants is for Ukraine not to fall into the NATO camp. 'What we want is that he respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine. What we want is that he does not support the separatists.' Paris in November pushed back the delivery of the high-tech Mistral class 'vessels' bought by Russia 'until further notice'. Just before Christmas celebrations, the some 400 sailors training to operate the ships left for Russia.","Ukraine crisis stopping France completing €1.2billion deal with Russia .

Her personal and work email accounts were allegedly spied on, as well. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges 'In June of 2013, the F.B.I. had opened a case on Ms. Attkisson's computer intrusions under the auspices of a national security issue, but it failed to contact or interview her.

"A New Mexico woman is facing charges after smuggling a handgun into a city jail inside her privates, according to sheriff's officials. Josephine McAllister, 34, from Albuquerque, was arrested December 16 on a slew of charges, including possession of stolen credit cards, larceny, receiving stolen property and resisting or obstructing an officer. A short time after Miss McAllister was booked into the Bernalillo Country Metropolitan Detention Center, another inmate found a handgun in the ladies' room while taking out the trash. Smuggler: Josephine McAllister, 34, from Albuquerque, has been charged with sneaking a handgun into a city jail inside her privates . Contraband: McAllister brought the gun into the Bernalillo Country Metropolitan Detention Center during a recent arrest and then ditched it in the bathroom . When questioned about the firearm by jail officials, McAllister said she did not inform police of the gun in her possession because she did not want additional charges. The 34-year-old claimed that she had stashed the gun in her waistband, but officers are convinced she was hiding it in her genitals. Officer Simon Drobik told the station KOAT four police officers searched McAllister as thoroughly as they could at the time of her arrest, but performing a body cavity search was 'out of the question' because departmental rules do not allow it. McAllister, a mother of four pictured right with her grown daugter, said she did not inform police of the gun in her possession because she did not want additional charges . Suspects who are brought to the city jail are passed through a body scanner and are subjected to a pat-down before entering the facility. Capt Ray Gonzalez said Miss McAllister likely asked to use the bathroom immediately upon arrival at the detention center, before staff had a chance to search her. Gonzalez said that since the incident, the jail has put in place additional security measures, including wanding detainees as soon as they arrive, posting staff outside the restrooms and searching the facilities before and after use to make sure no contraband was left behind. Josephine McAllister is now facing one count of taking contraband into a place of imprisonment. Checkered past: Online records show that McAllister, pictured above in four different booking photos, she has been arrested more than a dozen times since 2003 on a wide variety of charges . McAllister's grown daughter has shared a link to a news story about her mother's arrest, accompanied by the following comment: 'Yeah right they search good that's why they always have contraband charges. She would never hurt anyone especially a cop. If anything she would of [sic] hurt herself.‘ . The Albuquerque resident, who is a mother of four, is no stranger to legal trouble.

"A police force in Wisconsin have a mystery to resolve in their own station after a diamond ring was found on their Christmas tree. Staff were instructed to take down the tree on Saturday at which point they found a wedding ring they said was intentionally put on a branch. Writing on the force's Facebook page, police chief Peter Hoell said: 'If any one can shed a little light on this mystery, I would appreciate it.' The diamond wedding ring was placed on the Christmas tree in the Germantown police station, in Wisconsin . Peter Hoell wrote on the force's Facebook page asking if anyone could 'shed a little light on this mystery' Germantown police department had invited children to decorate their tree in the lead-up to Christmas in exchange for a stuffed animal that were placed beneath it. At some point in the festivities, the diamond ring appeared on the tree. Police Chief Peter Hoell said: 'We had the ring examined and the diamonds are real. For now, we have placed it in safe keeping. 'Anyone wishing to claim the ring will need to know a detailed description, or better yet, a picture of the owner wearing it. 'The ring was ""intentionally"" placed on the tree, it was not an accident. No crime was committed.' He added: 'I cannot dedicate someone to view five weeks of lobby video watching people decorate our tree in hopes to see the person who placed the ring on the tree. 'All we are doing is giving the person who placed the ring on our tree an opportunity to claim the ring if they want it back.' Germantown is about 15 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin.","Germantown police, in Wisconsin, found diamond ring in Christmas tree .

"Lesbian and gay couples were married in Miami on Monday by the same judge who said she saw no reason why they couldn't immediately get their licenses ahead of Florida's coming-out party as the nation's 36th state where same-sex marriages are legal statewide. The addition of Florida's 19.9 million people means 70 percent of Americans now live in states where gay marriage is legal. It also reflects how much the nation's third-largest state has changed since the days of Anita Bryant, the former beauty pageant queen and orange juice spokeswoman who started her national campaign against gay rights in Miami in the 1970s.

Lesbian and gay couples were married in Miami on Monday by the same judge who said she saw no reason why they couldn't immediately get their licenses ahead of Florida's coming-out party as the nation's 36th state where same-sex marriages are legal statewide . Catherina Pareto, left, and her partner Karla Arguello celebrate on the court house steps after Circuit Court Judge Sarah Zabel lifted a stay on her July ruling . Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel exits her courtroom after conducting Floridas first gay wedding . Ozzie Russ, left and his partner Steve Schlariet, plaintiffs in the case that led to a federal judge ruling Florida's gay marriage ban is unconstitutional, pose at their ranch in Chipley, Fla.  Russ and Schlariet said they never sought the spotlight of social activism, the spotlight found them . 'It means that we're no different than any other couple in the U.S.,' said Bill Munette, a Realtor in Pinellas County, Fla., who had a commitment ceremony with his partner in March of 2000. The courtroom erupted in cheers when Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel cleared the way for the licenses issued to Cathy Pareto and Karla Arguello, and Jeff and Todd Delmay. Then she presided over their weddings in a dual ceremony. The first same-sex marriage license officially issued in Florida went to another pair of women -- Deborah Shure and Aymarah Robles -- who attended the hearing, and later discovered they were first in line at the clerk's desk. 'We're just happy for everyone here,' said Robles, who plans a low-key wedding on Tuesday. Deborah Shure, 66, left, hugs her partner Aymarah Robles, 60, as they wait to apply for a marriage license at the Miami-Dade County Clerk of Courts office . Couples, left to right; Cathy Pareto with Karla Arguello, David Price, and Don Johnston and Jorge Diaz, celebrate as Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel lifts a stay on her July ruling that Florida's same-sex marriage ban violates equal protections under the U.S. Constitution . Other same-sex marriages were expected to happen around the state after midnight Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle's ruling, covering all 67 counties, was set to take effect. Both judges found that the same-sex wedding ban in Florida's constitution violates the guarantees of equal treatment and due process enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Large-scale ceremonies in Orlando, Tampa, Key West and Broward County were planned for Tuesday. Others planned to take their time. 'We want to do it right,' said Munette, who is 48, and is planning a March 2016 wedding with his 55-year-old partner, Robb Schoonmaker. 'We don't want to rush to get it done. We're planning it just like any normal couple would.' But while the news was largely met with cheers or even shrugs from Florida's more liberal enclaves such as South Florida and St. Petersburg, signs of opposition to the rulings were evident farther north, where more conservative Floridians live. In Jacksonville, Duval County Court Clerk Ronnie Fussell shut down the courthouse chapel, saying no marriage ceremonies -- either gay or straight -- would be allowed there. At least two other counties in northeast Florida did the same. Jeff Ronci, 53, left, touches the face of his partner of 15 years Juan Talavera, 46, right, as they wait to apply for a marriage license . 'Mr. Fussell said some of his people felt a little uncomfortable doing it,' said Charlie Broward, a spokesman for the clerk. 'It could cause discriminations down there (in the marriage license department) with those who are uncomfortable. We wanted to eliminate any unfairness.' Florida's northern counties may see an influx of license applications by same-sex couples from other southern states where marriage bans remain in place. Sean Hudson, a spokesman for the state clerks' association, said he was unaware of any clerk that didn't plan to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples seeking them, although several have said they won't do any more weddings for anyone. 'That's not a statutory duty of theirs,' said Hudson, referring to the ceremonies.  'The clerks are going to do what their duty is.' Florida's constitution was amended to ban same-sex marriages in 2008 by voters who approved it by a 60 percent margin. But judges in Florida found it discriminatory, mirroring decisions in many other states. And even as gays and lesbians get marriage licenses, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has appeals pending in state and federal courts, seeking to uphold the state's ban. Bondi's position — one shared by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, now considering a run for president — is that marriage should be defined by each state. Opponents of same-sex marriage in Florida weren't giving up without a fight. Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group based in the Orlando area, planned to file complaints in several counties Monday in an effort to block clerks from issuing licenses to same-sex couples, said the group's lawyer, Horatio 'Harry' Mihet. The group already tried to block Osceola County's clerk in a complaint filed on behalf of Florida Family Action, Inc., but that advocacy group's case was dismissed last week. A similar case is pending in Orange County. Mihet still hopes for success in the courts, and said 'the fact that some clerks may issue licenses against the law doesn't obviate any of the appeals.' The state's first weddings were set to happen in the same county where, 38 years ago, Bryant successfully campaigned to overturn a Dade County ordinance banning discrimination against gays. The county commission reinstated those protections two decades later. Bryant's career suffered — as did Florida orange juice sales — and she blamed the 'ultra-liberal press.' 'They're saying I'm a bigot and have hatred for the homosexuals,' she told The AP in 1977. 'I don't hate homosexuals. I love them enough to tell them the truth: that God puts them in the category with other sinners.' The state's Catholic bishops issued a joint statement Monday expressing disappointment, saying implications of gay marriages aren't fully understood and will upend millennia of tradition. 'How society understands marriage has great public significance,' they said. 'Because of this, redefining civil 'marriage' to include two persons of the same sex will have far-reaching consequences in society. Such a change advances the notion that marriage is only about the effective gratification of consenting adults.'

"Politicians ignore young people to chase the 'silver vote' because older people are more likely to turn out on election day, a senior Labour frontbencher has admitted. Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said older voters were being targeted by the major political parties because they were more likely to vote than 18 to 24 year olds. He warned the problem meant more people in their twenties and thirties were becoming disengaged from the political process, believing parties will only govern in the interests of the elderly. Turnout has fallen must steeply among 18-24-year-olds, according to research of elections dating back to 1964 . Barely half of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared to almost three-quarters of the over-65s. In the last 50 years total turnout has fallen from 77 per cent in 1964 to 65 per cent four years ago. In the sixties turnout was highest among 35-54 year olds, but social change and a sense of duty among the post-war generation means that 5 per cent more of of the over-65s voted in 2010 than the next highest age group. Mr Khan told the Independent: 'If you speak candidly to a campaign manager of any of the mainstream parties they will say that they concentrate their energies disproportionately on those they know are going to vote. 'If you've got a candidate with an hour spare and a choice to go to an old people's home or a sixth-form college, 99 per cent of campaign managers will say you've got to go to an old people's home. That's because 94 per cent of them are on the register and 77 per cent of them will vote. That's not true of the younger generation. 'You look at any empirical analysis of this government's policies and you can see they are going for the silver vote.' Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said older voters were being targeted by the major political parties because they were more likely to vote than 18 to 24 year olds . Mr Khan, the MP for Tooting, called for the voting age to be lowered to 16, a longer polling period and online voting. 'We as politicians have to understand the responsibility on us to engage young people in politics. If someone is not voting that is a problem,' he added. Today sees the first full day of general election campaigning, with all the main parties setting out their stall to voters. Labour leader Ed Miliband will use a speech in Manchester to warn the NHS is not safe in the Tories' hands. Five senior Conservative cabinet ministers are expected to tell an event in London that Labour has committed to an extra £20billion in spending commitments for the first year of the next Parliament. And Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will use his monthly press conference to urge people who would prefer another hung parliament instead of single party rule to vote Lib Dem. A House of Commons research paper said: 'The decline in young people’s engagement in politics has been a common theme of late. 'Voter turnout has been low among young people relative to older age groups,but in the context of falling overall turnout at General Elections, the decline has been sharpest amongst voters aged 18-24.'","Sadiq Khan says campaign managers focus on wooing older voters .

"The Indonesian government has suspended air control officials and an airport operator in a crackdown over the problems which allowed the doomed AirAsia Flight 8501 to take off without proper permits. The aircraft was traveling between Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, and Singapore on a Sunday when it crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 162 on board. Officials have since said its permit for the popular route was only for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and that AirAsia quietly switched three of those days. A number of people have been suspended from Surabaya airport (pictured) after allowing the doomed AirAsia flight to take off without the proper permits. File image used . Bodies of those killed in the tragedy are transferred to Surabaya from a rescue aircraft . Officials in Singapore, however, have said the plane was authorized to fly on Sundays from its end. Highlighting the depths of the country's air safety problems, the transportation ministry announced the harsh new measures and warned it would examine the permits of all other airlines flying in the country. Djoko Murjatmodjo, acting director general of air transportation, said: 'Who knows if other airlines are doing the same thing?' Murjatmodjo said key individuals who allowed to plane to fly without permits would be suspended while the investigation was pending. His ministry also issued a directive ordering all airlines to provide pilots with up-to-date weather reports before they take off. Currently, it's up to the captain and co-pilot to research and evaluate flying conditions before departing. In other countries, carriers' flight operations departments perform that task for them. He also planned to meet Monday with the Corruption Eradication Commission to discuss whether to investigate AirAsia's operations.

Applications for specific routes take into account issues including air traffic rights and airport takeoff and landing slots.

Violation of the regulations would boost legal arguments for passengers' family members seeking compensation, said Alvin Lie, a former lawmaker and aviation analyst. But he added AirAsia would not be the only one to blame. 'The Surabaya-Singapore flights have been operating since October ... and the government didn't know,' he said.

"Parents should cut back on the amount of sugar their children consume by giving them yoghurt instead of ice cream, according to a new Government campaign. Change4Life, launched today by Public Health England, is promoting 'sugar swap' tips as part of a push to cut back on the amount of sugar being consumed by young Britons on a daily basis. It comes as a survey found that two-thirds of parents are worried about the amount of sugar in their children’s diets, while nearly half believe that their family consumes too much sugar. Parents should cut back on the amount of sugar their children consume by giving them yoghurt instead of ice cream, according to a new Government campaign (posed by model) According to Department of Health guidelines, added sugars should make up just one tenth of a person's calorie intake. But statistics show that younger children, particularly those aged between four and 10, are consuming up to 50 per cent more than this. The Change4Life campaign will offer parents a 'sugar challenge', suggesting food which can be substituted for sugary products. Examples include giving a child water or milk instead of soft drinks, or a wholewheat biscuit cereal rather than a sugary cereal at breakfast. Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and well-being at PHE said the impact on our health of eating too much sugar is evident. He said: 'Reducing sugar intake is important for the health of our children both now and in the future. 'We are all eating too much sugar and the impact this has on our health is evident. This campaign is about taking small steps to address this. 17 per cent from soft drinks . 17 per cent from biscuits, buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies . 14 per cent from confectionery . 13 per cent from fruit juice . 8 per cent from breakfast cereal . 'We know from past campaigns that making simple swaps works and makes a real difference.' Research from the University of Reading found that the average sugar intake of 50 families went down by 40 per cent when they followed the Change4Life advice. In one month, the average dropped from 483g to 287g - the equivalent of 49 sugar cubes per day. Dr Daniel Lamport, Research Fellow at the University of Reading and Challenge data collection coordinator, comments: 'It is fantastic to see that the sugar swaps resulted in a reduction in sugar intake for these families. 'The University of Reading is delighted to support preventative health campaigns such as this which can help make a real difference to the health of the nation.' Earlier this year, the Government's own scientific advisers called for the target for added sugar to be reduced by half to 5 per cent of a person's daily intake. Excess sugar intake has become a key focus for health researchers and campaigners after it emerged that it causes at least as much damage as vices such as salt. Two-thirds of parents are worried about the amount of sugar in their children’s diets, while nearly half believe that their family consume too much sugar . A study last month claimed that sugar is likely to be a more significant factor in pushing up blood pressure than salt. But the findings were challenged by other experts who said a direct link between sugar and hypertension had not yet been proven. Sugar has nonetheless been identified as a key cause of obesity and associated diseases later in life such as heart problems, cancer and type two diabetes. It is also impacting dental health. Eating and drinking too much sugar means extra calories, which causes fat to build up inside the body. This can lead to heart disease, some cancers or type 2 diabetes later in life. Four sugar swaps recommended by Change4Life: . The breakfast swap: Swap sugary cereal for plain cereal, such as a wholewheat biscuit cereal . The drink swap: Swap from sugary drinks to sugar-free or no-added-sugar drinks . The after school swap: Swap, for example, a muffin to a fruited teacake . The pudding swap: Swap, for example, from ice cream to low-fat lower-sugar yoghurt . Children who are overweight or obese when they are young are far more likely to become overweight or obese adults. Recently published data highlights that approximately 1 in 5 children aged 4 to 5 years old and 1 in 3 children aged 10 to 11 years old is overweight or obese. Cathy Court, founder of Netmums said: 'We know that mums want to provide a healthy diet for their children but balancing a number of competing priorities, including healthy eating, can be tricky. 'This research with Netmums showed that sugar consumption is a worry for parents but taking steps to reduce sugar can be really difficult. 'We hope that these simple sugar swaps from Change4Life will make it easier for parents to reduce their family's sugar intake. The Change4Life campaign will feature media advertising as well as a national roadshow and the delivery of sugar swap packs to parents. Meanwhile, almost two-thirds of people do not know how many calories the average person needs to maintain a healthy weight, according to separate research commissioned by Diabetes UK, The British Heart Foundation and Tesco. A YouGov survey of 2,025 people, commissioned to mark the launch of a new partnership between the three organisations that aims to improve the health of the nation, found that just 35% of respondents knew the average man needs to consume 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight. Only slightly more, 37%, could pinpoint 2,000 calories as the equivalent for women.","Public Health Campaign offers 'sugar swap' tips for cakes, cereal and juice .

"A Gary Glitter fan has been condemned by child abuse campaigners for selling 2015 calendars signed by the paedophile singer. Claire Shephard, who is selling 45 of the 'limited edition' calendars on Facebook for £20 each, had five of them signed by the shamed rocker. Child protection groups have slammed the 'distasteful' memorabilia and warned the calendars could have a devastating impact on abuse survivors by triggering flashbacks. A Gary Glitter fan has been condemned by child abuse campaigners for producing 2015 calendars signed by the paedophile singer . Claire Shephard (left), who is selling 45 of the 'limited edition' calendars on Facebook for £20 each, had five of them signed by Glitter (right) Glitter - real name Paul Gadd - provided two exclusive photos of himself at home in his apartment for the 'through the years' calendars, which he is said to have described as 'brilliant'. In 1999, Glitter served half of a four-month sentence in Britain for possessing 4,000 child pornography images. He was jailed for three years in 2006, this time in Vietnam, for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11, but was released early. The paedophile returned to Britain in August 2008 after 19 other countries refused to let him in and his music has largely been banned by radio stations. Ms Shephard, the 50-year-old widow of Glitter Band guitarist, singer and composer Gerry Shephard, posted an advert on Facebook which said: 'GG Calendar 2015 It's Christmas!!! 'This is a limited edition run and only 45 are available. I know everyone was pleased with the one which was available two years ago so decided it was time for another.' Ms Shephard (pictured, right, with other Glitter fans) said her idol thought the calendars were 'brilliant' Five of the 45 2015 calendars were signed personally by Glitter, who was jailed in Vietnam for three years for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11 . After having the calendars made, Ms Shephard, from Coleford, Gloucestershire, added:  'I was so excited I could barely dare open the package! 'I have to admit it does look super. I am sure anyone who receives one will most definitely not be disappointed. 'I already have a list of you good folk who have already contacted me reserving one. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for sharing their uploaded photos (which has made this fabulous calendar possible), your continuing support of Gary and all of his related pages on Facebook (and those who work tirelessly at being the admin for them), your love and enthusiasm for the music he created and which we still enjoy just as much today as ever.' Earlier this week she revealed to other fans of the Glitter that the convicted paedophile had given the calendars his seal of approval. She wrote: 'I have managed to get five copies of the 2015 Calendar SIGNED!!! I should have them by the weekend. 'I was very pleased to hear that Gary thought the calendar was ""brilliant"".' Child protection groups warned simply seeing pictures of Glitter could be enough to trigger painful memories for abuse victims. Kidscape said any profits from the calendar should go to victims of sexual abuse. 'Exciting news': Ms Shephard posted an advert for the calendars on her Facebook page . Ms Shephard, the widow of Glitter Band guitarist, singer and composer Gerry Shephard, angered child abuse campaigners who said the calendar could bring back painful memories for victims . A spokesman said: 'Gary Glitter fans are of course entitled to their allegiances, but many people would question whether it is acceptable for a convicted sex offender to be enshrined in calendar form. 'Any profits from this merchandise should be directed to benefit victims of sexual abuse. 'Indeed the people behind this calendar should consider its potential impact on abuse victims. At the very least this product engenders distasteful associations.' John Bird, operations manager for National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the calendar was 'absolutely awful'. He said: 'The one thing we say is it is the truth that it important. 'When people present themselves in a rose-tinted way, it's one thing if they have been found guilty of some sort of tax fraud, but it is different for people who have sexually abused children. 'It doesn't matter what music career he ever had - it's completely irrelevant. 'If the photographs had ""child abuser"" written in big letters across them, I'd be happy. '[The calendar] could put someone who has been sexually abused in a flash back. For survivors of child sexual abuse that image could put them right back in that same emotional experience, reliving it.' Glitter is due to face 10 child sex charges involving three underage girls on January 12. The 70-year-old is currently on bail accused of the crimes in the 1970s and early 1980s and will appear at Southwark Crown Court.

"A court heard Joanne Mjadzelics - the ex-girlfriend of  Ian Watkins - discussed the singer's child abuse fantasies with him in a sex tape they made together . Paedophile  singer Ian Watkins made a sex tape with a girlfriend where they spoke of his fantasies of child abuse, a court heard today. Mother-of-one Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, allegedly discussed child abuse with Lostprophets singer Watkins  before he was jailed for 35 years for a series of sex offences. A court heard police  seized the rock star's computers and video tapes when he was arrested and discovered one titled 'Jo Paedo Talk Cardiff'. When they played the video they saw Watkins and Mjadzelics having sex and talking about having a baby together so they could abuse it, the court heard. Prosecutor Jim Davies read an extract of the 2008 video to a jury trying Mjadzelics for allegations of possessing indecent images and sharing them with Watkins. Mr Davies said: 'While they were having sex they were talking about him getting her pregnant so they could have a child to abuse.' Cardiff Crown Court heard the sickening tape was made nearly four years before Watkins was arrested for a string of child sex abuse offences. The jury was told police also discovered 'disgusting and abhorrent' online sex chats between Mjadzelics and Watkins, which had taken place three years after the video was made in May 2011. During the chats, indecent images of children were sent by Watkins to Mjadzelics - and she sent replies saying she wanted to 'play for real'. In the late-night messages, they also described the abuse they wanted to inflict on infants and animals. In one exchange, Mjadzelics told Watkins: 'Part of me feels you get off on showing me stuff you can get away with, knowing that is what I have wanted since forever.' Mjadzelics, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, told Watkins she thought they had a 'deep connection that couldn't be matched'. She signed off one message with the phrase: 'Child molesters till we die.' Watkins replied to her saying: 'I am really happy you now know it is not just talk. The sooner we can be together the better.' Scroll down for video . Mjadzelics was arrested as part of Operation Globe - a worldwide investigation into Watkins' vile paedophile activities. Mr Davies said there was no dispute from Mjadzelics that she was in possession of four indecent images of children, had sent an indecent image of a child and had twice encouraged Watkins to send her an image of child rape. Mjadzelics is said to have discussed Watkins' crimes with the singer (pictured) years before he was arrested . But a jury  heard she claimed she kept the images to trap Watkins and bring him to justice. Mr Davies said: 'The law provides a defence to these crimes if the person can show they had a legitimate reason for doing so. 'Joanne Mjadzelics says she did have a legitimate reason for possessing and distributing indecent images of children in an attempt to bring Ian Watkins to justice. 'We say that is not the case.' Mjadzelics claims she had abuse images on her computer so she could bring Watkins to justice . Mjadzelics denies four charges of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child. The 13 sex offences Watkins pleaded guilty to last November included the attempted rape of an 11-month old child. Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself. Originally, Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite damning video evidence. He changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him 'look guilty'. While awaiting sentencing last December, he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing was 'megalolz' during a telephone call to a friend. The trial of Mjadzelics continues.

"A disturbing photo of five unrestrained children squashed into the boot of a four wheel drive has led to the irresponsible culprit being slapped with a hefty fine and a massive loss of points. Tiana Kirkby, 18, was in the passenger seat of her boyfriend's car on Yawalpah Rd in Pimpama, Queensland on New Years Day when she saw the unbelievable sight of the youngsters jampacked into the back of the red Ford which had the boot door wide open. Completely flabbergasted at what she was witnessing, Tiana took a photo and posted the alarming image on her Facebook page with the one word comment: 'wuuuuut?' It then only took the police a day after seeing the photo to track down the 41-year-old New South Wales man who received $1932 in fines and lost three points for each unrestrained child. A man, 42, was fined $2,000 and lost 18 points after carrying five unrestrained children in the boot of his car . A man of his word - Chief Superintendent Des Lacy, of Queensland Police, had vowed that the offending driver would be caught and ensured that the person would be prosecuted after the fact with the photographic evidence. 'People don't realise that it might not be their driving but the driving of another vehicle that causes a collision and with that many people in the car with no seatbelts we would be looking at a fatality,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin. 'People think it won't happen to them or there is only a small distance to travel so it will be OK and nine times out of 10 it might be, but you only need one person to ignore a stop sign or look down and cross the centre line to have a collision.' Supt Lacy said a report was sent to NSW Police, where the car is registered, to determine who owned the vehicle. Tiana Kirkby (right) and her boyfriend Mitchell Johnson (left) saw the shocking stunt and Tiana posted it on her Facebook page which drew attention to the police who immediately acted . Tiana described the careless stunt as 'the most ridiculous thing' she had ever seen in her life. 'I've seen anything like that - you just don't see that anymore,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I couldn't see if there were more in the car without seat belts but there could have been - it's just so crazy and dangerous.' With plans to be a childcare worker, Tiana could not make sense of the careless situation. 'I have five nieces and nephews - I really care about kids,' she said. 'They looked between the ages of 12 and six - it's disturbing. 'I would hate to think that anything happened to them.' She said the kids were having fun in the back of the car with the boot wide open. 'They were laughing and looked like they were having a good time but they don't know the dangers,' she said. 'But the adult driver would know - it's completely wrong.'","Picture of five children squashed in the back of a car with no seat belts on .

"It was the scene of one of Prince Philip's most infamous gaffes. As he helped the Queen to open the new British Embassy in Berlin in 2000, the royal was memorably overheard describing the building as 'ghastly'. Now the Duke of Edinburgh is set to make a return to the city - and the embassy -  after Buckingham Palace announced that the prince  will travel with the Queen to Germany this summer. The tour, which will be the Queen's first to the country since 2004, follows an invitation from President Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident. On her travels: Buckingham Palace has announced that the Queen and Prince Philip will visit Germany . Visit: The Queen's last visit abroad was in June 2014 when she made a state visit to France . Remembrance: The visit was to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings on the 6th June 1944 . Mr Gauck and his partner, Daniela Schadt, were the guests of the Queen and Duke at a lunch at Buckingham Palace in November 2012. Buckingham Palace said in a short statement: 'The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from 24 to 26 June. 'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck.' The tour will be the first international visit undertaken by the 88-year-old monarch since the state visit to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings last year. Meeting: The Queen was invited by President Gauck (left) but is likely to meet with Chancellor Merkel as well . Regular visitor: The Queen, who last travelled to Germany in 2004, has made several visits to the country . Warm welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip wave to well-wishers in Potsdam during their 1992 visit . Partition: The Queen also visited during the Cold War in 1978, at the request of then President Walter Scheel . First trip: The Queen travelled to West Germany 10 years after the end of WW2. She is seen here in Stuttgart . During that trip, the Queen took part in a ceremony at Sword Beach, the scene of 683 British deaths, alongside David Cameron, Germany's Chancellor Merkel and President Obama. She also took the opportunity to reiterate her admiration for the men who fought during the Normandy campaign during a speech at the Élysée Palace, telling France's President Hollande: . ‘The true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them last. Each year has compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War. 'Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 700 years as they do after 70.' Her Majesty has remained in the UK since returning from that visit, although the Duke of Edinburgh has made several trips to the Athlone Barracks in the German village of Sennelager near Paderborn. Regular visitor: The Duke of Edinburgh regularly visits the Athlone Barracks and the Queen's Royal Hussars . Colonel-in-chief: He last visited the regiment in November and handed out Afghanistan campaign medals . Meeting: Angela Merkel is likely to meet the royal couple and last met the Queen in February 2014 in London . His most recent trip was in November, when he welcomed home members of the Queen's Royal Hussars, who were among the last soldiers to leave Afghanistan. Prince Philip is the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief and regularly visits the men, as well as handing out combat medals to veterans. While it is not known whether a visit to the Barracks will be included in the itinerary for June's tour, a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel is almost certain. The 60-year-old politician has met the Queen several times, most recently during a state visit to Britain that she made in February 2014. Welcomed by the monarch to Buckingham Palace, the German premier offered Her Majesty an awkward handshake in front of the cameras before being whisked away for a private afternoon tea.","The Queen and Prince Philip will travel to Germany in June .

"Bill Cosby cost his TV daughter her chance at winning Celebrity Apprentice, but not because of the current rape scandal. Actress Keshia Knight Pulliam, best known for playing the comedian's daughter Rudy on The Cosby Show, was fired by Donald Trump for not hitting her TV dad up for a bake sale donation. In the last few months, more than two dozen women have come forward to accuse Cosby of rape - but Sunday night's episode was shot more than a year before. Nevertheless, the conversation surrounding Cosby in the boardroom caused a few minutes of awkward television - as Trump called Cosby a 'tremendous guy' and a 'gentleman'. Scroll down for video . You're fired: Donald Trump (right) fired former Cosby Show actress Keshia Knight Pulliam (left) in Sunday night's episode of the Celebrity Apprentice,  for not calling her TV dad for a donation. The episode was shot a year ago, before scores of women came forward to accuse Bill Cosby of rape and sexual assault. TV dad: Pulliam is best known for playing Rudy Huxtable on Cosby's long-running sitcom The Cosby Show. A young Pulliam pictured sitting on Cosby lap, bottom left . Pulliam was named her team's project manager for the episode, and was put on the chopping block when they came up short in fundraising. In the boardroom, Pulliam's teammates (including Kate Gosselin, Shawn Johnson and Vivica A Fox) turned on her and blamed her for not calling up Cosby in front of judge Trump, his daughter Ivanka and guest judge Piers Morgan (Daily Mail Online's Editor-at-Large and the 2008 Celebrity Apprentice champion). 'Did you call Bill?' Trump asked a tearful Pulliam in the tense meeting. 'I did not. I have not talked to Bill Cosby on the phone in I don't know how long,' Pulliam explained. 'So for me to pick up the phone, having not talked to you for five years, except for when we run into each other for a Cosby event - I feel that's not my place to do.' Trump disagrees, saying a big donation to the sale would have been nothing for a 'tremendous guy' like Cosby with a 'tremendous amount of money' - enough to win the task with one phone call. He told Keshia: 'You are an amazing person, but you were the project manager. You didn't make one call that I really believe that if you'd called that gentleman he would have helped you, even if you hadn't spoken to him in years. 'You were an amazing team with one of the most successful shows ever, so I think it would have been a good call to make for charity. You have to take responsibility.' Blame game: Pulliam's (left) teammates (including Kate Gosselin, second left; Vivica A Fox, second right; and Shawn Johnson, right) threw her under the bus in the boardroom for not trying to solicit money from Cosby in the fundraiser, in which they came up short . Who to fire? Guest judge Piers Morgan (Daily Mail Online's Editor-at-Large and a former champion of the reality show, left) and Trump's daughter Ivanka (right) also weighed in on the decision of who to fire . With that, Trump made his signature hand move and sent Pulliam packing. He did, however, make a  $25,000 donation to her charity from his own pocket. His advisor Piers Morgan said he had made the right decision. He said: 'You go head to head with Geraldo and you only bring in $8000 yourself? Suicide.' Keshia, however, disagreed, saying: 'To send me home for a fundraising task where the other two people raised zero dollars is kind of crazy to me.' TV blog Vulture, which recapped the episode, pointed out how strange it was that the scene wasn't edited to remove the praise of Cosby, even though Trump and everyone else in the boardroom were clearly unaware of the scandal when the episode was shot. Immediately after the show's premiere episode aired, Trump was quick to point out that it had been filmed before any women came forward with rape allegations against Cosby. 'This show was taped just before the terrible Bill Cosby revelations came to light. She still should have asked him for money – goes to charity,' he tweeted. Scandal: In the past few months, more than two dozen woman have come forward to accuse Cosby (right) of rape. These accusations have tarnished the comedian's once-revered reputation as 'America's dad'. Pictured above in a still from The Cosby Show, featuring Pullia . Since the first episode of the Celebrity Apprentice was filmed, more than 15 women have come forward claiming to have been drugged, sexually assaulted or both by Cosby. He has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations, most of which date back to the 1970s. Sunday night's premiere episode of the Celebrity Apprentice saw a battle of the sexes as the all female team 'Infinity' took on the all male team 'Vortex'. With Keshia leading the women as project manager and journalist Geraldo Rivera stepping up to manage the men, the teams had the task of selling pies to raise money for charity. While the women opted to make an enchilada pie and a blackberry and pear pie, the men crafted a chocolate and vanilla pie alongside a low calorie chicken potpie. Singer Kevin Jonas, actor Lorenzo Lamas and Deadliest Catch star Sig Hansen slaved away in the kitchen creating team Vortex's products, but got off to a problematic star when Sig accidentally burned the crusts. While tensions rose between Kevin and Geraldo, the men had dozens of contacts coming to their pie shop with huge donations. Kevin's social media popularity also saw their store swarming with Jonas Brothers fans. After the episode aired Trump too to Twitter to clarify that it had been filmed before the allegations against Crosby had 'come to light' The men had dozens of contacts coming to their pie shop with huge donations. Kevin Jonas' social media popularity also saw their store swarming with Jonas Brothers fans . While baseball champ Johnny Damon and NFL star Terrell Owens encouraged people to visit the shop, comedian Gilbert Gottfried organized some outside entertainment and actor Ian Ziering worked behind the counter. In the women's shop, Olympic snowboarder Jamie Anderson and reality TV star Kate Gosselin were in charge of cooking the pies, while their fellow contestants Vivica A. Fox, Shawn Johnson, Brandi Glanville, Kenya Moore and Leeza Gibbons tried to raise money and increase publicity on social media. Keshia, who was hoping to win the task and raise money for her charity Kamp Kizzy, said: 'From the days on The Cosby Show and having that great example with Mr. Cosby, the importance of philanthropy and giving back to others has been a part of my life for forever.' Real Housewife of Atlanta Kenya, however, was critical of her project manager when she learned she had not called her former on-screen father to ask for a donation. She said: 'Keshia was a Cosby kid. She was on one of the number one shows of all time and the first person she should be calling is Bill Cosby. I know he has deep pockets.' She added: 'Your TV dad is accessible to you and you don't call him up for a donation? That's crazy.' Trump, Barron Trump and Melania Trump attend the Trump Invitational Grand Prix Mar-a-Lago Club at The Mar-a-Largo Club yesterday . In the boardroom it was revealed that while team Infinity had raised $93,862 – including a $25,000 bonus for having the best-tasting pie, team Vortex had raised a staggering $185,322. Winning project manager Geraldo took home $280,000 for his charity Life's Work. Threatened with the sack, the girls quickly turned on one another. Kate came under fire for raising no money at all and was called 'lazy' by Brandi. 'She stood around talking while we all did every job that we could,' the housewife said. Kenya, meanwhile, was critical of Keshia, saying. 'If I was Rudy Huxtable and I was TV's favourite daughter, I would have called my TV dad for a contribution.' There were tears as Vivica said she was 'proud' of her project manager, but Keshia fought back emotion and brought Kate and Jamie back into the boardroom. Despite Jamie and Kate having raised no money between them, it was Keshia who got the boot for failing to call Cosby.","Keshia Knight Pulliam was the first star to be sacked on this season of Celebrity Apprentice .

"A model whose bottom came second in Brazil's Miss BumBum beauty contest has revealed the terrible harm plastic surgery wreaked on her body. Andressa Urach, 27, spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg after fillers 'rotted' her muscles and had to be removed, triggering a life-threatening infection. These photos show the shocking extent of the damage to one of the most controversial TV presenters in Brazil - a nation which has overtaken the U.S. to become the cosmetic surgery capital of the world. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Terrible toll: Brazilian TV presenter Andressa Urach, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . Taped up: The presenter spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . Miss Urach, who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, has reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. Damage: The sobering, graphic photos show gaping holes in Miss Urach's thighs, all in the name of beauty . The 27-year-old suffered from septic shock after wounds from a procedure last July became infected . As Miss Urach lay in hospital, her mother Marisete De Favari asked her 220,000 Twitter followers to pray . 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. Her mother Marisete De Favari logged in to her Twitter account, asking the model's 220,000 followers to pray for her as she remained on the ward in a serious state. 'I would ask for prayers from friends and people who wish for the recovery of my daughter,' she wrote on December 10. 'She's starting to walk, put her foot down and sit. After all this time lying down, she expected it would be painful. She has been taking morphine since entering the hospital, but now they are taking the drugs away from her gradually. The model wrote on December 26: 'My loves, thank you for the affection and chains of prayers' Slow going: The recovery from sepsis acts as a warning to the millions of Brazilians having plastic surgery . 'As she had sepsis, healing will be slow, because it has to happen in a natural way so that it is not subject to a new infection. 'This takes time and she is assisted by doctors all the time. She has had no contact with anyone but the doctors and her mother.' The model added on December 26: 'My loves, thank you for the affection and chains of prayers. God is great and is taking care of me.' Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Miss Urach featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"BBC political editor Nick Robinson has attacked Russell Brand for urging the public not to vote in the general election. He said he had ‘a beef’ with the comedian and was an ‘unapologetic believer in elections’ after his German Jewish grandparents had to flee both the Nazis and then the Communists in China. Brand was also dismissed by Ed Balls yesterday as a ‘pound shop Ben Elton’ after the self-styled revolutionary called the Shadow Chancellor ‘clicky-wristed’ and a ‘snidey ****’. Critique: BBC political editor Nick Robinson says he has 'beef' with Russell Brand over his campaign urging the public not to vote in the general election . Robinson, 51, told Radio Times he had some things he wanted to get off his chest ‘at the beginning of a year that will determine not just who governs Britain but the future of the country itself’. He insisted that politicians are not all the same and are not all in it for themselves, and ‘it does make a difference whether you vote or not and who you vote for’. He went on: ‘Are you listening, Russell Brand, and admirers of the man with the most manicured chest in Britain? ‘You see I’ve got a bit of a beef with Brand. More than anyone I can remember in recent times he has energised, excited and enthused people about some of the great issues of our time. ‘And yet Brand continues to tell people that all politics and all politicians are corrupt or venal or a waste of time. Make up your mind! Russell Brand says he only discourages voting because there is no one good enough to vote for, but has previously written that he discourages voting altogether . ‘These days he pretends that he’s only ever argued that there’s no one worth voting for, but not very long ago he wrote in the New Statesman – “I will never vote and I don’t think you should, either”.’ Brand’s recent book Revolution encouraged people not to vote in order to bring about a collapse in government. He has discussed his views on Newsnight and had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on Question Time. Brand, 39, who has a fortune of around £9million, has been labelled a champagne socialist after leaving an anti-capitalist protest to attend a glitzy West End party. He also campaigned for more low-cost housing, despite living in a rented £2million home owned by a firm based in a tax haven. Nice chest: Russel Brand, who has been labelled a 'champagne socialist' had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on Question Time . Robinson said he had asked Brand for an interview, ‘but as he posed for a few selfies I was told he was too busy’. He added that it was his job to be impartial when reporting for the BBC, but ‘I am not required to be impartial between democracy and the alternatives. If Auntie ever asked me to be I’d refuse. ‘My German Jewish grandparents were forced to flee the Nazis and then, later, the Communists who took over China, the place they’d sought refuge. In this election year I am an unapologetic believer in elections’. Brand, who last month called Nigel Farage a ‘pound shop Enoch Powell’, turned his sights on Ed Balls at the weekend, saying on Channel 4’s Big Fat Quiz of the Year: ‘I shook his hand once. All clicky-wristed, he was a snidey ****.’ The Shadow Chancellor told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis: ‘I’m not quite sure what clicky-wristed means. I don’t know whether that’s supposed to be offensive or funny or whatever.’ He added: ‘He’s quite funny sometimes. I think probably Jo Brand is a rather better political commentator. I suppose you could call him a pound shop Ben Elton.’","BBC political editor Nick Robinson criticises comedian Russell Brand .

"A high-profile civil rights lawyer and ally of Al Sharpton has been told he will not face criminal charges after a woman accused him of rape last year. A 42-year-old executive from the National Action Network claimed Sanford Rubenstein attacked her in his New York penthouse apartment following Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party in October. The woman said she was drugged with cookies laced with marijuana before she was raped. But the Manhattan district attorney's office have said Rubenstein's case will not be sent to the Grand Jury following a three-month investigation because of a lack of compelling evidence. The 70-year-old was set to represent the family of Eric Garner after he died in a chokehold at the hands of police officers in Staten Island in July. However he removed himself from the case when the allegations surfaced. In the clear: Sanford Rubenstein, a top civil rights lawyer, has been told he will not face charges after a woman accused him of raping her in his New York apartment last October . Supporter: The ally of Al Sharpton (center) has continuously denied any wrongdoing during the investigation. His attorney said he is pleased the 'outrageous lie has been put to rest.' (Rubenstein pictured second left) Rubenstein told the New York Daily News he was 'very pleased' with the decision and excited to get back to work. In a statement he said: 'I maintained from the very beginning that I did not violate the law. I am pleased that the system worked and that I have now been fully cleared.' 'I look forward to many more years of practicing law and representing victims.' Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, released a statement Monday saying: 'Over the past three months, the District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit has conducted a thorough investigation into the incident that occurred on October 2 and was reported to authorities approximately 36 hours later. 'In keeping with standard procedure, prosecutors and investigators with decades of experience in such matters reviewed all aspects of the incident, including video surveillance, physical evidence, and medical records, and conducted extensive witness and expert interviews. 'The video evidence in this case included surveillance footage from before and after the incident, taken from the lobby and elevator of the suspect's apartment building, as well as from earlier in the evening at the Four Seasons restaurant. 'The investigation also included the collection and testing of multiple items of physical evidence, many pursuant to a search warrant executed at the suspect's apartment, as well as electronic devices and telephone records. 'A review of medical records was conducted by an independent medical expert. Experts at the National Institutes of Health and the FBI were also consulted. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner conducted toxicology and forensic testing, and further testing was performed at a second independent laboratory. Allegations: Rubenstein maintained the encounter following Sharpton's 60th birthday was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . 'In all, 48 individuals were interviewed over the course of the investigation, including the complainant, the suspect, the complainant's friend who accompanied her to the suspect's apartment, Four Seasons employees, employees of the building where the incident occurred, drivers, and event guests. 'Given the available evidence, the degree of the complainant's recollection of what occurred at the suspect's apartment and the results of toxicological testing, neither the provable facts nor the applicable law support a prosecution in this matter.' Ben Brafman, attorney for Sanford Rubenstein, said: 'Today I was informed that after a very thorough investigation, the District Attorney of New York County has decided that there would be no criminal charges filed against Mr Rubenstein in connection with a claim of Rape, which Mr Rubenstein has always vigorously denied. 'Mr Rubenstein has maintained from the very outset that the woman in question was not drunk, she was not drugged, and she was not raped. Rape is undoubtedly a serious offense. To 'falsely' accuse someone of rape is however equally offensive. 'We are obviously pleased that this investigation is over and this outrageous lie has been put to rest.' After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7 million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'. Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Investigation: NYPD officers were seen taking 'biological evidence' away from Rubenstein's luxury penthouse in brown bags after the allegations surfaced last November. They included a mattress, bedding and a sex toy .","Sanford Rubenstein, 70 was accused of attacking the woman last October .

"A female DJ was left with facial injuries after she was dragged to the floor and kicked repeatedly in the face at a nightclub. Nakia Oliver was out with her sister and cousins at Avici White in Deansgate in Manchester on New Year's Day when she was attacked on the dancefloor. Miss Oliver was left with a suspected broken nose and cuts and swelling to her face after the attack and claims she was repeatedly kicked as she lay unconscious. Nakia Oliver, 23, was left with a suspected broken nose after she was knocked unconscious and repeatedly kicked as she lay on the floor of a nightclub in Deansgate in Manchester. Left, Miss Oliver before the attack . She said she believes she could have been killed in the attack and nobody from the club came to help her. The 23-year-old said the trouble started when she 'brushed past' a woman with her bag to go for a dance and the woman shoved her. Her cousin tried to intervene and was punched in the face. Miss Oliver, of Whalley Range,  claims she stepped in to protect her and she too was hit. Miss Oliver claims she could have been killed after the attack at the club in the early hours of January 2 . She claims a man who was with the woman then dragged her to the floor, knocking her out, then continued to attack her as she lay unconscious. 'I've been told he was really laying into me. I remember being kicked but that's all I remember,' Miss Oliver, pictured, said that she is scared to go out and do another gig after the attack . 'It's the lowest of the low. It could have been a lot worse, I could have been killed.' Miss Oliver claims there were no bouncers in sight and nobody from the club came to her aid except a promoter who had booked her to DJ in the courtyard that night, before the outdoor sets were called off due to the weather. 'My sister helped me outside and we were just left on our own,' she said. 'I was crying hysterically, shocked and angry. I just didn't understand. No one really seemed to care. Because I've worked for them I thought at least someone should have helped me or protected me. 'It's left me quite anxious and it's made me scared to go out and do another gig. I'll never set foot in that club again.' The attack took place between 4am and 4.30am on January 2. Her attacker is described only as a black male, in his early 20s, who was wearing a dark-coloured body warmer and a beanie hat. The woman who pushed her is described as mixed race or black, with medium length, ginger-coloured straight hair. Police confirmed they were called to reports of an assault at the club at 4.35am and said enquiries were ongoing. Club manager Richard Stevens refuted Nakia's claims against the venue and said door staff did as much as they could to help her. He told Manchester Evening News: 'There were five door staff there and they were at the incident as soon as it happened and I personally came out of the office to see to the girl with the bust nose.' Mr Stevens said they turned the music off and shut the venue immediately after the attack because they could not identify the perpetrator.

Despite the warmer weather this week, Friday  will bring a spell of wet and windy weather thanks to a low pressure system moving in across the country. It will bring gusts of up to 70mph in some parts. Pictured: Sheep grazing in a frosty field at Woodhead in the Derbyshire Peak District . Britain will experience fairly mild conditions this week, with temperatures considerably higher than last week. The mercury will reach 10C to 11C in most parts of southern England today.

As millions of commuters headed back to work today following the Christmas break, they were greeted with dark, foggy conditions in many parts of the UK. Forecasters said today will remain fairly dry but overcast. Pictured: Fog on the M42, just south of Birmingham, this morning . There were delays on the M27 near Southampton this morning as millions of commuters headed back to work after the festive break . This graph, by the Met Office, showing the average recorded temperatures in the UK since 1850 shows how 2014 was the warmest on record . The 2014 record means that eight of the UK's top ten warmest years have happened since 2002. Despite the record-breaking conditions, no individual months through the year saw records for temperature - instead each month was consistently warm, with only August seeing below-average temperatures. As well as beating the warmest year record, the Met Office also confirmed that 2014 became the fourth wettest year ever to be recorded. The provisional rainfall total of 1297.1mm became the fourth highest total on record for the UK dating back to 1910, meaning five of the UK's top six wettest years have happened since 2000. A large contribution to the high annual rainfall total came from very wet weather in January and February. May, October and November were also wetter than average and August was especially wet across Northern Scotland. Most other months were drier than average in most areas, and September was the driest in the series from 1910 for the UK. While 2015 has remained largely dry so far, forecasters predict wet and windy conditions will set in towards the end of the week thanks to a low pressure system moving in across the country. Despite the warmer conditions this week – which will see temperatures more than double the January average of 6.4C – the end of the week will bring a spell of stormy weather. A low pressure system moving across Britain early Friday will bring gale-force winds of up to 70mph in some parts of northern Scotland, and up to 50mph across the rest of the UK. Londoners faced dry but cloudy and overcast conditions as they made their way back to work today after the Christmas and New Year break . Temperatures are set to reach 11C in some parts today, 12C tomorrow and soar to 14C by the end of the week, making it considerably mild . A low pressure system moving across Britain early Friday will bring gale-force winds of up to 70mph in some parts of northern Scotland, and up to 50mph across the rest of the UK. Pictured: Commuters were seen in their droves crossing London Bridge on the way to work early today . Lindsey Smyth took this photograph of a deer with its tongue our at Loch Quoich near Lochaber, Scotland. She said: 'My sister and I were driving around and suddenly came across this one. We like to try and get pictures of nature but we haven't seen anything like this before' Forecasters said there will be some 'quite strong gusts of wind particularly in northern parts' but added that all parts of Britain will see high winds. Laura Young, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'It's not going to be pleasant and most parts will see showery, wet and windy weather.' She said the far north of Scotland could see winds in excess of 70mph, and perhaps stronger in Shetland, while much of the UK will see winds of between 40mph and 50mph in coastal areas. The winds on Friday will come as a result of a low pressure system brought by a 200knot jet stream which is heading for the UK. However, before the stormy weather sets in, Britain will experience fairly mild conditions, with temperatures considerably higher than last week. The mercury will reach between 10C and 11C in most parts of southern England today, and 7C to 8C in northern regions. The national average temperature for January is 6.4C . It will be even warmer on Tuesday, with temperatures reaching 12C widely, before it dips overnight to lows of just 1C to 2C. A woman walks her dog as the beautiful first light of dawn reflects off wet sand around the Victorian pier at Saltburn-by-the-Sea in Cleveland . A man stands on the Victorian pier at Saltburn and watches the dawn break as forecasters predict temperatures of up to 14C this week . Despite the milder temperatures across much of the UK, a group of red deer could be seen in heavy snow at the Cairngorms National Park . The stags could be seen in the snow-covered pine forest of Cairngorms National Park. Temperatures in Scotland are set to reach 7-8C today, which is above the national January average of 6.4C for the UK.  Forecasters said the mild conditions will remain for the rest of the week . Miss Young said the sudden drop in temperature on Tuesday night could cause fog and frost on Wednesday morning. She said Wednesday would see temperatures return to double figures, with warmer air from the Atlantic moving across the country. By Friday and Saturday temperatures are expected to reach up to 14C in some places, with overnight temperatures of 10C to 11C, she said. It means Britain will be hotter than Spain, Turkey, Malta, Majorca and Morocco. Miss Young added: 'It's a really mixed week, it gradually gets warmer as the week goes on. It will be very, very mild. 'It might come as a bit of shock to most people considering how cold it has been.' Last week, temperatures plummeted to -4C in some parts of the country and daytime temperatures averaged at just 2C. Heavy traffic and congestion built-up on the M27 near Southampton early today . Commuters face rush-hour delays and rail replacement buses as they head back to work after the Christmas break today. Train passengers on Cross Country and First Great Western services were warned to expect an over-run on planned engineering work between Weston-super-Mare and Bristol Temple Meads this morning, with buses replacing trains and journey times extended by up to 60 minutes. A Network Rail spokesman said there was expected to be an over-run of 60-90 minutes which would affect one or two trains, which would be replaced by buses. 'It is an inconvenience but people will still be able to make their journey,' he said. He said Taunton to London services would not be affected. There were other problems for rush-hour train travellers this morning. A signalling problem at Merstham in Surrey prevented trains towards London from stopping at Redhill, Merstham or Coulsdon South. This affected passengers travelling on Southern and Thameslink services. Another signalling problem, near Eaglescliffe in County Durham, meant buses had to replace trains between Middlesbrough and Darlington stations during the morning peak. A broken-down train at Harrow & Wealdstone in north west London led to delays between London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire. As many roads were hit by fog, huge queues built up on the M25 where there were two big rush-hour crashes. One led to jams on the clockwise section in Surrey, between J6 for the A22 at Godstone and J8 for the A217 at Reigate. And in Hertfordshire, the anti-clockwise stretch was blocked by a crash between J24, linking the A111 at Potters Bar, and J25, the A10 junction at . Enfield. Meanwhile the AA warned that today is expected to be one of the busiest of the year for car breakdowns, with people using their cars after a restful period over Christmas. The motoring organisation expects to attend to around 19,000 call-outs, 30 per cent more than on a normal Monday. An AA/Populus survey of 16,165 AA members found that a third will have had at least one car standing unused throughout the festive period that will be relied on today. AA members in south east England (36 per cent) are most likely to be in this situation, compared with only 28 per cent in north east England and 19 per cent in London. AA patrolman of the year Mark Spowage said 'The first working day back in January is traditionally the busiest day of the year for breakdowns with flat batteries the main culprit. 'The issue is that many cars get left unused for up to a fortnight in often cold conditions, which causes the power output of the battery to drop.' But there was some good news. A planned 24-hour bus strike scheduled to take place in London today was called off. The walkout over pay and working conditions would have affected more than 20 routes, including the 58 bus from Walthamstow to East Ham, the 308 from Wanstead to Clapton, the 339 from Leytonstone and the W14 from Leyton to Woodford Bridge. Staff employed by company Tower Transit and the Unite union have instead agreed to meet at the conciliation service Acas to discuss pay. Bus drivers voted in favour of industrial action on December 18 with the second strike planned for today. Unite claims drivers have been offered a pay rise of 2.35 per cent pay rise, 0.15 per cent lower than other bus drivers. The first 24-hour strike on December 29th affected 13 routes and caused 'moderate disruption', according to TfL.","Temperatures set to soar to 11C today, 12C tomorrow and up to 14C by Friday - making Britain hotter than Morocco .

"A Wisconsin judge says the actor who played Screech on the 1990s TV series 'Saved by the Bell' must stand trial in a Christmas Day stabbing. Dustin Diamond, 37, is charged with reckless endangerment and two other counts in the fight at a bar near Milwaukee. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy heard a police officer's testimony Monday before saying there is enough evidence for the case against Diamond to continue. Dustin Diamond, aka Screech from 'Saved by the Bell,' must stand trial over a Christmas Day bar stabbing in his small Wisconsin hometown, a judge ruled . Diamond is free on bail while he awaits trial on the December 26 reckless endangerment, possession of a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct charges . Diamond is known playing nerdy Samuel 'Screech' Powers during the 1990s hit 'Saved by the Bell.' He stayed with the show, and its spin offs, from 1988 until 2000 . The officer clarified earlier reports and said that Diamond had a pocket knife - and not  a switch-blade, as the arresting documents initially stated. A criminal complaint says Diamond and his fiancee got into a tussle with two men and a woman at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington. Diamond lives in the small community 30 miles north of Milwaukee. Diamond told police he accidentally stabbed one of the men while trying to defend his fiancee. The man was not seriously injured. Police say surveillance video from the Grand Ave. Saloon shows Diamond swing the knife after he was shoved by another bar patron. Diamond claims he was defending his fiancee Amanda Schutz when and that he didn't mean to stab anyone . The victim said he did not realize he had been stabbed until he saw blood on his shirt. He was treated for the minor puncture wound and is recovering. Diamond is known for playing Samuel 'Screech' Powers, from 1988 until 2000 on four 'Saved by the Bell' shows. Since then, he starred in a porn video and has had minor success on the reality TV circuit. Diamond's lawyer requested that he be allowed to travel to speaking and acting engagements across the country - and possibly around the world - while he remains free on bail awaiting his trial. The judge agreed to the first request - and said Diamond would have to seek permission before leaving the country.","A judge ruled there is enough evidence to pursue charges against Dustin Diamond .

"A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday. The young North Korean soldier crossed the border in late December and stole money and food at a house before killing four residents in China's northeastern city of Helong, South Korea's Yonhap news agency and Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said. Both cited sources in the border areas between China and the North. Scroll down for video . A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday . The victims were either shot dead or beaten to death, Dong-A said, adding he was later shot and captured by Chinese authorities. 'Killing several Chinese nationals... is a major crime, so there are good possibilities that China, unlike other runaway North Korean soldiers captured before, will not hand him over to the North,' said an unnamed Seoul official quoted by Yonhap. All able-bodied young men in the North are subject to 10 years of military service. Many army bases are known to suffer food shortage and starving troops often cross the border to China in search of food. Private markets cropping up across the North in recent years have helped ease starvation among ordinary citizens. Seoul's unification ministry that handles North Korea affairs declined to comment on the incident. 'Chinese authorities have already reached an agreement with the North not to officially announce it,' Yonhap quoted the Seoul official as saying. Dong-A said the victims were two elderly ethnic Korean couples.Koreans make up for about 30 per cent of the population in China's Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture that borders the North. 'It has become pretty common for the past decade that North Koren soldiers sneak across the border at night to seek food here,' Dong-A quoted one resident of the area as saying. An official with the Yanbian police told AFP he had no knowledge of the reported incident. The border with China is a major route for escape for North Koreans fleeing poverty and repression at home. They also cross the border temporarily to find food and jobs. Thousands flee by secretly crossing into China and later travelling to a third country before seeking resettlement in the South.","A North Korean believed to be a runaway soldier killed four Chinese citizens during a robbery after he crossed the border into China in search of food, media reports said Monday .

"The White House refused on Monday to formally call on House Republicans to throw their No. 3 in command, Steve Scalise, out of House leadership but repeatedly claimed it 'says a lot' about the GOP that they would allow the Louisiana lawmaker to remain front and center. 'Who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. Twice he referenced a comment Scalise reportedly make nearly 20 years about being 'David Duke without the baggage.' Duke is a former KKK leader and and heads the white supremacist group that Scalise says he inadvertently spoke to a decade ago. Scroll down for video . Draw your own conclusions: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that the controversy surrounding Louisiana lawmaker Steve Scalise 'says a lot' about the GOP but he wouldn't tell them what he meant by that . Republican leaders had hoped that the controversy surrounding Scalise, who since apologized for speaking to Duke's organization, EURO, in 2002 and has condemned it as a hate group, would dissipate over the holiday break. House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor came to Scalise's defense last month as the conflict took shape, giving him the full weight of their support. Incoming Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first black female to represent Republicans in Congress, said Sunday that she had no issues with Scalise. 'I believe he should remain in leadership,' Love said on ABC News' Sunday morning program This Week. 'There's one quality that he has that I think is very important in leadership, and that's humility. And he's actually shown that in this case. 'And he's apologized, and I think that we need to move on and get the work of the American people done,' she added. Louisiana's sole Democratic representative, Cedric Richmond, who is also black, has also backed Scalise. 'I don't think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,' Richmond told New Orleans publication The Times-Picayune. But as members returned to Washington on Monday and Republicans prepared to take control of both chambers of Congress or the first time in eight years, the dust had yet to settle. The scandal bled into its second week on Monday, with high-profile Democrats doubling down on their denunciations of Scalise. 'As the new Congress begins, nothing discredits Republican claims of outreach and bringing people together more than their decision to keep Steve Scalise at the top tier of the elected leadership of their caucus,' Democratic National Committee Chair and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Continuing, Wasserman Schultz said, 'Anyone living in this century should have known better than to attend and speak at a white supremacist event, particularly one founded and led by David Duke, and Scalise’s explanation that he wasn’t aware isn’t credible by a long shot. 'But when House Republicans stand by him years later, and GOP White House hopefuls defend or refuse to speak out, they legitimize his actions,' she charged, calling on all potential Republican presidential candidates to 'publicly condemn Scalise.' I am not a racist: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise says he didn't realize that he was speaking to a white supremacist group when he gave the 2002 speech at the center of a scandal plaguing both him and the Republican Party. But the Democratic National Committee said on Monday that 'anyone living in this century should have known better' Attacking newly elected New York Rep. Lee Zeldin for his assertion Sunday that the ongoing coverage of the Scalise speech is the fault of the 'mainstream media who look for any opportunity to try to tear down Republicans to help back up the President of the United States and the Democrats in Congress,' the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Monday called his decision to advocate for Scalise 'mind-blowing.' 'Scalise’s ally David Duke has attacked “Zionists” as responsible for this negative story and the Anti-Defamation League says Duke is anti-semetic and that Scalise had legitimized Duke’s views by speaking there,' the DCCC said in a statement. The DCCC's Jesse Ferguson said Zeldin 'chose to relentlessly defend his leader who trolls for votes at anti-Semitic white supremacist rallies.' The White House took a less aggressive approach at criticizing Scalise on Monday when responding to questions from reporters. 'There is no arguing that who Republicans decide to elevate into a leadership position says a lot about what the conference's priorities and values are,' Earnest said in his first briefing of the New Year. 'We've heard a lot from Republicans particularly over the last few years, including the chairman of the Republican Party, about how Republicans need to broaden their appeal to young people and to women, to gays and to minorities, that the success of their party will depend on their ability to broaden that outreach,' he added. 'So it ultimately will be up to individual Republicans in Congress to decide whether or not elevating Mr. Scalise into leadership will effectively reinforce that strategy.' Earnest would not explain what he meant when he stated numerous times that the Scalise episode 'says a lot' about the GOP, however, leaving reporters to draw their own conclusions.","'Who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be,'  Press Secretary Josh Earnest said .

"‘The pain was like a constant burning sensation,' said Steuart Robson of his left leg . After years of worsening pain in his left leg, 63-year-old Steuart Robson was facing the last resort: amputation. He was on the verge of becoming one of the thousands of people who have a limb amputated every year due to ‘diabetic foot’. The condition, which results in 100 foot amputations every week in the UK, occurs when blood vessels in the lower limbs are so badly clogged up and damaged that the feet are starved of blood. This can lead to infection and even gangrene, where loss of blood supply causes tissue to die. Steuart first experienced pain in his left leg in 1994, after being diagnosed aged 23 with type 1 diabetes. With type 1 diabetes, the body doesn’t produce insulin, the hormone that mops up glucose from the bloodstream (type 2 is where patients don’t produce sufficient insulin). As Steuart’s condition deteriorated, walking became a struggle and eventually he needed a wheelchair. Then, in 2006, a 3cm-wide weeping ulcer appeared on his left shin. Doctors tried treating it with antibiotics but it wouldn’t heal. By late 2009, with blood supply to his lower leg practically non-existent, Steuart’s doctors thought amputation was his only option. ‘The pain was like a constant burning sensation,’ says Steuart, from Addlestone, Surrey, a father-of-three who is a warranty administrator with a car dealership. ‘I was on morphine-based painkillers to help try to numb it, but they were not strong enough. I would have said “yes” to amputation right there and then to stop the pain,’ he adds. Diabetes can lead to a particularly aggressive form of atherosclerosis, the condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances. High levels of glucose damage the lining of the blood vessels, as well as increasing the build-up of fatty deposits. In diabetes, the smaller blood vessels below the knee and in the foot are particularly prone to this. As a result they narrow, becoming blocked and preventing blood — and oxygen — reaching the lower legs. The nerves are also damaged. As these help control blood flow, this can worsen symptoms. And because these nerves also convey sensation, the feet can become numb. Poor circulation can also lead to the skin on the feet becoming dry and breaking easily. All of this means that the tiniest bump, or something as innocuous as a shoe rubbing against the skin, can cause a small cut, which can develop into an ulcer. The nerve damage and lack of sensation means patients often don’t know they have an ulcer until it has become established. Poor blood flow exacerbates the problem — the lack of oxygen and molecules crucial for repair mean injuries are less likely to heal, if at all. Steuart is delighted he was able to access the specialist treatment at the diabetic foot clinic . Weeping wounds can easily become infected and, in the worst cases, this leads to gangrene. In severe cases, amputation is the only option to prevent sepsis. Even diabetics who successfully manage their condition for years can eventually fall victim to diabetic foot, as with age the arteries naturally begin to harden and narrow. Taking aspirin and statins can help prevent diabetic atherosclerosis progressing but for diabetic foot there has been no ‘cure’, which is why there are so many amputations. Steuart was fortunate to avoid this drastic option. In late 2009, after he’d been referred to a specialist amputation unit, his wife, Sally, came across a Daily Mail article about a multi‑disciplinary diabetic foot clinic at King’s College Hospital, London. Patients facing amputation usually have many foot problems which require specialists to work together to save the foot. These patients are having a ‘foot attack’ and need immediate co-ordinated care, in a similar way to heart attack and stroke patients. Although his GP had not heard about this foot clinic, he agreed to refer Steuart. The clinic is run by Professor Mike Edmonds, a diabetes specialist, and the team consists of a range of specialists including vascular surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, chiropodists, podiatrists and radiologists. A key part of their approach is using interventional radiology (IR) to help unblock the damaged arteries and restore blood supply to the stricken limb. Guided by imaging techniques such as X-ray, CT scans and ultrasound, specialists insert tiny wires through the blood vessels to the damaged arteries. A tiny balloon is then inserted into the artery and inflated, squashing the fatty deposits and clearing the blockage. The artery is then held open with a metal tube, or stent. The technique, known as balloon angioplasty, is widely used for treating blocked arteries to the heart. Figures from the Society for Vascular Surgery published in 2011 suggest the technique has a 96 per cent success rate — meaning the blood vessels in the leg remain open — in the first year. The team discovered Steuart’s problems were caused by blockages in an artery in his left thigh and in arteries below his knee. Within four weeks he was undergoing treatment. First, he had a balloon angioplasty performed by an interventional radiologist. A vascular surgeon then performed a bypass of the blockage in the arteries in his calf. Again, in a technique more widely used for blocked arteries to the heart, the blood flow is redirected around an obstruction using a piece of vein taken from elsewhere, usually from the thigh. ‘Now I don’t even need crutches,' said Steuart (pictured with wife Sally) Steuart needed both procedures to increase the blood flow enough to help his lower leg heal. He also had a skin graft for his ulcer. Finally, doctors decided it was necessary to amputate one of the toes on his left foot. ‘There was such severe ulceration and infection that it would put the rest of my leg at risk — but this was a small price to pay if my leg could be saved,’ he said. Most patients take three to 12 months to fully heal. Three months later, Steuart was pain-free: walking, driving and back at work. He has since been monitored regularly. A couple of years later, the team found the blood flow in his leg had decreased again due to further narrowing of the artery — the continuing effects of diabetic atherosclerosis. However, according to a study published in the journal Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews, up to 80 per cent of patients don’t need any further interventions for five years. Another angioplasty tackled Steuart’s blockage. He still has regular ultrasound examinations to check his blood flow. Professor Edmonds, who highlighted Steuart’s case at the recent Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe conference in Glasgow, wants to see more specialist units across the country to reduce the alarming number of people who lose limbs to diabetic foot. He believes that in the long run it will save the NHS millions of pounds. Latest estimates state that the cost of caring for patients with diabetic ulcers or diabetic amputees was up to £662 million per year in England alone. Ulcer care alone is estimated to be £219 million each year, while amputation care is £55 million. ‘It is widely recognised that using vascular bypass and interventional radiology to combat diabetic foot is a much cheaper option than amputation,’ says Professor Edmonds. ‘Amputations should not happen because the problems are detectable and potentially treatable.’ He says teams similar to his own should be located at every hospital: ‘Clinical and economic studies indicate that multi-disciplinary foot clinics can improve patient outcomes and make savings that exceed the cost of the team.’ The proportion of hospital beds occupied by a patient with diabetes . His views are echoed by interventional radiologist Dr Trevor Cleveland, who works at the Sheffield Vascular Institute in the Northern General Hospital. ‘The majority of patients suffering from diabetic foot are elderly and unwell,’ he says. ‘Anything that means they avoid general surgery under general anaesthetic has got to be welcomed and that’s why the non-invasive methods we use in IR have a high success rate. 'Most patients have this done as a day procedure under local anaesthetic.’ Steuart is delighted he was able to access this specialist treatment. ‘If I’d ended up with a prosthesis, I would have taken months to get mobile, which would have affected my work,’ he says. ‘Now I don’t even need crutches, and I’m back behind the wheel after being unable to drive for four years. ‘The difference between how I was and how I am now is like night and day.’","Steuart Robson, aged 63, first experienced pain in his left leg in 1994 .

"India's Indira Gandhi International airport is on high alert after a terrorist threat claimed flights from Delhi to Afghanistan are being targeted by Al Qaeda and Islamic State extremists. The security crackdown comes after a phone call was made to Air India's Kolkata office on Saturday, in which the anonymous caller stated one of the carrier's planes would be hijacked. Following the phone call - in which the caller did not specify a particular flight - India's Bureau of Civil Aviation Security ordered airports across the country to strengthen security. Two Air India planes manoeuvre on the tarmac during heavy rains. The carrier received an anonymous phone call claiming it was being targeted by terrorists. Stock image used . Sky marshalls have now been deployed on flights in and out of the country, while there are increased security checks for those travelling. In addition, the number of police officers working outside the airport has increased, commandos are patrolling the airport and all flights to Afghanistan are being carefully monitored,The Times of India reported. In addition to the stringent security measures underway at the Dehli airport, Kolkata's NSC Bose International Airport is also on high alert given its proximity to the offices contacted by the anonymous caller. Security forces believe militants from Al Qaeda and Islamic State (ISIS) - who are currently embroiled in a bloody jihad across Syria and Iraq - are targeting the region, the International Business Times reported. Tensions over a possible terrorist attack in the region are currently on a knife edge after an Indian coast guard ship last week intercepted a Pakistani fishing boat suspected of carrying explosives in the Arabian Sea. The four occupants of the vessel blew it up after a nearly hour-long chase. The ministry said intelligence sources indicated that the boat from near Karachi, Pakistan was planning an unspecified illegal transaction. Indira Gandhi International airport (pictured) is now on high alert following the threat. Stock image used . Included among the airport's (pictured) new security measures are commando patrols and additional sky marshalls aboard flights . It said an aircraft and the coast guard ship intercepted the boat late Wednesday and demanded it stop to allow a search of its crew and cargo. The boat attempted to escape from Indian waters after warning shots were fired, it said. After nearly an hour, the people on the boat set it on fire, causing it to explode and sink near the India-Pakistan maritime boundary, about 365 kilometers (230 miles) west of the Indian town of Porbander. There was no sign of their bodies. 'The boat and persons on board could not be saved or recovered. The boat burnt and sank in the same position, in early hours of January 1,' the statement said. Maroof Raza, strategic affairs editor of the TimesNow news channel, said the people on the vessel may have been planning a New Year's attack on an Indian navy base or a coastal town. Attackers in the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai, in which 166 people were killed, sailed to the Indian financial capital in a boat from Karachi.","India's airports increase security measures following hijacking threat .

"Labour could try to cut the cost of the Trident nuclear deterrent to save money, Ed Miliband said yesterday – opening the way for a deal with the SNP. He declared that he wanted to have the ‘least cost nuclear deterrent we can have’. His comment raises the prospect of a coalition with the SNP, which has insisted it will not support any party that favours replacing the Trident nuclear missiles. Scroll down for video . Nuclear deterrent since 1994: The Trident missiles have a range of 7,500 miles and are accurate to a few feet. They are carried by four submarines - Vanguard (above), Vengeance, Victorious and Vigilant . It also suggests that Labour could ditch one or more of the submarines which carry the weapons and are needing to be replaced. Next year MPs will hold a final vote on whether to build a new generation of submarines in a £20billion ‘like for like’ replacement of Trident. Labour’s position on Trident could be a key factor in any coalition deal after the May election – and the SNP could end up handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10 if it wins enough seats to prop him up and deliver a Commons majority. The issue could also help Mr Miliband in negotiations with the Lib Dems and the Greens. Labour leader: Ed Miliband declared that he wanted to have the ‘least cost nuclear deterrent we can have’ The current system involves four nuclear-powered submarines, with one armed boat always at sea, operating out of Faslane in Scotland. Ed Miliband was asked about Trident during a question and answer session. He said: ‘I want to see disarmament, but I want to see multilateral disarmament, I’m not in favour of unilateral disarmament. ‘What does that mean? That means we have got to have the least cost deterrent that we can have, and that’s my philosophy.’ The Liberal Democrats say ending round-the-clock patrols would allow the submarine fleet to be cut from four boats to three but the Tories attacked the idea of a ‘part-time’ deterrent. Stepping inside: David Cameron (pictured) is said to back the like-for-like replacement of the ageing Vanguard class boats which carry the missiles. He is pictured aboard Vanguard class submarine HMS Victorious in 2013 . Downing Street said David Cameron backed the like-for-like replacement of the ageing Vanguard class boats which carry the missiles. A 2007 vote saw 161 MPs vote to oppose the renewal of Trident, including 95 Labour rebels. Submarine-launched missiles are regarded as superior to land-based nuclear weapons because they are less vulnerable to a ‘first strike’. Trident has been the UK’s nuclear deterrent since 1994. The missiles have a range of 7,500 miles and are accurate to a few feet. They are carried by four submarines - Vanguard, Vengeance, Victorious and Vigilant. On patrol, one submarine will carry 16 missiles, each with three warheads. Authorisation for using them can only come from the Prime Minister. Former home secretary Charles Clarke, a critic of the current Labour leadership, questioned his party’s credibility on controlling public spending. He wrote in the Fabian Review magazine: ‘The public needs to support how their tax is spent. So Labour needs to acknowledge that spending which might easily have gained public support decades ago now needs serious re-evaluation.’","SNP won't support parties favouring replacing Trident nuclear missiles .

"Wai Hong Tsang, 33, from Grimsby (pictured), must serve a minimum of 28 years  after being found guilty of murdering his former partner,  Mingzi Yang . A scientist who battered his ex-wife to death in what he believed was the perfect murder was trapped by his satnav, a court was told yesterday. Wai Tsang, 33, was involved in a custody battle with Mingzi Yang, 29, and wanted her dead so that he would not have to share access to their son Lucas, five. He began planning her death immediately after he received a solicitor’s letter telling him she was seeking increased time with the boy. Tsang, a chemistry graduate who worked as an industrial hygienist, created what he believed was a cast iron alibi putting himself 40 miles away from the scene of the killing in Lincoln. Police instead arrested Miss Yang’s fiance Darren Grundy, 32, who found her body after calling at her terrace home in the city when she failed to answer his phone calls. Mr Grundy was held for three days and questioned about the murder while Tsang remained free, giving police a detailed witness statement setting out his movements on the day of the killing. He had switched off his mobile phone during the crucial period so that his true whereabouts could not be tracked. But what he had not reckoned with was that the satnav in his Mazda estate car had recorded his every move. It showed that instead of driving directly from his home in Grimsby to go mountain biking in Sherwood Forest, as he claimed, he had travelled via Lincoln and left his car in a secluded layby outside the city for two-and-a-half hours. Scroll down for video . Tsang told police he was mountain biking in Sherwood Forest, 40 miles away, at the time of Ms Yang's (right) murder. However, the sat nav on his mobile phone showed he had actually stopped off in a lay-by in Lincoln . He then cycled to his ex-wife’s home, lay in wait for her to return from the morning school run and battered her to death. The court heard she had been ‘struck repeatedly and with force’, causing brain damage which killed her. He attempted to make it look as if a burglary had taken place. Detectives trawled through 3,000 hours of CCTV footage from across the city to find images of Tsang cycling to and from the murder scene wearing a distinctive blue helmet. Forensic tests on the bicycle and his watch revealed traces of his ex-wife’s blood. Officers arrested Tsang and freed Mr Grundy. Tsang, who is British and of Chinese origin, of Scartho, Grimsby, denied murdering Miss Yang on June 17 but was found guilty by a jury at Lincoln Crown Court at the end of a month-long trial. Peter Joyce, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘Mingzi was killed for a reason. The only person who had a reason and a motive to kill her was him. This wasn’t a random killing.’ CCTV footage from businesses across the city was pieced together by more than 50 officers during the case . The footage, and information from the sat nav, enabled police to link Tsang to the murder despite his alibi . Mr Joyce said that after the killing Tsang went on to Sherwood Forest, buying a parking ticket and obtaining a timed receipt at a cafe to back up his alibi. When police told him of Miss Yang’s death, he gave a lengthy statement detailing how he had set off from home between 7am and 8am and drove straight to Sherwood Forest, where he went biking. He said he later visited the site cafe before driving home. But he slipped up when he agreed to hand his satnav to police. The subsequent check of the device revealed that Tsang had actually set off around 6am and travelled via Lincoln, stopping for two-and-a-half hours in the layby. Then a witness came forward to say he had seen a cyclist matching Tsang’s description loitering outside the scene of the murder, and Tsang was arrested. Judge Michael Heath yesterday jailed him for life and ordered him to serve a minimum of 28 years. The judge said: ‘You are a very intelligent and very clever man. When poor Darren Grundy, a wholly innocent man, was in custody for three days I have no doubt that you thought you had committed the perfect murder and got away with it. ‘You are a cold, calculating individual and a liar but you didn’t fool the jury as you mendaciously attempted to explain away the constellation of compelling evidence that the prosecution produced.’ Tsang was convicted of murder at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) and jailed for life, to serve a minimum of 28 years in prison. The judge told him he was a 'a cold, calculating individual and a liar' during the four-week trial .","Wai Hong Tsang, 33, jailed for life for murdering his ex-wife Mingzi Yang, 29 .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the American-led invasion of Iraq left the country in chaos, in a rare criticism of Australia's strongest ally. Mr Abbott made the unusual remarks during a surprise visit to Baghdad. He has not ruled out sending more troops to the war-torn nation. 'Iraq is a country which has suffered a very great deal. First, decades of tyranny under Saddam Hussein. Then, the chaos and confusion that followed the American-led invasion. 'Most recently, the tumult, the dark age, which has descended upon Northern Iraq as a result of the Daesh death cult, but Australia will do what we can to help.' Scroll down for video . Wearing a leather jacket, Prime Minister Tony Abbott greeted diggers serving at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Compound . Mr Abbott made a rare criticism of US foreign policy in Iraq, saying the aftermath of the invasion had left the country in 'chaos and confusion' On the third leg of an unannounced visit to the troubled region, Mr Abbott held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in Dubai and visited an airbase. 'I certainly don't rule out doing what we reasonably can to make the world a safer place,' he said after the meeting. Australia is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and has deployed special forces troops to assist in training the local army. 'Because the ISIL or Daesh death cult has declared war on the world, including here and Australia.' Mr Abbott said he looked forward to further talks with Baghdad and coalition partners about what Australia 'can usefully do'. First visit to Iraq: Mr Abbott is pictured here with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi . The prime minister's latest comments and those he made after a meeting with Iraqi leader Haider Al-Abadi on Sunday have led to speculation Australia might be prepared to go beyond its limited commitment to the conflict. Back home, the Labor opposition is holding back bipartisan support for any expanded role. Instead it will wait for a detailed briefing from the government before revealing its position. Mr Abbott also rejected criticism of the secrecy surrounding his visit to Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. In a departure from previous practice, Australian media were excluded from covering the visit first-hand and were forced to rely on footage provided by the prime minister's office in Canberra. The opposition accused the government of pursuing a culture of secrecy, saying it was not in the national interest. But Mr Abbott said the media was excluded for 'understandable security reasons'.","Prime Minister says 'chaos and confusion' followed Iraq invasion .

"The tomb of a previously unknown queen has been discovered, Egyptian officials have revealed. Unearthed by Czech archaeologists in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo, the tomb is thought to belong to the wife or mother of Pharaoh Neferefre who ruled 4,500 years ago. Abu-Sir was an Old Kingdom necropolis used by the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis. Forgotten queen: The discovery was made in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo,  and is thought to be 4,500 years old. The location of the grave has made archaeologists believe she was probably the wife of the pharoah . Here pyramids dedicated to Fifth Dynasty pharaohs, including Neferefre, can also be found. The location of the queen's grave, in Pharaoh Neferefre's funeral complex hints that she was probably the wife of the pharoah, however. Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said that her name, Khentakawess, had been found inscribed on a wall in the necropolis. Mr Damaty added that this would make her Khentakawess III as two previous queens by this name were already known of. Hidden treasures: Czech archaeologists also found about 30 utensils (pictured)  - with 24 made from limestone and four of copper, an official statement added . Abu-Sir (marked) was an necropolis where pyramids dedicated to Fifth Dynasty pharaohs can be found . Archaeologists also found 30 utensils - with 24 made of limestone - a statement added.

Mysterious history: Abu-Sir (pictured) was an Old Kingdom necropolis where pyramids dedicated to Fifth Dynasty pharaohs, including Neferefre, can be found . Chief archaeologist hopes that the find would help him and colleagues shed light on unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, saw the construction of the first pyramids . An official at the antiquities ministry said the tomb dated from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty (2994-2345 BC). In December last year a 2,400-year-old coffin bearing unusual decorations, revealed the decline of Ancient Egypt. 'Goofy'? Experts believe the childlike paintings were made by junior artists . Its strange illustrations were described as ‘goofy’ and 'amateurish'. Experts believe the marks were made by junior artists, after the best Egyptian painters were deported when the Persians controlled the region. From 525 BC for around a century, the Persians ruled Egypt after king Cambyses marched into the Egyptian capital, Memphis, toppling the pharaoh. The occupation meant that the Persian Empire stretched from what is now Turkey to Afghanistan. The coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in Egyptian history, in which ancient texts by Diodorus Siculus suggest the occupying Empire deported Egypt’s best craftsmen and artists to work on its own grand projects in Persia.","Discovered in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo, the tomb is thought to belong to the wife or mother of Pharaoh Neferefre who ruled in the Fifth Dynasty .

"Staff working for NHS England racked up expenses bills of more than £7m on travel and staying in hotels in just 12 months. NHS England was established in 2013 as part of reforms to the health service which aimed to save the NHS money by reducing bureaucracy and consolidating commissioning in one centre. But the move continues to prove costly for the taxpayer. NHS England racked up an expenses bill of £7.1m in just one year. One of the highest claimants was Tim Kelsey, director for patients and information, who claimed £46,000 in expenses for travel and hotel bills . The total expenses bill submitted by NHS England staff last year equates to about £1,334 spent per staff member on flights, travelling on trains and staying in hotels in the UK and abroad, the  the Yorkshire Post reported. NHS England has offices in Leeds and London and employs around 5,000 staff. Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of the Patients Association, said: 'It is alarming that such vast sums of money are being spent in this way. At a time when the NHS is under such huge financial pressures, this type of waste is unacceptable. 'We must remember that the NHS is paid for by the tax-payer, and it belongs to patients and the public. 'Every pound spent on expenses is a pound lost for the delivery of frontline services. This money would have been better invested in resourcing our wards with front-line staff and in improving patient care. We cannot continue to allow patient care to suffer due to poor management and wasteful spending of precious resources. Unison said the spending appeared to be high and said the organisation should be 'tightening its belt' at a time when staff were being refused pay rises. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, said: 'When times are tight, this is one of the areas that NHS England must be cutting back on. 'Huge amounts of money being spent on executive travel, cars and other perks sends out completely the wrong message.' The central NHS body was set up to cut bureaucracy in a reorganisation by ministers and led by Sir David Nicholson. Sir David Nicholson (left), who spearheaded the reforms, claimed £32,000 in expenses while chief nurse Jane Cummings (right) submitted a £27,000 bill which included money claimed for hotels and travel expenses . This saw strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) abolished and replaced by NHS England and locally run clinical commissioning groups. The changes were designed to reduce the number of managers and put decision-making in the hands of doctors. But the measures, introduced by the then health secretary Andrew Lansley, been criticised as introducing dozens of new quangos and expenses for the health service. A spokesman said: 'NHS England has staff based all over England, and it is necessary for them to be out talking to patients, clinicians and others in order to carry out the work of commissioning healthcare. 'Staff are expected to think like patients and act like taxpayers, and from April 2014 no staff were permitted to travel first class, and must use public transport where available.' NHS England was set up in 2013 to save money . All staff at NHS England are expected to book travel and hotel arrangements through Leeds-based company Redfern and to use public transport instead of taxis. This is not the first time the organisation has been hit be revelations of large expenses claims by its staff. In the first year of NHS England's existence £195,802 was spent by just nine board members of NHS England on travel and hotels. The top spender was Tim Kelsey, national director for patients and information at NHS England, who lavished £46,000 on taxi bills and plush hotels. Sir David Nicholson, former chief executive of the organisation, claimed £32,000 in expenses, while Jane Cummings, chief nurse, spent £27,000. Since the revelations about expenses, staff have been banned from using first class rail travel. The quango also spent £1.2m on kitting out staff with iPhones and iPads since it was launched in April 2013. Critics also claim the NHS wasted money by giving managers axed by the reforms large pay-offs, only to rehire them again with large salaries.","Staff working at NHS England spent £7million on train and plane travel .

"The ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was . Speaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an ""it"" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world . 'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris . Early written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years . Adam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives' The ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth. However, geologists have uncovered evidence that a mountainous area of Svaneti in what is now northwest Georgia was the country ‘rich of gold’ described in the legend. They claim that villagers that were part of the wealthy Kingdom of Colchis, which existed from the sixth to the first centuries BC, used sheepskin to capture gold from mountain streams in the area. The fleece was used to line the bottom of the sandy stream beds, trapping any tiny grains of gold that built up there. The technique is a variation on panning used elsewhere in the world. This, they say, would have lead to sheepskins that were imprinted with flakes of gold and could have given rise to stories of a golden fleece. Mr Nicolson, who has presented several TV programmes, including one about the history of whaling, has now written a book called The Mighty Dead, or Why Homer Matters in the US, to explore what influence Homer's stories have today. He said that he believes many of the poems attributed to Homer have their beginnings around 2,000 BC. He said that large elements of the stories from The Iliad, for example, are shared with stories found in India, Germany and Iceland. He also said that the Iliad also paints the Greeks as lawless violent warriors rather than the civilised society they later became. He said: 'That picture of the Greeks doesn't make sense any later than about 1,800 to 1,700 BC. After that, the Greeks had arrived in the Mediterranean and started to create a civil society. 'Before that, they were essentially tribes from the steppes between the Black Sea and the Caspian - nomadic, male-dominated, violent.'

"A young Indian couple who were members of the untouchable caste were stabbed to death by the girl's relatives despite police being ordered to protect them, . Sandeep Rani, 24, and his wife Khushboo, 22, had known that their lives were at risk after getting married without permission so asked police for protection, but they declined. Mr Rani's family then went to the Punjab and Haryana High Court where a judge ordered police to provide the couple with security. Scroll down for video . Sandeep Rani and his wife Khushboo were killed by her relatives who disapproved of their marriage, despite police being ordered to provide them with protection . But Mr Rani's mother, Udham Kaur, said when the couple then went back to the police to seek protection they 'refused to honour the court order'. After returning to their village in Hoshiarpur district the couple continued to receive death threats, so they went to stay with friends. When they later briefly returned to their home in Mugowal village, some 77 miles from the Punjabi capital of Chandigarh, the couple were attacked and killed by five masked men carrying swords and knives. Mr Rani's family said their son was targeted first, and when his father, Parkash, tried to protect him he was also stabbed. He is currently in intensive care. After killing Mr Rani the attackers then critically injured Khushboo. She was still alive when an ambulance arrived, but died a short time later. Police said despite the fact that the couple had applied and successfully won a High Court order for police protection, they had then decided that they didn't need it . The couple, who were neighbours, had eloped and got married about three months before they were killed, against the wishes of Khushboo's family. Ms Kaur told police that the mask of one assailant came off during the attacks. She claimed to have recognised the attacker as being Khushboo's father, Sodhi Ram. Hoshiarpur district police chief Rajjit Singh Hundal said the matter was being investigated, but denied the police were at fault. He said that despite the fact couple had applied for a High Court order for police protection, they had then decided that they didn't need it.

"A Staten Island judge ruled Monday that he would hear arguments later this month on whether to release grand jury records in the case of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold. After an unusually lengthy session lasting nine weeks, the grand jury voted in December not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner’s death on a Staten Island sidewalk last summer. Captured on video, Garner's repeated cries of ‘I can't breathe!’ as Pantaleo holds him by his neck have become a rallying cry for protesters at demonstrations across the US who accuse police forces of being hostile towards people of color. Powerful message: Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner, walks away from a State Supreme Court following a Monday hearing about whether or not to unseal the grand jury records in connection with the arrest and death of her son . Wheels of justice: Judge William Garnett agreed Monday to hear oral arguments concerning the release of the sealed records January 29 . Demand: A protester displays a placard calling for transparency during a demonstration outside the courthouse in Staten Island Monday . The New York Civil Liberties Union, the city's public advocate, the Legal Aid Society and the New York Post have each filed petitions to unseal the records in the case . The groups asking for the grand jury transcripts to be made public say they are expecting a tough legal battle in a case that has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama and his Justice Department. But, they say, it is important to show how the grand jury came to its conclusion, and possibly expose flaws in the secrecy-shrouded process. Grand jury proceedings, which are led by the prosecutor, are secret by law. The New York Civil Liberties Union, the city's public advocate, the Legal Aid Society and the New York Post have each filed petitions in State Supreme Court in Staten Island arguing that an exception should be made in the Garner case. Deceased: The grand jury voted in December not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner’s death . Justice William Garnett ruled Monday that the four petitioners demanding the release of the records will present their oral arguments January 29. The hearing at the State Supreme Court in Staten Island was attended by Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, who showed up wearing a sweatshirt bearing her son's last words, 'I can't breathe.' 'I would like transparency to see what actually happened with my son,' Miss Carr said. Outside the courthouse, a small group of protesters braved the frigid temperatures, waving homemade signs and calling on the grand jury records to be unsealed. ‘Millions of people saw that video, know that there were no indictments and now wonder what did the grand jury do and how did they do it,’ protester Bill Dobbs told CBS 2. ‘That’s why it’s critical to release these grand jury records.’ The grand jury system has come under renewed scrutiny with the cases of Garner and of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by a white police officer last August in Ferguson, Missouri. In the Brown case, a St. Louis County grand jury voted in November not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, for killing Brown. Call to action: Garner's repeated cries of 'I can't breathe!' have become a rallying cry for protesters at demonstrations across the US .

In both cases, protesters and some elected officials were angered that there would be no public trials, sparking a new wave of street rallies in recent weeks. Donna Lieberman, the NYCLU's executive director, said overcoming the presumption of secrecy will be an uphill fight. ‘We are all concerned about the failure of a secret process to provide any vehicle for accountability in the case of Eric Garner,’ Lieberman said. ‘It has raised serious questions about the ongoing viability of the grand jury process as it is currently structured.’ In the case in Ferguson, the county prosecutor decided to publicly release most of the transcripts from the proceedings and evidence he presented to the grand jury. Daniel Donovan, Jr., the district attorney who handled the Garner case, has said New York's law is tougher than in Missouri, although a judge allowed him to say how many witnesses were called and whether or not they were civilians.","Staten Island Judge William Garnett ruled petitioners demanding release of records  will present their oral arguments January 29 .

Teresa told Bravo co-star Dina Manzo during a bizarre resolutions-themed Haute Hostess video for Glam.com that she plans to cut back on carbohydrates as her New Year's resolution. But according to Radar Online, her resolution may be tricky to uphold on a prison diet. Breakfast is a fresh orange, hot oatmeal, three slices of bread, a margarine pat, two packages of jelly and two cups of skim milk. When lunch is served Teresa will be tucking into beans and franks, potatoes, two mustard packets, three slices of bread, two margarine pats, a fresh apple and a drink. And dinner will be a fish filet, tomato sauce, white rice, lima beans, two tartar sauce packets, three slices of bread, two margarine packets, a fresh apple, and again another drink. Meanwhile Teresa will only be allowed 12 visits per month with her family, and she'll likely have to work in the prison factory. Wake-up is at 6am and Giudice will report to her prison-assigned job from 8am-3pm. On Saturday, her teenage daughter tweeted 'can't sleep, to much stuff on my mind,' along with a nervous face and gun emojis.

Giudice's last public event was watching her eldest perform with her girl-group 3KT at Iplay America in Freehold. The New York Times best-selling author has been spending her final days before surrender with her princesses - at a hockey game and a ski trip to Crystal Springs Resort. 'My family is probably one of the strongest families I know,' her daughter Gia - who's shopping around a reality show - told Access Hollywood in November. 'So we'll get through this. It's gonna be fine. And when it's over, we're gonna be better than ever.' The Real Housewives of New Jersey star has told daughters Gia and Gabriella about the family's legal woes, but she's reportedly keeping her incarceration a secret from her youngest girls. 'She told [Milania and Audriana] she is going to jail to work on a book about jail,' a source told Radar Online. 'Teresa and Joe feel that they are too young to fully comprehend what is going on.' They pleaded guilty last year to hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe  also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000. At the Giudices' sentencing in October, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas criticized the couple for not disclosing all their assets as required under their plea agreement, calling it 'the same pattern of obstruction, concealment and manipulation as they showed in the bankruptcy case.' Still, Salas sentenced Teresa to a sentence below the range sought by the U.S. attorney's office and staggered her sentence with her husband's so they wouldn't be in prison at the same time and unable to care for their four daughters. Joe is not an American citizen, and he faces an immigration hearing when he completes his sentence and is expected to be deported. His attorney has said Giudice came to the U.S. as an infant and did not know he was not an American citizen until he was an adult. Last month, Teresa Giudice sued former attorney James Kridel, whose firm handled the couple's bankruptcy case, alleging legal malpractice and negligence. Reached by phone last week, Kridel called the lawsuit 'ridiculous' and denied the claims. 'We did what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'We can only rely on the facts that were provided to us. I don't wish her any ill will, but I would have preferred a 'thank you' rather than a lawsuit.'","The Real Housewives of New Jersey star was convicted of bankruptcy fraud .

"The man suspected of strangling his lover before throwing her body into a river wrote a note to her teenage daughter telling her: 'Stay here, I've gone to look for mum', before killing himself, police believe. John Didier, 41, is believed to have murdered Annette Creegan, 49, on the Norfolk Broads while the couple were on a boating holiday with her 13-year-old daughter. Now it has emerged that the American scribbled a note to the girl while she was asleep before deliberately drowning himself or dying in an accident. It is believed the girl found the note when she woke up and waited on board for several days, hoping that her mother, a 'devoted' hospice nurse, and her boyfriend would return. Holidaymaker: John Didier strangled Annette Creegan on board a Norfolk Broads pleasure cruiser . Investigation: John Didier, who has family links in the U.S. state of Arkansas but lived with Annette Creegan in Surrey, worked for the National Health Service in an unspecified role . She was found alone on board the rented 38ft boat that witnesses said had been tethered to a tree at an isolated spot for an entire week. The bodies of Didier and Ms Creegan . were found in the River Bure, near Wroxham, on Sunday. Ms Creegan, of Mitcham, Surrey, . worked as a community nurse treating dying people in their homes for the . Trinity Hospice charity in South West London. Chief executive Anne Hooper said she . was ‘a truly wonderful and well-respected’ member of the care team, . adding: ‘She was devoted to improving the lives of her patients.’ A neighbour of Ms Creegan’s said . she had lived alone with her daughter until just . over two years ago when Didier, from Phoenix, Arizona, arrived. He had been working as an IT analyst at the St Charles’ Hospital in Kensington but left the job to go travelling. The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘John was almost always indoors. Aftermath: Police examine the couple's rented boat, which was found tied up on the Norfolk Broads . Clues: Detectives investigating the deaths of a couple on the Norfolk Broads took a large amount of evidence from the boat where Didier spent a week after killing his partner . Investigation: Police are believed to have removed a blood stained sheet, lengths of cable and cable ties from the boat discovered tied up to a tree last September . ‘While Annette went out to work, and paid for and did all the shopping, he never did. She did everything for him.’ Among items removed from the boat by police were a bloodstained sheet and lengths of rope and cable. Detectives confirmed that Ms Creegan’s death was being treated as a strangling while Didier’s death was not suspicious. A spokesman said: ‘We believe the deaths were a result of a domestic incident.’ Police searched Ms Creegan's home last night and removed computers and boxes from the property. Two officers stood guard in front of the two-story end terrace house about 5.30pm as forensic team members loaded the items into a nearby car. Probe: Police also searched Ms Creegan's home in Mitcham, Surrey, as part of the investigation . Evidence: Forensic officers removed computers and boxes from the end-terrace property . A neighbour, who would give her name only as Jo, said Ms Creegan 'idolised' her daughter. 'She was a lovely lady - she’s lived here about 15 years now,' the woman said. 'Her daughter is being cared for by family. They’re devastated. 'I didn’t know she was going away. When I saw the police outside I thought it was a burglary. Examination: A police officer searches the house in Mitcham, Surrey, where Ms Creegan lived . 'Annette was really lovely, really nice. She idolised her daughter and they were always together. 'A friend told me the news and I was devastated. I can’t believe it - it’s really sad. 'I think she worked in the care profession as a nurse or something but I’m not sure.' Michael Sek, 35, who moved in next . door to Ms Creegan’s house a month ago, said he was 'a little shocked' when he heard his neighbour had been killed. Earlier, it emerged that officers . telephoned local guest houses and hotels in the Norfolk Broads to check . if the couple had booked . in as they had found a 'lost' child. But . the bodies of the couple, who were both in their 40s, were later found . in water near the boat on Sunday, which was moored in a secluded . spot on the River Bure, near Wroxham. Police are still trying to establish how . long the girl had been on board the vessel after they today revealed . she may have 'sat there traumatised for days'. Det Supt Jes Fry, of the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: ‘We are building a time line of events that we will put together in a file for the inquest. ‘But I was trying to allay people's fears that she hadn't been in that situation for weeks or whatever. ‘She has given an account and we will build on that to establish a time line. ‘Obviously there are concerns from the public as to the welfare of this young girl. And that is our paramount concern. ‘We are providing support for her and the welfare of her family.’ Mystery: Police guard the scene on the Norfolk Broads between Wroxham and Salhouse where the pleasure boat was found . Jacqueline Brown, an employee at the 18th century Regency guest house in . Neatishead, Norfolk, confirmed that officers had called her at 9pm on . Saturday to ask if she had seen 'a couple'. She said: 'They just said they had a lost child and they were looking . for the parents who they thought might have checked into a local B & . B.' Officers said the girl was being . looked after by family in Norfolk. Some . reports suggest the boat had been moored at the same spot for most of . the week with the curtains closed and few signs of life on deck. But others reported seeing the family enjoying a barbecue on board on Friday night. Det Supt Fry refused to . comment on reports that the mother had been . dead for several days. But it is understood that the girl, . who was found alone on board the family’s rental boat, was . cared for and fed throughout last week. Remote: Locals described the banks along the section of the River Bure as inaccessible . An ice cream seller said yesterday . that he had seen the 38ft £1,000-a-week boat tied to a tree several . times since the previous Sunday. He became so worried that he . approached the craft but said a man on board angrily waved him away, . apparently wanting to be left alone. The alarm about the boat was only . raised when the hire company, Le Boat, realised it had not been returned . as arranged on Saturday. It was quickly found after a search that . evening. Police officers who searched the boat are understood to have . retrieved duct tape, cable ties, a computer hard drive, a laptop, . screws, brackets and lengths of cable. The ice cream man, who has worked on the Broads for . 23 years, said the boat had been in the same place for ‘at least seven . or eight days’. After seeing no movement when passing . the craft at the remote spot between Salhouse Broad and Wroxham Broad, . near Hoveton, he became so concerned that he went up to it to check . everyone was well. The 49-year-old said: ‘I went up and . down the river a few times to get a good look at it and it always had . its curtains and windows closed even in the middle of the day. ‘On Tuesday at about 5.30pm I decided I . would go and see if everything was OK because I was concerned for their . safety as they’d been in the same place for a long time. 'I was about eight . feet away and shouted over. The man came through in a hurry, from the . toilet area to the main section. ‘He shouted back through the curtain . something like, “Go away. I don’t want anything”, and he waved me away . with his hand. I saw the boat in the same position every day after . that.’ Steve Daniels, owner of Fineway Launch . Hire, said that many passers-by had spotted the boat but didn’t think . it was unusual. He said: ‘It is a popular spot for fishing at this time . of year and people often fish into the night then sometimes sleep in . during the day.’ A spokesman for Le Boat . said the family had hired craft through them for Norfolk Broads holidays . on ‘several’ previous occasions. A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that police had named the dead man as John Didier. In fact, police have not yet named the man and have not issued a photograph of him. The police did not reveal that the dead man was an American citizen. In fact, the officer confirmed during a briefing only that the man was a foreign national. Didier and Ms Creegan hired the vessel from Le Boat, which operates across the UK and Europe with a fleet of 1,200 cruisers .

"Tory plan to deport foreign students will harm the economy, billionaire vacuum tycoon James Dyson has warned. Sir James said Theresa May's proposal to expel overseas students as soon as they graduate would help Britain's global rivals.

Scroll down for video . Sir James Dyson (left) with Prime Minister David Cameron, at the Dyson Vacuum Factory in Malmesbury . But, writing in The Guardian, Sir James said the Government should be encouraging the brightest graduates to remain in the country and develop their ideas for the benefit of the British economy. He said: ‘Give them our knowledge, allow them to develop their own, and permit them to apply it here on our shores. 'Their ideas and inventiveness will create technology to export around the world.' Sir James added: ‘May's immigration plans simply force the nimble minds we nurture to return home and fuel competition from overseas. ‘Sending them home with new technology developed here presents very good value to our competitor nations. Instead our education system should be a tool to import the world's greatest minds. ‘And, most importantly, to keep them here, so that it is our economy - and our culture - that benefits.’ Home Secretary Theresa May announced plans to expel overseas students as soon as they graduate . It is not the first time Sir James's comments have discomforted ministers.

"An electrician has been ordered to pull down the £10,000 security fence he built after he was burgled ten times in two months - because it might scare motorists. Graham Jaggar, 51,  built the barrier after thieves relentlessly targeted his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. But he now claims council chiefs have told him to remove the fence - because it could pose a hazard to drivers. Graham Jaggar has been ordered to pull down the £10,000 security fence after he was burgled ten times in two months - because it might scare motorists . He said: 'Over the last few years I've had around £30,000 worth of stuff stolen by these idiots, it's just a scandal. 'It's mostly been expensive tools from this house, which means I can't work, and building materials. 'They have also stolen model aircrafts worth a few thousand pounds and even my children's toys from the garden. 'From my old house, which I left because I thought I would be more secure in another property, I had a boat stolen, two cars, a motorbike and my daughters scooter. 'They have even stolen four or five wheelie bins - and one of them was full of rubbish. The boat had around £4,000 of work done on it. 'I reckon I have been bugled around 20 times over the past six years.' Self-employed Mr Jaggar built the six foot fence last year after his electrics business was threatened for months by the burglars. Mr Jaggar, 51, built the barrier after thieves relentlessly targeted his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. But he now claims council chiefs have told him to remove the fence - because it could pose a hazard to drivers . He said the fence had been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by January 7 . But now, he said a neighbour's complaint that it causes a blind spot has put his house at risk of being targeted again. He said he was given 'verbal planning permission' by a man from the council who has since left. He said: 'The fence means there is a very small blind spot, but there are hazards everywhere in the roads so all it takes is caution and common sense. 'It causes a brief blind spot, for the blink of an eye, when you come out of the junction. 'I've not had any burglaries since putting it up 12 months ago but now I might have to spend even more adjusting it. 'I could be left with a bill of thousands of pounds after changing the fence to what the council want. 'I can't take it down - I've been burgled so many times the insurance won't even pay out anymore. 'It's ridiculous and a scandal, why can't anyone use some common sense?' He added that the fence has been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by January 7. Mr Jaggar estimates has now spent around £12,000 in total on security - including the fencing, CCTV, an electric gate, walls and bushes to protect his home . He claims his grandchildren are 'terrified' to visit the house for fear of burglars, added: 'They've given me two weeks to get it sorted, which is impossible at this time of year. 'It's so much hassle, someone is just being vindictive about it. It's going to cost a fortune and it would be an eyesore. 'I could plant ten foot conifers around this house and get away with it, there's no common sense whatsoever. 'I put this up about a year ago and had no trouble, so I don't know why neighbours are complaining now.' Mr Jaggar, who lives with partner Stephanie, 56, made the headlines in 2013 when a sign outside his property warning against thieves. He estimates has now spent around £12,000 in total on security - including the fencing, CCTV, an electric gate, walls and bushes to protect his home. He said: 'The council just won't see any sense. They have cocked up and I've been left to to cough up the costs - I need to protect my house. 'The fence also acts as a safety guard because so many children climb on the three foot wall it sits on and fall off, then I'm the one that gets the blame.'

"Immigrants who were found hiding in a food lorry entering Britain. Fresh food supplies to the UK are being threatened by stowaways . Fresh food supplies to the UK are coming under threat because illegal immigrants are hiding in the back of lorries, it emerged last night. Entire truck-loads of imported fruit and vegetables are being destroyed if a migrant is found inside a transportation vehicle, MPs heard – and this could lead to a supplies shortage. Home Secretary Theresa May has agreed to an urgent meeting with the ‘increasingly worried’ food industry to try to find ways of better protecting imported food from stowaways. It is understood that, over the Christmas period, large quantities of vegetables destined for supermarkets and other retailers had to be ‘condemned’ for this reason. Many migrants clamber aboard lorries as they are being loaded –sometimes as far away as Spain – while others sneak aboard later in a journey. But once an illegal immigrant is detected by the authorities, either at the port of Calais or in the UK, the cargo is deemed ‘contaminated’, no longer considered fit for human consumption and destroyed. If this problem persists, it could lead to a shortage of supplies or a rise in food prices to cover the cost of ruined consignments. Ex-agriculture minister Sir James Paice, who has long-established contacts in the food industry, said: ‘There’s ample evidence now that many illegal immigrants are getting into lorries as far afield as Spain, particularly lorries bringing fresh food into this country, which means the whole load is condemned. ‘Our retail sector is now increasingly worried about fresh food supplies.’ Speaking in the Commons, Mrs May confirmed officials were ‘aware’ of the problem. She added: ‘We are looking to introduce improved ability to identify people who are within lorries when they pass through our controls in Calais. ‘But obviously the problem is often people are getting into the lorries further afield, which even if you find them at Calais the load is still considered to have been damaged and contaminated.’ The revelations came amid increased pressure on ministers to get a grip on the immigration chaos at Calais. Yesterday a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which has recently been on a fact-finding trip to the port, revealed the farce of migrants being caught by UK border guards – only to be immediately set free again by the French authorities. Many migrants clamber aboard lorries as they are being loaded –sometimes as far away as Spain – while others sneak aboard later in a journey . Britain can stop migrants from travelling to the UK from Calais but it is up to the French to decide whether to deport them. Tory MP Tim Loughton then questioned whether the ‘real problem’ was that ‘when potential migrants are apprehended, the French police take them two miles outside town and release them without even taking their fingerprints, so they can come and do it all over again’. Once lorries have reached the country, the UK Border Force uses an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors, scanners and visual searches to find stowaways. Last month it emerged that a record 3,000 immigrants a month were caught trying to sneak into the UK illegally, including 420 who were refused entry more than once.","Fresh food supplies coming into Calais are being threatened by migrants .

"Man Haron Monis, the gunman responsible for the Lindt cafe siege, fooled the Australia government into granting him refugee status. The Islamic extremist claimed he was an Iranian spy and that his life would be in danger if he was sent home. Monis approached the government in 1997 with a signed letter on an Amnesty International letterhead, which lobbied Department of Immigration on his behalf, the Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children . 'Mohamed Hassan Manteghi’s status as a cleric, his involvement with the Ministry of Intelligence, and his connections with high level individuals are relevant considerations which add objective weight to his fear of persecution, and to his fear of being targeted by the authorities outside Iran,' reads the supposed letter from Amnesty International. It has been revealed that Monis was given an Australian permanent protection visa without much investigation, after Amnesty International purportedly lobbied the Immigration Department on his behalf. The revelation comes after tapes of the man responsible for the Martin Place terror plot delivering religious rants, saying 'Society should behave in an Islamic manner', were unearthed. In 2009, the self-styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16-hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in Martin Place's Lindt Cafe in Sydney's CBD last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city's western suburbs. The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne. The footage, translated by a Farsi translator for The Daily Telegraph, slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes, saying: 'your intelligence service is not working properly'. He believed governments who were 'not aware that there [was] criminal activity happening in your country' then officials should resign from their positions as they were 'incompetent'. At times, Monis became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message. Showing his level of paranoia, the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist Muslims lay within their community. Monis believed moderate Muslims would spell the death of extremists. Canvassing what he thought was the virtues of Sharia law, he pushed the case for Australia to take on more of the Islamic culture. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16 . 'The core of an Islamic society is justice, social justice. Society should behave in an Islamic manner and there should be justice,' he said. In the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies, Monis warned about keeping an eye on 'friends' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror. 'An enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy. An ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you, you would socialise with them and associate with them, but one day like a bear, they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him,' he said. Monis went on to say people should fear the ones who declared 'Islam is in jeopardy'. Adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of Monis over the past couple of weeks following the siege, friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party Hezbollah Australia and funded a Campsie warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall. Mamdouh Habib (pictured), who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, said he knew Man Haron Monis 'very well' and insisted that the Sydney siege gunman was 'not violent' Refugee advocate Jamal Daoud told News Corp he did not know where Monis' money was sourced and the terrorist was 'mysterious'. Mr Daoud added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the Muslim community - Sunni and Shia, saying 'He knew a lot about everybody, they knew nothing about him'. The advocate said Monis worshiped at different mosques around Sydney, which included Granville's Nabi Akram Islamic Centre, in Sydney's west - a location where these religious rants were given. The way Monis spoke was described as 'slow' and 'low-pitched'. Mr Daoud said the gunman was a 'very good listener' who 'wasn't stupid, he's intelligent'. It comes after former failed politician and Guantánamo Bay detainee, who previously employed gunman Monis, claimed he could have convinced the 50-year-old to end the Sydney siege without resorting to violence. His offer was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed (pictured). All of these are believed to have been rejected . Mamdouh Habib, who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, told Fairfax he knew him 'very well' and insisted that Monis was 'not violent'. Despite this show of support, Monis will be buried in an undisclosed location in Melbourne after the Sydney Muslim community reportedly refused to bury him. The wrongly accused former Guantánamo Bay detainee, who was tortured after being arrested in Pakistan under the false pretences he had knowledge of the September 11 attacks, claimed Monis was only seeking attention. Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children. He insistently told Fairfax he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State. His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. All of these are believed to have been rejected. Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and will be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to the Telegraph. It follows claims from the Muslim community no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended. An Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia .","Monis convinced authorities he was an Iranian spy and that his life would be in in ­danger if he was sent home .

"A mother has been accused of beating her three-year-old daughter to death just six months after she was arrested for abusing two of her other children. Katlyn Marin, 25, said nothing as she appeared via video link in district court in Nashua, New Hampshire for her arraignment on Monday, two days after the charges against her were announced. Marin is accused of assaulting her daughter Brielle Gage several times on November 24 and 25. After a 911 call was placed from the family's Nashua home, Brielle was rushed to hospital on November 25 but died shortly after. An autopsy determined she died of blunt force injuries and her death was ruled a homicide. Arrest: Katlyn Marin appears in a video arraignment from the Department of Corrections jail in Manchester, New Hampshire on Monday. She is charged with second-degree murder in the death of her  daughter . Authorities launched an investigation into the death and announced on Saturday that Marin had been charged with second-degree murder in her daughter's death. Prosecutors said she 'recklessly caused the death of her daughter under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life'. It is not the first time Marin has been accused of mistreating her children. In May, Marin and her 30-year-old live-in boyfriend Michael Rivera were arrested for allegedly abusing two boys in their home after one of the boy's guidance counselors alerted authorities. At the time, five children - ages eight, six, four, three and nine months - were living at the house, Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin told the Boston Globe. The Division for Children Youth and Families reported possible abuse of an eight-year-old boy, who had bruises across his body, and a six-year-old boy. Murdered: Three-year-old Brielle Gage, pictured, was beaten on November 24 and November 25 and died of blunt force trauma on November 25, authorities said. Her death was ruled a homicide . Tragedy: The youngster had lived at the home with four half-siblings. Child services had previously responded to the home and found that four of the children - including Brielle - had bruises across their bodies . The children said that Marin and Rivera used belts to beat them, police said, while the eight-year-old boy was forced to kneel for up to an hour, causing his knees to bruise. Investigators noted that four of the children had bruises across their bodies, including the nine-month-old baby,WMUR reported. The eight-year-old boy had bruises on both of his forearms. Marin said that the three-year-old girl had a bruise on her face because she was 'born that way' - but  later changed her story to claim that the toddler slept on her toys or would fall on them. The couple also claimed the bruises came from the children fighting with each other, WMUR reported. The six-year-old boy told detectives that he and his siblings were only allowed to eat once a day when they were home, and he once got beaten for eating food he had hidden, police told WMUR. The children were placed into protective custody in April and the couple were taken into custody on May 5. Rivera was charged with two counts of second-degree assault and one count of simple assault, while Marin was charged with one count of second-degree assault and one count of simple assault. Mug shots: Marin, pictured left following her arrest in May and right in her latest mug shot, was accused of second-degree assault in May. The case was about to go to jury selection when her daughter died . She was released on $10,000 personal recognizance and Rivera was released on $500 cash bail, on the condition that the couple did not contact each other, according to the Union Leader. The children were placed temporarily in foster care. There is no official record of when they were handed back to the couple, although neighbors told the Union Leader that at least two of the children had returned to the home in recent months. Accused: Her live-in boyfriend Michael Rivera, 30, pictured, was also arrested for assault in May . In a Facebook post on Saturday, the girl's grandmother, Sharon Boucher, wrote that the little girl was returned last summer by the family court - even though the child abuse charges were still pending. 'We want to bring awareness to the issue of child abuse and how [the Department of Health and Human Services] and the court system failed my granddaughter,' she wrote. The assault cases were going to go to trial and jury selection was scheduled to take place on December 15 - nearly three weeks after the death of Brielle. But during a status conference on November 20, the state informed a judge that it intended to drop the charges against Marin, although Rivera's case continues to move forward. Neighbors expressed their shock over Brielle's murder. 'They should have dug deeper,' John Horton told WMUR. 'They should have continued with their investigation instead of letting it go.' Gage's paternal grandmother, Sharon Boucher, has created a Facebook memorial page and a GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of the little girl's funeral. She wrote on the page that she was 'relieved' about the arrest but that she now hopes to bring awareness to the issue of child abuse because 'the court system failed my granddaughter'. 'No family should ever have to suffer the pain we are feeling,' she wrote. At Marin's minutes-long hearing on Monday, bail was not set and she will remain jailed pending a probable cause hearing on January 13.

"A couple who spent $35,000 building a tiny house-on-wheels to live an eco-friendly life were stunned to find their home-to-be had been towed away by thieves. Casey Friday and his wife Jessica spent two and a half years building the house themselves from the raw materials so they could reduce their environmental impact. The 650sq ft home, which can be attached to a car and moved like a trailer, could run on rainwater, compost its waste and get by on 'very little' electricity - but was purloined from its custom-paved driveway in Spring Branch, Texas. House no more: Casey Friday found that his tiny home had been towed away from Spring Branch, Texas, leaving only a wrecked driveway behind . Love's labor lost: The tiny home, pictured, was dragged off by thieves who have yet to be identified - but was found just under two weeks later . The theft on December 20, which drove the couple to despair, led the two to think that their efforts and money was wasted. But after the story featured on the local news, San Antonio residents tipped police off that the diminutive dwelling had cropped up on the other side of town. Sheriff's deputies were able to return the home last week, which is now being kept in an impound lot while the Caseys decide what to do with it next, according to NBC4 San Antonio. Rage: Friday reacted angrily to the theft of the home, which had been finished for less than a month when it was taken . Painstaking: Friday and his wife built the whole house themselves from the raw materials . He told the station the theft was 'depressing, devastating, made me angry and shocked all at the same time.' In a blog-post after the crime, he said: 'Our house had not even been on the property for a month, and some f*****g a**-clown decided to steal it, like it was his all along.' 'We probably put in about $35,000 into parts alone on the house. Clearing the (now destroyed) land and adding a paver “driveway” for my car cost us $3,100. Unsure: The Fridays are waiting to decide what to do with the home now as they no longer want to live in it . 'You can see how they destroyed it while stealing the house. I worked on this house for 2.5 years, while building up my businesses. The resale value on this highly custom house would easily be $55-60,000.' The couple has said they may now sell off the house as the theft has blighted their plans to live in it, and they have already signed up for an apartment. Officials at the Bexar County Sheriff's office told NBC4 that they were not certain who stole the house - and that the people responsible will face charges.","House took Casey Friday and his wife more than two years to build .

"These implausible towers of irregularly shaped stones seem as if they should tumble as soon as you look at them. Rising in the picturesque wilderness they could almost be the work of fairies, mischievously placed to confuse passers-by who chance upon them. Artist Miha Brinovec, 43, from Braslovce, Slovenia, does not use any adhesives to stick together the rocks. Instead, he carefully calculates how best to balance his stones in the most surprising ways. The amateur photographer insists the practice helps him to meditate and feel closer to nature. 'It is all about the connection between water, rocks and me,' he says. 'I just pick some random rocks and one unusual stone for the top of the installation and the process can begin. 'Mathematically, I have to find three points on each stone so it can stand still. But this is much more than just mathematics - it is a way of meditating and connecting with nature. When the connection is right the magic happens, gravity surrenders and the whole place becomes balanced and peaceful.'

"A mother-of-three was shocked into losing 13 stone after doctors warned her comfort eating would kill her. Tallula Douglas weighed 24 stone and was a size 28 before realising she was too fat to fit in the bath. That, combined with the terrifying fear when her daughter Beatrice began to choke while being breastfed, proved the tipping point. 'I was worried I'd eaten something to induce the fit,' Ms Douglas, 32, told MailOnline. 'My weight was impacting on every part of my life.' Tallula Douglas, 32, from Hertfordshire, was inspired to lose weight after doctors warned she wouldn't live to see her 40th birthday if she continued to comfort eat. At her heaviest she tipped the scales at 24 stone . After giving birth to her daughter Beatrice, Ms Douglas said she realised she was too fat to fit in the bath and suffered a scare when Beatrice choked while she was breastfeeding. The 32-year-old said she was worried that her daughter's ordeal was caused by something she had eaten . After joining Slimming World, Ms Douglas has so far lost around 13 stone, and is now a size 12 . She suffered high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and severe joint pain. When she was growing up, Ms Douglas, from Hodderstone, Hertfordshire, said she always considered herself the 'fat friend'. But it was only as she got older and began to try for a baby that she realised the impact her 24 stone frame was having on her body. 'It wasn't until I was trying to have children that I realised my weight was a serious health concern,' she told MailOnline. 'I was trying for my first child and was failing fertility tests because of my weight. 'I suffered high blood pressure, very bad cholesterol and severe joint pains.' As a carrier of the sickle cell gene, Ms Douglas passed the trait on to her eldest son, Lorenzo. But after giving birth to her second child, Jayden, doctors revealed he had the full blown sickle cell anaemia disease. As a result, the then mother-of-two faced long stays in hospital with her baby son, as he received treatment for the disease which causes red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, to develop abnormally. 'With Jayden being in and out of hospital, I just didn't have time to eat healthily, I just had to eat whatever was easy,' she told MailOnline. The deterioration of her relationship with the father of her sons fuelled further weight gain, as Ms Douglas turned to food for comfort. She said: 'Things got really bad at home and my husband and I divorced, things went from bad to worse. 'I was by now, a size 28 and weight 22 stone. At her heaviest, after having her three children, Lorenzo, right, Jayden, left and Beatrice, Ms Douglas told MailOnline she reached a size 28 . 'I couldn't walk properly, struggled to breathe and sometimes even moving was difficult. 'It got to the stage where I was so fat I could no longer get into Jayden's hospital bed to comfort him. 'I was so ashamed of myself. I was seriously ill and couldn't even support my own children, I was that overweight. 'I carry a lot of guilt over Jayden and his illness, and my way of dealing with that guilt was to eat. 'And when you're pregnant and couldn't drink or smoke, I ate even more. I think I am just addicted to food.' While pregnant with her third child, Beatrice, Ms Douglas had to have more scans than the average expectant mother, because of her size. She told MailOnline: 'I never realised I had to have so many scans because I was obese, I was high risk. 'I was so fat I couldn't feel her move, I was constantly worried . 'I was being monitored everyday. I couldn't say if she was doing her 10 movements a day. 'My stomach was massive, I had to hold up my excess skin with belts. 'From 30 weeks I couldn't walk, I was housebound.' After giving birth Ms Douglas was shocked to discover she was too big to fit in the bath. 'I bought a pair of pyjamas for after I had Beatrice, and I really thought they would fit,' she said. While obese, Ms Douglas suffered high blood pressure, a raised cholesterol and severe joint pains. Her second son Jayden suffers sickle cell anaemia, and the 32-year-old said she was ashamed when she couldn't get into his hospital bed to comfort him, on account of her size . 'After I had her, I went to put them on but I couldn't get in them, I couldn't even get in the bath. 'My weight had begun to affect my entire life.' But it was two events, her baby daughter choking and a visit to the doctor that proved the final straw. Ms Douglas said: 'Beatrice choked while breast feeding and I had to call an ambulance out for her. I was worried I had eaten something wrong. 'I was so depressed I didn't have the motivation to sort my life out but a visit to the doctor gave me the kick up the backside I needed,' Ms Douglas said. 'I was told that if I continued to comfort eat and gain weight I wouldn't live to 40. 'My weight would physically kill me and I had to do something about it. So I did.' After speaking to a friend who is a Slimming World consultant, Ms Douglas vowed to turn her life around. Since shedding the weight, Ms Douglas has been able to take her children to Disneyland . She revolutionised her eating habits, cutting out greasy food, chocolates, crisps and banned comfort eating. The mother-of-three joined a gym and with the support of her friends and family, got her life back on track. 'I can now take the kids on days out and even took them to Disneyland - something I never would've been able to do had I stayed the weight I was,' she said. 'I couldn't even take the kids down the park, let alone to another country.' In recognition of her achievement, Ms Douglas has been named Miss Slinky by her slimming group this year and has been nominated Slimmer of the Year. And while she now weighs around 11 stone she said she isn't done with her weight loss mission yet, hoping she can reach her goal of a size 10. 'I never in a million years thought I'd be able to do this, I was so used to being fat that I thought I would always be that way,' she told MailOnline. 'I won't go back, losing the weight has really changed my life. I am proud of myself, I have lost eight stone in total which is a nice achievement.' And she said her revolutionised eating habits are having a positive impact on her children. 'How I eat affects my kids. Lorenzo is used to eating absolute rubbish, because that's all he saw me eat,' she said. 'He was eating whatever I craved when I was pregnant with Jayden and Beatrice. 'Jayden was always in hospital because he was ill so he used to eat whatever was easy, and I did too. 'But Beatrice, because ever since she can remember, I have been eating healthily, she eats nothing but fruit and veg. She loves it. 'It really does make a difference. 'I hope my story can be an inspiration to other women out there that comfort eat. 'Life can be so hard sometimes, but only you can change it. I did it for my kids and I've never been happier.' Ms Douglas, said: 'I couldn't walk properly, struggled to breathe and sometimes even moving was difficult. It got to the stage where I was so fat I could no longer get into Jayden's hospital bed to comfort him. I was so ashamed of myself. I was seriously ill and couldn't even support my own children, I was that overweight' Ms Douglas said she hopes her experience will help others shed their excess weight, adding: 'Life can be so hard sometimes, but only you can change it. I did it for my kids and I've never been happier'","Tallula Douglas weighed 24 stone and reached a size 28 at her heaviest .

"The ladies of Downton are known for enjoying afternoon tea but they might be shocked if this cake was served alongside their sandwiches. A baker has created a cake that spookily resembles Lady Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by Dame Maggie Smith. The creation was the brainchild of cake and chocolate artist Karen Portaleo, 50, who was asked to make it to celebrate the season five premiere of the ITV show in the U.S. Scroll down for video . Dame Maggie Smith, right, as Lady Violet in Downton Abbey and the cake replica created by Karen Portaleo . The cake resembling the Dowager Countess took pride of place at a launch party at The Fox Theatre, hosted by Georgia Public Broadcasting. It took Karen 18 hours to create her culinary masterpiece. It is a vanilla cake with buttercream, with an Earl Grey Tea soak. A humorous video speeding up the baking and decorating process reveals how the cake was made. Taking shape: The vanilla cake before being decorated . Attention to detail: The Dowager Countess's hat is added as the cake creation continues . Shots of Karen at work are interspersed with scenes from Downton Abbey in which the characters are talking about making a cake. The video also features some of Lady Violet's best one liners as if she is talking about the cake's creation. 'There comes a time when things are best left to the professionals,' she quips as the scene cuts back to Karen baking. The finished cake was displayed at a premiere party to celebrate season five of Downton Abbey  in the U.S . The food artist said she had been asked to recreate Downton Abbey itself, aka Highclere Castle in Newbury, West Berkshire, but she preferred to immortalise her favourite character from the show in sponge instead. She told Today.com: 'Buildings are my Kryptonite. To me, buildings are much harder than faces; buildings are nothing but mass. Faces and people are so much more interesting.' She added on her Instagram that: 'The Countess was delicious,' and revealed Dame Smith herself was sent a picture of the cake. Did she approve? Dame Maggie Smith, pictured with her co-stars, was sent a picture of the cake . Downton Abbey consultant, Alastair Bruce, sent the actress a photo after he attended the party and was amused by the tribute. Karen explained: 'He said the cake is so very American, which I thought was hysterical. It is very American to create a human out of cake.'","Image of actress Dame Maggie Smith has been made as a cake .

"The Ebola screening system at airports has been toughened up after Pauline Cafferkey, who later developed the virus, was waived through . The Ebola screening system at airports has been toughened up after a nurse who later developed the virus was waived through. Nurse Pauline Cafferkey is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday having spent five weeks treating victims in Sierra Leone. It later emerged that officials at Heathrow had allowed her to board a connecting flight to Glasgow even though she had complained of a fever. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the UK following volunteer work. Until recently, the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling-in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients. But from now on, anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal. Officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours. Pauline Cafferkey, 39, from Glasgow, remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said: 'Pauline's condition has deteriorated to a critical state although she stabilised yesterday and continues to receive the best possible care.' 'She said in Sierra Leone that she hoped her loved ones would be proud of her. 'Well, she should know today the whole country is proud of her for her bravery and dedication to the service of others. 'She stands, quite simply, for the very best of NHS values.'

"A new app has marked yet another breakthrough in biometrics by using your face to log on to a website - instead of a password. True Key takes a photo of your face with the computer’s camera and stores it for later use. When you want to use a password-protected website such as your email, the app scans your face and matches it with its records - removing the need for a password. Face unlock technology was unveiled at CES 2015 in Las Vegas today. True Key (shown) takes a photo of your face and then uses it as your password. The technology works on any device and can be used for multiple sites. A 'freemium' service can be used on 15 websites - after that it costs £12 ($19.95) per year . The technology works on any device which has a camera meaning that it can replace passwords on computers, tablets and smart phones. True Key was unveiled at the technology at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and was reported by USA Today. The app will be available through the True Key website from next month and could change how we use our computers. It works on a ‘freemium’ model and is free for the first 15 websites. After that it costs £12 ($19.95) per year. 'Your data is locally encrypted with AES-256, one of the strongest grades of encryption available,' the company writes on their site. 'Only you have access to it using things that are unique to you (your face, your fingerprint, a trusted device or a master password that is only known by you).' 'The more factors you have and use, the stronger your True Key profile becomes. 'In addition, we provide multiple security controls so that users can decide how to configure True Key based on their needs.' True Key has been developed by computer chip maker Intel and Mark Hocking, a vice president with Intel Security, who said: ‘Our goal is the elimination of passwords altogether’. Mr Hocking added that the service might not achieve that goal overnight but it ‘will make it easier, over time. It will be a long time before they [passwords] are gone.’ He said: ‘I think that the password system is broken. ‘We’d like to invent a new system for being able to identify if it’s truly you that’s trying to get in and then grant you access accordingly as opposed to a password which can be shared or stolen . ‘Nothing is truly hack free but the practices most of us use for managing our identity are generally very unsafe - using the same password over and over again, using simple passwords. ‘This is a tool that will help consumers be more safe’. Google already lets its users enable two-step verification for their online accounts, and offers Face Unlock on Android. With Face Unlock, pictured, Android users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet, in place of a PIN or a pattern . 'Our goal is the elimination of passwords altogether' said Mark Hocking, vice president of Intel Security. Mr Hocking added that the True Key service, which can be used with multiple sites (shown), might not achieve that goal overnight but it ‘will make it easier, over time' Studies have shown that the average person has just 10 passwords that they recycle for all the websites they use, including online banking. However most of us use obvious things like the name of a pet, our mother’s maiden name and our address. Apple advanced phone biometrics with the iPhone 5 which allowed users to unlock the device with a fingerprint instead of their password. Researchers have also for years been experimenting with ways of doing away with house keys including retina scans. They have also developed scanners that let you use your fingerprint to gain access to your home. AxisKey, developed by a Florida-based security company, went further, and used sonar to scan your fingerprints, the contours beneath them and the shape of your blood vessels in your hands.","Face unlock technology was unveiled at CES 2015 in Las Vegas today .

"Germany was plunged into darkness last night as the authorities switched off the lights at some of the country's most famous landmarks in a mark of disapproval at protests against the so-called 'Islamisation of Europe'. Protesters from the mounting right-wing group the Patriotic Europeans Against Islamisation of the West marched through the streets of several German cities in the latest round of demonstrations against what they say is the growing influence of Islam on the country. But campaigners in Cologne, Berlin and Dresden were met with darkness as opponents staged a silent coordinated campaign to switch off the power at a number of buildings. In Cologne, where the PEGIDA campaigners were heavily outnumbered, the square around Cologne Cathedral - one of Germany's most famous landmarks - was plunged into darkness. Scroll down for video . Cologne Cathedral (left) was plunged into darkness last night as the authorities switched off the power at famous landmarks to show ttheir disapproval at anti-immigrant protests . The blanket of darkness which descended across Germany was said to be a sign of solidarity against protests by the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West . Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff said that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the demonstrators think twice about their protest . In Berlin, the floodlights at the Brandenburg Gate were switched off, while the lights were also extinguished at the city's iconic TV Tower. Lights on the bridges which cross the Rhine were also switched off. Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, said that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the demonstrators think twice about their protest. 'You're taking part in an action that, from its roots and also from speeches, one can see is Nazi-ist, racist and extremist,' he told n-tv. 'And you're supporting people you really don't want to support.' Other buildings, including several other churches and a museum, joined the Cologne Cathedral in shutting off their lights. In the eastern city Dresden - which has been at the centre of the weekly rallies since they began in October -  Volkswagen decided to keep its glass-walled manufacturing plant dark, to demonstrate that the company 'stands for an open, free and democratic society.' The latest wave of protests came just days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel used her New Year's Day message to spurn the rallies which she views as racist. Some 18,000 anti-immigrant protesters marched through the streets of Dresden in the lastest round of demonstrations about what they say is the growing influence of Islam . The rallies, attended by opponents of Germany's immigration and asylum policies, have become an almost weekly event in the east German city of Dresden in recent months . In defiance of her words, some 18,000 people turned out in Dresden, carrying signs with slogans such as 'wake up'. The crowd also chanted 'we are the people' and 'lying press' as they passed television cameras and waved Germany's black, red and gold flag. They also brandished posters bearing slogans such as 'Against religious fanaticism and every kind of radicalism'. One poster  called for 'potatoes rather than doner kebabs', a swipe at ethnic Turks who at around three million represent Germany's largest immigrant community. But similar rallies in Berlin and the western city of Cologne were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance. But some of the protestors, including in Berlin (pictured), were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters, including these from the Alliance against Racism, who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance . Members of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) also joined the counter protest in Berlin, where police said just 300 anti-immigration protesters turned up . One person in Cologne - where just 250 anti-immigrant demonstrators turned up - waved a flag saying 'I love immigration' German Justice Minister Heiko Maas (centre) and Berlin's Integration Senator Dilek Kolat (right) also joined the demonstration in Berlin to protest against a rally by the mounting right-wing populist movement . Only about 250 PEGIDA supporters showed up in Cologne - home to a large Muslim population - compared to about ten times that number of counter-demonstrators. PEGIDA was even forced to call off its demonstration early, after organisers reported being blocked from marching along their planned route, police said. Similarly in Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate. Justice Minister Heiko Maas said at the Berlin counter-demonstration: ''Germany is a country where refugees are welcome and the silent majority must not remain silent but rather go out onto the streets and show itself,.' In Stuttgart, where there were not even a planned protest, there were reports of 8,000 people demonstrating against the movement. Supports of the left-wing group 'Die Linke' held up a poster reading 'Refugees welcome! Against racism and right-wing violence' in Berlin . In Rostock, north east Germany, hundreds turned out in a show of solidarity against the anti-immigrant campaigns . In Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route . The protestors were planning on marching from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate but were blocked by those campaigning against the protest . The increase in counter-protests came following Mrs Merkel's New Year's address, in which she urged Germans to stay away from the Dresden rallies. 'We need to ... say that right-wing extremism, hostility towards foreigners and anti-Semitism should not be allowed any place in our society,' Merkel said on Monday in the eastern town of Neustrelitz. But, at Monday's rally, PEGIDA organizer Kathrin Oertel slammed the speech, telling the crowd 'in Germany we have political repression again.' 'Or how would you see it when we are insulted or called racists or Nazis openly by all the political mainstream parties and media for our justified criticism of Germany's asylum seeker policies and the non-existent immigration policy,' she asked the cheering crowd. Germany has some of the world's most liberal asylum rules, partly due to its Nazi past. The number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany, many from the Middle East, jumped to around 200,000 last year -- four times as many as in 2012. PEGIDA supporters, pictured last night in Dresden, has unsettled Germany's political establishment since its first protest in October . PEGIDA organizer Kathrin Oertel slammed Angela Merkel's speech at Monday's rally, telling the crowd 'in Germany we have political repression again' The highest number yet of participants took part in a demonstration called by anti-immigration group PEGIDA in Dresden, seen as the birthplace of the movement . PEGIDA has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated' It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups. Pictured: Demonstrators hold banner saying: 'Don't bite the hands that feeds you! We are the people!' But PEGIDA has unsettled Germany's political establishment. The first protest in October was attended by just a few hundred people, but the movement quickly snowballed. Since then, PEGIDA has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated.' 'PEGIDA is for resistance against an anti-woman political ideology that emphasizes violence, but not against integrated Muslims living here,' the group said. It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups. Their leaders have singled out Muslim immigrants in their speeches, but the movement has broadened into one against immigrants from all backgrounds. A particular target has been 'economic refugees', or asylum seekers who they say are seeking a better standard of living in Germany.","Cologne Cathedral, one of Germany's most famous landmarks, plunged into darkness in silent protest against rally .

"A potentially deadly cold snap is set to sweep across half of the United States on Monday, bringing freezing temperatures, strong winds, heavy rain and snow to more than 50million people. A series of 'dangerously cold' arctic air masses will strike almost everywhere east of the Rockies - and will remain for much of the week, Weather Channel meteorologist, Roy Lucksinger, said. They are likely to send temperatures plummeting to 10 to 20 degrees below average - rivaling last January's arctic outbreak that led to the widespread use of the term 'polar vortex.' Scroll down for video . Chilling out: Temps on Monday were expected to be between 10 and 20 degrees below normal as Winter Storm Gorgon blew in from the northwest . One-two punch: Tuesday temperatures were expected to drop even further in the Midwest and Northeast as arctic chills sweep in for a second time this week . 'We're looking at 50million people in 24 states seeing some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,' CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. 'This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous. Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. A second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday.' Speaking to USA Today, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin added: 'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well. It's going to drive all the way down south.' According to the service, heavy rain and mountain snow will strike the Northwest on Monday, while a cold blast of arctic air will sweep across the Midwest. Then, on Tuesday, a second, 'brutal' blast of frigid air will hit the region, spreading to the Plains and the East. This will last until at least Thursday, it is predicted. Worrying: A series of 'dangerously cold'  arctic air masses will strike almost everywhere east of the Rockies on Monday (pictured), bringing freezing temperatures to more than 50million people, forecasters have said . Deadly: The first arctic blast on Monday will be followed by a second on Tuesday. They are likely to send temperatures plummeting up to 35 degrees below average. Above, a graphic of the blasts expected this week . Snowy weather: In the northern Plains, Ohio Valley and upper Midwest, temperatures could drop to minus 45 degrees.

Another accident: A police officer stands near the scene of a crash in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Sunday . Playing: Aleks Mcelheny, three, of Plainfield, eats snow as he sleds at Johnson Park, in Walker, Michigan . 'The first push of cold air is pretty cold, but not as cold as the second shot starting Tuesday,' Frank Strait, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, said, describing it as a 'one-two punch'. His colleague, senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski, added that gusty winds accompanying the arctic blasts will result in much lower temperatures than usual - and ones that could prove deadly. 'Because of this, the air will be beyond painful, reaching dangerous and life-threatening levels in  the Midwest and Northeast for those who spend a significant amount of time outdoors without proper protection,' he said, adding that the freezing daytime temperatures will only drop further at night. For many parts of the country, temperatures will reach highs of just zero to the teens and twenties. People take to the hill at Johnson Park to sled, in Walker, Michigan, on Sunday amid weather warnings . A snow-covered barn sits along Baumhoff Avenue in Sparta, Michigan, following snowfall over the weekend . In Chicago - which will see the tail end of a storm that could leave up to as much as five inches of snow by early Tuesday - residents are expected to see highs of just zero degrees on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in New York, rainy showers will give way to cold air. By Thursday, the Big Apple 'will be lucky if it hits 20' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees, forecasters said. A storm system will also bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York. In the south, even Atlanta, Georgia, will see low temperatures of around 15 degrees on Monday and Tuesday - but there is not expected to be any ice to accompany the chilly weather. And in the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the Seattle area - and could mean substantial snowfall in the Cascades. Clearing away snow: Doc Johnson clears snow from his driveway in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Sunday . On te water: 'We're looking at 50million people in 24 states seeing some of the coldest weather that we have seen in quite some time,' CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. Above, the Grand River in Michigan . Snow could also coat portions of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, as well as the more western states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Further south in San Francisco - a part of the U.S. that desperately needs rain - skies will be sunny. A dip in the jet stream means cold air from Canada and points north is plummeting into the eastern two-thirds of the United States. However, forecasters are shying away from calling it a 'polar vortex'. The forthcoming cold can be linked to the dip, according to Michael Musher, with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Snow covers a path at Millennium Park, in Walker, Michigan, on Sunday. Temperatures are set to plummet . This is because the air is coming from near the north pole, he said. But the low-pressure system itself isn't going to sink into the United States this year, just the temperatures that precede it. Wind chill warnings and advisories are currently active in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast. By the end of the week, temperatures are expected to lift slightly, forecasters said. Over the weekend, snow and ice fell in the eastern United States, while violent thunderstorms were seen in the deep south, including two tornadoes in Mississippi, AccuWeather.com reported. Heavy snow also fell in the Great Lakes region, causing several traffic accidents in Michigan. Another chilly place: Chicago is also set to be hit by another round of snow early this week.

"A California zoo has begun holding regular iPad gaming sessions - for its penguins. Staff at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach say its animals love to play a game originally designed for cats. However, instead of using paws, they peck at the screen to try and catch a stray mouse that runs around in the game. Jeremy, a Magellanic Penguin at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach playing the iPad app Game For Cats. Instead of using paws, he pecks at the screen to try and catch a stray mouse. Magellanic Penguins were named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in the mid-1500s through what is now called the Strait of Magellan. They build their nests during the breeding season along the rocky, sandy beaches of the southern coasts of Argentina and Chile and on the Falkland Islands. A temperate species, Magellanic Penguins are usually about two to two-and-a-half feet tall and weigh between six and fifteen pounds when fully grown. Sara Mandel at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach said she originally tried out the game at home. 'It's a game called 'Game for Cats' - but we found the penguins like to hang out with it. 'I'd originally bought it for my cats, but I put in down in their enclosure and two of the penguins just started pecking at it.' The team were astonished when the birds instantly took to the game, chasing an on-screen mouse and managing to score highly on the game by tapping their beaks on the screen. Two Magellanic penguins, Jeremy and Newson, began the game, but Mandel says many of the animals now regularly play. 'The animals all started playing with it. 'We even find they get so engrossed we can examine them.' However, she is hopeful that an ever better game could come along for the animals. 'We know they like this game, and we know they like shiny objects - so we are hoping someone will put the two together.' Zoo volunteer Hugo Ryono first experiments with the game at the zoo in 2013. He had the idea after a discussion with keepers about the iPad app 'Game for Cats' and wondering if it could be used as an enrichment aid for the penguins. The animals have even started top play the game together . Sara Mandel at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach said she originally tried out the game at home. 'Just like cats penguins are very . curious and the idea of these birds following a virtual mouse on a . screen was just too appealing to me not to try out. 'Dusting off my old iPad 1 and loading Game for Cats app on it we set up a penguin video arcade in the exhibit last week.' Video from Cool Hunting . 'Sure enough when Jeremy and Newsom . noticed the iPad in the exhibit they both waddled on over. Jeremy was . the first to try it out but Newsom was the one that really got into it. 'Stalking the virtual mouse intently he tried to pick it up repeatedly with his beak. 'Newsom especially seemed to like the squeak that the mouse made when he put his beak on the virtual critter. 'The mouse was self reinforcing for this penguin. 'Newsom set the penguin high score of 1600 for the game.'","App called Game for Cats was originally designed for feline players .

"A New Hampshire man accused of abducting a teenage girl, holding her captive and repeatedly raping her over the course of nine months pleaded not guilty after waving his right to an arraignment. Nathaniel Kibby, 34, was charged last month with 205 criminal counts in connection to the kidnapping of a 14-year-old girl at gunpoint in October 2013. Kibby was arrested in July, a week after the girl was reunited with her family. If looks could kill: Nathaniel Kibby (pictured in July) pleaded not guilty after waving his right to an arraignment in the October 2013 abduction and sexual abuse of a 14-year-old girl . Kibby has been indicted on charges he kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, imprisoned her, and sexually assaulted her over nine months at his New Hampshire home . Court documents made public in mid-December allege that Kibby repeatedly raped the girl, who is now 16, and used death threats, a stun gun, zip ties and a shock collar to control her. The Gorham resident had been scheduled to be arraigned in Coos County Thursday and in Carroll County Friday, but last week his public defender waived the arraignments and entered not guilty pleas on his client's behalf, reported the Boston Globe Monday. Kibby is accused of abducting the teenager on her way home on October 9, 2013, in the White Mountains town of Conway. Despite a massive search and widespread public outreach, there was no trace of her except for a letter she wrote to her mother in November of that year. List of crimes: Kibby, 34, was charged in December with 205 counts of abduction and rape . The teen returned just as mysteriously in July, a week before Kibby was arrested. Media outlets repeatedly published the girl's name and picture after she disappeared and when she returned home. The girl's family and prosecutors have asked that her name and image no longer be published because they fear the publicity and association with sexual abuse will slow her recovery from what they call a horrific trauma. Kibby, 34, was indicted in Carroll and Coos counties on charges including kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, criminal threatening, illegal use of a gun and illegal use of an electronic restraint device. In the records released last month, more than 160 of the indictments were heavily blacked-out. Kibby has been held on $1million bail since his arrest at his home in Gorham, about 30 miles from the girl's home. He has a criminal history dating to 1998, including convictions on simple assault, criminal trespass and breach of bail conditions, according to court records. Police said the girl was last seen after leaving Kennett High School in Conway. She walked her normal route down a busy road toward home and sent several texts to a friend between 2.30pm and 3pm. But when her mother returned from work, the girl was not home. Prosecutors said she had no way to travel or get food, shelter or other necessities on her own. They said she 'went dark' and could not be traced through social media for the duration of her absence. Kibby has been held on $1 million bail since his arrest at his home in Gorham, about 30 miles from the girl's home . Police did reveal in December 2013 that she had written home to her mother. When the letter surfaced, FBI Special Agent In Charge Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility the girl had run away, but someone could still be coercing her into staying away from home. The contents of the letter have never been released. Lawyers hired by the victim's family said in August she suffered 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence' during her months of captivity. Court documents revealed that the teen told investigators she learned her captor's name from a cookbook he had handed her. A police officer who has known Kibby for two decades said he's very bright, opinionated and thrives on conflict. In an interview in July, former Conway Lt. Chris Perley said Kibby, 'was smart, but he was also brutally myopic in whatever view he had. You could not shake him or redirect him in the way he saw the world.' Kibby grew up and attended school in Conway.  He worked as a machinist at two gun makers — Green Mountain Rifle Barrel Co. and E.M.M. Precision.","Nathaniel Kibby, 34, was charged in December with 205 counts in kidnapping and rape of 14-year-old girl .

"A Harvard law professor who was named alongside Prince Andrew in his 'sex slave' case has insisted he has never even met his accuser. Alan Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', was named in court documents by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with friends of U.S. billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, including Prince Andrew. The woman, identified as Virginia Roberts, was just 17 at the time, making her a minor. But on Monday, Alan Dershowitz appeared on the Today show to speak out against the claims, which have resurfaced in a civil suit against the U.S. government for how it handled Epstein's case. Speaking from Miami, Dershowitz insisted the woman's claims against him are 'totally false and made up' and he is 'completely and absolutely' innocent. Scroll down for video . Anger: Prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz spoke out on the Today show on Monday morning to deny claims he had sex with an underage girl, as she has claimed in a civil lawsuit . 'I don't even know who she is,' he said of the woman. 'I've never seen her. I've never met her. I don't know who she is.' He pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter. 'I was never out of the sight of my wife,' he said. He added that the woman has also accused him of having sex with her while they were on Epstein's planes, but he called upon her lawyers to check the manifests of the journeys - because he was never on the flights, he said. Dershowitz then turned on the woman's lawyers, Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards, accusing them of failing to properly investigate her claims. 'If they had checked my travel records, if they had asked me and I could have given them the names of people who were witnesses - they would know the story is totally untrue,' he said. 'It's the legal equivalent of scribbling something on a toilet stall and then running away.' Dershowitz called for the two men to be disbarred for their 'unethical' practice. 'They will rue the day they filed this,' he said. 'They will not get away with this. There will be legal proceedings. The truth will come out and... these two unethical attorneys will be disbarred.' Support: Dershowitz's wife of 30 years, Carolyn, has said her husband 'is the least likely person in the entire world that this would be true of.' They are pictured with their daughter Ella, center . Questions: Prince Andrew is photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001, left, and she is also pictured with her father, right, when she was seven. Roberts accused the prince and Dershowitz of having sex with her . Mr Cassell told DailyMail.com that he and Mr Edwards would not be responding to 'specific claims of indignation by anyone'. 'We have been informed of Mr Dershowitz's threats based on the factual allegations we have made in our recent filing,' he said in a statement. 'We carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them. We have also tried to depose Mr Dershowitz on these subjects, although he has avoided those deposition requests. 'Nevertheless, we would be pleased to consider any sworn testimony and documentary evidence Mr Dershowitz would like to provide which he contends would refute any of our allegations.' He added that attorney Jack Scarola, who is handling related litigation, has invited Dershowitz to provide sworn testimony and any evidence - including his passport travel pages and photographs of him at Epstein's properties - relating to his part in the suit by January 19. Cassell added: 'We intend only to litigate the relevant issues in Court and not to play into any sideshow. We feel that is in our clients' best interest and consequently that is what we are doing.' Also on Monday, Dershowitz's wife of 30 years, Carolyn, came to his defense and denied that they had ever met Roberts. 'Anyone that knows us would find it laughable if it weren't so serious,' she told Inside Edition. 'He is the least likely person in the entire world that this would be true of.' She said that they had been to Epstein's island  - but had no recollection of meeting the girl. 'She's totally unfamiliar to me,' she said. 'I was on that island with Alan. Our daughter was there. Our friends met us for dinner. We were together the whole time.' Speaking to the Today show, Dershowitz added that he would welcome a full investigation into the woman's claims so that people see he had no part in it. 'I'm not trying to silence her,' he said. 'I challenged her to repeat the statement to the press so I can sue for her defamation... She has studiously refused to.' Lawyers: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied . In an interview with BBC Radio 4 over the weekend, he also urged the Duke of York to fight back. 'You cannot allow these allegations to hang above you,' Dershowitz said in the interview. 'The first question you have to ask yourself when you are charged with a crime like this is, ""Is there any conceivable possibility you did it?"" and if the answer to that is 'no', you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you.' The prince, who has cut short a vacation to travel back to the U.K., has issued a strongly-worded denial, with Buckingham Palace saying 'any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue'. The claim by the woman is part of a U.S. civil case she and three other women have made against the government for how it handled the case against Epstein, a former friend of the Duke. The women claim the government violated victims' rights when it made the plea deal in 2008. Epstein – who was suspected for decades of paying for sex with dozens of underage girls – was only ever convicted and jailed for 18 months on a single charge of soliciting paid sex with minors. Her lawyers claim that Prince Andrew had lobbied the government over Epstein's case. In court documents the woman accuses Epstein, the Prince and his friend the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - the daughter of crooked tycoon Robert - of abusing her when she was underage. She says she was told to 'give the prince whatever he demanded' by Epstein. Old friends: Prince Andrew is pictured with former friend and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 2011 . Solemn: Fellow skiers watch as Prince Andrew leaves his Swiss chalet this weekend, bound for Britain . The prince stayed friends with him despite his conviction and they were seen together in 2011 after Epstein's release from jail. Her father, Sky Roberts, has also spoken out to say that Prince Andrew should be prosecuted if the claims were true. The suit, which is civil not criminal, has been filed against the government and not Prince Andrew so he does not face any penalties. Over the weekend, police sources in the U.K. said that the Duke of York could face an investigation if Roberts makes a formal complaint against him. Mr Roberts, 58, also claimed his daughter had been introduced to the Queen while visiting London with Epstein - but Buckingham Palace has denied the allegations. 'There is nothing to suggest the claim is true,' a spokesperson said. 'We have no record of such a meeting.' In a newly-released statement, the alleged victim said she would continue to fight for justice. 'I am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse,' she said. 'It appears that I am now being unjustly victimized again. These types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent and the reason why I did for a long time. That trend should change. I'm not going to be bullied back into silence.' See below for video . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .

"A couple scuba diving in a frigid lake found a GoPro camera that had been lost there six months before - and managed to track down its owners and return the footage of their dream road trip. Allisa Oliger and her husband Mark found the camera, encrusted with mussels, 40ft below the surface of Lake Powell, Utah, while diving there on New Year's day. The camera, plucked out of the freezing water, had been there for six months, when it was dropped by a group of four friends who had filled the memory card with footage and snaps of their voyage. Scroll down for video . Quite the find: Mark Oliger poses with the GoPro camera he found 40ft under Lake Powell in Utah on New Year's Day . Road trip: Dan, holding the GoPro stick, and his buddies took stacks of images of their week-long trip across the country . Dream trip: The camera contained footage of Dan Burkovskiy, right, and his three best friends, who went on a summer road trip from Massachusetts to California . Accident: The friends, pictured above recording each other jumping into the lake with GoPros, had taken extensive footage of their voyage - and the rescued camera will add even more . Dan Burkovskiy, who owned the device, had been distraught at losing the footage loaded with images and video of his trip, which took them from Massachusetts to California. Along the way they took in sights like Niagara Falls, Chicago, Sioux Falls, Mount Rushmore, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. Burkovskiy, a logistics manager from Los Angeles, had been planning the trip for a year with his cousin and two other friends who have known each other since they were teenagers. They lost the camera in Lake Powell, another stop on the list, when they capsized their kayaks for fun before heading off. Burkovskiy said: 'We kayaked around Lake Powell, and my friend decided to be funny and flip the kayaks over just to take that one last dip' - which is when the camera fell out. He had given it up for lost after it vanished in July, but was overjoyed when the Oligers worked out who he was from the footage and managed to track him down online, Fox31 Denver reported. Crusty: The GoPro was covered in mussels when the Oligers plucked it from the bottom of Lake Powell . Allisa Oliger, who lives in Durango, Colorado, explained her story to the station. She said: 'I went on YouTube and in the search box I typed in ""2014 cross country road trip"".

As the ash cloud billows into the night sky a barrage of lightning bolts crackle from deep within it – creating a mesmerising scene that looks like the entrance to the underworld. Scroll down for video . German photographer Martin Rietze, 50, captured the stunning photos while visiting the volatile Sinabung volcano in Indonesia . As the ash cloud billows into the night sky a barrage of lightning bolts crackle from deep within it, creating a fascinating scene . It is believed that the collision of fine ash grains in the air creates huge amounts of static electricity, resulting in a spectacular electrical storm. While it is an amazing display the 8,000ft volcano, in North Sumatra, has proven to be deadly since it erupted in 2010 after being dormant for an estimated 400 years. On this occasion some small villages were wiped out by the lava flow and many acres of farmland were buried by ash, the photographer said. Known as a pyroclastic flow, the deadly mix of burning hot ash, gas and lava can quickly blanket large areas, exterminating anything and everything in its path. The 8,000ft volcano, in North Sumatra, has proven to be deadly since it erupted in 2010 after being dormant for an estimated 400 years . On several occasions the Sinabung volcano has erupted and blanketed villages and surrounding farmland in severe feet of ash . But if that wasn't destructive enough, the Sinabung volcano oozes rivers of scorching hot magma and creates blasts of swirling heat tornadoes. And despite the obvious dangers, this didn't stop Martin, 50, from photographing the explosive action. He said: ‘Pyroclastic flows are mainly silent, gliding along at high speeds like a hovercraft. They are absolutely deadly, all life forms that come in to contact with it would die instantly. ‘Seeing such a strong and powerful pyroclastic flow from very near is indeed a little bit frightening.' Photographer Martin Rietze said some small villages were wiped out by lava flow while others were covered in a layer of thick ash . Mr Rietze, an enthusiast who travels the world to photograph eruptions, said catching the volcano at its highest level phase was 'pure luck' Known as a pyroclastic flow, the deadly mix of burning hot ash, gas and rock can quickly blanket large areas . Martin said: ‘Nobody was killed by this particular eruption but a few weeks later during its lower activity, one single but exceptionally strong pyroclastic flow did indeed kill some nearby observers.’ He said a few small villages were hit by the lava flow and ‘burned completely’, but more villages and surrounding farmland were covered in three feet of ash. He added: ‘All crops were destroyed and its inhabitants were evacuated. ‘The mini tornadoes are caused by the hot air from the pyroclastic flow mixing with surrounding air which generates high momentum, spinning air combined with fine dust and ash. Crops were destroyed and residents were forced to flee their homes after the Sinabung volcano erupted and spewed molten rock and ash . Martin Rietze poses for a photograph as lava spews from the mouth of the Sinabung volcano in North Sumatra, Indonesia . ‘A few days before, while standing near to a lava field on Fogo Island, such a tornado formed and hit me. ‘Hats, backpacks and equipment were sent flying through the air for hundreds of metres, I was completely encased in dust. ‘Although a mixture of low and high activity had occurred over the months, catching the volcano at its highest level phase was pure luck.’","Photographer Martin Rietze captured the fascinating scene at the volatile Sinabung volcano in North Sumatra .

"Parents have told of their horror after the body of a young woman was found outside a primary school. Three people were arrested on suspicion of murder the body, believed to be that of a woman in her early 20s, was discovered in an outside doorway at Harlescott Junior School in Shrewsbury just before midnight. It came after concerns were raised for the safety of a local, West Mercia Police said, but no official identification has yet taken place. The woman is not believed to have been connected with the school. An officer found the woman after a search of the grounds. Two men - aged 32 and 39 - and a 31-year-old woman are all being questioned by detectives over the death. Scroll down for video . Three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman's body was found outside a primary school in Shrewsbury . The body of a woman, thought to be in her early 20s, was discovered in a doorway at Harlescott Junior School in Shrewsbury just before midnight . An officer for West Mercia police discovered the body after concerns were raised for the safety of a local woman . Pupils had been set to return from their Christmas holidays today but the school in Featherbed Lane remains shut while investigations continue. A force spokesman said a detailed forensic examination of the scene was taking place, with officers hoping to have completed their work so the school can reopen on Wednesday. A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said: 'Pupils were due to return to school tomorrow following the Christmas holidays but the decision has been taken to keep the school closed while investigations continue. 'Police hope to have completed their examination of the site tomorrow to allow the school to reopen on Wednesday. A force spokesman said a detailed forensic examination of the scene was taking place, with officers hoping to have completed their work so the school can reopen on Wednesday . Pupils had been set to return from their Christmas holidays today but the school in Featherbed Lane remains shut while investigations continue . 'A date and time for the post-mortem has not been set yet. 'No more information regarding the deceased will be made available before formal identification has taken place. 'The deceased's next of kin has been informed. 'No additional information is available at this point.' The body was found just 500 metres further along the same road where Julie Mercer, 47, was found dead at local business Shrewsbury Transport Ltd on Christmas Eve. A man was arrested on suspicion of her murder but has been bailed while detectives continue their investigation. Police are not linking the two murders and believe they are unconnected. Mother-of-three Georgina Hughes, 39, whose eight-year-old daughter goes to the school, said: 'As a parent it is very worrying. 'They have very high security fences so I have no idea how they have got in there. The body was found in a doorway by a side entrance into the school. 'So they have managed to get well and truly on the site, which is also very concerning. 'I'm not sure whether a teacher or staff member found the body or not - but it is very shocking nonetheless. 'The school has been closed today anyway due to a personal development day and will probably be tomorrow now as well. 'The sooner we can get back to normality the better because it feels quite unnerving ' Another 79-year-old neighbour, who did not want to be named, added: 'I have lived on this street for 30 years and I have never known anything like it. Two men - aged 32 and 39 - and a 31-year-old woman are all being questioned by detectives over the death . A spokesperson for West Mercia Police said: 'Pupils were due to return to school tomorrow following the Christmas holidays but the decision has been taken to keep the school closed while investigations continue' 'This is a nice and peaceful street and always has been, but maybe its just a sign of the times. Unfortunately these things seem to be happening all over the place.' Harlescott Junior School caters for 277 boys and girls from the age of seven to 11. It received a rating of 'Good' in its most recent Ofsted inspection in July 2013. Joe Thomas, 33, whose house backs onto the school fields, said: 'I came back from work earlier and saw all the police. 'I think the people were arrested here at the back of the field. Loads of people go on the school field to mess about. 'It's quite far from the front of the school where the body was so maybe they did a runner.' One 32-year-old father, whose six-year-old son attends the school, added: 'The school has been very proactive in getting in touch with parents to keep us informed. 'But it sends shivers down your spin to think there was a dead body in the playground where your children are playing. 'Thank goodness the school was closed - the thought of a young child returning from their Christmas holidays to find a corpse is like something from a horror movie. 'It doesn't give me great comfort about the security of the place - as people can get on site so easily. 'I know the people involved are probably unrelated to the school but I think I will still feel very nervous and apprehensive for a while about sending my boy off in the mornings.' Another neighbour added: 'It's terrible to hear what has happened. 'There is quite a big estate here behind the school but no-one is near the front so we don't know what happened. 'You see kids jumping the fence and going on the field on weekends but these people are older so it's rather strange.'

"The U.S. Air Force is reportedly so low on pilots that it is running its drone raids against ISIS on emergency staffing levels while hundreds quit from being overworked. According to an internal memo from a top general, the extra strain on the military's fleet of Predator and Reaper drones  has pushed the air force beyond 'red line' staffing levels thanks to Pentagon demands for more raids on ISIS. This in turn has caused fleet commanders to scoop up green recruits from flight school, which is now working at half capacity, according to a report in the Daily Beast. 'Not enough pilots': The Air Force is reportedly creaking under demands for more raids by drone aircraft, such as the MQ-9 Repaer pictured above in Iraq . Fight against ISIS: The increased demands are a consequences of the United States's air campaign against militants in the Middle East. Pictured is an explosion caused by air raids in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border . Flight school: Training programs to teach cadets, like those shown here, the knowledge needed to fly drone raids are reportedly running at just half capacity . According to the Beast, the drought at the bottom comes as more experienced drone pilots quit due to the demands of flying constant raids against the enemies of the United States. Pilots have reportedly had leave canceled and been forced to miss training courses which would normally lead to promotions in order paper over the cracks in the low staffing levels. The situation was revealed in a message reportedly from General Herbert J Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command (ACC). 'Extremely concerned': The memo reportedly came from General Herbert J Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command . The message, to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh, says Carlisle is 'extremely concerned' by problems in the drone fleet, especially in light of Pentagon requests for even more operations. He said that the air force is expected to field 260 drones every day in 65 CAPs (Combat Air Patrols) of four planes each. The Air Force is supposed to have 10 pilots for each CAP, who would fly the craft, operate weapons and also gather and monitor intelligence - 650 overall. The message explained that in emergencies they can get by with 553 pilots per day (8.5 per CAP) - but in reality they are running on no more than 520 pilots - a gap of 130. He wrote: 'ACC squadrons are currently executing steady-state, day-to-day operations (65 CAPs) at less than an 8:1 crew-to-CAP ratio. 'This directly violates our red line for RPA [remotely piloted aircraft] manning and combat operations'. The memo also dealt with the wider consequences of the extra pressure, which has reportedly cleaned out flight schools (Formal Training Units, or FTUs) and led to staff leaving. It said: 'Long-term effects of this continued OPSTEMPO [pace of operations] are manifested in declining retention among MQ-1/9 [drone] pilots, FTU [flight school] manning at less than 50 per cent, and enterprise-wide pilot manning hovering at about 84 per cent.' An unnamed official told the Beast: 'It’s at the breaking point, and has been for a long time. What’s different now is that the band-aid fixes are no longer working.' An Air Force spokesman told DailyMail.com it is 'mindful' of how the demands of its drone raids are affecting staff, and admitted keeping the raids together is a 'challenge'. Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Karns said: 'In order to meet combatant commander requirements, and in response to SECDEF [Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel's] direction, the Air Force surged MQ-1/9 CAPs nine times in the last eight years, and has successfully sustained those operations to date.' 'We're mindful of the toll this has had on the force and recognize Airmen remain the service's most vital resource. 'Continued sustainment of surge operations will have potential long-term impacts on training, safety, retention, manning, sustainment, and combat capability.' 'Retention problem': The memo says that more experienced pilots are leaving the force too.

"With a combined weight of 54st, they say they are ‘too fat to work’. But that did not stop Stephen Beer, 45, and wife Michelle, 43, being able to splash out £3,000 on their wedding – as the bill was footed by the taxpayer. The couple’s big day – which saw £1,000 spent on catering, including £450 for their favourite kebab takeaway for the evening buffet – was funded almost entirely from benefits. Scroll down for video . Stephen Beer and Michelle Coombe, are from Plymouth, where 60 per cent of adults are overweight. The couple, who weigh more than 54 stone between them and claim £2,000 a month in benefits, have wed in a £3,000 ceremony - paid for by the taxpayer . The couple were filmed by the makers of Benefits: Too Fat To Work, a Channel 5 documentary about benefit claimants who claim their weight prevents them from working . Mr Beer, who has already been married five times, weighs 31 stone and has not worked in five years. His partner Ms Coombe has never worked and at 23 stone claims she is too big to find a job . Mr Beer, who was marrying for the sixth time, weighs 31st and had to have a suit specially made for the occasion. By contrast his 23st wife became a bride for the first time and wore a white gown for the registry office ceremony and church blessing that followed. Their 50 guests were treated to a three-course meal at the reception, followed later by the buffet. The couple’s story was featured on the Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Too Fat To Work last night and viewers were shown how paramedics were called to the reception in Plymouth, Devon, before Mr Beer was taken to hospital feeling unwell. Mr Beer can't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time, he relies on a council carer to get washed and dressed . He admits his 'hygiene would go out of the window' if the personal cleaner, who costs £8,000 a year and is paid for by the taxpayer, did not attend to him twice a day . Despite being jobless and on a weight management course, the couple can be seen treating themselves to kebabs after they went to a weigh in and realised they had lost a few pounds. The takeaway cost almost £12 . Producers followed them as they organised the ceremony - including canapes and a buffet provided by their favourite kebab shop . The groom, who suffers from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other problems linked to his weight, had a blood clot on the lung and instead of a honeymoon he spent nine days in hospital. He can only stand for a limited period before becoming breathless and his wife said the wedding day trip to hospital was no surprise. Mrs Beer, who has not had a job during her adult life, said: ‘I reckon Stephen will be on benefits for most of his life.’ Mr Beer used to run a cleaning business and had to give up work six years ago following a stroke. Interviewed about his benefits on the documentary, he said: ‘Is it right? Of course not. But at the end of the day I did work. I have worked, I haven’t sat on my a*** all the time. 'I have done some work and so really, why not?’ The programme also follows Amy Johnstone (right)who at  just 18-years-old already weighs 32 stone . She is virtually housebound and unable to do the most basic things for herself, including wash, and as such is entitled to £240 a fortnight in Disability Benefits . Her mother Sharon (right) - who herself is 20 stone - helps her daughter to shower and claims that being on benefits has contributed to her weight problem . The couple receive around £1,700 a month in benefits. The rent on their one-bedroom flat is paid for by the taxpayer, and a carer comes twice daily to clean and help Mr Beer dress, but the taxpayer pays the £8,000-a-year cost. Mr Beer also uses a specially strengthened mobility scooter, provided at public expense. He insists he wants a job but says no one will give him work because of his weight. And yesterday, he blamed the Government for being too generous to those on benefits. Speaking on ITV’s This Morning programme, Mr Beer said: ‘The Government is making it easy for people like us. The Government is making it easy for people on benefits.’ He said he didn’t think he deserved anything, adding: ‘I’m the one who put myself in this situation, no one else.’ However, he insisted he was now suffering from ‘prejudice’. He said he recently applied for an office job but claims he was turned down because he was too overweight. Mr Beer said he became so overweight because of an addiction to food, but is now trying to sort himself out and plans to go to a boot camp later this month. The couple both attended weight loss groups and courses at public expense in the run up to the wedding. Commenting on the documentary – which also features other overweight people on benefits – weight-loss expert Steve Miller said: ‘Being obese shouldn’t entitle you to benefits. These people need to be motivated to turn their lives around and become useful members of society.’ Pictured is Amy as a child. She says she could not physically work even if she wanted to . Amy is pictured as a child. Her mother has to check she is breathing while she is asleep and she cannot sleep on her back in case her own fat suffocates her . The couple also made a controversial appearance on ITV's This Morning to discuss why they took part in the documentary . Mr Beer defended his inability to work, saying the employers were prejudiced against fat people . He also told host Phillip Schofield that he did not always eat kebabs, and that off camera he and his wife were eating 'healthy food' A viewer poll decided that no, being fat was not a valid reason not to go to work .","Stephen Beer and Michelle Coombe claim they are too fat to work .

"A Boston police officer of 16 years has been charged with beating an Uber taxi driver who dropped him off at the wrong location. Michael Doherty, 40, from South Boston, started yelling abuse at the driver when he accused him of going to the wrong destination. He then attacked him and allegedly made racial slurs against the victim. A police report said veteran officer Michael Doherty beat an Uber driver who dropped him in the wrong place . According to a police report, veteran officer Doherty started yelling abuse at the driver when he started travelling to the wrong destination in the early hours of Sunday morning. When the driver stopped his car at the location at 2.45am - on the corner of East 2nd Street and M Street in South Boston - the veteran police officer said they were in the wrong place. According to a report obtained by the Boston Globe, Doherty said: 'What, you think I'm stupid, you (expletive),' followed by a racist term for Latinos. The victim said Doherty then physically assaulted him and so he ran out of his taxi. Once outside the car, the victim claimed Doherty got in to the front seat and drove off. The victim, who was aided by a passing motorist, followed the victim to East 1st Street and Farragut Road where Doherty stopped and exited the Uber cab. He walked towards the Uber driver and the man who provided help - who was black - and reportedly said, 'what do you want, you n*****?' He then allegedly hit the Uber driver to the ground and repeatedly punched him as the other man tried to pull Doherty off. When the driver stopped his taxi on the corner of East 2nd Street and M Street in South Boston (pictured) - the veteran police officer said they were in the wrong place and then physically assaulted him . Doherty, a Boston police officer of 16 years, has been put on administrative leave by the force (headquarters pictured) pending the outcome of the charges filed against him . The police officer then fled the area before the police arrived. He was later identified, located and placed under arrest and charged him with assault and battery and using a motor vehicle without authority. Doherty has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the charges filed against him. The Boston Police Anti-Corruption Unit said it was actively reviewing the 'facts and circumstance surrounding this incident.' Uber, the popular ride-sharing service, said in a statement their thoughts were with the driver, adding they have barred Doherty from using the service and 'stand ready to assist law enforcement' in the investigation. Uber, established in 2009, is present in dozens of countries and recently attracted investment which values it at $40bn.","Michael Doherty, 40, has been charged with beating an Uber taxi driver .

The Windows maker bought the Finnish technology firm in a £4.4 billion deal in April, and has now shifted its Lumia brand of phones into its own Windows Phone range. Mobiles expert Rob Kerr from comparison site uSwitch says that this new smartphone shows there is no sentiment in the dog-eat-dog world of smartphones. 'By laying the Nokia brand name to rest, Microsoft is sending the message there's no room for nostalgia in the fast-moving mobile market. 'The path of least resistance would have been to use the Nokia name as a crutch, but Microsoft has loftier visions. 'And it's a tactic we've seen before when Sony dropped the Ericsson brand.

"The seven-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed the four other passengers has been described as 'one remarkable young lady' by officials investigating the accident. Sailor Gutzler was the sole survivor of the plane crash in Kuttawa, Kentucky, that killed her parents, sister and cousin. She is now being looked after by her grandparents. Investigators hope Sailor might assist them in determining what brought the plane down. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Heidi Moats said: 'Having someone that is a witness (is) always helpful in the investigation, it gives us kind of a story line.' Sailor Gutzler, seven, walked barefoot with broken bones through thorns in the dark to find help . Sailor (pictured left and far right) saw her mother, father, and sister Piper (all pictured right) were dead . Sailor was called 'one remarkable young lady' by officials who hope she will help them in their investigation . 'Her voice was quivering': When police arrived, Sailor was so shaken she wasn't making any sense . Using survival techniques she picked up from her father, Sailor lit a stick from the burning wreckage to fashion a makeshift torch to guide her way through the Kentucky forest . She crossed two embankments and a river creek in darkness and near freezing temperatures, before she reached the house of Larry Wilkins, about three-quarters of a mile from the crash site. 'I opened the door and this little girl was standing there with bloody nose, bloody legs and bloody arms,' Mr Wilkins told NBC. 'Her voice was quivering. She told me her mom and dad were dead and she was in a plane crash and the plane was upside down. 'She was bleeding pretty bad, her legs were bleeding, her face had a bloody nose. She was barefoot, only had one sock on. She asked if she could stay here,' Wilkins recalled. He immediately called 911 and then cleaned up the bloodied girl with a washcloth. When police arrived, the little girl was so shaken up she could hardly make herself understood. The  plane, that was en route from Florida to Illinois, crashed over Kentucky on Friday night . Salvage workers carry away parts of the crashed Pipe PA-34 from the crash site in Kuttawa, Kentucky . Tight-knit: The family of four are from Nashville, Tennessee, and were on Florida on vacation. They are pictured here celebrating the birthday of Mr Gutzler with a plane cake . Sailor's cousin Sierra Wilder, 14, also died in the crash and was described by her mother as 'her best friend' A family spokesman said: 'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. 'We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.' In the wake of the disaster, relatives have set up a fund to provide for the girl. Lieutenant Brent White of Kentucky State Police said the situation was extraordinary. 'She literally fell out of the sky into a dark hole and didn't have anybody but her own will to live and get help for her family,' White told the Associated Press. 'Absolutely amazing.' He told NBC: 'She's upside down in an aircraft that's crash-landed, she is in shorts and a T-shirt, she's seven years old, she has broken bones, she pulls herself out of the aircraft, she's in a place where she doesn't see any lights, she walks through thorns, briers, a 12-foot ditch, and continues to walk in that environment with no shoes on until she sees a light on in a house.' Lt. White said emergency crews 'worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board, but ultimately it just wasn't meant to be.' A photo Mr Gutzler took of his daughters inside the plane a few days before the tragic accident . Sailor was taken to Lourdes hospital in Parducah, Kentucky for treatment and was released on Saturday morning. Sailor's parents Marty Gutzler, 48, and his wife Kimberly Gutzler, 46, sister Piper Gutzler, 9, and cousin Sierra Wilder, 14, all died in the crash. They were returning from visiting Sailor's adult brother at a naval base in Florida to their home in Nashville, Illinois. A longtime friend of the Gutzlers, Patrick Povolish, 61, told the St Louis Post Dispatch: 'This is a small community where everybody knows everybody and this will be devastating for the whole town. Larry Wilkins found a bloodied and distressed Sailor on his doorstep and took her in before calling 911 . The home of Larry Wilkins sits nestled in the woods - Sailor walked through the woods to his home for help . Mr Gutzler, who was flying the aircraft was an experienced pilot who had been piloting light aircraft since he was 16 and taught as a flight instructor. He had made the Florida to Illinois flight, 'many, many times' a family friend told NBC News. A photo on Facebook from his birthday shows Mr Gutzler with his wife and two young girls next to a plane birthday cake. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials said that the plane had reported engine problems shortly before it lost contact with air traffic controllers just before 6pm local time. The last contact was at 1,800 feet. Police received a phone call from Mr Wilkins about 30 minutes after the plane lost radio contact to report the crash and Sailor's survival.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the American-led invasion of Iraq left the country in chaos, in a rare criticism of Australia's strongest ally. Mr Abbott made the unusual remarks during a surprise visit to Baghdad. He has not ruled out sending more troops to the war-torn nation. 'Iraq is a country which has suffered a very great deal. First, decades of tyranny under Saddam Hussein. Then, the chaos and confusion that followed the American-led invasion. 'Most recently, the tumult, the dark age, which has descended upon Northern Iraq as a result of the Daesh death cult, but Australia will do what we can to help.' Wearing a leather jacket, Prime Minister Tony Abbott greeted diggers serving at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Compound . Mr Abbott made a rare criticism of US foreign policy in Iraq, saying the aftermath of the invasion had left the country in 'chaos and confusion' On the third leg of an unannounced visit to the troubled region, Mr Abbott held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in Dubai and visited an airbase. 'I certainly don't rule out doing what we reasonably can to make the world a safer place,' he said after the meeting. Australia is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and has deployed special forces troops to assist in training the local army. 'Because the ISIL or Daesh death cult has declared war on the world, including here and Australia.' Mr Abbott said he looked forward to further talks with Baghdad and coalition partners about what Australia 'can usefully do'. First visit to Iraq: Mr Abbott is pictured here with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi . The prime minister's latest comments and those he made after a meeting with Iraqi leader Haider Al-Abadi on Sunday have led to speculation Australia might be prepared to go beyond its limited commitment to the conflict. Back home, the Labor opposition is holding back bipartisan support for any expanded role. Instead it will wait for a detailed briefing from the government before revealing its position. Mr Abbott also rejected criticism of the secrecy surrounding his visit to Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. In a departure from previous practice, Australian media were excluded from covering the visit first-hand and were forced to rely on footage provided by the prime minister's office in Canberra. The opposition accused the government of pursuing a culture of secrecy, saying it was not in the national interest.

"Americans moving out of state in 2014 were most likely to head to places that were warmer and more affordable, such as the South and Southwest, according to studies by two major moving companies. The 47th annual report by Allied Van Lines showed that Illinois topped the list of states people are moving away from with 1,372 net moves, followed by Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and New Jersey. The states have remained in the top five since 2010, the company said. Go west: United Van Lines was one of the moving companies that offered a list of states Americans are migrating to and from. People seem to be leaving the Northeast and Midwest and going South . Source: Allied Van Lines . Source: Allied Van Lines . In its 38th annual report, released Friday, United Van Lines reports that New Jersey, New York, Illinois, North Dakota and West Virginia represented the states their clients exited the most last year. Illinois, where outbound moves represented 63 percent of total moves for the state, has ranked among the top five for the past six years, the company says. Michael Stoll, an economist with the department of public policy at the University of California in Los Angeles, said in a statement for United that migration patterns reflected long-term movement to the South and Southwest, where housing costs are lower, climates are less severe and job growth has been at or above the national average. United said Oregon was the most preferred destination for its clients, followed by South Carolina, North Carolina, Vermont and Florida. The company said 38 percent of its clients moving to Oregon were going for a new job while 29 percent cited retirement. Allied clients were most likely to move to Texas, Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and Colorado, the company said. The company said the most popular destinations were generally the same but the number of moves has increased with California, Oregon and Washington state showing the greatest increases for inbound moves. 'Trends demonstrate a heavy movement toward warm-weather, retirement-friendly states,' Lesli Bertoli, general manager and vice president of Allied, said in a statement. Illinois ranks top in Allied Van Lines' study of states most Americans are fleeing. Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey are both near the top of the list, as well .

"Here are three things to know about new U.S. sanctions against North Korea over a cyberattack on Sony Pictures, whose movie depicting the fictional assassination of North Korea's leader has infuriated Pyongyang, which denies responsibility for the cyberattack: . Pyongyang's rhetoric over the weekend, which included a vow that the new sanctions and America's 'inveterate repugnancy and hostility' would not weaken the North's 1.2-million-strong military, is probably directed as much at a domestic audience as it is at Washington. The United States imposed new sanctions Friday on North Korean government officials and the country's defense industry for a cyberattack against Sony, insisting that Pyongyang was to blame despite lingering doubts by the cyber community . Some North Korea watchers believe that sanctions help to insulate Pyongyang from taking responsibility for its failures, and allow Kim Jong Un, the 30-something leader who took power in late 2011 after his father's death, to better solidify his power and bolster his domestic image as a strong leader. Pyongyang, the argument goes, uses tension with the outside world, in general, and sanctions, in particular, to whip up always high anti-U.S. sentiment. This, in turn, allows the leadership to justify its inability to feed many of its people and the continuing push to develop nuclear bombs it says are needed to defend against Washington. The new measures are unlikely to make much of a difference in North Korea, which has been bombarded by sanctions for decades and which has woven an obsession with self-reliance into its national psyche. Some analysts say Washington and others have the ability, should they choose, to apply more severe financial measures to hurt the North's leadership. But many others point out that a raft of multilateral penalties from the United Nations, as well as national sanctions from Washington, Tokyo and others meant to punish the government and sidetrack its nuclear ambitions, have done nothing to derail Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear tipped missile that could reach America's mainland. The most recent sanctions, which target 10 North Korean government officials and three organizations, including Pyongyang's primary intelligence agency and state-run arms dealer, will have a limited impact because North Korea will likely assign other people or organizations to take over the work of those targeted, analysts say. The measures probably won't hurt recent efforts to improve ties between the rival Koreas. North and South Korea have been at each other's throats, both figuratively and literally, since the Korean Peninsula was divided at the end of World War II into a U.S. backed capitalist south and a Soviet-backed communist north. In the decades since they were founded in 1948, the Koreas have established elaborate patterns of communicating their intentions toward each other, even as they trade bombastic rhetoric and threats. The North's comments over the weekend have been largely viewed in Seoul as leaving the door open for warming ties as they didn't specifically criticize South Korea.","The United States imposed new sanctions Friday on North Korean government officials and the country's defense industry for a cyberattack against Sony .

"He was born weighing less than a bag of sugar and smaller than his father's hand. But Jett Morris' parents were simply relieved he was alive, having been told he would never survive and they should abort him. When his mother Mhairi's waters broke at just 20 weeks, doctors advised the pregnancy was 'non- viable - and prepared her for a termination. But she and husband Paul defied doctors' advice - and believe had it not been for their  determination, Jett - who is thriving and recently celebrated his first birthday - would not be here today. Tiny: Jett Morris was born prematurely at 25 weeks weighing just 1.4lbs - having survived for five weeks in the womb after his mother's waters broke. Doctors had repeatedly advised her to have an abortion . Happy: Jett's parents believe had it not been for their determination and decision to ignore doctors' advice, he would not here today. Despite being born so early, doctors say the one-year-old is perfectly healthy . Jett was born prematurely at 25 weeks weighing just 1.4lbs - having survived for five weeks in the womb after his mother's waters broke. But his parents say that before this, they were constantly pressured by medics at East Surrey Hospital to end the pregnancy. They claim staff gave them just five minutes to come to terms with a termination. However Mrs Morris refused - convinced her unborn baby was healthy - and five weeks later he was born. The 34-year-old said: 'They didn't see him as a child yet, they just called him a 'non-viable foetus'. It was cold and I was devastated. 'I was in the early pregnancy unit and no-one from paediatrics came to talk to me about my other options. 'But I'd just had a 20 week scan and everything was perfect and finding out it was a boy made it very hard to accept a termination. 'The doctor said ""You have to have a termination because there's nothing we can do"".' She added: 'I understand doctors have to tell you the worst case scenario and be blunt, but no two people on this Earth are exactly the same and doctors didn't even give Jett a chance. 'When he came back in and Paul and I had talked we told him I wouldn't be going into theatre and the doctor looked at his watch and rolled his eyes at me, as if I was wasting time. 'I said to Paul ""we have to get out of here"".' Mrs Morris suffered preterm premature rupture of membranes - where the waters break before the pregnancy reaches full term. Agony: After he was born, Jett (with his father, Paul) suffered with chronic lung disease and jaundice - which he quickly recovered from after his lungs and organs developed. He was finally allowed home on March 5 - almost three weeks before his original due date . Heartbreak: Jett's mother, Mhari, said: 'When my waters broke at 20 weeks they didn't see him as a child yet, they just called him a 'non-viable foetus'. It was cold and I was devastated' Complications: Mrs Morris had suffered preterm premature rupture of membranes - where the waters break before the pregnancy reaches full term . She was later diagnosed with placenta praevia - where the placenta forms underneath the baby and can cause bleeding and infection. She was told she was likely to go into labour within 48 hours and the baby would die. But days later she still hadn't given birth and was allowed to go home to Crawley, West Sussex. Twelve days later she started bleeding and was rushed to hospital. But with the local trust only equipped to deal with children born after 28 weeks, the couple had to travel 80 miles to a hospital in Portsmouth. Doctors there warned their son could be brain damaged and would probably die at birth because his lungs would not be developed. However Jett defied the odds and came out kicking and wriggling on December 6, 2013 - and even let out a small 'squeak' before being rushed to an incubator. He suffered with chronic lung disease and jaundice - which he quickly recovered from after his lungs and organs developed. He was finally allowed home on March 5 - almost three weeks before his original due date of March 24. Though Jett has two small holes in his heart it is not thought they will ever cause a problem for him and and he was taken off an oxygen machine in May. Strong: Though Jett has two small holes in his heart it is not thought they will ever cause a problem for him and and he was taken off an oxygen machine in May. Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes happens in expectant mothers who are less than 37 weeks pregnant. Most women will go into spontaneous labour within 24 hours of rupturing their membranes. But six per cent of women do not go into labour within 96 hours. The earlier into the pregnancy the rupture occurs, the less likely it is that the onset of labour will be within a specified time period. The condition affects six to 19 per cent of preterm pregnancies and occurs in two per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is associated with 40 per cent of preterm deliveries and can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for the condition include smoking, previous preterm delivery, vaginal bleeding and lower genital tract infection. An expectant mother may describe feeling a 'popping sensation' of a 'gush' with continuous watery liquid draining. A woman will be taken into hospital immediately and admitted in many cases for the at least 48 hours. In most cases delivery should be considered at 34 weeks. It is recommended that women diagnosed with PPROM should not exceed 96 hours after their membrane has ruptured. The risk of maternal and foetal infection increases the longer the time between membrane rupture and the onset of labour. Source: patient.co.uk . Mrs Morris, who runs a children's boutique with her 36-year-old husband, added: 'We have a happy outcome but I worry that other mothers could have had an abortion when their babies might have survived. 'I was given such a bleak outlook that I kept thinking ""he's not supposed to be healthy"" and was waiting for something to happen, but it never did.' She claims she was forced to Google her options rather than being given any by medics - and now hopes her story will be seen by other pregnant women doing the same thing. Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust's Chief Executive Michael Wilson said staff were working with Mrs Morris to resolve her concerns about her treatment. He said: 'From June 2013, while Mhairi was with us, it's our opinion that she received high quality clinical care and was provided with information about the range of options available to her in her circumstances, as well as having these options discussed in detail. 'The team who cared for her pulled out all stops to keep both her and her child safe throughout her high-risk pregnancy and following this, we transferred her to a more specialist hospital so that she received the best possible care for her condition. 'We are delighted that over a year on, both mother and son are healthy and well. 'As a Trust, we strive to learn from all the feedback we receive from our patients to continually improve our service. 'We have only very recently learned of her concerns as no complaints were raised earlier - had they been, we would have been in touch with her directly and looked into what had taken place. 'We are now working closely with her and her family to understand what happened in detail.'","Jett Morris' mother's waters broke just 20 weeks into the pregnancy .

"If a dog becomes trapped in icy water, owners are always advised not to follow them in. And this video shows why it really is best to leave it to the experts. The footage, captured in Poland, shows a black dog clearly in distress as it clings onto a ice sheet, having fallen into the water. The fireman puts his own safety on the line for the desperate dog who was trapped in an icy river . After struggling to get its legs going on exit, the dog soon scampers off after being pulled free . The action is shot by a pedestrian on a bridge above the stranded pooch, who barks and whines, and is clearly in a perilous position. But a group of firemen come up with an ingenious way to help rescue the dog before it perishes due to the cold. One brave firefighter edges down the ladder, before extending a hooked stick forward towards the shivering canine to snare the collar. Soon the dog is pulled from the icy water - the lack of balance in it's legs on exiting demonstrating how the cold has affected its muscles. The watching audience break out into a round of applause for the successful rescue effort, and the dog scampers off.

"The first full moon of the year - known as the Wolf Moon - lit up the night's sky last night. While much of the UK was shrouded in mist and cloud, elsewhere in the world stargazers were treated to clear views of the Moon's pockmarked surface. January's full moon became known as the Wolf Moon due to the howling of hungry wolves that often accompanied it at the height of winter. Scroll down for video . A passenger aircraft crosses in front of the first full moon of 2015 over Whittier, in Los Angeles, California . This moon traces a path that takes it high into the sky, unlike the trajectory of the sun during the short winter days, due to the tilt of the Earth. Some of the best views were seen in Los Angeles, California, but in the north of England, like Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear, clear skies also allowed some to see the moon glow a rich orange as it rose in the sky. It is not just werewolves that have sleepless nights when there is a full moon. Research has shown that many people get less overall sleep and reduced levels of deep sleep when there is a full moon in the sky. New research shows it’s not just werewolves and vampires who get little or no sleep on night’s like tomorrow when there is a full moon. The study, led by experts at the University of Toronto in Canada, that on nights when there is a full moon it takes some people nearly twice as long to fall asleep - up to an hour - as on darker nights. Women took an average of 52 minutes to nod off, compared to 25 to 30 minutes when there was no full moon. Men took up to 60 minutes, compared with half an hour at other times. For centuries, there has been a widespread belief that the moon exerts a powerful effect on human sleep patterns, as well as health and behaviour. In South Africa the National Sea Rescue Institute issued a warning of strong rip currents off its coast as the full moon brought a powerful spring tide. Full Moon parties in Koh Phangan, Thailand, were also expected to attract more than 40,000 holiday makers. This year's Wolf Moon, sometimes called the Old Moon, also coincided with the Earth reaching perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its orbit. This brought the Earth just 91.4 million miles from the sun, making the full moon appear slightly brighter. However, the bright glare from the sunlight reflected from the lunar surface meant the annual Quadrantids meteor shower, which peaked in the early hours of Sunday morning, was difficult to see. The full moon and the meteor shower are the first of a number of astronomical events due to delight astronomers in January. Comet Lovejoy is also visible in the northern hemisphere for the first time since it was discovered in August by the Australian amateur astronomer Terry Lovejo. It will be closest to the Earth on 7 January and should be visible in binoculars for around a week. Three planets will line up in the southwest of the sky just after sunset on 10 January with both Venus and Mercury visible alongside each other and Mars further to the left. The rising Wolf Moon glowed bright orange as fishermen and walkers on Roker Pier in Sunderland looked on . Comet Lovejoy is currently whizzing northwards past Earth, leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake . The first full moon to occur in January is known as the Wolf Moon as it was often accompanied by howling in North America from hungry wolf packs as they searched for food during the cold, lean days of winter . Venus will be particularly bright in January and will make Mercury alongside it easy to spot in the evenings . A good view of Saturn will also materialise to the left of the waning crescent Moon on 16 January. Views of the planet Jupiter are also expected to be among the highlights in the night's sky this month. The middle of January will enjoy several moonless hours each evening and will give astronomers a good view of the stars that are normally drowned out by the light from the sun. Among these could be the red star Antares will sit alongside Saturn as the two brightest points on the southeastern horizon. The constellation of Auriga, the charioteer, will be high in the south, with the brightest star Capella, nearly completely overhead.

"Imagine being given the chance to embark on a restorative two week holiday  to anywhere you want in the world. Now imagine you don't have miss any work for it, you can get there instantly and it costs virtually nothing. It could soon be a reality as Paul McKenna has devised the world's first holiday hypnotherapy service to transform Britain's hungover workforce this bleak January. Paul McKenna has designed the world's first holiday hypnotherapy service that takes just 20 minutes . In one twenty minute session  the world renowned hypnotist and self help guru promises to revitalise, refresh and restore your mojo by reproducing the feeling you get after a two week holiday. Virgin Holidays and McKenna will launch the experience today, the day most of the nation returns to work after two weeks of overindulgence, and the time of year when we start longing for an overseas break. McKenna will be delivering the bespoke service one-to-one in a 'hypno-pod' at House of Fraser Bluewater in Kent until Tuesday 6 January. After the session you will feel as though you have just been on a two week holiday . McKenna says, 'This is a truly pioneering experience and I'm so excited to be working with Virgin Holidays to help lift the nation's post-Christmas blues. 'Together we're going to help the great British public feel like they've been relaxing with loved ones in their dream holiday destination despite the freezing temperatures outside.' He adds: 'The aim is to bring people round from the hypnosis so they feel as refreshed and revitalised as they do after a two week break. The service will launch 5 and 6 January in Bluewater shopping centre in Kent in a 'hypno-pod' We'll simulate the feeling you get when the brain releases endorphins, the natural feel-good hormones often associated with a holiday. It's really a very exciting proposition.' Mark Anderson, Managing Director at Virgin Holidays comments: 'This experience could not come at a better time for the great British public. Nothing beats the feeling of an amazing holiday, and we think they have the right to flaunt it even in the dark depths of January before they get the real thing later in the year. 'We know that the average British worker typically holds out until lunchtime on the first day back at work before they start dreaming of sunnier climes. 'Last year we saw a 32 per cent increase in traffic to the site on the first day back at work after Christmas with peak browsing time at 12:43pm.'","Hypnotist and self help guru Paul McKenna  launches  one-to-one service .

"Islamic State have released photos from one of their forthcoming videos showing the execution of eight Iraqi police officers, who are accused of informing on Islamic State for the Iraqi government. Entitled 'the Day of Judgement', the photos show eight Iraqi men dressed in orange Guantanamo Bay style jumpsuits. Standing behind them are Islamic State's notorious security forces, known for carrying out mass public executions in broad daylight. Final moments: ISIS has released still images from a forthcoming video which allegedly shows the execution of eight Iraqi police officers . Several of the victims are named in the captions and appear to have been interviewed for the video as they are seen wearing microphones. The leader of the group is named as Captain Hossam Salah Bnosh. According to Islamic State media, Bnosh and seven other police officers converted to Sunni Islam and joined Islamic State. However once they had infiltrated the Islamic State security forces, they began to secretly spy for the Iraqi government. The group are accused of providing intelligence information to the Iraqi government, identifying targets for coalition airstrikes against Islamic State. Ahmad Basil Ramadan, a young bearded Iraqi, was accused of giving information on the location of Islamic State soldier houses. The victims, accused of spying on ISIS appear to have been interviewed before their executions . Last march:The eight Iraqi police officers seen in the video were accused of infiltrating ISIS in order to spy in the organisation on the behalf of the Iraqi government . Another prisoner wearing a microphone is named as Marwan Habib Said, who reportedly joined Islamic State security forces but was caught giving target information to the Iraqi government. The photos show how the eight prisoners were blindfolded and frogmarched along the edge of the river, most likely the Euphrates. Their hands are handcuffed behind their backs and each Islamic State fighter appears to be holding their victim's neck as they march to their deaths. They appear to have been taken to a quiet area away from the city, possibly under a motorway bridge, near the river. Forced to kneel down and unable to see, the prisoners wait as each Islamic State fighter draws their pistol and takes aim. Each prisoner is executed with a single bullet to the head. Afterwards, the security forces pose for a photo. The squadron are shown pointing their pistols at the video camera.

The executions come just weeks after photos emerged on social media of another public execution in Salahuddin province. The photos show 13 Islamic State security forces standing in a line, with a prisoner kneeling in front of them. The mass execution appears to have taken place at a roundabout or square believed to be in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Each prisoner is wearing an orange uniform, similar to the tunics worn by the three western journalists and two aidworkers, who were executed in recent months. Their hands are hands are tied behind their backs. In broad daylight, all of the prisoners are then executed by a single pistol round to the head. Their bodies lie slumped in the curb whilst the barbaric executioners are seen triumphantly holding their pistols up in the air at their achievement. The large black flags of Islamic State can be seen fluttering in the background. It is believed the thirteen prisoners were captured from when Islamic State briefly captured the strategic oilfield at Baiji. They were all found guilty of treachery and apostacy according to an Islamic State court.","ISIS release photographs of execution of eight Iraqi police officers .

"A harsh frost will hit the country tonight before temperatures soar by an astonishing 18C over four days to leave the UK warmer than Athens. Forecasters last night also warned of fierce gales in a week of topsy turvy weather that will chill, soak and then buffet the nation. Their warnings come as Met Office figures confirmed last year was the warmest in Britain since modern records began in 1910. Scroll down for video . This week: The first light of dawn reflects off wet sand around the Victorian pier at Saltburn by the Sea in Cleveland, North Yorkshire . One series of records, collected in an area of central England between London, Bristol and Lancashire, even put 2014 as the warmest since 1659 – breaking a record dating back 355 years. It was also the fourth wettest year on record for the whole of the UK, since 1910. The average temperature across Britain was 9.9C, some 1.1C above the long term average of 8.8C, making it warmer than the previous record year of 2006. There were no record-breaking hot months in 2014, but temperatures were consistently warm with only August experiencing below average temperatures. The number of frosts in the UK was the lowest in records dating back to 1961, the provisional figures show. Last week: . Fallow deer graze in Richmond Park after a heavy night of frost on New Year's Eve . I woke up like this: Highland Cattle cows stand in the fog near Ambleside, in Cumbria, on Monday morning . Morning has broken: The  frosty banks of Woodhead reservoir in Longdendale in north Derbyshire . That particular statistic will likely be far from the mind tonight, when a clear night and northerly wind is expected to bring a deep frost across the country. The mercury will plummet to a bitter -4C overnight. Mark Wilson, forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘The frost will be widespread across the country with the coldest temperatures likely in rural spots.’ But the chill will be shortlived, with the wind swinging to the south-west tomorrow, bringing a warm air mass from southern Europe which will see temperatures soar over the next few days. Parts of southern England will experience temperatures as warm as 12C on Thursday and 14C on Friday – which will be hotter than those predicted for Athens, Rome and Istanbul. The temperatures are far above the average 6.9C expected in England for January. They will, however, be accompanied by fierce winds and heavy rain. Mr Wilson said gales would peak on Friday with winds of up to 65mph expected in northern England . Cold Monday: A sheep has a frosty start of the week at Woodhead in the Derbyshire Peak District . Climate experts and green campaigners insisted 2014’s temperature record shores up evidence for global warming. The figures for 2014 mean that eight of the UK’s top ten warmest years have occurred since 2002. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics said: ‘This is clear evidence of the impact of man-made climate change on the UK. 'The lack of awareness of the UK public of how climate change is already affecting them represents a colossal failure by the Government and its agencies…to communicate with the public about this issue.’ Simon Bullock, of the Friends of the Earth, said: ‘Without action to cut our use of fossil fuels the world is going to keep warming – with ever-increasing risks of climate disasters.’ The Met Office says the weather record of one individual year cannot be attributed to man-made global warming. But it also points out climate change makes warm years more likely than not.","Mercury will plummet to a bitter -4C overnight, the Met Office say .

Above, a police tent at the scene on Sunday . Mr Walsh was rushed to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital. But despite medics' best efforts, he was shortly declared dead, according to Fox 12. His family have since been informed of his death. The driver - who remained at the scene until police arrived - was also taken to hospital as a precaution. He has cooperated with officers and no charges have yet been filed, it is reported. Following the incident, Sargeant Greg Wityak told the Republican-American of Waterbury that the truck was doing a 'regular route' when it collided with Mr Walsh who was running southbound. This means its 'plow' was not down at the time, he said, adding that the victim may not have heard the vehicle because he was wearing a pair of headphones.

The sign also has a Twitter hash tag that says '# end white silence.' Chief Cameron McLay was photographed holding up the sign that someone had brought to the city's annual First Night celebration.

'I thought, 'What a great way to begin the new year,'' said the first-year mayor, who hired McLay in September. Peduto said he believes the chief was simply recognizing that racism exists and acknowledging there's work to be done restoring trust between the city's police and the black community. But Fraternal Order of Police president Howard McQuillan said the sign paints city police as racists and violates a policy governing police participation in social media. McQuillan took issue with the mayor's previous comments criticizing the police and saying departmental reforms were needed, and fired off an email to the mayor, which the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Sunday. Criticized: Chief Cameron McLay was snapped with the photo during a city New Year's Eve celebration. He became police chief this past September . 'By Mayor Peduto labeling us 'corrupt and mediocre' and now our current Chief insinuating that we are now racist, merely by the color of our skin and the nature of our profession, I say enough is enough!' the email said. In an email to the union, McLay apologized if he offended officers but defended his posing with the sign, saying it was a 'statistical fact' that policing efforts have 'a disparate impact on communities of color.' 'The predominant pattern of our city's increased violence involves black victims as well as actors,' wrote the police chief, who is white. 'If we are to address this violence, we must work together with our communities of color.' The brouhaha over the photo comes as the city continues to grapple with incidents that have angered blacks in the city. McLay last month put Officer David Derbish on desk duty while the U.S. Justice Department reviews the officer's shooting of a black motorist, 21-year-old Leon Ford, who was left paralyzed after a 2012 traffic stop. Ford, who is suing the city in federal court, was acquitted in September of aggravated assault for allegedly endangering officers by driving away from the stop. Ford contends in his lawsuit that officers apparently thought he was a wanted gang member but refused to believe they had the wrong person even after he gave them various pieces of identification. Ford contends he didn't try to flee, but that his car was knocked into gear as officers tried to yank him from the vehicle. The Allegheny County district attorney has yet to decide whether Ford will be retried on lesser remaining charges, prompting protests and causing Ford's name to be mentioned in recent marches and other demonstrations relating to the shooting of an unarmed black man by police in Ferguson, Missouri. McQuillan told the chief in his email that the poor morale among officers needs to be addressed and is made worse by 'pandering to the community at the expense of the police community.' In his email, McLay pledged to meet with commanders of the city's police patrol zones 'to talk these tough issues through.' Applauded: Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto applauded the chief's gesture and said he believes the chief was simply recognizing that racism exists and acknowledging there's work to be done restoring trust between the city's police and the black community .","New Chief Cameron McLay was photographed with the sign during a city New Year's Eve celebration .

"As bushfires continue to rage in South Australia, a family run grocery store has shown its appreciation for the local firefighters through a touching donation of fruit and a receipt that notes their 'pure awesomeness'. Justin Golding, 40, who runs and owns Golding's Gully Fruit Market at Tea Tree Gully, only 13 kilometres from Sampson Flats where the bushfires began, shared a copy of the receipt he addressed to the local volunteer Country Fire Service online. The receipt - for 50KG of watermelon, 10kg of Bananas and 5 kg of cherries – had been totalled of to $00.00, a 100 per cent discount from $125. Scroll down for video . Local business owner Justin Golding, donated $125 worth of fruit to his local fire station after his home was filled with smoke during the South Australian bushfires . Mr Golding, a father-of-three, told Daily Mail Australia that he personally delivered the 65 kilograms of fruit to the Tea Tree Gully Fire Station. 'Our house is on the edge of where the fires were and when I woke up on Saturday morning, my house was full of smoke,' Mr Golding said. 'I went to work and thought ""I can't open my shop, this is ridiculous"" and I just felt useless; I'm not good in a crisis and thought the least I can do is bring something out to the boys. 'I just dropped it [the produce] off and wrote the receipt in jest. I wanted to show my appreciation somehow because I do believe all the firefighters are absolute heroes. The least I could do is take some fruit up for them to eat.' The 40-year-old runs and owns Golding's Gully Fruit Market at Tea Tree Gully, only 13 kilometres from Sampson Flats where the bushfires began . Since Mr Goilding shared the picture of his receipt online less than 24 hours ago, he has received over 3,000 likes on Facebook and 2,000 on Redit. The local producer also told of how his own house came close to destruction and mentioned that some of customers had lost their homes and pets. 'It was only 5km away and heading in our direction, but luckily the wind change direction,' Mr Golding said. 'I didn't think our house would go up, but it was more so the embers coming over and landing in our garden that were worrying. We have no lawn, just dry mulch this time of year because we grow our own stuff. 'I just dropped it [the produce] off and wrote the receipt in jest. I wanted to show my appreciation somehow because I do believe all the firefighters are absolute heroes. The least I could do is take some fruit up for them to eat,' Mr Golding said . 'The smoke was so that thick and my oldest son has asthma so I had to send my wife and kids over to mum's place by 1pm on Saturday.' Mr Golding is one of many locals in the region providing small spirit-lifting donations to the fire crews battling the inferno, as well as its many victims. Boxes of chocolate bars were delivered to a CFS station at Nairne while the owners of the Hampshire Hotel  have offered free accommodation to anyone displaced by the fires. Local woman Sarina Waterman has organised over 1000 free meals for  firefighters from the various food donations provided by residents, local supermarkets and even catering companies,The  Advertiser reports. Over 12,000 hectares of land and 38 homes have been destroyed by the bushfires that began on Friday afternoon . Premier Jay Weatherill on Monday said the response to the fire was now focused on three key areas: containing the blaze; clearing roads to help restore services; and protecting more than 1000 homes in the fire zone which are 'surrounded by fuel that could ignite'. The premier has confirmed that 38 homes have been destroyed or badly damaged - the number is expected to rise - as well as 129 other buildings and businesses. Hundreds of firefighters from across the country will continue to fight the blaze on Wednesday, with temperatures expected to soar. Up to 123 people have been injured so far, 29 of whom are firefighters, The Guardian reports.","Justin Golding personally deliver 65kg of fruit to his local fire station .

"Billionaire Elon Musk is renowned for his futuristic electric cars, ambitious plans to colonise Mars and concept for revolutionary transport systems. But behind the headlines, the 43-year-old entrepreneur is said to have a ‘highly skewed’ sense of reality and ‘doesn’t seem to give a damn’ about his employee's family lives. That’s according to claims made on question and answer site Quora by an anonymous user purporting to be a SpaceX engineer. The claims were made by an anonymous user on Quora who claims to be an engineer for Elon Musk’s California-based SpaceX. The engineer said they ‘highly doubt there is a cooler company in the world’, but added Mr Musk (pictured) is difficult to work with, and has a ‘highly skewed’ reality . The question was originally filed in June last year. The anonymous user said they have been an engineer with SpaceX for more than five years, and that they ‘highly doubt that there is a cooler company in the world than SpaceX.’ ‘SpaceX really is awesome,’ they continued, but said they wanted to ‘discuss the side that you won't often hear.’ ‘If you want a family or hobbies or to see any other aspect of life other than the boundaries of your cubicle, SpaceX is not for you and Elon doesn't seem to give a damn. ‘You can always tell when someone's left an Elon meeting: they're defeated. It is unsure who the user is and his claims have not been substantiated. MailOnline has contacted SpaceX for comment. Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers. But in August, the Tesla founder warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons (Tweet pictured) ‘These are some of the hardest working and brightest people in the world, mind you. And they are universally defeated.’ The user added that Mr Musk’s version of reality is ‘highly skewed…much like Steve Jobs's ""reality distortion field"". Elon Musk is the founder of electric car maker Tesla, and space exploration firm SpaceX. The South African-born entrepreneur immigrated to Canada at age 17. He then moved to America to study at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr Musk made his first fortune by helping set up money service PayPal. In September, SpaceX won a $1.6 billion contract with Nasa to resupply the International Space Station with its rockets and launchers. In August 2013, Mr Musk unveiled plans for a Hyperloop system that would offer a faster way to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Mr Musk described the concept as a subsonic air travel machine that would stretch approximately 350 miles (560 km). It theoretically would let commuters travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less. He has plans to colonise Mars and has even said he wants retire on the red planet. Mr Musk is additionally one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers. But in August, the Tesla founder warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. ‘If you believe that a task should take a year then Elon wants it done in a week. 'He won't hesitate to throw out six months of work because it's not pretty enough or it's not ""badass"" enough. But in so doing he doesn't change the schedule.’ But the anonymous engineer said this attitude is understandable. ‘Putting people on Mars is not a small task especially given the overwhelming political obstacles that face SpaceX's mission. ‘Continuously being the underdog and the entrenched politicians that strangely want SpaceX to fail is only a small part of it. ‘SpaceX certainly requires a hard mentality. It is a great company and I do love it. But is isn't the pie in the sky, everything's great idea that so many seem to think.’ On the same thread, former engineer Dolly Singh provided a similar view, adding that working with Mr Musk isn’t a comfortable experience because he is never satisfied with himself, so is never really satisfied with anyone around him. ‘He pushes himself harder and harder and he pushes others around him the exact same way,’ continued Ms Singh - who left SpaceX after five years in 2013. ‘The challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t.' ‘So if you work for Elon you have to accept the discomfort. But in that discomfort is the kind of growth you can’t get anywhere else, and worth every ounce of blood and sweat.’ Ms Singh also told Business Insider that she believes the claims made by the anonymous engineer 'seem legit.' While another anonymous user simply said: ‘There's just one thing I have to say: Elon Musk is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.’ MailOnline has contacted SpaceX, Tesla and Quora for comment.","Answer was posted by an anonymous user on question site Quora .

"A drink-driver has been shamed on Twitter by police after he crashed his car next to a neon sign - warning about the dangers of drink-driving. The unnamed man left his car parked at a 90 degree angle and wedged next to the lamppost which had a matrix sign reading 'Don't drink and drive'. The motorist was breath tested at the scene in Cheltenham, Gloucester, where he gave a reading of 75mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - almost twice the legal limit.

It comes after a woman was arrested on suspicion of drink driving after two police officers were seriously injured when they were hit by a car yesterday morning in an unrelated incident in the West Midlands. The officers both suffered broken legs when the Blue VW Golf GTi ploughed into the back of a car they had just stopped. The force of the smash sent the Mercedes E350 hurtling into the officers before the Golf hit the pair - sending them flying through the air. Gloucestershire Police later tweeted the picture of the car with the message: 'The irony is attached to the lamp post.'Driver arrested on suspicion of drink driving - blew 75 at the roadside' An officer, in his 40s, who has served with the force for 11 years was knocked unconscious and sustained a broken leg.

"Glass panels that were installed on Paris' Pont des Arts bridge to stop tourists attaching 'lovelocks' to the railings have been scrawled with graffiti. Viewed as an apparent protest against city officials preventing the craze from continuing, interestingly it was Spanish words that were used on the panels. The word 'Preciosa', or 'beautiful' in Spanish was spray painted on the glass. Scroll down for video . Preciosa, which means beautiful in Spanish, has been daubed on the bridge's glass panels . The group who are campaigning for the end of 'lovelocks' believe this kind of act only strengthens their case . The glass panels have been in place since September, but now graffiti 'artists' have left their mark on them . Locals and expats had started a 'No Love Locks' campaign on Facebook to force the authorities into action, as they believed the padlocking was getting out of control. Amorous couples would attach a lock to the bridge as a sign of their love, and then throw the key into the River Seine. Writing on their page regarding the graffiti incident, 'No Love Locks' said: 'New glass panels on the PDA are badly tagged today. Almost as if to mock the city it says, ""preciosa"" (lovely/beautiful). Looks more ""feo"" (ugly) from where we're standing. Or how about, ""violento?"" 'Is there no respect for Paris anymore? Proof that ""love locks"" breed more vandalism. ‪#‎banlovelocks‬.' The locks are strapped to the railings by couples in love who then toss the key into the River Seine . Protests from people living in Paris urged authorities to halt the tradition of 'lovelocks' Other comments on the Facebook page liken the iconic bridge to looking more like a New York City subway, while others believe the answer is to install CCTV to catch wrongdoers. There are plans to add a third see-through panel and expand the experiment to other bridges as the French capital cracks down on ‘visual pollution’ and attempts to make the blighted bridges safer after a panel of the Pont des Arts bridge collapsed under the weight of the metal last year. Pont des Arts, a little footbridge over the River Seine, is one of the city’s best-known symbols of romance thanks to the ‘love locks’, but it has been said it is at risk of losing its identity as its metal fencing is replaced with glass panels. This would satisfy Paris officials and residents, who have long bemoaned the tradition of attaching a padlock as a symbol of undying love and tossing the key in the river. The locks strapped onto the rails caused part of the bridge to collapse into the River Seine . Paris Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard told Le Parisien: ‘Paris is the capital of love, we are all very proud of that, but there are more beautiful ways of showing that love than by putting padlocks on a bridge.’ He said the locks are a costly hazard because they are damaging the city’s bridges and jeopardising visitors’ safety due to the added weight. In June, part of Pont des Arts’ railing collapsed under the weight of the locks, forcing police to close the iconic structure while repairs were made. It is estimated there are over 700,000 padlocks attached to the bridge, with each grill weighing 500kg. Earlier this year, two American writers who live in Paris launched a ‘No Love Locks’ campaign . The metal bridge was originally completed in 1804 but it had to be rebuilt in the 1980s due to damage caused by aerial bombings during the First and Second World Wars.","The word 'preciosa', or 'beautiful' in Spanish spray painted onto the glass .

"There's no better wake-up call than a steaming cup of fresh coffee – but first thing in the morning, just getting out of bed to make it can be a challenge. Luckily, help is at hand from a gadget that grinds the beans, brews them and pours out a hot drink tailored to your taste, all at a swipe of a smartphone. Just tap a single button in the mobile app that comes with the coffee-maker, then stay snug under the covers as it gets to work. Scroll down for video . The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste, it can have it ready for you before you even wake up. Once it has ground the beans and boiled the water to a precise temperature, it will send an alarm to your phone to rouse you . Alternatively, the machine can be set to make coffee at the same time each day. When it is ready, it sends an alarm to the owner’s phone to wake them. The system can also welcome people home at the end of the day with an offer to brew up. The Wi-Fi Coffee Machine, by British firm Smarter, is part of a technological revolution that entrepreneurs say will create smart homes full of appliances run wirelessly from a home hub. Everything from heating to lighting, the washing machine to the TV, the oven and the lock on your front door will be controlled through smartphones that link into a home wi-fi system or the internet. Initially, people would have to tap in their commands, but experts are already working on voice controls via iPhones or Android mobiles. Smarter’s coffee machine will go on sale in Britain in March, at a cost of £129. It makes the drink from scratch, grinding the beans and boiling water using set recipes that can be tweaked to suit the owner’s taste. It can even alert you when it needs refilling.

"Illegal and 'barbaric' traps being used to catch foxes in urban areas are so deadly they could kill or severely injure a child, experts warn. The so-called 'gin traps' clamp down on the unsuspecting fox's legs, and are still being used despite them being banned in 1958. Several traps have been discovered in Guildford, Surrey, and wildlife experts say they are strong enough to cut off a child's hand. Danger: A fox that has been caught in a 'gin trap' in Guildford, Surrey and had to be put down . The 'gin traps' horrendously maim the animals meaning they often must be put down said Wildlife Aid Foundation founder Simon Cowell. Mr Cowell has now issued the stark warning after several foxes were found dying in the traps in Surrey. He said: 'These traps are incredibly dangerous and would catch pets or even children - which is an incomprehensible thought. 'If a child puts its finger hand in the trap it would easily take a finger off if not a hand. Worse scenarios are unthinkable, it makes me cringe. Wildlife experts warn that a child or a pet could easily be caught and seriously injured by the illegal traps . 'People should not to approach the fox but call us, and if possible keep the fox in sight but from a distance, and we will get over there immediately. 'We also want people to keep an eye for any traps that may have been set and again don't touch but call us we need the evidence and need to catch the person responsible.' There are an estimated 33,000 'urban foxes' in Britain, according to Bristol University research from 2013.

"Grandmother Ann Egan jokingly threatened to shoot rail workers who kept her awake over Christmas - but then got a visit from the police . A grandmother who jokingly threatened to shoot railway workers who had kept her awake for two days over Christmas was shocked when police turned up on her doorstep to investigate her ‘threat’. Disabled Ann Egan, 57, who suffers from a lung condition and relies on an oxygen mask, made the comments when her partner was on the phone to Network Rail, complaining about the work taking place on a line behind their home. Engineers had arrived without warning at 10pm on Christmas Eve and worked through until 8am on Christmas morning. They did the same on Christmas night, finishing at 8am on Boxing Day. Later that day, Miss Egan’s partner Dave Bumstead, also 57, called Network Rail to complain. Miss Egan said she was ‘shattered’ and ‘wound up’ when she said in the background: ‘If they come back again I’ll shoot them with a gun’. Two hours later, two uniformed officers from British Transport Police knocked on the door of their home in Rainham, Kent, to investigate a threat of violence to railway staff. They went to the couple’s home following a complaint by Network Rail. Miss Egan said the officers quickly realised she posed no risk and left after apologising for bothering her. ‘Obviously I was joking,’ she said. ‘It was totally tongue in cheek and I think anybody with a bit of common sense would realise that. ‘I could hear the woman from customer services getting really snotty on the phone and after two sleepless nights it really wound me up. ‘There were two officers on my doorstep and they took one look at me and knew it was ridiculous. ‘They were chuckling about it. They thought it was ridiculous too but they have to come and check it out. I think they just took one look at me and realised it was said in frustration. I was shattered.’ She added: ‘I can’t even run down the garden let alone climb a wall and gun down some rail workers. ‘Network Rail have totally wasted police time. It was a waste of my time and a waste of their time.’ Disabled Ann Egan, 57, who suffers from a lung condition and relies on an oxygen mask, made the comments when her partner was on the phone to Network Rail, making a complaint . Miss Egan said the work on the tracks behind her home had ruined her Christmas. Network Rail apologised for not warning residents in advance that work would be taking place but would not comment on the police matter. Miss Egan said: ‘When you’ve got about twelve men shouting at the top of their voices and a disc cutter going all night and flood lights beaming into your window it is annoying. ‘I went to bed at midnight on Christmas Eve after getting everything ready for the next day. ‘I did not sleep for two nights and we had no letter or warning that the work would take place, no one in the street did. ‘It totally ruined my Christmas. I was shattered for the entire time.’ Rail engineers had arrived without warning at 10pm on Christmas Eve and worked through until 8am on Christmas morning near her home in Rainham, Kent . A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘Clearly our neighbour in Rainham should have received advanced warning of the work over Christmas and I can only apologise. ‘We are investigating how this came to happen and we know how important it is to let people know when we will be doing work overnight. Christmas is the busiest time of year for our engineers as it is the only time when we can get access to the busiest parts of the railway without impacting passengers.’ A British Transport Police spokesman said: ‘Officers had cause to visit an address in Rainham on Boxing Day, after a threat of violence with a gun towards rail workers was overheard. We take all abuse and threats of violence against rail staff very seriously and will investigate as appropriate. ‘In this case, we were satisfied the threat was made out of frustration, with no actual malice intended. There was no gun. ‘However, rail staff have the right to carry out their work without fear of intimidation.’","Disabled grandmother Ann Egan joked that she would shoot rail workers .

"It has proved controversial in Britain and has been banned outright in France but it seems the burka does have at least one high profile supporter - the Countess of Wessex. 'It’s very evident that Muslim women can be fashionable while also retaining their modesty,' said the 49-year-old in an interview ahead of her 50th birthday this month. 'And it's a great way of bringing people together, and saying, ""Look, this is what we're really like"".' Controversial: Sophie Wessex made the controversial comments during a recent interview . Modest: The Countess said the garment proves you 'don't have to show a lot of flesh to be beautiful' The Countess, who was speaking in her role as patron of the London College of Fashion, made the comments in an interview with the January issue of fashion bible Harper's Bazaar, which along with the article on Sophie, features pieces on actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. It promises titbits on 'how I stay close to Chris' from Ms Paltrow and further features on new season fashion, which this year includes new ways to wear nautical and the return of culottes. One item that isn't featured is the burka, although as the Countess goes on to say, most conceal a fashionable ensemble. 'What people forget is that underneath the burka and everything else, there is somebody who is probably wearing something really quite fashionable,' she added. 'It  proves you don’t have to show a lot of flesh in order to be beautiful and stylish.' Her comments are likely to prove controversial thanks to the debate surrounding the burka, which some campaigners say should be banned in the UK as it is in France. A Facebook campaign calling on the Government to ban the garment boasts 39,858 likes, while in July, a European Court of Human Rights ruling upheld France's burka ban on the grounds that it made it easier for different cultures to live together. Nevertheless, the debate about the garment, which covers a woman from head to foot and usually masks the face, continues to rumble on, with opponents describing it as being a means of oppressing the female wearer. Schools have also questioned whether burkas should be allowed in classrooms with teachers saying that being unable to make eye contact pupils makes it harder to teach. Some Muslim groups have also rounded on those who insist the garment must stay, pointing out that it is not required by the Qu'ran. Debate: Sophie, seen here with her son Viscount Severn, risks reigniting the debate on a UK burka ban . Spotlight: Gwyneth Paltrow features in the magazine which also includes an interview with Jennifer Aniston . But opponents of a ban, among them Shami Chakrabarti, the director of human rights campaign group Liberty, say the debate is fuelled by racism and not women's rights. Speaking to the Guardian following the European Court ruling, Ms Chakrabarti said the ban 'has nothing to do with gender equality and everything to do with rising racism in western Europe. 'How do you liberate women by criminalising their clothing? If you suspect bruises under a burqa, why punish the victim, and if you disapprove of the wearer's choices, how does banishing her from public engagement promote liberal attitudes?' Other opponents of the French ban include Human Rights Watch and Open Societies, an organisation that promotes tolerance of people's religion and culture.","The Countess of Wessex made the comments in Harper's Bazaar .

"Bradley Arthur, 24, was last seen at a house party in Grays, Essex, at around 4am and has not answered his mobile phone since . A major police hunt has been launched to find a missing father who disappeared in the early hours of New Year's Day after a party. Bradley Arthur, 24, was last seen at a house party in Grays, Essex, at around 4am and has not answered his mobile phone since. His frantic family and friends have launched a campaign appealing for the maintenance engineer to come home to his one-year-old son Archie. Police are growing increasingly concerned for the young father as he was only wearing a blazer and jeans when he was last seen - and since then night-time temperatures have dropped below zero. The search has widened to water-filled quarries, nature reserves and beaches and police have called in a helicopter to help. People have been urged to check their gardens and sheds in case he is lying somewhere injured. Mitchell Arthur tweeted a picture of Bradley's son Archie with the message: 'If anyone knows anything at all about Brads whereabout please let someone know, for this little boys sake.' Ryan Corrigan tweeted: 'If one good thing is to happen to me this year, please get brad home safe back to my best mate, his brother.' According to his Twitter profile, Bradley's son Archie was born on 19th October last year. On Christmas Day, he tweeted: 'Happy Xmas Archie, love you.' He later added: 'I can't wait till my little boy is old enough to have a toy garage. His (sic) not gonna get a look in on it.' Mr Arthur is described as white, around 6ft tall and very thin with mousey brown hair and stubble. When he was last seen he was wearing dark blue jeans, a white shirt and a grey blazer. His frantic family and friends have launched a campaign appealing for the maintenance engineer to come home to his one-year-old son Archie (right) Inspector Alan Blakesley said: 'It is now more than 48 hours since anyone has heard from Bradley and the longer time passes without any contact the more concerned we are for his wellbeing.' 'We have received several calls from people who believe they may have seen Bradley since he left the party and these are being investigated but we do not have any confirmed sightings and calls to his mobile phone remain unanswered. 'Specially trained police officers have been carrying out searches of open ground and along the beach in Grays and will be concentrating their efforts today on the nature reserve off of Hogg Lane. This includes potentially dangerous terrain and we would ask members of the public to leave the searches of these areas to our officers. 'It is quite possible that Bradley might be lying somewhere injured and unable to move and we would ask people in Grays to help us by checking their gardens, sheds, and outbuildings for any sign of Bradley. 'We would also ask them to check alleyways near their homes and to ask friends and families that live in Grays to do the same. If they find anything of significance they should contact Grays Police Station on 101.' Police are growing increasingly concerned for the young father as he was only wearing a blazer and jeans when he was last seen - and since then night-time temperatures have dropped below zero . The search has widened to water-filled quarries, nature reserves and beaches and people were urged to check their gardens and sheds in case he is lying somewhere injured .","Bradley Arthur, 24, was last seen at a house party early on New Year's Day .

"She has recently gone from playing tough cop DC Rachel Bailey in TV's Scott and Bailey to a promiscuous single mother in theatre production Beautiful Thing. With such a high profile career, it is no wonder Suranne Jones is going to extreme lengths to retain her youthful looks. The star, 34, is reportedly a fan of anti-aging Cryolift facial freezing treatments - extreme facials that encourage the natural production of skin-plumping collagen. The £250 treatments freeze skin to -15°C, supposedly helping enhance natural production of collagen to tighten skin making it appear more youthful. NOW, AGED 34: Suranne pictured last week at the TV BAFTAs looking very fresh-faced . A source said: 'Suranne is a prime-time TV star who, understandably, wants to look her best. Playing a gung-ho copper, she wears minimal make-up on set and has her hair roughly scraped back. 'If she can boost her appearance in any other way, she will. She tried a cryolift facial and absolutely loved it. 'It’s a non-surgical procedure but the results were fantastic and have really brightened Suranne’s complexion. She looks amazing,' the source told the Mirror. The former Coronation Street star, who . played feisty Karen McDonald for four years until 2004, was told about . the treatment by a friend. She now has regular sessions at the exclusive KX spa in Chelsea, West London, with dermatologist and TV beauty expert Malvina Fraser.

Cryolift freezing application has a very long history of use in healing - including for muscle fatigue, strains and damage. It has been greatly developed over the last few years as a result of modern technology. Cryoplasty aims to help improve the general tone, texture and tightness of the facial skin and neck area. It usually comprises a course of six treatments for optimum results and can include a glycolic acid peel and various specialist skin products to further enhance the final results of the treatment. These products can include glycolic . acid, Vitamin C and vitamin-rich cellular poly-revitalisation formulas, . coenzymes, hyaluronic and amino acids and minerals. The skin is prepared with . the peel and product treatments before the Cryolift machine is used to . deliver a controlled amount of cold thermal energy uniformly cooling it . and the underlying tissue. 2002: Suranne in her Coronation Street days (l) and 2004: Winning Inside Soap Sexiest Female award (r) 2005: Suranne at 26, showing she has hardly aged. 2011: When she was 32 for a Scott & Bailey shoot . The cooling promotes skin analgesia, dermocryphoreses and skin oxygenation, which radically acts on marked and fatigued skins to help regain firmness, tone and radiance. Immediately following a Cryolift procedure skin should feel tighter, smoother and look more radiant. The hour-long procedure is said to be relaxing and painless. Negative side effects, while very uncommon, include swelling, rosacea, blistering, pigmentation changes, discomfort, itching - and even permanent scarring. Though it is also said to help heal scars.

"If you’re starting the New Year on the hunt for a new role, beware: your online habits could be giving you away to your boss. HR teams and recruiters are now using technology, such as that offered by Joberate, to track how their employees use social networks. Employees are given a baseline score, and if the technology spots signs that suggests they are looking for a new job, it flags up the changes to their bosses. A company tells Joberate which employees it wants to tracks, who are are then given a baseline score, based on their role, how long they’ve been at the firm, and which sites they regularly use, for example.

"Samuel Lee Bassett is accused of punching a cop after police stopped him from running into his house . A Chicago man has been arrested after he repeatedly tried to run into his burning house and save his beloved dog from a fire. Police say that Samuel Lee Bassett lashed out and punched an officer after cops handcuffed and restrained him when he wouldn't stop trying to run into the blaze on Friday afternoon at his home in Chicago's Morgan Park neighborhood. Three firefighters became trapped in the basement and had to be hospitalized while battling the intense fire. Bassett's dog died in the blaze. The Chicago Tribune reports that Bassett, a 48-year-old US Air Force veteran, wasn't home when the fire broke out. He returned to find his home fully engulfed in flames with firefighters already inside. He frantically tried to get inside his house to save his dog, firefighters said, and resisted their attempts to keep him away from the blaze. When police handcuffed and detained Bassett, he allegedly punched one of the officers in the face, leaving a cut on the bridge of his nose. Officers responded by hitting him in the face with a pair of handcuffs, the Tribune reports. He is charged with resisting the police and two counts of felony aggravated battery on a police officer. A judge ordered him held on $300,000 bail. Three firefighters became trapped after getting lost and disoriented in the basement of the home while battling the blaze. They were taken to the hospital with minor injuries after being rescued. Bassett, who works as a lighting designer, posted a Facebook photo from his Air Force days showing him in uniform with a German shepherd. On it, he wrote 'me and my best friend.'

"A heartwarming new video has proven once again that older doesn't necessarily mean wiser. An Italian video journalist called Luca Lavarone conducted a social experiment with children on a busy street, to highlight the issue of violence by men against women. In the three-minute clip, several boys aged between six and eleven years old are introduced to a girl and asked to pay her a compliment, caress her, pull a funny face to make her laugh... and then they are told to slap her. The participants react to the final request with shock and appear visibly upset, but their responses as to why they won't go through with the task are the real tearjerker. A new video shows Italian boys aged between six and eleven asked to slap a girl. The children all look horrified and refuse. When asked why, answers include, 'Because I'm a man' and 'Never hit a girl'. The film is part of an anti-domestic violence campaign . The video was produced by the Italian news company Fanpage.it with the aim of putting an end towards domestic violence. It starts off with the cameraman asking several different boys, who they claim are ordinary members of the public, their names and ages on a busy Italian street. The children answer with a number of ages, that range from six to eleven. The boys are then asked what they would like to do when they grow up and they answer with a variety of professions that include a pizza maker, a footballer, a firefighter, a policeman and a baker. Next, a pretty young girl with long blonde hair called Martina appears and is introduced to the boy who is being interviewed.

"On Earth, free-burning and smouldering fire can usually be put out with water. But in space – where there is no up or down – fire behaves in bizarre ways creating spheres of floating flames. Now, a new Vine recently posted by astronaut Reid  Wiseman, has revealed this incredible phenomenon in action. Flames in space burn with a lower temperature, at a lower rate, and with less oxygen than in normal gravity. This means that materials used to extinguish the fire must be present in higher concentrations. The slow flow of air from the fans mixing the air in a spacecraft can make the flames burn even faster. To help understand how flames burn in space, Flex researchers ignite a small drop of either heptane or methanol. As this little sphere of fuel burns for about 20 seconds, it is engulfed by a spherically symmetric flame. The droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out. ‘A floating sphere of fire comes alive in Flex-2 @ISS_Science – may lead to better engines on Earth,’ wrote the 38-year-old from Baltimore who is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the International Space Station. On the ISS - which is the size of an American football field - putting out even a small fire quickly is a life-and-death matter. For several years, Nasa's Flame Extinguishment Experiment, or Flex, has conducted more than 200 tests to better understand the fundamentals of flames and how to control them in microgravity.

Flames in space burn with a lower temperature, at a lower rate, and with less oxygen than in normal gravity . When a flame burns on Earth, heated gases rise from the fire creating a buoyant flow that draws oxygen into the flame and combustion products away from it. This creates a flame shape. ‘In space molecular diffusion draws oxygen to the flame and combustion products away from the flame at a rate 100 times slower than the buoyant flow on Earth,’ Dan Dietrich, project scientist, Nasa’s Glenn Research Center, said.

This allows astronauts to better study the rate at which fuel mixtures evaporate and burn, as well as understating the conditions required for soot to form.

"It is the most iconic image ever taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope. Taken in 1995, is revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16. Now, the space telescope has revisited the three pillar - and taken these stunning new images. Scroll down for video . The new Hubble photo of the pillars of creation is sharper than the original, and also has a wider field of view. It also reveals the base of the cold, gassy columns for the first time. Released today during the American Astronomical Society's annual winter meeting, the new Hubble photo is sharper than the original, and also has a  wider field of view. It also reveals the base of the cold, gassy columns for the first time. Astronomers also asked the telescope to shoot the same region in both visible and infrared light. The infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie, wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars. That's because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust, except for the densest regions of the pillars. Newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars. 'Though such butte-like features are common in star-forming regions, the M16 structures are by far the most photogenic and evocative,' researchers said. The original Hubble image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows, on tee-shirts and pillows, and even on a postage stamp. In celebration of its 25th anniversary, Hubble has revisited the famous pillars, providing astronomers with a sharper and wider view. The infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie, wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars. Taken in 1995, Hubble's original image revealed never-before-seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16. Although the original image was dubbed the Pillars of Creation, the new image hints that they are also pillars of destruction. 'I'm impressed by how transitory these structures are. They are actively being ablated away before our very eyes. The ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space. 'We have caught these pillars at a very unique and short-lived moment in their evolution,' explained Paul Scowen of Arizona State University in Tempe, who, with astronomer Jeff Hester, formerly of Arizona State University, led the original Hubble observations of the Eagle Nebula. The infrared image shows that the reason the pillars exist is because the very ends of them are dense, and they shadow the gas below them, creating the long, pillar-like structures. The gas in between the pillars has long since been blown away by the ionizing winds from the central star cluster located above the pillars. At the top edge of the left-hand pillar, a gaseous fragment has been heated up and is flying away from the structure, underscoring the violent nature of star-forming regions. 'These pillars represent a very dynamic, active process,' Scowen said. 'The gas is not being passively heated up and gently wafting away into space. 'The gaseous pillars are actually getting ionized (a process by which electrons are stripped off of atoms) and heated up by radiation from the massive stars. 'And then they are being eroded by the stars' strong winds (barrage of charged particles), which are sandblasting away the tops of these pillars.' When Scowen and Hester used Hubble to make the initial observations of the Eagle Nebula in 1995, astronomers had seen the pillar-like structures in ground-based images, but not in detail. They knew that the physical processes are not unique to the Eagle Nebula because star birth takes place across the universe. But at a distance of just 6,500 light-years, M16 is the most dramatic nearby example, as the team soon realized. By comparing the 1995 and 2014 pictures, astronomers also noticed a lengthening of a narrow jet-like feature that may have been ejected from a newly forming star. As Paul Scowen of Arizona State Universitywas piecing together the Hubble exposures of the Eagle, he was amazed at what he saw. 'I called Jeff Hester on his phone and said, 'You need to get here now,'' Scowen recalled. 'We laid the pictures out on the table, and we were just gushing because of all the incredible detail that we were seeing for the very first time.' The first features that jumped out at the team in 1995 were the streamers of gas seemingly floating away from the columns. Astronomers had previously debated what effect nearby massive stars would have on the surrounding gas in stellar nurseries. 'There is only one thing that can light up a neighborhood like this: massive stars kicking out enough horsepower in ultraviolet light to ionize the gas clouds and make them glow,' Scowen said. 'Nebulous star-forming regions like M16 are the interstellar neon signs that say, 'We just made a bunch of massive stars here.' This was the first time we had directly seen observational evidence that the erosionary process, not only the radiation but the mechanical stripping away of the gas from the columns, was actually being seen.' The jet looks like a stream of water from a garden hose. Over the intervening 19 years, this jet has stretched farther into space, across an additional 60 billion miles, at an estimated speed of about 450,000 miles per hour. Our Sun probably formed in a similar turbulent star-forming region. There is evidence that the forming solar system was seasoned with radioactive shrapnel from a nearby supernova. That means that our Sun was formed as part of a cluster that included stars massive enough to produce powerful ionizing radiation, such as is seen in the Eagle Nebula. 'That's the only way the nebula from which the Sun was born could have been exposed to a supernova that quickly, in the short period of time that represents, because supernovae only come from massive stars, and those stars only live a few tens of millions of years,' Scowen explained. 'What that means is when you look at the environment of the Eagle Nebula or other star-forming regions, you're looking at exactly the kind of nascent environment that our Sun formed in.'","Original image was taken in 1995 showing  three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16 .

"Tourists in India will be given helpline numbers and a list of 'dos and don'ts' after an alleged month-long abduction and gang-rape of a Japanese student was branded a 'national shame'. India's tourist minister Mahesh Sharma spoke after the 22-year-old woman escaped an ordeal in which she was allegedly lured to a Buddhist shrine then locked in a basement at gunpoint. Five men have been arrested in the case, the latest in a string of alleged violent gang rapes to blight India's reputation overseas. Horror: Tourists in India will be handed helpline numbers and a list of 'dos and don'ts' after the country's tourism minister branded the gang-rape of a Japanese student visiting Kolkata (pictured) a 'national shame' 'The incident is a national shame', said Mr Sharma, according to ZeeNews. 'Government will soon release helpline numbers for foreign tourists. List of dos and don'ts will also be issued to foreign nationals.' He added to CNN: 'We are only getting 6.9million tourists in a year so that's a matter of concern for us. (We have) to take care of the security of travellers'. Details first emerged on Friday of how the Japanese university student was allegedly kidnapped and handed over to two tour guides who gang-raped her in a basement for three weeks. The 22-year-old is said to have befriended a trio of men when she visited Kolkata, the former seat of the British Raj and India's third-largest city. Attack: The victim is said to have been lured to the famous Bodh Gaya temple complex (file photo) According to police, they met her on November 20, persuaded her to draw $1,200 (£800) in cash and took her to the famed Buddhist shrine of Bodh Gaya, in neighbouring Bihar state. The men, one of whom spoke Japanese, are then said to have handed her over to two brothers who kept her locked her in a secluded underground room and repeatedly raped her. After three weeks she was taken for medical treatment in the city of Gaya where she managed to escape, according to reports. Eventually she reached the Hindu holy city of Varanasi, where she met some Japanese tourists who helped her contact the consulate in Kolkata. It is not known how or exactly when the woman's ordeal came to an end, but she filed a police complaint in the last week of December. The two brothers were arrested on Friday and taken to Kolkata, where a magistrate ordered that they be remanded in custody until January 9 for an identification parade. Kolkata joint police commissioner Pallab Kanti Ghosh said the other three men were being held on suspicion of extorting money from the victim and then handing her over to the alleged rapists. 'We have arrested three people who befriended the victim in Kolkata,' he said. 'They have been charged with common conspiracy and intention to kidnap and rape. 'The men managed to extort 76,000 rupees ($1,200) from her and convinced her to travel to Bodh Gaya with them in their car.' Japan's consul-general in Kolkata, Kazumi Endo, said: '(When) we came to know of the incident... we assisted her in registering the complaint with the police'. The case is the latest in a string of high-profile sex attacks that have highlighted the frightening levels of violence against women in India, the world's second most populous country. Anger: The case is the latest in a string of high-profile sex attacks, including the gang rape on a bus in New Delhi which made global headlines in December 2012. Pictured, protesters marking the second anniversary . India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women after the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012, which sparked a global outcry. The most recent attack echoes that of a 25-year-old Japanese woman who was gang-raped in 2010 while she was on her way to the railway station in Gaya. Sex attacks against women from Western countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have received major media  coverage and tourism bosses are wary of their negative impact. In January 2014 a 51-year-old Danish tourist was robbed and gang-raped at knifepoint in Delhi in a case that grabbed national and international headlines. In 2013 a Swiss cyclist holidaying in the central state of Madhya Pradesh was robbed and raped by five men, all of whom were later jailed for life. Samina Khatoon, sister of the two brothers arrested in the latest case, denied the charge of gang rape and demanded a thorough probe into the incident. 'We also want a medical examination of the victim. It will prove that my brothers are innocent,' she said.","Five men held after woman, 22, escaped underground room in Bihar state .

"They were a symbol of the Fuhrer’s vision for world domination, produced a lot of dung down in deepest Devon…and now, it turns out, have ended up in some ‘very tasty’ sausages. The mouth-watering, if unfortunate, end of half of the only herd of ‘Nazi’ cattle in England was revealed yesterday as the farmer who owns them told how he was forced to send seven to the abattoir because they were ‘incredibly aggressive’. Derek Gow, 49, said: ‘The ones we had to get rid of would just attack you any chance they could. They would try to kill anyone. Dealing with that was not a lot of fun at all.’ Scroll down for video . Derek Gow, 49 (pictured), who runs Upcott Grange Farm in Lifton, Devon, has been forced to get rid of seven of his Auroch cows - known as 'Nazi cows' - as he could not handle their 'incredibly aggressive' nature . The once-extinct Aurochs were brought back to life by Adolf Hitler's scientists in the 1930s after officially dying out 4,000 years ago. They arrived in Britain for the first time in 2009 when Mr Gow imported 13 cows . The cows in question are a relic of Adolf Hitler’s support for a scheme to revive the mighty auroch – a huge beast which featured heavily in Teutonic folklore. The aurochs had been hunted to extinction in Europe by 1627, but two zoologist brothers decided to ‘bring them back to life’ in a breeding plan which later won Nazi support. Heinz and Lutz Heck mixed animals from the Scottish Highlands, Corsica and the French Camargue, as well as Spanish fighting bulls. After the fall of the Nazis, the Heck cattle were seen as an unwanted reminder of German oppression and efforts to build a master race, and almost all of them were destroyed. But a few survived, and 13 were shipped from a conservation park in Belgium to Mr Gow’s farm at Broadwoodwidger on the Devon-Cornwall border in 2009. It was the first time the beasts had been seen in Britain for more than 4,000 years. But yesterday Mr Gow said he ‘couldn’t handle’ the rogue members of the herd, adding: ‘What the Germans did with their breeding programme was create something truly primeval. The aurochs were wild bulls.’ The Hecks’ programme was so successful the cows flourished and were used in propaganda material during the Second World War. Mr Gow says they are shorter than the aurochs, but retain their half-ton ancestors’ muscular build and lethal horns. Mr Gow, a father of two, said he had to reduce his herd (pictured) because the cows had tried to kill some members of his staff and would 'attack at any chance they could'. They have now been sent to an abattoir . Mr Gow said  the cows he sent to the abattoir will be turned into sausages and will be sold in Europe . He added: ‘As far as being a commercial breed is concerned, they have little value, but they are a significant animal from a conservation point of view. For instance, each cow can produce its own weight in dung every year, which is a great source of food for insects and bugs and nutrients for the environment.’ But he added of the aggressive ones: ‘I have worked with a range of different animals from bison to deer and I have never come across anything like these. ‘To get them into the trailer to get them off the farm we used a young and very athletic young man to stand on the ramp and they charged at him before he quickly jumped out the way. 'When the Germans were selecting them to create this animal they used Spanish fighting cattle to give them the shape and ferocity they wanted. The Auroch breed was brought 'back to life' under orders by Adolf Hitler (pictured) in the 1930s . The half-tonne cattle died out in Britain 4,000 years ago but remained widespread across much of Europe until the 1600s. However, they were finally wiped out in 1627 after they were hunted to extinction for their horns, hide and meat. They were saved in the early 1930s when Hitler wanted to recreate the breed to evoke the power of the 'runes, folklore and legends of the Germanic peoples'. Heinz and Lutz Heck found their descendants in a cattle from the Scottish Highlands, Corsica and the French Camargue, as well as Spanish fighting bulls. They then identified the particular Auroch gene, which they were able to use to bring them back from the 'dead'. The cows were later transported to game parks in Schorfheide near Berlin, and the Neander Valley in Dusseldorf. Mr Gow said: 'The Aurochs were wild bulls. Julius Caesar recorded them as being bulls as big as elephants. 'Young men hunted these bulls as preparation for battle and leadership in war, but also to obtain these huge 6ft-wide horns that the bulls had as drinking vessels and war horns. They were huge trophies.' 'The reason the Nazis were so supportive of the project is they wanted them to be fierce and aggressive. 'Since they have gone it is all peaceful again. Peace reigns supreme on the farm. 'Despite these problems, I have no regrets at all. It has been a good thing to do and the history of them is fascinating.' The meat from the slaughtered cows was turned into sausages which Mr Gow said were ‘very tasty’ – and a bit like a cross between venison and beef. They will be sold in Europe, he said, but probably not marketed as ‘Nazi sausages’. He explained: 'I'm not sure how appealing Third Reich sausages would be but they might be popular with some. 'They are very tasty though and taste like a cross between beef and venison and are sought after in Austria and Germany. They are a different product with low fat and cholesterol. 'I don't imagine any of them are sold locally but we are looking in the future to create a speciality market for them. 'But we need to get to a stage where it is a manageable herd that can be used for normal farming.' Hitler saw the 'super cows' as a symbol of German and Aryan might and tasked leading geneticists, brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, to bring the Aurochs 'back into existence'. The pair traced the species' descendants to domestic breeds and managed to 'pull the wild genes out' in a Jurassic Park-style experiment. The Hecks' programme at zoos in Berlin and Munich was so successful that the new Aurochs flourished and were used in propaganda material during the Second World War. Mr Gow, a father of two, said his cows were slightly shorter than the original Aurochs, but retain their ancestors' muscular build, deep brown complexion, and shaggy coffee-coloured fringe. He added: 'Importing the cattle has been an interesting project for us - they have such an unusual history. 'There was a thinking around that time that you could selectively breed animals for Aryan characteristics, which were rooted in runes, folklore and legend. 'Heck cattle were the product of an attempt to back-breed using a number of existing older species, including Spanish fighting bulls, Fresians and Simmentals.' The cattle, which have lethal-looking horns and a muscular build, are unlike any modern commercial breed of cow. They were almost destroyed following the defeat of Nazism in 1945, but some survived after they were shipped to game parks in Western Europe. Mr Gow said: 'As far as being a commercial breed is concerned, they have little value, but they are a significant animal from a conservation point of view. 'For instance, each cow can produce its own weight in dung every year, which is a great source of food for insects and bugs and nutrients for the environment. 'The Auroch was extinct, but domestic descendants - Friesians, Simmentals and everything else - were still kicking around the countryside. 'The two brothers argued that if the one wild animal that spawned all of these had gone, through a process of back-breeding domestic cattle, you could pull the wild genes out and recreate the ancestor. 'Between the two wars, there was a thinking that you could selectively breed animals - and indeed people - for Aryan characteristics, for characteristics that were rooted in runes, folklore and legend.'","Farmer Derek Gow imported 13 'Heck' cattle from Belgium to Lifton, Devon .

"The flu epidemic continues to rage into the new year with the deadly virus now widespread in 43 U.S. states - up seven from the previous count. According to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention there have been 21 pediatric deaths this season as a result of the mutated H3N2 strain, with six fatalities in the week of Christmas alone. During this period, there were 7,289 newly diagnosed infections, bringing the total number of cases to 37,938. Scroll down for video . Spread: This map reveals the sweep of flu across the United States with almost the entire country reporting widespread flu . CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung announced on Monday that the situation could worsen as the flu has yet to rev up to high levels in large states like New York and California. While the rest of the country is on red alert, the West Coast and Alaska have been experiencing outbreaks at a 'regional' level. There have been 'sporadic' incidents in Hawaii and no reports in Washington, D.C., Guam or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Because the flu strain  has mutated this year the CDC says  vaccines currently on the market may be ineffective. Fever, chills . Cough, sore throat, runny nose, . Muscle aches . Headache . Fatigue, . Nausea . Source: CDC . Those particularly at risk of illness are those over 65 and children younger than four. Across the nation, 3,441 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis. According to the CDC, data from 122 U.S. cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline. About 96 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent H3N2 sub-type, the CDC reported. Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong. The flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in December while battling the illness. Shannon Zwanziger, 17, from Minnesota, passed away in early December after contracting the flu . Shannon Zwanziger, a 17-year-old senior at Owatonna High School in Minnesota died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu. Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week. Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away. The CDC admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2. That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly. 'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden. CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC. Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season. Ineffective: A man receives a free flu shot from a Walgreens employee during a free flu shot clinic at Allen Temple Baptist Church on December 19, 2014 in Oakland, California . Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter. The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. The three most deadly flu seasons of the last ten years - in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 - were H3N2 seasons. In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said. But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said. An official with one vaccine manufacturer - GlaxoSmithKline - emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain. 'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business. HOW BAD IS THIS FLU SEASON? It's not clear yet. Experts worry this winter will be unusually bad because the nasty bug that's making most people sick isn't included in this year's vaccine. Preliminary data on how well the vaccine is working is still weeks away. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading causes of death, killing roughly 24,000 a year, on average. HOW UNUSUAL IS FLU THIS YEAR? The different flu strain makes predictions more difficult. The current season hit hard in December - earlier than usual. But the last two flu seasons hit early, too. So far, flu hospitalization rates are similar to the harsh season two years ago, which was dominated by a similar flu virus. Especially this year, health officials this year are urging doctors to treat flu patients promptly with antiviral medications. HAS FLU BECOME EPIDEMIC? Yes, but that's not unusual. 'It's safe to say we have a flu epidemic every year,' Jhung said Monday. Epidemics occur when a virus spreads quickly and affects many people at the same time. According to one CDC definition, flu is epidemic when a certain percentage of deaths in a given week are due to flu and pneumonia. By that measure, flu epidemics occurred in nine of the last dozen winters, including this one. Flu-related deaths surpassed the epidemic threshold three weeks ago, then dropped below that level the next week. But other measures indicate flu still is epidemic. IS IT TOO LATE TO GET A FLU SHOT? CDC officials say no. The flu season appears to be on track to peak this month, but even if it does, the flu will still be around for months. Despite the new flu strain, the vaccine has been well matched in roughly a third of the flu cases seen so far. And it is considered to be effective against some other flu viruses that could surge in the late winter or spring. About 40per cent of the public was vaccinated against flu as of November, which is about normal in recent years, Jhung said.","Mutated strain of H3N2 virus has hospitalized 3,441 people nationwide .

"Harry Redknapp remains confident QPR will avoid relegation this season but admits his side must urgently improve their form away from home. Rangers have taken four points from their opening five Barclays Premier League games but are still winless on their travels after two 4-0 thumpings by Tottenham and Manchester United either side of a 1-0 loss at Burton in the Capital One Cup. QPR face a tough trip on Saturday to high-flying Southampton, who sit second in the table after an excellent start to the campaign under new boss Ronald Koeman. Harry Redknapp looks on as his QPR side entertained Stoke last weekend . Redknapp ushers instructions to his players after Niko Kranjcar's last-gasp equaliser for the Hoops . 'We've played well at home, our home form has been decent,' Redknapp said. 'I thought we played well against Hull in the first game, we had a good win against Sunderland and then we got a point against a good Stoke team - I think they'll be in the top half again this year. 'So that's encouraging but we have to take that away from home now, our two away performances haven't been good enough and we need to improve.' Redknapp added: 'We have had two tough away games - we'll play worse teams than Man United and Tottenham away that's for sure. 'We'll be okay, it's going to be tough, it's going to be tight but I'm still confident we'll be okay come the end of the season.' Redknapp is short of midfield options this weekend with Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch both unavailable with hamstring injuries and Niko Kranjcar also doubtful after picking up a knock against Stoke. There may be better news, however, regarding the fitness of Sandro who appeared to injure his knee while celebrating a goal in training. QPR face a tough trip to Ronald Koeman's Southampton this weekend, who have started the season superbly . Joey Barton went off injured for QPR during last weekend's game against Stoke at Loftus Road . The Brazilian has endured a series of knee problems in the past but the midfielder could be back for the trip to St Mary's. 'He told me that's not when he did it but I saw him and I thought that's when he did it when he slid on his knees celebrating,' Redknapp said. 'It shouldn't happen too often anyway because he's not a goalscorer. 'I was worried when he first did it, you fear the worst, but it looks like he's okay so that's good.' Another bizarre off-the-field incident saw Rangers defender Steven Caulker wrongfully arrested for stealing cheese from a supermarket this week but Redknapp said he was in the dark over the issue. Caulker looks set to start on Saturday and he will need to be at his best to contain a Saints side that has scored eight goals in their last three league matches. 'We're only five games in but at the moment they're looking the real deal,' Redknapp said. 'It's been fantastic what they've done, amazing really. 'When they lost all those players in the summer I think people thought that was the end of Southampton and that they'd be on the slide but Ronald Koeman has done an amazing job there. 'They play some good football, they've got good players - good young players coming through again as usual.' Redknapp, who left Southampton to return to their bitter rivals Portsmouth in December 2005, added: 'I always get a bit of grief down there. 'I think we went there and won last time and it was on my birthday so that was a good birthday present - let's hope we go and get a win there this time.'","The Rangers manager remains confident QPR will stay up this season despite a poor run of form on the road .

"A group of conservatives are banding together in the House to oppose Ohio Republican John Boehner's reelection to Speaker in retaliation for a budget deal leadership supported at the end of last year. A half dozen Republicans, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa and David Brat of Virginia, have said they won't vote for Boehner in tomorrow's speaker election. Texas lawmaker Louie Gohmert on Sunday put his name forth as a challenger. Boehner has little chance of losing the gavel, as it would take a defection of nearly 30 members of his caucus to put his position in jeopardy. The last time disgruntled conservatives and tea partiers tried to take out their party leader, they ultimately mustered just 10 Republican votes against him. House Speaker John Boehner is pictured here on Capitol Hill last month. Conservatives are trying to oust him from his leadership post but his office doesn't seem to be worried . 'Rep. Boehner was selected as the House Republican Conference's choice for Speaker in November, and he expects to be elected by the whole House next week,' the congressman's spokesman, Michael Steel, said in a statement, writing off the insurgent effort. Still, the vote will be a key indicator of just how much negotiating it will take for House Republican leaders to keep their members in line over the next several months as party gets its first opportunity in Democratic President Barack Obama's tenure to sideline him. Beginning tomorrow, Republicans will make up majorities in both chambers of Congress for the first time since Obama was elected after picking up nine additional Senate seats in November. No sooner had the votes from the midterm elections been tallied before Republicans were arguing among themselves about what to do with their new powers. The first preview of Republican leadership of Congress came in mid December when the legislative body was under the gun to pass appropriations legislation or see the government shut down. The House was only able to pass a $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that funded the government through the end of the fiscal year, with the exception of Homeland Security, which it put on a shorter leash, after President Obama rallied Democrats to support the measure. Conservatives in the House refused to attach their names to the bill over ire at Obama for giving millions of illegal immigrants safe haven in the U.S. Had they had it their way, the bill would have included language restricting the Obama administration from using immigration funds to register illegal residents of the country for work permits. Alternatively, conservatives lobbied for legislation that would have short-term funded the entire government through February, giving their party more leverage over Obama once Republicans elected in November were seated in Congress. Boehner's decision to join forces with the opposition party to pass the spending bill didn't sit well with conservatives, and over the holiday break separating the previous legislative session with the 114th Congress, they began plotting a rebellion. 'While I like Speaker Boehner personally, he will not have my support for Speaker,' Brat said in an op-ed in Breitbart News. 'Our current leadership was recently tested when Mr. Obama attempted to circumvent Congress and the law by unilaterally granting amnesty to illegal immigrants by presidential decree. His decree provides illegal immigrants with work permits, legal status, and free federal entitlements. But on a much more significant front, his action shows a complete disregard for our constitutional system where Congress makes the laws and the president's duty is to enforce them. The recently elected lawmaker, who defeated former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary election last summer and joined Congress early after Cantor resigned, blasted Boehner for allowing funding for 'illegal amnesty' to be allowed in the spending bill and for going to House Democrats to get the votes he needed instead of members of his own party. 'Washington is broken in part because our party's leadership has strayed from its own principles of free market, limited government, constitutional conservatism,' Brat wrote. Texas lawmaker Louie Gohmert said Sunday that he would challenge Boehner unless a more viable Republican jumps in the race. 'At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate,' he said. 'It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands' On Sunday, in announcing his candidacy for speaker, Gohmert also cited the spending bill controversy. 'After the November elections gave Republicans control of the Senate, voters made clear they wanted change. 'There have been numerous examples of problematic Republican leadership, but we were hopeful our leaders got the voters’ message. However, after our Speaker forced through the CRomnibus by passing it with Democratic votes and without time to read it, it seemed clear that we needed new leadership,' he stated. Gohmert said that he'd 'heard from many supporters and also friends in Congress who have urged me to put forward my name for Speaker... to increase our chances of change' yet said he'd be open to voting for another one of his colleagues instead. 'At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate. It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands,' he said. 'I am putting forward my name for consideration as Speaker and hope that with a new Speaker, be that me or someone else, we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in November.' Florida congressman Ted Yoho, one of a cadre of Republicans who voted against Boehner in the last election for speaker, provided similar reasons for his resistance to the Ohio lawmaker's reelection. 'Our vote for a new Speaker is not a personal vote against Representative Boehner—it is a vote against the status quo,' he said in a Facebook post. 'Our vote is a signal to the American people that we too, have had enough of Washington politics, and that we will stand with the American people.' In this Jan. 5, 2011 photo, House Speaker-designate John Boehner of Ohio wipes away tears as he waits to receive the gavel from outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., during the first session of the 112th Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Boehner was unanimously elected to speaker by Republicans four years ago today . So far, North Carolina's Walter Jones, Kentucky's Thomas Massie, Oklahoma's Jim Bridenstine and Iowa's King are the only other Republicans to say they would not vote for Boehner tomorrow. 'We need a Speaker who will help us all keep our oath, including his own, to the Constitution, not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours,' King said in a statement. 'I will vote for an alternative candidate for Speaker. I can't vote for John Boehner again.' However, a handful of new representatives that include Barry Loudermilk and Jody Hice of Georgia, John Ratcliffe of Texas, Gary Palmer of Alabama and Mark Walker of North Carolina have suggested in the past that they would not support Boehner. And Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, New Mexico Rep. Steve Pearce, Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp and Arizona lawmakers Paul Gosar and Matt Salmon have all voted against Boehner in a past election or recently expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership. Republicans hold a 246-seat majority in the House and Boehner only needs 218 votes to prevail over Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi and his conservative challengers if all 435 Members of Congress were to vote tomorrow. One vote that will go uncast is that of New York Rep. Michael Grimm, whose resignation takes effect today. Other members of both political parties could show their agitation with their side's leaders by abstaining. But refusing to vote merely lowers the threshold for reaching a consensus. At the start of the 113th Congress Boehner received 220 votes for speaker and Pelosi garnered 192. But only 426 members voted, making 214 votes necessary to reach a majority. If Boehner hadn't won outright, voting would have gone to a second round, giving conservatives an opportunity to ignite a revolution.","Speaker John Boehner's decision to join forces with the Democratic party to pass the spending bill didn't sit well with conservatives .

"Actor Benedict Cumberbatch is as closely related to Richard III as the Queen, a genealogist has claimed. Professor Kevin Schurer has revealed Cumberbatch and the 15th century monarch are third cousins, 16 times removed, as the Sherlock star prepares to play the king in a new BBC series. The Pro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Leicester traced the line of descent, originating from Edward III - Richard III's great great grandfather, all the way to Cumberbatch. This is not the first time the actor's ancestry has revealed surprising parallels with his roles, as genealogists claimed he was related to codebreaker Alan Turing, who he played in 'The Imitation Game'. Scroll down for video . Actor Benedict Cumberbatch is as closely related to Richard III as the Queen, a genealogist has claimed . Professor Kevin Schurer has revealed Cumberbatch and the 15th century monarch (right) are third cousins, 16 times removed . It is estimated that between one million and 17 million people in the UK are connected in some way to the monarch whose remains were discovered buried beneath a  car park in Leicester in 2012. But Prof Schurer said: 'He (Cumberbatch) is more direct because he is a third cousin. Most other relatives would be much lower order cousins. 'I think the Queen would be a third cousin several times removed as well.' The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays. Cumberbatch family genealogist, Bob Cumberbatch, said: 'Personally, I think it's fabulous. 'My colleague Andrew Millard estimates that there is a probability greater than 99 per cent that a modern English person is descended from Edward III. The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays . 'However, he adds that finding documentary evidence of this connection is a completely different matter. 'Miriam Silverman, of Ancestry UK, discovered a connection between Benedict and Alan Turing and now the Leicester team have extended this to reveal a connection to Richard III. 'If Andrew Millard's conclusions are right then it seems highly probable that Benedict may indeed be related to many characters he has played and will play in future with some exceptions such as Sherlock.' Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of the victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church. In February 2013 a skeleton discovered beneath a Leicester car park was confirmed as that of the English king. Cumberbatch is believed to be as closely related to Richard III (right) as the Queen . In February 2013 a skeleton discovered beneath a Leicester car park was confirmed as that of the English king . The spot (circled in red) where archaeologists found the remains of the 15th century monarch . He is set to be reburied in March and thousands of people from around the world have applied for tickets for the ceremony. Professor Schurer, who played a key role in identifying Richard's modern day relations, published a paper  showing there was a 99.999 per cent probability that the remains were those of the king. Cumberbatch also shares a common 15th century ancestor, John Beaufort, the Earl of Somerset, with Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing, making them 17th cousins. Turing helped alter the course of the war after he created a machine that allowed the Allies to read secret German messages. The star, who won plaudits for playing a slave owner in 12 Years A Slave last year, is also descended from a long line of slave owners in Barbados. Earlier this year, a New York City commissioner, Stacey Cumberbatch, claimed she gained her distinctive surname because her ancestors were owned by the star's fifth great-grandfather on a sugar plantation. Cumberbatch once said his part in another anti-slavery film – Amazing Grace – was a sort of apology' for his ancestry. He also revealed that his mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, once urged him not to use his real surname professionally in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. A plastic facial model made from the skull of England's King Richard III . Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite's eggs in soil taken from Richard III's pelvic region. The find suggests that the king's intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.","Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard III are third cousins, 16 times removed .

Musing about his school teachers in an article for a magazine, Earl Spencer wrote about his experiences of Maidwell. ‘I had only ever stayed one night away from home and I was sleepless for six months before going. But it was the done thing so off I went … straight into survival mode,’ he wrote. The place was ‘Cold and unpleasant … quite tough, with a slightly terrifying headmaster and military-style drill in the morning … Once a week, boys deemed stupid or lazy were beaten really unpleasantly with a cane on bare buttocks.’ This is not the first time that Maidwell Hall has been the subject of public comment. In his memoir of childhood, In The Blood, the former poet laureate Andrew Motion writes about Maidwell Hall as a prison run by sadistic sociopaths. Motion said the then headmaster Oliver Wyatt ‘enjoyed beating’ the boys. Indeed, there didn’t seem to be a crime that didn’t merit a caning on the buttocks. ‘He beat us if we did badly at work, if we were cheeky, if we walked with our hands in our pockets, if we left the middle button on our jackets undone, if we walked on the grass by the statue standing on one leg, if we slammed doors, if we barged ahead of masters, if we swore, if we made a mess in our lockers, if we didn’t have our towels, if we had fights, if we damaged the flowers, if we hid our food.’ In an interview in 2005, Motion explained that ‘there were two kinds of beating. There was beating at the end of the day in our dormitories where the head came round and slippered people, and there was “the swish” (cane) administered in his study. This was in the early Sixties, but the regime was Dickensian.’ Reviewing Motion’s memoir, fellow schoolboy Tom Fort admitted that the ‘regime of constant corporal punishment [would today] land the perpetrator in prison’. Maidwell Hall in Northampton (pictured) is fondly remembered by many, but Earl Spencer described it as 'cold and unpleasant' Yet how do those views chime with my memories, and those of my pals? We hardly seem a traumatised bunch when we gather to reminisce. As Boris Starling says: ‘It was an eccentric place but with a good heart.’ The school is an austere building constructed around four towers and partly clad in dark brown Northamptonshire stone. The grounds are vast and include a large wooded area known as the Wilderness and a lake. I was still seven when I arrived to board. The place seemed huge to me, as did the older boys. It seems strange now to think that I found 12-year-old boys terrifying! We slept in dormitories on rickety beds whose springs sagged in the middle, and we knew to stop mucking about when we heard the matron, Mrs Ford, approaching; her high heels clickety-clacking on the wooden floors. The headmaster was a man called Porch who may have had a rather terrifying appearance, but nevertheless had a good sense of humour. As he came around the dorms to say goodnight, we would set traps above the door so that when he entered a cascade of books and shoes would rain down on to his bald and shiny pate. He would then chase us around the room and put whoever he caught across his knee for a mild slippering. As we gathered in the dining room to eat tea, the head-boy would read out a list of the day’s miscreants who were instructed to ‘come down’. For some reason, I was often on it — although it was never a short list. Well-educated: After attending Maidwell Hall, the Earl, pictured, went on to study at Eton then Oxford . The condemned would stand in a line in the hall outside the headmaster’s study, and the head boy would appear. To the right of the hall’s fireplace was an alcove, from where the head boy would retrieve a pair of crimson slippers. These he then carried along the line of boys and into the study. I was whacked so often that for about ten years after I was always nervous come tea-time. For graver misdemeanours it was not the slippers but the cane. For this we were instructed to take down our trousers and kneel on a footstool. I was caned frequently for not working hard enough. But it didn’t seem to make much difference to my attitude. Neither did my parents’ attempt to make me work harder with bribery: 20p for a better grade. It wasn’t until I got my Common Entrance results from the headmaster — I was told bluntly: ‘Sitwell, you failed!’, which meant I could not go on to my next school — that I was shocked into working. I re-took it and passed. Meanwhile, the school’s staff were straight out of an Ealing comedy. There was Mr Flower who styled himself on Hitler. He had the haircut and moustache, (and drove a grey VW Beetle) and referred to himself as Uncle Adolf. He would divide our class into two groups: imbeciles and morons, and when he wasn’t teaching us history taught the principles of ‘treacle mining’. There were even questions on ‘treacle mining’ in our exams. It was only years later that it occurred to me the concept of molasses being mined and then processed into treacle was Uncle Adolf’s humorous hoax. There was the odd-job-man, Mr Powell. He lived above a barn amid cats and straw, and when he wanted to visit Northampton (a mere ten miles away) he would always walk. And there was Miss Darling, the assistant matron who we were all in love with: we would go to great pains to try to get her to help us have a bath. The days always started with every pupil and there about 80 of us — on parade at the front of the school. There we lined up to do star-jumps. We were next outdoors at break-time, where gang warfare would erupt. The older boys would capture a few younger ones (‘squits’) and take them into the Wilderness, where they had dug out a den and made a roof out of corrugated iron. After some gentle torture, it would be back inside and more lessons. I was caned frequently for not working hard enough, says former pupil William Sitwell . We called masters ‘Sir’ and any female staff ‘Please’, we had to tip our plates at meal-times to show we had wiped them clean (often a struggle, I recall lots of cabbage) and on Sunday mornings had to write two sides of A5 to our parents. I didn’t contribute much on the games pitch and neither did I enjoy the compulsory dips in the outdoor, unheated swimming pool. Yet many of our hours were filled with roaming the grounds, climbing trees and feeling free. We were always glad to return after an away match at some other boarding school where the buildings seemed more austere and smelled of dirty laundry and the food was far worse. To this day, walking through the school in my mind, I can remember every corner of the place. It’s a rather softer, cosier institution today, not least because they’ve introduced girls. I gave a talk there a couple of years ago, in the main hall where once we were taught dancing and watched black-and-white movies from an ancient projector. The whole school assembled, and as I finished my talk on food history there was a vast sea of hands with eager questions. Maidwell Hall always did encourage thought and independence. And when we old boys gather in a few weeks, we’ll shrug off the slipperings and cold dips, and look back fondly on the adventure we all had there when we were little.","Earl Spencer described Maidwell Hall in Northants as 'cold and unpleasant'
