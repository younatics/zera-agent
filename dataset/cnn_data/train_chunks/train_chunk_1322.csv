"Women in their 40s could have IVF on the NHS under updated guidelines this week. The changes could also make it easier for lesbian couples to receive free IVF. Current advice, from 2004, recommends the taxpayer stop funding IVF at the age of 39. Currently IVF is only offered on the NHS to women aged 39 or under but this could be increased to 42 . A draft of overhauled guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggests raising the age limit to 42 for some women who have not had fertility treatment before and have no other chance of having a baby. They would be given one attempt at IVF, rather than the recommended three cycles for younger women. It also proposes giving IVF on the NHS to lesbians who have already tried other techniques. Some, but not all clinics, already do this. However, the topic isn’t addressed under existing rules. The change would bring the advice in line with fertility laws which no longer require clinics to take into account a father’s influence to approve treatment. Dr Jane Stewart, secretary of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘Fertility problems are a bona fide health issue and should be funded as such. However, there is a risk that without central direction there will continue to be variation according to postcode, and that is regrettable.’ The plans could benefit lesbians who have already tried other techniques. Some clinics already offer this . The updated guidelines, which will be finalised on Wednesday, are designed to take into account progress in IVF treatment. NICE says it wants to ensure that everyone who has fertility problems has ‘access to the best levels of help’. But campaign groups have accused it of social engineering, saying that approving IVF for lesbians amounts to deliberately depriving children of a father. Other recommendations include cutting the amount of time that couples need to wait before being referred for IVF from three years to two.","The move may make it easier for lesbian couples to receive fertility treatment .

"Manchester United's winning run was extended to six games on Sunday, largely because of superb performance from Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea. De Gea produced a string of excellent saves to deny Liverpool, to continue a magnificent season for the United keeper. And, as United took advantage of De Gea's brilliance, fans responded on the internet with a new set of virals to mark the occasion. David de Gea makes a superb stop, tipping a Mario Balotelli shot onto the crossbar at Old Trafford . De Gea denies Balotelli again, and the keeper also made several stops against Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . The hashtag #ThingsDavidDeGeaCouldSave began trending as Twitter users posted pictures of De Gea saving everything from the Titanic to Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter.

"Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie’s names will forever be etched on the scoresheet that immortalises Manchester United’s 3-0 win over Liverpool, but few would argue it was keeper David de Gea who had the biggest hand in the result. The Spanish keeper was outstanding as he tormented the Reds with eight official saves – six of them were match-changing and four were in one-on-one situations that should have favoured the player with the ball. Former Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina, who is now at Bayen Munich, said Liverpool wouldn't have lost were it not for De Gea and that his countryman was the best on the pitch 'by miles'. Former United custodian Peter Schmeichel had one word - 'brilliant'. David de Gea celebrates Manchester United's third goal but it's his saves that most helped beat Liverpool . De Gea raises his arms in triumph after making six saves and winning man of the match on Sunday . Here is how De Gea thwarted Brendan Rodgers' strikerless plot that saw false No 9 Raheem Sterling come face to face on a number of occasions with the keeper and come off second best. The introduction of a recognised front man at half-time didn't even help, with Mario Balotelli's efforts also drawing athletic stops from the impenetrable 24-year-old. 1) 12th minute . Raheem Sterling is slips in behind the United defence and Adam Lallana delivers a no-look through ball into his path. One-on-one with De Gea, Sterling tries to shoot to the far post but can't beat the keeper's outstretched left leg. Rooney scores at the other end 25 seconds later. De Gea's left leg saves from Raheem Sterling for the first time after a slick through ball from Adam Lallana . The Spanish keeper covered his near post and Sterling attempted to go to his left without success . 2) 23rd minute . Sterling turns Phil Jones inside out to bring himself one-on-one again with De Gea, who makes himself big and saves with his right thigh. After turning Phil Jones (left) with a slick turn Sterling shoots into a big De Gea's right thigh . 3) 51st minute . Sterling swoops on a shocking pass back to De Gea. The Liverpool speedster appears to have him beaten but keeps his feet, forces Sterling to take one more touch than he’d like to before showing his agility and saving with his right leg. Sterling is thwarted again, this time after picking up a poor back pass to De Gea . 4) 67th minute . Sterling finds Balotelli in the box and the Italian hits his side-footed shot first time with substantial power – De Gea's gloves tip the ball onto the cross bar. A raw display of reflexes from a stopper at the top of his game. Balotelli blasts his first-time shot shot goalwards but De Gea tips it onto the crossbar . 5) 82nd minute . Balotelli again gets a chance in the box courtesy of Sterling and shoots off balance through the traffic of two defenders right in front of De Gea. The keeper takes is easily though, diving low to his right and holding onto the ball to prevent further drama. 6) 85th minute . Balotelli is again found by a piercing through ball, this time from Lazar Markovic, and the Italian really should score. But again De Gea is up to the task. Balotelli can't beat De Gea one-on-one after a sensational through ball from Markovic . De Gea gets his angles spot on again as Balotelli is denied late on and confirms his clean sheet .

"Manchester United do not know when Argentine defender Marcos Rojo will be available again after he missed the 3-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday, admitted manager Louis van Gaal. Van Gaal told reporters the 24-year-old, signed from Sporting Lisbon in the summer, was injured in training on Saturday, which meant Phil Jones was brought in despite only just being back from injury. The manager declined to go into detail, saying only: 'I don't think it's healthy but I'm not a doctor.' Marcos Rojo missed Manchester United's 3-0 win against Liverpool on Sunday at old Trafford . United manager Louis van Gaal was unable to give a return date for the injured defender . United were already without injured defenders Rafael, Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw, which meant fielding a three-man backline of Jones, Jonny Evans and midfielder Michael Carrick. Meanwhile Liverpool's Australian goalkeeper Brad Jones, brought in for a first league appearance since March 2013, will stay in the side in place of the out-of-form Simon Mignolet. Manager Brendan Rodgers told reporters the change was for 'an indefinite period', adding that Jones will play in the Capital One Cup quarter-final away to Bournemouth on Wednesday.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's full match report from Old Trafford . Michael Carrick has started the last six games for Manchester United and they have won every one. That is not a coincidence. He is so versatile and experienced and his calming influence is helping the rest of the team. He is a good, honest player and he doesn’t try to overcomplicate things — all he has is a nasty habit of passing to his own team-mates! But it’s not just that he takes the easy option every time. He is always looking to pass it forward and get his attacking players on the ball in dangerous positions.

When he and Daley Blind are both fit, I would still pick Carrick ahead of the Dutchman, purely because he looks to pass forward more often. David de Gea had another excellent game between the sticks for United and Juan Mata scored one and set up another. People criticise Mata for not having an impact in the biggest games, but you couldn’t fault him on Sunday. Yes, he got lucky with his goal, which he scored from an offside position, but his assist for Robin van Persie’s strike was superb. No other player on the pitch would try a pass as cute as that.

"Lewis Hamilton came with his pet bulldog and went home with the top prize — BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The Mercedes racing driver was a surprise winner of the coveted award in a glittering ceremony in Glasgow, capping a year that saw him secure the Formula One world championship for a second time. He flew in from Los Angeles and flew pretty much straight back after adding his name to four previous winners from his sport — Sir Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell (twice) and Damon Hill (twice).

Hamilton walks down the red carpet in Glasgow on Sunday as his pet dog Roscoe slowly follows . Lewis Hamilton is held aloft after winning the F1 driver's championship in Abu Dhabi last month . It was a shock because the bookmakers had installed Rory McIlroy as odds-on favourite. Hamilton had always seemed to be ‘Marmite’ — loved or hated — but the people who like him spread their love in the live phone-in to take him one place higher than he managed in 2007 and 2008. The margin — 209,920 to McIlroy’s 123,745 — was an even bigger surprise. The Ulsterman looked upset at coming second. Jo Pavey, who won two major athletics medals — including European gold in the 10,000m — at the age of 40 and having returned to the track in May after the birth of her second child, was third. The claims of both Hamilton, who took his dog Roscoe for a walk on the red carpet before the ceremony, and McIlroy were immense. McIlroy’s brilliance was showcased in 25 days, starting with his first round at Hoylake, where he won The Open, and finishing with his final round at Valhalla, where he won the USPGA Championship. His first World Golf Championship win fell in the middle. His aggregate total was 48 under par and 11 of the 12 rounds were under 70. Remarkable statistics by any stretch and then there was the sheer uninhibited style of his play. Those claims were impressive. But so were Hamilton’s. He was only the fourth Briton to win double world championships — joining Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Stewart. He has won more races than any compatriot (33). His 11 race wins this season was another national record. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale joined the ceremony via video link from the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco .

Jill Stidever (Swimming) Oh, yes, the car was good but his ability to put it in places others could not at speeds they could not match was remarkable. It has been that way ever since he announced himself as a talent of rare brilliance. And he does it in a dangerous sport. One wonders how much nationality had to play in the outcome. McIlroy has said he will compete for Ireland at the Olympics. Hamilton, despite where his taxes are paid, is avowedly British. ‘I am so proud of being British,’ he said. ‘I am proud and honoured to be among such talent. A huge thank you to all the people who called in. It’s been such an incredible year. I couldn’t have done it without my team and my family. 'My father did four jobs to make this possible. Being here is a reminder of how many great sportsmen we have, and I never thought I would be up here with the greats. This is a dream.’ Yet another award fell at Cristiano Ronaldo’s twinkling feet when he was named Overseas Personality of the Year. On an evening populated by the royalty of Scottish sport — mostly handing out the prizes, though in the case of Sir Chris Hoy awarded one himself — as well as Prince Harry, Ronaldo added some foreign glitz. His Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale presented the award to his fellow and greatest Galactico, who this year scored his 200th goal in 178 games. His 23 hat-tricks is a La Liga record.

A misnomer perhaps, but who could begrudge him after his team was so good it almost rendered an intrinsically heart-stopping competition an anti-climax? In every sphere Europe had the measure of the USA, as they posted a 16½-11½ victory. Sunday night’s ceremony was staged in Glasgow’s Hydro, a venue for this summer’s superb Commonwealth Games. So it was appropriate that Hoy, a twice Commonwealth champion, was handed the Lifetime Achievement Award. Hoy, 38, is Britain’s most decorated Olympian with six gold medals and one silver on his bulging c.v. He also has 11 world titles. But the facts do not convey what a fabulous standard-bearer for British sport he has been. All 12,000 of the cheering home crowd realised something of his status as a true sportsman in the rounded sense of the word.

"With Christmas just around the corner, it's not unusual to see fans around the world getting into the festive spirit by wearing Santa hats to games. But Montpellier winger Anthony Mounier showed that it's the season of goodwill for players as well, pulling out a hat of his own on Saturday.

However, his team-mates were not able to give him the gift he really wanted, as Montpellier were pegged back late on. For every moment of Christmas joy there is also a scrooge, and referee Said Ennjimi somewhat spoiled the celebration by producing a yellow card, rather than a Christmas card, for Mounier. The game, in which the hosts had led 2-0 after just 16 minutes before Lens pulled back to equalise before half time, ended 3-3, which leaves Lens 19th in the table.","Montpellier winger scores to put his team 3-2 ahead .

"The bereaved mother of a victim of the 2012 Newtown school shooting wrote a letter to herself remembering the woman she was before the horrific tragedy. As a way to mark the two-year anniversary of her 6-year-old son's death--and the slaying of 19 other children--Nicole Hockley penned the emotional words that also detail the woman she's become since the shooting. 'Two years ago, on December 14, 2012, the world changed and you changed with it,' Hockley wrote on Today.com. Understandably, the change that occurred in the Connecticut mother was major and took her from an upbeat, life-loving woman to a more reserved person always with one eye on life's darker side. Scroll down for video . Letter to herself: Ian Hockley and Nicole Hockley, parents of Sandy Hook massacre victim Dylan Hockley, embrace during a press conference with fellow parents of victims on the one month anniversary of the Newtown elementary school massacre. Two years later, Mrs. Hockley would pen a public letter to her pre-massacre self . 'No longer brimming with optimism, you are now someone far more realistic and still. And you look back so much more,' she writes. Her words are a meditation on grief as well as a call to action. 'For all the Moms and Dads reading this now — this doesn't have to be you,' Hockley writes. 'Because every gun-related death is a preventable death.' Hockley urges parents everywhere to discuss with their children the facts about these deaths. Hockley's youngest son Dylan (left) died at the hands of Adam Lanza and his assault rifle. His older brother Jake (right) survived . 'If you have five minutes, with your kids. If you have two hours, host a conversation with other parents,' she writes. Hockley isn't alone in her quest to spread awareness of gun violence. Her fellow grieving mother spoke out against the epidemic on Sunday, saying it has broken the hearts of other mothers across the country. 'And just like our hearts were broken and we can't breathe, the hearts of the mothers in Ferguson, in Bridgeport, in Hartford, in Florida, in New Haven, in Danbury, they can't breathe,' said Nelba Marquez-Greene, who lost her daughter, Ana Grace. 'And we should care. We should care when our children are lost to gun violence.' Marquez-Greene, speaking at The First Cathedral's church service in Bloomfield, recalled the moment two years ago when she and her husband were in the Newtown firehouse, where officials were informing parents of the 20 children slain along with six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She and her husband found their son, now a fifth-grader, but not their daughter. 'But in that same firehouse,' she said, 'my husband and I knew Ana was with Jesus and that we would see her again.' After describing her own journey through darkness, Hockley ends her letter on a note as positive as Marquez-Greene's. She writes: . 'I am beginning to feel some of my old optimism returning, because more and more people are engaging around this issue. Our conversation is gaining momentum. I sense a sea change is coming.' 'Your eldest son Jake survived, but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real. He describes it as the day ""when hell came to my school""' writes Hoickley . Via TODAY . To the mom I used to be: . Two years ago, you were happy and whole. You had a plan for life — start a new business, get involved in the school PTA, teach your sons how to ride bicycles and play sports, spend as much time with your friends and parents as possible, watch your children mature, grow old with your husband. You were optimistic — a 'glass half full' person who saw the silver lining in every cloud and often felt so much joy you thought you would burst. You always looked forward — never backwards, no regrets. You smiled and laughed a lot. You danced. You aren't that person anymore. Two years ago, on December 14, 2012, the world changed and you changed with it. A disturbed young man with access to high-powered firearms went to your sons' school and killed six educators and twenty first-graders. Your eldest son Jake survived, but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real. He describes it as the day 'when hell came to my school.' 'Your beautiful baby boy who you thought of as pure love, with his captivating eyes, infectious giggle and warm deep cuddles, was killed. Shot multiple times, dying instantly in the arms of his special education assistant who also died while trying to protect him,' writes Hockley . Your youngest son, your beautiful baby boy who you thought of as pure love, with his captivating eyes, infectious giggle and warm deep cuddles, was killed. Shot multiple times, dying instantly in the arms of his special education assistant who also died while trying to protect him. The tragedy changed every single aspect of your life, not only because of the obvious absence of your child, but because of the constant hole inside you that can never be filled. Your eldest son has been forced to grow up way too fast because of the unfathomable loss of his baby brother. The pain has altered the lines on your husband's face. The way you look at the world has changed. Your interactions with friends and family seem foreign. You've become much harder. No longer brimming with optimism, you are now someone far more realistic and still. And you look back so much more. You view life through the prism of 'before' and 'after.' Jake's fifth grade photos came recently. They are still sitting on a table because you haven't put them in the frame that sits next to Dylan's last school photo. It's too hard for you — too soon. Jake is getting older. But Dylan is frozen in time forever. Even after two years, there's this denial that is still very present inside you. You have Dylan's baby teeth and a lock of his hair on your bedside cabinet, beside the urn holding his ashes. That's all you have of your little boy now. It hurts. It just hurts. You suppress your feelings as much as you can because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. If you started truly crying, you would never be able to stop. It would destroy you. And here's the thing — you didn't have to be that Mom. For all the Moms and Dads reading this now — this doesn't have to be you. Bereaved: Nicole and her husband Ian (center right) are among the parents of 20 children who lost their lives two years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary . Because every gun-related death is a preventable death. These are not random acts. You can't ever say, 'This will never happen to me.' It can happen to anyone, at any point, at any place. You have to care enough and be insightful enough to do something before it's too late. Taking action to protect children from gun violence can take many forms. For some people that means fighting for policy and political change — that can be a long, frustrating road, and certainly not the only option. Small but meaningful actions create change. If you have five minutes, start a dialogue at the dinner table about gun violencewith your kids. If you have two hours, host a conversation with other parents. If you can dedicate one day a month, work with educators on how to better recognize the signs of children who may be troubled and reach out to their parents immediately. But to do nothing? That doesn't honor the dead and doesn't protect the living. One of the most important actions families, schools, employers and communities can do is learn the signs of someone in crisis and then intervene before they hurt themselves or someone else. We need to teach kids better anger management and conflict resolution skills, because much of gun violence stems from anger and fear. Learning other ways to deal with anger and fear rather than striking out at someone is a good first step. We need to recognize the signs on social media— and know the difference between someone who is just angry and someone who poses an imminent threat. Lines of communication always need to remain open between ourselves and our children. I am beginning to feel some of my old optimism returning, because more and more people are engaging around this issue. Our conversation is gaining momentum. I sense a sea change is coming. I know everything we're doing at Sandy Hook Promise will protect more children. We're fighting a good fight. But after every sort of victory, there's also a moment of incredible sadness for me, for whatever happens, I know I still can't bring Dylan back. That hole will never be filled. No matter how many lives get saved in his name, or in the name of others, I can't go back. But you can go forward and make a difference. With love,Nicole Hockley, a.k.a. Dylan's mom .

"It was an incredible Saturday of bad tackles, red cards and dives. Here I cast my eye over a host of controversial incidents and give my verdict on whether the men in black got their decisions right or wrong... Chelsea v Hull City . Chris Foy had a tough afternoon at Stamford Bridge where the attitude and approach of both teams made decisions hard and all the more difficult when so many players surrounded him and pressured him to send opponents off. The FA must look at this and charge Hull with failing to control their players - whatever the provocation or sense of injustice, this cannot be allowed to go without sanction. Foul by Jon Obi Mikel on Sone Aluko in the centre circle which was not given, and Chelsea scored the first after gaining possession. Verdict: WRONG . Chelsea's Jon Obi Mikel (right) should have been penalised for fouling Hull City's Sone Aluko . Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's first goal following Mikel's foul on Aluko, which was not given . Willian dives and is correctly cautioned for simulation. Verdict: RIGHT . Chris Foy (right) booked Chelsea's Willian for diving against Hull at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Willian (left) goes down under a challenge from Curtis Davies, who tried to pull away from it . The Brazilian midfielder goes to ground theatrically at Stamford Bridge, however . Foy did not buy the dive and rightly booked Willian for simulation against Hull . Gary Cahill goes over the top of the ball with an outstretched boot, studs showing and catches Aluko. The Chelsea defender was cautioned but should have been sent off. Verdict: WRONG . Chelsea defender Gary Cahill goes through Hull's Aluko in this challenge that landed him a booking . Hull's  Nikica Jelevic and Tom Huddlestone wanted more serious punishment for the foul by Cahill . Cahill bursts into the penalty area and dives between two Hull defenders, both of whom pull out of challenge. Not booked. Verdict: WRONG . Gary Cahill (obscured, centre) goes down theatrically in the box for Chelsea against Hull City . The Chelsea centre back (left) looks on in shock at Huddlestone (right) tells him to get up . Referee Foy (second right) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for Cahill . Alex Bruce goes into a challenge at pace and while he wins the ball the speed of the tackle makes it dangerous and he is cautioned. Verdict: RIGHT . Alex Bruce (right) was booked by Foy for going into a challenge which had too much pace to it . Tom Huddlestone dangles a leg out to challenge Diego Costa who dives over the leg. Had the Spanish striker continued the run he would have been fouled and possibly injured. While many would disagree I thought it was a foul but Foy cautioned for diving. Verdict: WRONG . Diego Costa (right) was booked for simulation after a challenge on him from Huddlestone . Foy (centre) brandishes a yellow card to Costa, wrongly, after believing he dived during the match . Huddlestone commits a horrible over-the-top tackle leaving Foy with a simple decision to send him off. Verdict: RIGHT . Huddlestone (right) was correctly sent off for an over-the-top challenge against Chelsea . Arsenal v Newcastle United . Lee Mason had a relatively quiet afternoon but still managed a couple of strange decisions. Cheick Tiote went in very high, leading with studs on Alexis Sanchez with a very poor challenge, and should have been sent off. Verdict: WRONG . Cheick Tiote (right) should have been sent off for Newcastle United after a challenge on Alexis Sanchez (left) Danny Welbeck danced through the Newcastle defence and scored a lovely goal but Mason pulled play back and awarded a free kick to the Magpies for a foul by Welbeck on Janmaat. Verdict: WRONG . Arsenal's Danny Welbeck should not have been penalised for pulling back Newcastle's Daryl Janmaat . Paul Dummett certainly fouled Danny Welbeck for the Arsenal penalty. Verdict: RIGHT . Paul Dummett (left) was rightly penalised for pulling down Welbeck in the box on Saturday . Burnley v Southampton . Mark Clattenburg also had two stand-out decisions to make and could not have been in better positions to judge. There was a collision between Burnley’s Michael Keane and Jake Hesketh in the first half. Both players went in committed to the challenge and Clattenburg saw it as 50-50. Verdict: RIGHT . Michael Keane (right) vies for the ball with Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh on Saturday . A far easier call came when George Boyd brought Ryan Betrand down for a penalty for the visitors. Verdict: RIGHT . Burnley's George Boyd (left) leaves his leg in and brings down Southampton's Ryan Bertrand in the box . Bertrand went down under Boyd's challenge and a penalty was rightly awarded to Southampton . West Bromwich Albion v Aston Villa . Again there were two key decisions and, similar to Clattenburg, I thought Mike Dean got both of them spot on. There was talk of a harsh red card at The Hawthorns but I thought this was a very good decision by Dean. Kieran Richardson absolutely flew into the challenge and was completely out of control of his forward motion. He caught the opponent, West Brom’s Stephane Sessegnon, and could have caused a serious injury. Verdict: RIGHT . Kieran Richardson of Aston Villa goes through the back of West Bromwich Albion's Stephane Sessegnon . Richardson (left) was sent off for Villa following the challenge and it was a correct decision by the official . The worst simulation of the day (not that we want to be giving out awards for this!) and again Dean called it correctly as West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli produced a shocking dive and was rightly cautioned. Verdict: RIGHT . West Brom's Sebastien Pocognoli (left) was rightly booked for simulation during the match with Villa . Sunderland v West Ham United . A game of two penalty appeals at the Stadium of Light, which I thought Phil Dowd got wrong - but it might well have been that his assistant erred with the first decision. Adam Johnson drove into the West Ham penalty area and went sprawling over under James Tomkins attention. It was not a foul and only Johnson knows if he deliberately simulated the foul. Irrespective, it was not a penalty. Verdict: WRONG . Adam Johnson of Sunderland goes down under a challenge from West Ham United's James Tomkins . Johnson (left) won a penalty but that decision was incorrect as there was no real contact from Tomkins . In the second half Winston Reid misjudged the flight of the ball and then played it with an outstretched arm. For consistency this season a penalty should have been awarded. Verdict: WRONG . West Ham's Winston Reid (left) should have been penalised for handling the ball in the area . CONCLUSION . Another tough day for the referees in a season where they had a clear objective to avoid controversy. Too many clear errors are undermining their credibility and affecting the outcome of games.","Saturday saw a series of controversial incidents in the Premier League .

"There are many ways for Arsene Wenger to defend his record at Arsenal: two 4-1 wins in a week are a fair start. Specious claims about the Champions League, however, are not. ‘Since I arrived we have played over 180 Champions League games,’ Wenger said. ‘You will see that before then they didn’t play too many.’ Yes, and there is a reason for this. Wenger arrived at Arsenal in 1996. Until season 1997-98 only the champions were allowed to enter UEFA’s main competition — unless the league winners had already qualified as European Cup winners. In 1999-2000 that was expanded to three Premier League qualifiers, and later four. So how many times would Wenger have made it into Europe under the restrictions placed on every previous Arsenal manager? Four. He would have qualified with Arsenal as champions in 1997-98, 2001-02 and 2003-04. In addition, the year Manchester United won the competition, 1998-99, Arsenal would have made it in the following season as runners-up. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger celebrates after winning the FA Cup and Premier League title back in 1998 . Samir Nasri (right) and Nicklas Bendtner celebrate during Arsenal's 2010 victory over Porto - the last time the Gunners advanced from the last 16 stage of the Champions League . Meanwhile, had previous Arsenal managers played by Wenger’s rules over the same time period, they would have qualified on eight occasions. In 1988-89 and 1990-91 as champions, but also in 1979-80, 1980-81, 1986-87, 1989-90, 1991-92 and 1993-94 by finishing in the top four. Wenger also overlooks that the first time Arsenal won the title under George Graham they were not allowed to take their place in the European Cup due to the ban on English clubs. And, no, what went before does not compare to Wenger’s 16 straight Champions League qualifications, but they were different times, and the financial stranglehold of the elite clubs was not in place. Wenger has done wonderful things at Arsenal but he has been aided by an era that has placed Europe’s most prestigious club tournament beyond the reach of all but a few. If his predecessors had been given that advantage they would surely have played more European football; had Wenger worked with their limitations he would boast nowhere near 180 appearances.

"A woman who could face the death penalty for murdering her ex-boyfriend in a jealous rage has asked for the date of her sentencing to be delayed. Jodi Arias admitted killing her former lover Travis Alexander in 2008, who was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head, but said it was in self-defense. Prosecutors said the murder was premeditated, and that Arias killed Alexander because he wanted to end their affair. She was found guilty last year but jurors could not decide whether she deserved the death penalty, so a retrial to determine her punishment was set for next month. Jodi Arias was last year found guilty of brutally murdering her former lover Travis Alexander, but the jury could reach a decision on whether she should face the death penalty . At a hearing on Wednesday at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona, Arias, 34, asked for a delay to give her time to interview an expert witness she plans to call to testify and to review evidence. Speaking softly while seated at a defense table alongside her two lawyers, it was the first time Arias had argued her own motions. Arias was previously granted permission to represent herself, so long as the two court-appointed attorneys stayed on as advisers. But yesterday Arias asked judge Sherry Stephens to postpone the penalty phase of her murder trial, saying she would no longer represent herself if one of the defense lawyers quit the case. Kirk Nurmi, one of the two attorneys representing Arias, filed a motion last week which said that 'a completely fractured relationship between counsel (and client) now exists'. Prosecutor Juan Martinez objected, saying that the case had dragged on long enough. He added that the original ruling allowing Arias to represent herself stated that there would be no delays. 'She agreed to those terms,' Mr Martinez told the judge. Arias, 34, wants the sentencing to be delayed so she can interview an expert witness . The convicted murderer also wants one of her defense lawyers to be removed, which could further delay the sentencing, which is set for September 8 in Phoenix, Arizona . Arias has tried to fire Mr Nurmi several times, and he has sought to get off the case too. Arias told the judge that she would no longer serve as her own attorney and would let her other lawyer, Jennifer Willmott, argue the case if Mr Nurmi was allowed to quit. 'As far as I know, he has not done anything' to assist in the defense lately, Arias told the judge. Arguments were then closed to the media and public, and it was not immediately clear if the judge issued a ruling. The prosecutor and defense attorneys left court without comment. A hearing is set for August 22 on Arias's motion to postpone the retrial. Under Arizona law, Arias's murder conviction stands and prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure the death penalty. If a new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, the judge will then sentence Arias to spend her life behind bars or to be eligible for release after 25 years.","Arias, 34, murdered her ex-lover Travis Alexander in 2008 .

"Steven Smith is to captain Australia in the absence of Michael Clarke after being promoted to the vice-captaincy by Cricket Australia. Smith will lead the side for the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank Test Series against India after Clarke was ruled out with a hamstring injury suffered in the opening Test in Adelaide earlier this week, and his promotion could yet prove to be permanent, with Clarke himself suggesting that this latest in a long list of injury problems leaves his future in the game uncertain. The 25-year-old Smith got the nod ahead of the current vice-captain Brad Haddin, who will serve as his deputy when the second Test begins in Brisbane on Wednesday, and the decision to go with the younger man may reveal the extent of concern over the 33-year-old Clarke's future. Scroll down for video . Current captain Michael Clarke (right) and his replacement Steven Smith (left) share a hug during the first Test . Smith made a brilliant century in the first match of a four-game series, and paid tribute to Phil Hughes . National selector Rod Marsh said in a Cricket Australia release: 'These are difficult circumstances given Michael's injury and the fact that we don't know how long he will be out of the game. 'What we do know is that it won't be an overnight fix so after a lot of thought we have taken the opportunity to appoint an emerging young leader as captain until such time as Michael regains fitness and returns to the side. 'We congratulate Steve on the wonderful honour of leading his country. On Wednesday he will become Australia's 45th Test captain and at the age of 25 will become one of our youngest leaders. He is an exceptional young man who is highly regarded by the National Selection Panel not only for his fine performances with the bat but also his maturity and clear leadership potential.' The 25-year-old all-rounder has been rewarded for his maturity and is seen as a long-term captain . Clarke's latest injury comes after he made a century in Adelaide, and could keep him out for a while . The Australian captain left the field with a hamstring injury to follow on from his back complaint . Clarke is unsure whether he will be able to play Test Cricket again after his latest injury . At 37, Haddin's age counted against him with Cricket Australia keen to take a long view. 'Brad Haddin has done an exceptional job as vice-captain since assuming the role last year and will provide strong support to Steve just as he has done for Michael,' Marsh added. 'There was a strong argument for Brad to assume the captaincy until Michael returns, but given we don't know how long that will be, we felt the time was right to take a longer-term view and give a young player this chance.' Smith shakes hands with Brad Haddin, who was overlooked because of his age and remains vice-captain . Smith, who has captaincy experience with New South Wales and the Sydney Sixers, has emerged as a leading batsman in 23 Test appearances for Australia, having initially made the grade as a leg-spinner who could contribute with the bat. He had unbeaten innings of 162 and 52 in the 48-run victory over India, lifting his Test average to 46.03.","Steven Smith, 25, will lead Australia in Test series against India .

News host Jason Kennedy, 33, shared an adorable Twitter picture with his new wife, airplane accident survivor Lauren Scruggs, 26, Sunday while on a romantic honeymoon . The two were married in an emotional, lavish wedding ceremony. The bride, wearing a gown by New York-based designer Romona Keveža, was walked down the aisle by her father Jeff, almost three years to the day after a plane propeller accident that took her left eye and part of her left arm.

But she told me that he had this amazing Bible study in Los Angeles and had great friends. 'She texted Jason and asked if he was going to be on set. When I was asking Giuliana about places to go hiking, she told me, 'Just ask Jason places to go. He hikes all the time.'' They went hiking with Miss Scruggs' mom and a friend of Mr Kennedy's the next day, and the pair became instant friends. Miss Scruggs' amazing recovery from the tragic plane accident has been a huge inspiration to thousands of people. 'It's kind of weird to say, but I wouldn't trade it,' she told People in November 2012. 'I have seen it as a miracle. I've been through a lot but I'm living. 'Sometimes it's easy to dwell on the fact that I don't look the same. But every day I'm feeling better and better.'","In the first photograph since their lavish wedding Friday, newlyweds Jason Kennedy and Lauren Scruggs are seen smiling and embracing each other while on a romantic honeymoon in Mexico .

"Long depicted as the rootin'-tootin' capital of American gun culture, Texas is one of the few states with an outright ban on the open carry of handguns. That could change in 2015, with the Republican-dominated Legislature and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott expected to push for expanded gun rights. 'If open carry is good enough for Massachusetts, it's good enough for the state of Texas' Abbott said the day after his election last month. In 2015, Texas' Republican-dominated Legislature and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott are expected to push for expanded gun rights including allowing open carry of handguns . And if Texas, which allows concealed handguns, embraces open carry - rolling back a 140-year ban - it would be the largest state to have done so. Open carry drew wide support in the 2014 statewide election, and at least six bills have already been filed for the upcoming session, which starts in January. Abbott has already pledged to sign one into law if sent to his desk. Coni Ross, a 63-year-old rancher in Blanco, carries a handgun in her purse for personal protection and said she'd like the option to carry it openly on her belt if she could. She already does when she's on her ranch and feels comfortable with her gun by her side. 'In one-and-a-half seconds, a man can run 25 feet with a knife in his hands and stab you before you get your gun out,' Ross said. 'If your weapon is concealed you're dead.' Of the states that ban open carry, Texas easily has the most gun-friendly reputation . Most of the country already allows some form of open carry of handguns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a California-based group advocating gun control legislation. But Texas, California, Florida, New York, Illinois and South Carolina, which make up more than a third of the U.S. population and include six of its seven largest population centers, do not. Large urban areas have traditionally had the strictest controls on weapons in public because of concerns over guns in crowds and crime control, said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, author of 'Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.' He said it's 'pretty surprising' that Texas still has an open carry ban that dates to the 1870s. 'We've been regulating guns in the interest of public safety, even in places like Texas, since the founding,' Winkler said. 'The battle over open carry of guns in public remains one of the most heated in the gun debate today.' Of the states that ban open carry, Texas easily has the most gun-friendly reputation. From manufacturers to dealers, Texas has the most federal firearms license holders in the country. It has few restrictions on gun ownership, and Gov. Rick Perry and state lawmakers have actively lobbied gun makers to move to the state. Texas allows the public display of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, and open carry advocates have staged high-profile rallies at the Alamo and state Capitol . Texas allows the public display of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, and open carry advocates have staged high-profile rallies at the Alamo and state Capitol. Concealed handguns are allowed inside the Capitol, where license holders can bypass metal detectors. But Texas still insists handguns be kept out of sight. Texas first banned the carrying of handguns 'when the carpet-bagger government was very anxious about former Confederates and recently freed slaves carrying firearms,' state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said. Overturning a century of law proved difficult, and a concealed weapons law failed several times until it finally passed in 1995 when Patterson, then a state senator, led the charge. Texas now has about 811,000 concealed handgun license holders, nearly equal the population of San Francisco. Even among gun supporters in Texas, the idea of open carry was considered too radical when the concealed carry law passed. Since then, the Legislature has expanded gun rights incrementally. It made the licensing of concealed handguns easier and, during the last three sessions, held heated debates over concealed handguns on college campuses. Open carry backers believe these debates helped rally support to their cause and that an open carry law will pass. Open carry opponents, such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety in America, say carrying guns on the street is less about gun rights than intimidation. Concealed handguns are allowed inside the Capitol, where license holders can bypass metal detectors . 'There is no way to know ... if that person is a threat to moms and our children,' said Claire Elizabeth, who heads the group's Texas chapter. Despite the early momentum, there are no guarantees open carry will pass. Bills to allow concealed handguns on college campus appeared to have widespread support in 2009, 2011 and 2013, but were derailed by objections from universities and law enforcement. Most of the open carry bills already filed for the upcoming session would still require a license. One, by Rep. Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford, would eliminate the licensing requirement for concealed or open carry. 'The idea is we're going to return our Second Amendment rights,' Stickland said. 'I can't imagine what the citizens would do if they had to take a class or pay a fee to use their First Amendment rights.'","Open carry of firearms drew wide support in the 2014 statewide election .

"The contentious moment of the game was Juan Mata not being given offside when he scored the second goal.

At full speed it was impossible to be 100 per cent certain that Van Persie had touched the ball. Juan Mata should have been given offside but it was a tough call for the officials . Robin van Persie got a slight flick on the way through but it was almost impossible to know that at full speed .

Perhaps better communication between the referee, Martin Atkinson, and Mullarkey could have led to the correct outcome.

The American-owned island, which forms part of the Samoan archipelago chain in the Pacific Ocean, only has a population of 700,000, according to a 2013 census. But, according to World Health Organization records, 94 per cent, or 658,000 of them are overweight. The dire statistic is blamed on an unhealthy fast-food culture, influenced by its mainland powerhouse, and a penchant for a sedentary lifestyle. Almost all of the food in American Samoa is imported and therefore expensive, but fast-food chains offer a cheap and convenient alternative. 1. American Samoa - 94 per cent . 2. Kiribati, Central Pacific - 82 per cent . 3. French Polynesia - 74 per cent . 4. Saudi Arabia - 73 per cent . 5. Panama - 67.4 per cent . 6. The U.S. - 66.9 per cent . 7. Germany - 66.5 per cent . 8. Egypt - 66 per cent . 9. Kuwait - 64 per cent . 10. Bosnia and Herzegovina - 63 per cent . 11. New Zealand - 62.7 per cent . 12. Malta - 62.3 per cent . 13. Israel - 61.9 per cent . 14. Croatia - 61.4 per cent . 15. Bahrain - 61 per cent . 16. Macedonia - 60.4 per cent . 17. Barbados  - 60.4 per cent . 18. Seychelles - 60.1 per cent . 19. Canada - 59.1 per cent . 20. Chile - 59.7 per cent . Samoa Air's new 'pay-by-weight' system may be having an effect on its passengers, however, so perhaps this is the way forward for fat countries? The island's obesity epidemic is at crisis point, since its population is now giving birth to overweight babies, starting life with a plethora of health complications. One study found that at just 15 months old, 40 per cent of boys and 30 per cent of girl babies were classed as overweight. Being overweight is associated with a catalogue of awful chronic diseases and health complications, including hypertension and heart disease, diabetes and subsequent renal failure and liver disease. It is also linked the asthma, cancer, depression, stroke and problems associated with digestion. The implications and burdens of such crippling chronic diseases, not just to the individual and their relatives, but also for the the country's healthcare system, are immense. But at last, it appears the island's health push is apparently sinking in. An early morning exercise class at the island's only sports stadium is attracting more members. Olivia Reid-Gillet attends twice a week because she became aware of how serious her weight issues were. Quoted by CBS News, she said: 'I needed to get healthier. I had high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol.' Clinics including dietary advice, wellness programmes, and childhood obesity tracking are also being offered to educate people so they can take more control of their disease. Local doctor, John Tuitele, told the news service: 'The people are being aware of the problem. People are realising the importance of what we're trying to get across.'","WHO figures reveal extent of the obesity crisis in the small Pacific island .

"Amir Khan, having done everything humanly possible to prove he is worthy of that mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather, may be denied the chance forever by the public demand for the Money man to meet the PacMan in the richest boxing match of all time. It could be May or nothing for Khan. But the prospect of riding his brilliant Saturday night victory over Devon Alexander into the opposite corner for Mayweather’s next fight is threatened by Floyd Jnr’s announcement that he is finally ready and willing to meet Manny Pacquiao in the spring. There is one fight left after that on Mayweather’s $300 million dollar contract with the Showtime pay-per-view cable network. VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan: I want to fight Mayweather but I might not get a chance . Amir Khan is aiming high for his next bout after dominating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas . Khan has set his sights on five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr . That is scheduled for September and would be a natural fall back for Khan – except that it would clash with the Muslim fasting for Ramadan, which he strictly observes and which would rule him out on that date. And that will be the last of those half-dozen Showtime fights after which Mayweather, now 38, is threatening to retire. Oscar De La Hoya, Khan’s Golden Boy promoter, concedes: ‘It will be perfectly reasonable if Floyd and Manny get it on. This is not only the fight the world has been waiting to see but one which boxing needs to happen. But Mayweather is instead trying to make a long-awaited fight happen with Manny Pacquiao . Marcos Maidana (right) was the 46th and 47th victim in Mayweather's so far unbeaten career . ‘I still don’t think it will take place but if it does we will need Plan B for Amir.’ The alternatives include a Battle of Britain with Sheffield’s new – albeit stabbing victim – world welterweight champion Kell Brook. Eddie Hearn, Brook’s promoter, was at ringside in Las Vegas on Saturday night talking up that fight as a Wembley Stadium follow up to his spectacular staging there of Carl Froch’s stunning KO of George Groves. Khan would also like to set the record straight in a revenge match with Danny Garcia, who temporarily derailed his career with a knock out. But Mayweather is the dream and after proving so splendidly against Alexander that he deserves that chance Khan will be mortified if it does not become reality.

"Christmas came early for Arsenal as they were rewarded for a return to form with a three-day festive break to revive their minds and bodies. Arsene Wenger told his players to report back on Wednesday after they moved to within two points of the Barclays Premier League’s top four with a 4-1 win against Newcastle. They started by pulling on ironic seasonal knitwear and throwing a party. ‘We will not have Christmas so I’ve given the players some days off,’ said Wenger. Arsenal have been rewarded with a three-day festive break after beating Newcastle 4-1 on Saturday . Arsenal players gather for a photo ahead of their Christmas party on Saturday night . Wojciech Szczesny (left), Theo Walcott (centre) and Aaron Ramsey (right) pose for a photo . Olivier Giroud has six goals in five Premier League appearances against Newcastle. ‘It’s important to have a break. When you count the number of games with the Champions League, the players will not be at home over Christmas so to have two or three days at home is important. ‘Most of them will stay in England because their families are here.’ Arsenal have played 26 times this season — starting with the Community Shield and the Champions League play-off ties against Besiktas — and have been suffering from injuries. Next Sunday’s game at Anfield will be the first of five in 15 days for Wenger’s team — a congested sequence shared by all Premier League clubs — and he wants his players to be mentally and physically fresh. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is the latest injury concern. He hurt his groin near the end of the Newcastle game. ‘He got a knock and I took him off quickly,’ said Wenger. ‘He’s got a pain in his groin. I wanted to take him off and then he takes the ball and crosses the whole pitch and he cannot run anymore. ‘We cannot afford to lose him. I hope it’s nothing bad. He had a bit of inflammation before the game. I took him to Galatasaray and maybe two games was a lot for him.’ Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's performance which leaves them two points off the top four . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is an injury worry after being brought off late on at the Emirates Stadium . Theo Walcott could be back in the squad to face Liverpool but Aaron Ramsey is expected to be out for four weeks with a hamstring injury. The club are quietly confident they can acquire defensive reinforcements in January, which they need with Laurent Koscielny struggling again with his achilles tendons. With Calum Chambers suspended and Nacho Monreal injured, right back Mathieu Debuchy played at centre half in only his second game back after three months out with an ankle injury. ‘I still need to work hard to come back to my best physical level,’ said Debuchy. ‘It was a freak injury. Usually, no-one gets injured like this. Maybe it was post-World Cup tiredness.’ Also back after a broken ankle is Olivier Giroud, who scored twice against Newcastle. He has three in five appearances after three months on the sidelines. Mathieu Debuhy partnered Per Mertesacker at centre back, an unfamiliar position against his former club . Olivier Giroud has lifted spirits at Arsenal after his return from injury, according to Wenger . The Frenchman nets his second of the game against the visitors, a neat flick at the near post . Wenger believes his presence and attitude lifts the team as well as providing goals and a more direct tactical option. ‘It’s not just him as a player, but something as well in his mentality,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘He’s such a positive guy. Even when he misses, people forgive him. He has had a positive mental impact as well as physical impact. Santi Cazorla chips home his second goal on hi 30th birthday on Saturday night . ‘He is like an English centre forward. His first goal was a typical 1970s goal. You love it because you see it less now. ‘He gives us different options because we can go for a longer ball. We have plenty of players who can go short and he gives us a variety in our game. ‘He wasn’t at his best at Stoke and he had something to show against Newcastle and he responded well.’ Santi Cazorla scored twice for the hosts either side of a well-taken effort by Newcastle’s in-form striker Ayoze Perez.","Arsenal have been rewarded with a three-day festive break after victory .

"Tee-d off: A highly critical documentary about Donald Trump's £750m golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland will air on Sunday for the first time . Residents living near Donald Trump’s £750m golf resort in Aberdeenshire have suffered ‘egotistical bullying,’ film-maker Bill Forsyth claims. He compares the living conditions of Trump’s neighbours with living in communist-era Romania as a highly critical documentary on the development called You’ve Been Trumped is set to air on UK television for the first time this Sunday. Forsyth was left ‘dazed and shocked’ after watching the film about proud Scottish homeowners taking on the celebrity tycoon. The film shows residents’ water and electricity being cut off, tonnes of earth being piled up next to their homes and film-maker Anthony Baxter as complaints by locals to police are ignored. Forsyth told The Guardian: ‘We’re watching real lives and livelihoods mercilessly put to hazard by a malign concoction of egotistical bullying, corporate muscle flexing, craven averting of gaze by national politicians and crass misreading of events by local authorities including police.’ The documentary, which is acclaimed by radical American film-maker Michael Moore, makes parallels with his Bafta-winning classic film Local Hero in 1983 which tells the story of an American oil tycoon who wants to buy out a remote Scottish village. Many refer to Local Hero including neighbour Michael Forbes who resisted Trump’s attempts to acquire and demolish his home to expand his golf course. Trump says on the golf course website: ‘I have never seen such an unspoiled and dramatic sea side landscape and the location makes it perfect for our development.’ But Forsyth described the documentary about the development ‘a moving depiction of human survival and dignity amidst murky doings akin to seventies Romania’. The film-maker also described Trump as having ‘very limited utility in a sophisticated fictional drama. That’s not to deny his usefulness elsewhere, say in a comparatively primitive or cheap drama’. On hearing that You’ve Been Trumped . would be broadcast on British television, the tycoon went on a tirade on . Twitter, targeting director Baxter and other ‘morons’ for criticising . the multi-million pound resort.

Scotland so successful you stupid fool!’ Trump . has bought up hundreds of acres on the northeast coast of Scotland and . built Trump International Golf Links which opened in July. The . project, spanning approximately 1235 acres, will also include a second . 18-hole golf course, a 450-room hotel and 1,500 luxury homes in a . residential village. The broadcast comes as first minister . Alex Salmond, once an influential supporter of Trump’s project, was . refused support from Trump. Twitter tirade: Trump criticised the documentary's director Anthony Baxter, writing: 'Take a hint and get out of the film business, loser' about his golf course (pictured arriving in Scotland to view developments at the course in June) It was revealed last week that Trump refused Mr Salmond’s written request to Trump for public support for a controversial decision to release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. On Tuesday Trump’s lawyers threatened Scottish agencies supporting a potential offshore wind farm being built near the site of his golf resort. His executive vice president and counsel, George Sorial, said Baxter’s film was ‘a gross misrepresentation of the facts’ and that the project was widely supported by local residents, businesses and politicians. He said: 'This film only presents the myopic views of a very small fringe element that are not respected and are widely regarded as a national embarrassment for Scotland. 'Mr. Baxter is not a credible source of information and it's widely known that he breached US copyright laws to produce this film, which is nothing more than a feeble attempt to make money by exploiting the Trump name. 'Despite his yearlong efforts to peddle this fraudulent interpretation of the story, Baxter's film has totally failed at the box office while our course in Aberdeenshire has been embraced by the global golf community and the local residents.' Not fact: Trump's executive vice president and counsel, George Sorial, said Baxter's film was 'a gross misrepresentation of the facts' and that the project was widely supported by locals . Trump bankrolled a £10million fighting fund for British anti-windfarm campaigners earlier this year. The move followed proposals for 11 giant turbines off the Aberdeenshire coast, which Mr Trump says will spoil the view from his golfing resort. The billionaire believes the structures, each as high as a 64-storey building, will besmirch the unspoilt landscape surrounding the £750million, 1,200 acre complex. But with the resort being built over a site of special scientific interest, Mr Trump's sudden lust for preserving the environment may open him to accusations of hypocrisy.

"Albania  captain Lorik Cana says he heard cries of 'Kill, kill the Albanians' during the melee that forced the abandonment of their Euro 2016 qualifier with Serbia. Cana and his team-mates were forced to defend themselves before fleeing to the safety of the dressing room in Belgrade on Tuesday after Serbian fans invaded the pitch and attacked visiting players. He told L'Equipe: 'There were racist and hateful chants. There were three of them. The first was: 'Kosovo is part of Serbia.' The second: 'Kill, kill the Albanians.' And the third: 'You are monkeys!' But we ignored that.' The incident was sparked when a drone flying the Albanian flag and showing a map of Kosovo - which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, but is not recognised by its neighbour - flew over the pitch. Captain Lorik Cana (R) rushes to defend his teammates after they were attacked by Serbia fans . The Albanian captain claims he heard three different racist chants against Albania during the brawl .

Albanian players try to take cover as they flee to the tunnel - a chair and a bottle (ringed) were thrown at them . Cana added: 'The people attacked us; a guy even came with a chair and hit one of our players on the head. When I saw that, I had to defend him. What was terrible was that even the stewards started hitting us. I received blows from members of the stadium security. 'If you saw some of the bodies ... They really caught it. What would have happened if instead of a chair, it had been a knife? Our lives were in danger. 'We took the decision to get back to the dressing room as quickly as possible, but we had to get to the players' tunnel, and we saw their supporters get through the security barriers and come towards us. We were hit with stones, batteries ... It was really dangerous and I just tried to gather everyone together.' Cana added that he was kicked in the stomach as the team, who were left with 'six or seven' members of their delegation injured according to the former Sunderland midfielder, eventually got back to the dressing room where they waited for three-and-a-half hours before finally heading for home.

UEFA have already opened an enquiry into the disturbances and have charged both Football Associations for their misconduct. Reflecting on the incidents, the president of European football's governing body, Michel Platini, told TF1 it may have been worse. 'It's not only shameful, just imagine a drone comes onto the pitch like that and there's a bomb rather than a flag?' He said: 'What would we do? It's sad, but we have to be very careful because it's becoming dangerous, especially in those countries over there where there is an enormous amount of political tension.'","Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania descended into a mass brawl after a drone carrying a politically sensitive flag flew over the pitch .

"Santi Cazorla has been a bit hit and miss this season, but he was outstanding against Newcastle United. He scored twice — the perfect present on his 30th birthday — and was at the heart of an Arsenal performance that was a joy to watch. For his first goal he took an excellent touch, rode a challenge and then hit a delightful chip into the corner. It would have been very easy for him to go down in the area, but he stayed on his feet and was rewarded with a goal. Santi Cazorla didn't go down to score the first of his two goals against Newcastle on Saturday . The Spaniard also scored a cheeky 'Paneka' penalty to seal Arsenal's 4-1 victory at the Emirates . Cazorla wheels away to celebrate his goal in a victory that had Gooners singing Arsene Wenger's name . Olivier Giroud (left) is congratulated by Danny Welbeck after also scoring twice against the Magpies . That was good to see on a day where too many players were diving, including West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli, who took a theatrical tumble. PS The diving this weekend was bad but another problem is the high foot. Last week Eliaquim Mangala was booked for an ugly high lunge and Cheick Tiote was lucky not to be sent off for catching Alexis Sanchez on Saturday. It’s a worry because it’s the kind of challenge that can cause serious damage. West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli (left) was one of several players taking theatrical dives at the weekend . Cheick Tiote's (right) high footed challenge on Alexis Sanchez deserved to be shown a red card . SUPER FRANK IS AT IT AGAIN . Frank Lampard must have an invisibility cloak. That’s the only reason I can think of to explain why so many teams still let him make those late runs into the area to score. Lampard has hit plenty of 30-yard screamers in his time, but if you had to describe his winner for Manchester City at Leicester, you’d have to say: ‘Oh, just the usual.’ Frank Lampard steals in to score Manchester City's match winning goal against Leicester on Saturday . Despite scoring as many Premier League goals as Thierry Henry, opponents still struggle to pick up Lampard . Manchester City's win keeps the pressure up on Lampard's former club Chelsea at the top of the table . Arriving late in the box is his trademark, but still teams let him do it. When he is in the final third you have to mark him because if you don’t, he will punish you. Esteban Cambiasso is so experienced but the way he let Lampard in made me wonder if he’d ever seen him play before. At this level, attention to detail is everything and you cannot afford to let a player like him have five yards of space in a crowded area. He even pointed to where he wanted the ball! It’s such an obvious weapon, but Leicester didn’t do enough to try to stop it. PS It seems Man City will have ‘discussions’ with New York City about extending Lampard’s stay. Considering City own the New York club, it won’t exactly be a tricky conversation... City: Frank’s doing well, isn’t he... mind if we keep him a bit longer? NYC: Well, you do actually own us, so in a way he’s your player... City: Of course he is! Pleasure doing business with you! SZCZESNY ON SONG . Wojciech Szczesny has had his critics in the past but he made an excellent save against Papiss Cisse on Saturday night and is impressing me. He came on to our Sky panel show, A League of Their Own, last week and he struck me as a really nice young man. He was game for a laugh, got stuck in and at 24 is mature beyond his years. Wojciech Szczesny celebrates Arsenal's victory, which included an exceptional save against Papiss Cisse . The Arsenal No 1's skills between the sticks are more impressive than his singing voice . The Pole could go on to rival David Seaman (centre) as arguably Arsenal's greatest ever keeper . David Seaman was nearly 27 by the time he arrived at Arsenal and is arguably the club’s greatest goalkeeper. Szczesny has a long way to go to match that, but he has a bright future. The only downside was his singing. He had to do a duet with Chesney Hawkes. It’s a good job his goalkeeping is better than his singing! BURNLEY HIT BACK . Burnley bounced back from defeat at QPR with an excellent result against Southampton. Ashley Barnes puts his hands behind his ears after scoring the winner for Burnley against Southampton . Burnley have picked up almost a point a game on average, which would ultimately see them earn  survival . Ronald Koeman has seen Saints slump after a better than expected start to his Premier League campaign . In the past 10 years, teams have needed an average of around 37 points to stay up — that’s about a point per game. So Burnley will be pleased with 15 points from 16 games, all things considered. For Southampton it was disappointing, but that shows how well they have done under Ronald Koeman. Expectations are perhaps too high because they are doing brilliantly. 1997 - Dusan Tadic was something of a penalty specialist at FC Twente, with 11 scored over two seasons. But the Serb missed the chance to give Southampton the lead from the spot at Burnley on Saturday. The last time Southampton missed a Premier League penalty was way back in April 1997, when Jim Magilton missed against West Ham. 83.3% - Juan Mata has scored five goals from just six efforts on target this season. That puts his conversion rate at an impressive 83.3 per cent. 4th - Santi Cazorla became the fourth Arsenal player to score on his birthday after Yossi Benayoun, Robert Pires  and Paul Merson. 92 - It only took Stoke 92 seconds to equalise at Crystal Palace on Saturday. After James McArthur hit the opener for the home side, Peter Crouch replied just over a minute and a half later for the visitors. 3 - Tom Huddlestone's red card at Stamford Bridge means he has now been sent off in three straight seasons. He previously went seven seasons without a red. 63.3% - Crystal Palace completed just 63.3 per cent of their passes against Stoke. Only 10 times this season have teams completed less than 65 per cent — on five occasions it was Palace. 2 - It was not a good day for Aston Villa’s Kieran Richardson. His red card after 22 minutes was the second fastest this season after James Chester’s against Stoke. Also, his two PL red cards have come against his old clubs — West Brom and Man United.","Santi Cazorla stayed on his feet to score against Newcastle on Saturday .

"A Sydney father has told of his terrifying brush with a terror suspect just moments before he entered a downtown cafe and took dozens of people hostage. Craig Stoker, from Eastlakes in Sydney's south, said he bumped into the gunman on the street just outside the cafe after he bought a coffee from the café on Monday morning, News Limited reports. Mr Stoker described the man as wearing a black shirt with white writing and similar headband, carrying a blue bag and walking with two other similarly dressed men. 'The bag bumped into me and there was something hard in it. I said ""watch where you are f***ing going"",' Mr Stoker said. 'He turned round and said ""do you want me to shoot you too"". I looked into his eyes and they were crazy.' Later, witnesses reported seeing one or two men walk into the café and pull a weapon from a blue bag. Seconds later police were on the scene. Scroll down for video . Rodrigo Neryt said he was arriving at Channel 7 for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the café . Police have begun to evacuate people from the first floor of the building above the Lindt Cafe . Family and friends of a hostage still inside the cafe have told Daily Mail Australia they were in the dark about what was going on. 'We weren't told anything at all and we heard there was a place for family to sit and wait but [officers] didn't know anything about it,' the family friend said. 'But then again how do they [officers] know we are for real [actually family]?' Rodrigo Neryt said he was arriving at Channel 7 for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the café. Rosemary Healion, who works at Frederick Jordan Chambers, told Daily Mail Australia 'a couple hundred' of her colleagues were inside . 'I was at the corner when everything started. I saw people yelling and screaming and two police cars arriving at the scene,' Mr Neryt told Daily Mail Australia. 'I saw what looked like a black ISIS flag and they were holding it up.' The fiancé of one of the café staff being held hostage told The Guardian that their partner had only been working at the chocolate café for six months. 'She's the sweetest person ever who thinks about everyone. She took some of my old shoes and made me wash them and she gave them to a homeless guy. She just cares about everyone,' the fiancé, who preferred to remain anonymous, said. Police were seen evacuating people from the first floor of the building above the Lindt Cafe. Rosemary Healion, who works at Frederick Jordan Chambers, told Daily Mail Australia that 'a couple hundred' of her colleagues were inside at the time. Police have begun to evacuate people from the first floor of the building above the Lindt Cafe . 'My colleagues are still in there. They're trying to get them out now,' Ms Healion told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have been in contact with them.' Ms Healion said her office was on the ground floor of the same building in which the Lindt Cafe is located. She said they had been pushed behind the office's reception area. 'I'm so so worried as you would be. I was about to walk into the cafe. I get coffee there all the time.' Window cleaner, David Wilson, managed to get a birds-eye-view of police swarming into Martin Place as he and a colleague cleaned the windows of a building across from the Lindt Chocolate Café. 'We were looking around and there were cops running around and guns drawn. Some people came out, they looked like just coffee drinkers and that was about all we saw,' Mr Wilson said, adding that his colleague's first response was to get out his phone and start filming.

'We were outside the building on our machine cleaning the windows…we were up quite high.' Gabriella Barry and Lisa Maloney, who work at a nearby barrister company, were evacuated after being locked in their 36 floor building directly opposite the café. They said their building was full of people when the siege began and that at least 20 floors were taken up by government officers and treasuries. 'We've been locked in since 11am. We were told nothing but we could see across the road. We saw all the police and the café. We've had so many phone calls form friends, colleagues and barristers trying to come back to the building,' Ms Barry said. Gabriella Barry and Lisa Maloney, who work at a nearby barrister company, were relieved to be evacuated after being locked in the building directly opposite the café since 11am . Witnesses reported seeing staff and customers sobbing as they were forced to stand with their hands pressed against the windows of the Lindt cafe, in Martin Place . 'We've had phone calls and we've been trying to say it's ok. We were shaking; we were hearing things through the phone and the internet.' When asked if they had heard that the siege was part of a terrorist attack, Ms Maloney added: 'It's shocking. It doesn't happen in this country. No one knows how to react'. John Edwards works across the road from the cafe on the ninth floor of 53 Martin Place. He said every floor of the building had been cleared about 11.15am.

"Albania claim their players were assaulted by fans, stewards and police in Belgrade at the now-infamous Euro 2016 qualifier against Serbia which was abandoned after the violent scenes. UEFA has charged both countries with a number of offences following the game, which saw a melee erupt on the pitch after a mini unmanned drone trailed a pro-Albania flag over the stadium. Serbia have claimed the incident had been a 'scenario of a terrorist action planned in advance', but the Albania FA has hit back saying the team was targeted even before the game when stones were throw at the bus, and its delegation and players were hit by a piece of concrete and other missiles during the warm-up. Albanian players try to take cover as they flee to the tunnel - a chair and a bottle (ringed) were thrown at them . The Albanian team pile into the tunnel to escape the hail of missiles after the match was abandoned . The drone struggled to fly as players and substitutes from both sides get involved in a scuffle . A statement from the Albania FA said: 'For the entire duration of warm-up, the offensive chants of 30,000 strong repeated 'Kill the Albanians' and 'Death to Albanians'.' The melee began after a Serbian player hauled down the flag from the drone and English referee Martin Atkinson took the players off the pitch. Albania then refused to consider returning even if the stadium was cleared of fans. The statement added: 'Making their way to the dressing rooms, in the tunnel, Albania players were repeatedly hit by Serbia supporters, security personnel and the police.'

Albania face forfeiting the match and Serbia playing future games behind closed doors but UEFA is not expected to expel the countries from the competition. UEFA president Michel Platini has described as 'inexcusable' the incidents which followed the drone trailing a flag of Greater Albania banner - which incorporates parts of various other countries including Kosovo - over the the Partizan Stadium pitch. Supporters, some dressed all in black, clashed with police and players on the pitch at the Partizan Stadium . Some spectators tried to storm the police lines as the disorder continued in the stands . Riot police attempt to contain fans in the stands of the Partizan Stadium before the match was abandoned . Neither country had requested they be kept apart in the draw, and nor did the other main criteria which also persuade UEFA to keep them separate - being involved in an armed conflict and not having diplomatic relations - apply. Albanian supporters had been banned from entering the stadium by UEFA on safety grounds and the match was set against a backdrop of tight security. The Serbian FA has claimed their team acted with restraint despite being provoked by the 'offensive' flag and were then attacked when they tried to remove it from the field.","Serbia's qualifier against Albania was abandoned due to violence .

"I reckon they missed a trick at the 2014 Sport Personality of the Year awards on BBC One on Sunday evening. It was clear for a while that this was not going to be Andy Murray's year. But I would have still arranged to have him on camera, stood alongside an empty swimming pool, looking rather sad and forlorn. Something that the lad can really pull off. Every now and then, we'd go over to Andy, who'd be stood there silently and alone. When suddenly Lennox Lewis would stroll into shot, put one of those big, powerful paws on Murray's sagging shoulder and say 'sorry mate, not this year'. For a big slapstick finish, Lennox would then gently push Andy in to the pool like a mighty redwood being sent down the river. There was a time when playing it for a few laughs was very much part of the SPOTY brief. But the hit or miss nature of some of the antics is probably why this approach has now been filed away under 'cheesy'. Lewis Hamilton receives the trophy as the F1 driver is named the 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year . Andy Murray pictured in Miami with the trophy last year after winning the famous award . What the event now leans on heavily is the re-selling of the dramatic sporting moment. Then endeavours to add the human touch through the conversations and speeches. So more the Oscars than It's A Knockout. But in the process, has it perhaps become a little earnest, just too overblown for its own good? You could easily be forgiven for thinking so right from the top as the BIG ROCK of Simple Minds opened proceedings inside Glasgow's monstrous SSE Hydro Arena. A stadium band playing a home game. This was then underlined as the show's three hosts Clare Balding, Gabby Logan and Gary Lineker made a heralded catwalk entrance onto the epically proportioned, sparkling set. I could just imagine Simon Cowell watching from home and thinking 'even I reckon this is a bit over the top'. Although he would probably be quietly impressed by Gary's rasping Rod Stewart impression. By this point, if you were actually still hankering for a few giggles, then your wish was soon to be fulfilled. And probably just as quickly quashed. All the eight-year-olds still up after 9:30 would have been thrilled to see one of their CBeebies heroes Hacker T. Dog disrupting proceedings from the audience. Scottish band Simple Minds kick off the awards ceremony at the SSE Hydro on Sunday night . Presenters Gabby Logan (left), Gary Lineker (centre) and Clare Balding are pictured on stage . But as I say, they are eight! They're allowed to find it funny. The rest of us, I imagine, just squirmed a little on our settees. Indeed, fifteen minutes later, as Gabby Logan introduced the latest contender from alongside the audience, Dickie Bird still looked so shocked, you feared if the wind changed, his face would stay like that. Having said all of this, I will hand it to the puppet for one thing. It did voice the question that I had been asking myself from the start. Where WAS Sue Barker? One thing that hasn't gone AWOL in SPOTY, though, is the top BBC film-making talent which is clearly still given full reign to conjure up those marvellous vignettes (Max Whitlock's ""groundhog day"" short being a prime example) that perfectly remind us of the excellence of the contenders. However, then taking these same athletes out of their sporting comfort zones, sticking them in some posh togs and asking them to chit chat casually in front of 12,000 people and a live telly audience is a big ask. And quite frankly, I found it often to be just be a little awkward to watch. I was uncomfortable for them. Winner Hamilton (centre) speaks to the crowd in Glasgow after being announced as the winner . Indeed, I don't think the sheer scale of the event does the hosts many favours, either. These are three of our top sports broadcasters. Yet it would seem they might have been better off playing summer seasons in Vegas rather than welcoming us to the fields of play, so as to prepare themselves for the demands of delivering the biz they call show. Although I'm not sure ANYTHING could have prepared Gary for the moment when he was upstaged by an upped kilt! Yet there was one man who did look like he belonged up there under the bright lights. As Lewis Hamilton made his first appearance of the night, it came with a close up from the audience by Royal Appointment. So if he's good enough for Prince Harry...? 'How you doing Glasgow?' bigged up Hamilton, like he was on the European leg of his world tour. Before then trying to sell us all tickets to his girlfriend Nicole's gigs. His personality can appear as slick as the tyres he rips up around F1 tracks, but clearly that will to win rubbed off on the viewing audience, who made him their number one choice. That's a viewing audience that was able to see him win his championship live on the BBC, of course! Prince Harry (left) presents the Lifetime Achievement award to former track cyclist Sir Chris Hoy . Mind you, he had his work cut out stealing this particular show from a man from the two wheeled game. Sir Chris Hoy had a genuine and emotional moment while picking up his Lifetime Achievement Award. Lest we forget, though, Lewis is a champ. And with a hug for his brother, Hamilton was back on the stage, and back on pole. This time, however, the visor was up. And now we could see an emotional young man, his voice wavering, thanking his family, being 'proud to carry the Union Jack' and being honoured at 'standing with the greats'. So, in those last few minutes, Sports Personality of the Year delivered what we have come to love about this telly institution. However, whether it wants to continue to present itself rather like the popular music singing contest the aforementioned Simon Cowell was involved in at the same time over on ITV, I think is a question well worth asking.

"BBC Sport will receive a hammer blow on Monday, the morning after their flagship Sports Personality of the Year show, with news they have lost Football League highlights rights to Channel 5. The Football League are due to announce a three-year deal with C5 for all their divisions plus the Capital One Cup, starting next season. C5 won the contract with an estimated offer of £2million a year, which was marginally better than the BBC’s, and a pledge to screen their show at 9pm on Saturday. The BBC will receive a hammer blow with news they have lost Football League highlights rights to Channel 5 . C5 won the bidding with a contract of £2million a year (pictured Patrick Bamford scoring for Middlesbrough) Match of the Day may be limited to FA Cup highlights . This was seen by the Football League as a far better way to promote their product than being put in the graveyard slot after Match of the Day, even if there is more cache in having the Beeb as rights-holders. And certainly Saturday prime-time for the Football League will not bring the derogatory chants of ‘Thursday nights, Channel 5’ that greeted teams dropping out of the Champions League into the C5-screened Europa League. Meanwhile, the nightmare scenario facing the BBC is that the loss of their Football League contract will be followed next February with ITV outbidding them for their prized Premier League highlights. That is the likely outcome, with ITV having money to spend on football after losing the Champions League and the FA Cup, but not enough for live Premier League packages. Gary Lineker and Co would then be left with only the FA Cup and the major tournaments they share with ITV. BBC Sports Personality showed its great pulling power on Sunday night when Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold, one of the 10 athletes short-listed for the top prize, made a three-flight journey from Lake Placid in the USA to be in Glasgow, despite her slim chance of winning. Other awards ceremonies struggle to attract sports stars across London unless they have been guaranteed a gong. Lizzy Yarnold made a three-flight journey from Lake Placid, USA, to make the BBC SPOTY awards . Gary Neville leading the Manchester United counter to City’s £200m state-of-the art training centre, saying academies are about people rather than buildings, isn’t necessarily supported by his brother and Class of 92 team-mate Phil. He sent his son to the City academy before the grand opening, as did Robin van Persie, Darren Fletcher and United ambassador Andy Cole. Bearing in mind how paranoid Sky Sports are about the challenge from BT, and Isleworth staff going off message on social media, Sky Sports News reporter James Cole might find himself in trouble even for tweeting: ‘Happy to hear Dover v Crystal Palace will be televised. Great news for the non-League club.’ BT are broadcasting the match. Phil Neville sent his son to the Man City academy before the grand opening of their £200m training centre . The IAAF blame game . International athletics chiefs have only themselves to blame for the list of 150 competitors with suspicious blood readings from 2006-08 — which includes a famous Briton — continuing to be a major talking point. The document, seen by Sports Agenda, is simply a list of names and was being shown to media attending the IOC Congress by German TV station ARD. So IAAF communications chief Nick Davies, rather than moan about the reporting three days later, should have been briefing journalists in Monaco as to why the list in isolation is a long way from doping evidence. The saga has also deflected attention from the more serious allegations on German TV about a systematic doping regime in Russia. World Cup dates for Qatar 2022 will be discussed at the FIFA ExCo meeting in Morocco this week. November and December, despite Premier League opposition, now looks the only viable option. January-February — suggested by FIFA’s task force — will not happen. IOC president Thomas Bach was adamant at the IOC Congress that FIFA president Sepp Blatter had promised the World Cup would not interfere with the 2022 Winter Olympics. With all the scrutiny on top referees, it seemed odd that Professional Game Match Officials technical director Howard Webb was sent to referee an Under 12 tournament in Ypres as part of the First World War anniversary events rather than keep a close eye on the weekend’s Premier League performances.

"It's a nuisance to some and a golden key to others but the Europa League features four British sides ahead of the draw for the last 32. For the first time this season, winning the tournament offers a Champions League place so there is plenty of incentive for Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Celtic to go all the way and try and win the competition. Here, Sportsmail gives you a guide to their European exploits so far and who they can face in Monday's draw for the last 32 when the competition resumes in February. Liverpool . Group placing: Third (Champions League - unseeded) Last five seasons: . 2013-14: Did not qualify . 2012-13: Last 32 (vs Zenit) 2011-12: Did not qualify . 2010-11: Last 16 (vs Braga) 2009-10: Semi-finals (vs Atletico Madrid) Who can they face? Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Besiktas, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit. Odds to win Europa League: 14/1 . When Liverpool fans dreamed at the start of the season of playing in the knockout stages of Europe, this probably wasn't what they quite had in mind. But in a  disastrous Champions League campaign, the Reds finished behind Real Madrid and Basle in the group and it means they drop into the Europa League last 32 as opposed to moving into the last 16 with the rest of Europe's elite. To make matters worse, their one win, which came on the opening matchday in fortunate circumstances against minnows Ludogorets, means that with just five points they will be one of the unseeded teams heading into the last 32 draw. Basle may have pipped Liverpool by two points thanks to a final day draw at Anfield, but Liverpool's poor record in this year's Champions League compared to other third-placed teams means that despite being joint third-favourites, they will have to win the Europa League the hard way from an unseeded position. Steven Gerrard and Rickie Lambert stand dejected following Basle's opening goal during their final day Champions League game at Anfield. In a must-win game to progress, the Reds could only draw 1-1 . Liverpool's failure to beat Basle in their final Champions League  game resulted in them finishing third place in their group and a diverted European path into the Europa League last 32 as an unseeded team . Tottenham . Group placing: Runners-up (unseeded) Last five seasons: . 2013-14: Last 16 (vs Benfica) 2012-13: Quarter-finals (vs Basle) 2011-12: Group stage . 2010-11: CL quarter-finals (vs Real Madrid) 2009-10: Did not qualify . Who can they face? Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit . Odds to win Europa League:  14/1 . While Tottenham rarely looked like being knocked out at the group stage of the Europa League, performances in Europe this season have often left fans frustrated rather than purring with delight. Aside from a wonder Erik Lamela rabona goal against Asteras, Spurs haven't sparkled. Nervous wins away at the Greek outfit as well as at home to a poor Partizan Belgrade side have done nothing to convince supporters they can go all the way in this competition. With Besiktas offering the only measure of a competent side in their group, Spurs were fortunate to get a point at White Hart Lane, before offering very little in their last day 1-0 defeat in Istanbul which decided top spot in the group. Mauricio Pochettino's habit of mass changes and picking a reserve side has obviously had an effect, but it's hard to see Spurs progressing far in this competition if they don't drastically improve. Despite this, they are still joint third favourites to lift the trophy in Warsaw come May. Etienne Capoue, Benjamin Stambouli and Andros Townsend (right) acknowledge the Tottenham fans following their 1-0 defeat in Besiktas which condemned them to runners-up spot and an unseeded place in the last 32 . Tottenham sealed qualification for the last 32 with a match to spare, but blew the chance to top the group and finish as a seeded team following a last-day 1-0 loss at Besiktas . Everton . Group placing: Winners (Seeded) Last five seasons: . 2013-14: Did not qualify . 2012-13: Did not qualify . 2011-12: Did not qualify . 2010-11: Did not qualify . 2009-10: Last 32 (vs Sporting Lisbon) Who can they face? Villarreal, Torino, Celtic, PSV, Dnipro, Sevilla, Wolfsburg, Young Boys, AaB, Guingamp, Trabzonspor, Anderlecht, Ajax, Roma . Odds to win the Europa League: 16/1 . A good formula to success in Europe is win your home games and draw your away ones, and it's effectively been the foundation for the Toffees impressive continental showings this term. From their first four games, two dominating and convincing Goodison Park victories by three goals over Lille and Wolfsburg firmly established the Merseyside outfit as top dogs in the group, with draws away from home in France and at Krasnodar sandwiched inbetween. But the best was yet to come. A superb win at Wolfsburg on the penultimate matchday confirmed their last 32 spot as group winners, meaning the last day home defeat by Krasnodar meant nothing on a night when Roberto Martinez fielded a very youthful side. At 16/1 it's clear that Everton will be a side to avoid among the seeded outfits  and Toffees fans will be optimistic that their side can progress a long way in this competition. Leon Osman (left) celebrates during Everton's group stage win against Lille at Goodison Park, with the Toffees seeing off challenges from the French side, Wolfsburg and Krasnodar with ease in Group H . Everton's defeat on the final day of the Europa League group stage meant very little as the club had already secured top spot ahead of Wolfsburg on matchday five with a win in Germany . Celtic . Group placing: Runners-up (Unseeded) Last five seasons: . 2013-14: CL group stage . 2012-13: CL last 16 (vs Juventus) 2011-12: Group stage . 2010-11: Play-off round (vs Utrecht) 2009-10: Group stage . Who can they face? Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Besiktas, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Everton, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit . Odds to win the Europa League: 80/1 . After failing to qualify for the Champions League (twice) this season, it was intriguing to see how Celtic would bounce back in the Europe League and just where their status rests among Europe. After all, the Scottish Premiership tends to mask the overall ability of the Bhoys but they are indeed still a threat at European level, having come through their Europa League group relatively unscathed in a runners-up spot. They never got anywhere near group winners Red Bull Salzburg, but were the only side to take a point off the Austrian side after drawing 2-2 away from home on the opening match day. Despite picking up just eight points, progression to the last 32 was booked as early as matchday five. The Scottish champions will now head into the knockout stages as one of the rank outsiders to go all the way in lifting the trophy in Warsaw - but not many sides will fancy a trip to Celtic Park on a European night. Celtic finished comfortably ahead of third placed side Dinamo Zagreb in Group D, with Kris Commons scoring the winning goal when the teams met at Celtic Park on matchday two . Celtic were distant runners-up behind Red Bull Salzburg in Group D but despite picking up just eight points, they secured last 32 qualification with one match to play before losing at Dinamo Zagreb on the final matchday . How the last 32 Europa League draw works . There are two pots ahead of the draw. One will contain the 12 Europa League group winners and four best third-placed Champions League teams (seeded), and they will be drawn against the Europa League runners-up and the remaining third-placed Champions League outfits. No team can play a club from their group or a side from the same association. This rules out Tottenham, Liverpool or Everton drawing each other (or any side they have already played in the group stage) but it does leave Everton open to draw Celtic. Games will be played on 19 and 26 February and the draw will take place from Nyon on Monday at midday GMT. GROUP WINNERS & BEST CL TEAMS . Borussia Monchengladbach . Club Bruges . Besiktas .

"Authorities took Eugene, Ore., man Jeffrey Wright Leonard, 57, into custody Friday on felony chargers of conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation for murder for allegedly trying to have his neighbor killed . The man called the the 'world's worst neighbor'  is in jail after police say they caught him trying to hire someone to kill his neighbor. Authorities took Eugene, Oregon, man Jeffrey Wright Leonard, 57, into custody on Friday and charged him with conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation for murder. Leonard, who was picked up near Autzen Stadium, is now being held at Lane County Jail. The Register-Guard reports that Leonard allegedly asked a 30-year-old jail inmate - that he shared a cell with earlier in the year - to kill his neighbor. Leonard allegedly wanted his former cellmate to crash his vehicle into the neighbor's car on Highway 99. However, the inmate decided to report Leonard to the  jailhouse deputy and said Leonard had given him the neighbor's route to work and asked for the hit to take place on Friday. Leonard even gave a description of the car and license plate. 'We’re convinced this man meant business, and if our source was not going to agree to kill this guy, somebody else would,' Sgt. Scott McKee told The Register-Guard. Leonard faces a minimum prison sentence of more than seven years. The neighbors had long feuded. Vocativ reports Leonard was known for shining flood lights into his neighbor's homes and even flinging dog feces at them. It's unclear how much money Leonard promised the inmate for the murder. The pair met while sharing a cell several months ago after Leonard was booked on charges of violating a restraining order and contempt of court. Those charges were related to an entirely different neighbor Leonard has issues with. Authorities have not specified what charges the inmate was jailed over.a . Leonard has established a pattern of being the neighborhood antagonist. In November 2013 he was slapped with a restraining order by a neighbor for attempting to 'run me off the road while I was driving,' say court documents. Business Insider reports that Leonard told the unidentified neighbor 'that he was going to terrorize me till I moved.' That same neighbor renewed the restraining order twice over the next 11 months after being pelted with dog feces and hit with floodlights. Yet another neighbor filed a stalking protective order against him in March 2014. That neighbor claimed he threw rocks at her home and screamed profanities at her family. 'Being he has reached an unpredictable state, I fear that anything he says could and may happen,' she told the court. 'I now have no idea of what he is capable of.' Yet when brought to court, he claimed to be fighting bone cancer and the victim of neighbors trying to terrorize him during his recovery. Leonard would've wanted the murder committed after the inmate was released but its unclear exactly what that timetable would be. 'We have these cases where people say they want to have someone killed, but do they really mean it and really mean it a month later?' McKee told reporters. '(Leonard) is still as agitated and as serious as he was a month ago.'","Authorities took Eugene, Oregon man Jeffrey Wright Leonard, 57, into custody Friday on felony chargers of conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation for murder .

"Thousands of weeping South Africans wearing red or black football jerseys said farewell to murdered national team goalkeeper and captain Senzo Meyiwa at a packed stadium in the Indian Ocean city of Durban today. The mood was in part sombre, with red-eyed fans sobbing or blowing into tissues as a hearse carrying the 27-year-old's flag-draped coffin drove around the stadium, and at times festive as they blew vuvuzela horns and sang soccer chants. Those in attendance at the service - held at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban - included Meyiwa's widow, politicians, footballers, celebrities and members of the general public who wished to pay their respects to the much-loved player. South Africa has been in mourning for the past week after the popular national team player and captain was shot dead during a botched  robbery at his girlfriend's home last Sunday.

The goalkeeper was adored by his teammates and fans . A picture taken in January 2013 shows South Africa President Jacob Zuma (left) posing with Senzo Meyiwa during his visit to the national team in Soweto . His coffin was today carried into the stadium by his  team-mates and across the pitch by members of the South African Police as the memorial service got underway. 'We've got every reason to be angry about Senzo,' Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula told the mourners. 'Justice is grinding and we will find them. We will never rest until we find all of them.' Kaizer Motaung, the founder of the Kaizer Chiefs, the main rivals to the Orlando Pirates club Meyiwa played for said: 'Lest we forget, this is not the first time that an icon of this nature departs in the fashion that Senzo departed.' Thousands of people braved drizzling rain in the 85,000 seater stadium, a short distance from the Umhlazi township where Meyiwa was born. Most of the crowd wore the Pirates' red or black colours but there was also a sprinkling of the yellow worn by the Chiefs. Team mates and mourners wiped away tears as they watched video clips showing father of three Meyiwa training, diving to make saves, or pumping his arms in celebration of a win.

A group of fans solemnly watch the funeral procession from the stands of Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban . Meyiwa had captained South Africa in their first four African Nations Cup qualifiers over the last two months without conceding a goal. The funeral comes the day after it was announced a suspect has been arrested and charged with murder for his shooting. Police said the suspect, 25-year-old Zenokuhle Mbatha, will be held in custody until his next court appearance on November 11. Police said Mbatha was placed in a lineup and 'positively identified' by witnesses to the killing of Meyiwa, who was shot in the upper body during the attempted house robbery on Sunday night while visiting his girlfriend. The suspect also faces a charge of armed robbery, said Nathi Mncube, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority. Police said they are hunting two more suspects and investigations are at a 'very sensitive stage.' Meyiwa, a goalkeeper for South Africa and club team Orlando Pirates, was fatally shot in the township of Vosloorus near Johannesburg. Meyiwa was gunned down by an intruder at his girlfriend's home in south-east Johannesburg last Sunday . Fans, many of them dressed in costumes and carrying vuvuzelas, sing and chant in the stands of the stadium . A woman breaks down in tears during the funeral proceedings as her friend, holding a portrait of Meyiwa, watches on . A fan holds aloft a displaying Meyiwa's shirt number, while to the right, a copy of the cover of his funeral programme . The death of the popular player and national team captain led to an outpouring of dismay and anger in South Africa, which has a high murder rate. South Africa remains one of the world's most violent countries, although the murder rate been dropping gradually. Police recorded more than 17,000 murders last year, or 31 per 100,000 people - seven times the rate in the United States. An average 50 guns are reported lost and stolen every day from licensed owners, according to lobby group Gun Free South Africa. Authorities said three suspects were involved in the break-in that led to Meyiwa's death. Police launched a manhunt and offered a reward of nearly $23,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 27-year-old Meyiwa's killers. Police said: 'Whilst we are pleased with the progress we are making and the overwhelming support from members of the public, there is still a lot of work to be done to finalize the investigation and ensure that we can link all suspects to the murder.' South African officials on Thursday called for a strict new gun law as a tribute to Meyiwa. The calls were made at a memorial service to honor Meyiwa and two other South African sports figures, who all died in the space of a few days. Former 800-meter world champion runner and Olympic silver medalist Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday, and female boxer Phindile Mwelase died Saturday after being in a coma following a bout. Meyiwa's death also came days after the jailing of paralympian Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder lurking in his luxury Pretoria home in the capital of crime-ridden South Africa.","Tens of thousands of people, including politicians and celebrities, fill stadium for footballer Senzo Meyiwa's funeral .

"The self-styled Iranian sheikh who has taken staff and customers hostage in a Sydney chocolate shop demanded police officers bring him an ISIS flag in a chilling phone call to a local radio station. Man Haron Monis is understood to have forced one of his hostages to call 2GB radio host Ray Hadley and demand the terror group's black banner be brought to the Martin Place cafe, as well as requesting a personal phone call with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Mr Hadley initially refused to speak to him publicly urging him to talk to police instead. A short time later, however, the radio host went off air, apparently to talk to one of the hostages being used as a spokesperson by the gunman. Monis' request for the flag came shortly after one of the hostages inside the cafe was seen with her hands placed on one of the windows and running her thumb across her throat. The hostages may have been directed to make the gesture by Monis. Scroll down for video . Gunman: Self-styled Iranian sheikh Man Haron Monis demanded police officers bring him an ISIS flag in a chilling phone call to a local radio station. Born Manteghi Bourjerdi, the extremist left Iran for Australia in 1996 and adopted various names before settling on Sheik Haron . Already well-known to police, Haron is currently on bail for more than 40 sexual offences relating to his work as a so-called spiritual healer . Man Haron Monis is understood to have forced one of his hostages to call 2GB radio host Ray Hadley and demand the terror group's black banner (pictured) be brought to the Martin Place cafe . Not long after taking the café under siege at about 9.45am, Haron forced crying women to hold a black Islamic flag up to the window with the words 'there is no God but Allah' and 'Mohammed is the messenger of God' written in white writing. That flag is a perfectly innocent and generic Islamic slogan, although it has been incorporated into the banner used by Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. One of the hostage-takers has made contact with officers saying that he has 'devices all over the city' and 'wants to speak with the prime minister live on radio', according to Ray Hadley, from 2GB. One of dozens of hostages in side the Lindt Cafe appeared to run thumb across their throat . Two women were forced to face the window and hold up an Islamic flag at the start of the siege .

Armed police have sealed off streets around the cafe and Martin Place station is shut. Planes have been diverted away from the city centre. Lindt Australia CEO Steve Loane estimates there are up to 50 people being held. Officials have also evacuated the Opera House after reports of a suspicious device. Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the incident as 'deeply concerning'. 'This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,' he said in a statement.

"A doctor suspected his mistress had poisoned him, but was afraid to contact authorities in case she tried to attack him or his girlfriend as he recovered, a court has heard. Dr. George Blumenschein believes his ex-mistress, Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, poisoned him after she found out he was trying to have children with his partner. Gonzalez-Angulo, a breast cancer doctor based at Houston's famed Texas Medical Center, is charged with aggravated assault after prosecutors say she spiked Blumenschein's coffee in 2013 with ethylene glycol, a sweet-tasting chemical found in antifreeze. Scroll down for video . Dr. George Blumenschein (left) suspected his mistress Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, (right) had poisoned him, but was afraid to contact authorities in case she tried to attack him or his girlfriend as he recovered, a court has heard . Yesterday his long-term partner Evette Toney told jurors that Blumenschein feared the other woman might attack him again while he recovered in the hospital. Prosecutors say that Gonzalez-Angulo and Blumenschein, a fellow researcher, were involved in a casual sexual relationship. They say Gonzalez-Angulo's relationship with Blumenschein turned into a 'fatal attraction' after he spurned her in favor of Toney, his 10-year live-in girlfriend, with whom he was trying to have children. His long-term partner Evette Toney (pictured) told jurors that Blumenschein feared the other woman might attack him again while he recovered in the hospital . Witnesses have testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where she and Blumenschein worked. But Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys have argued that other people may be responsible for his poisoning, including Toney. Blumenschein survived the poisoning but told jurors this week he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function. If convicted, Gonzalez-Angulo, 43, could be sentenced to up to life in prison. While questioned by prosecutors, Toney told jurors that she did not poison Blumenschein and that despite the affair she still loves him. She said they are still together and are working on their relationship. Witnesses have testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, (pictured) where she and Blumenschein worked . 'It's a work in progress,' she said. Toney testified that shortly after Blumenschein was hospitalized following his poisoning, he told her that he believed Gonzalez-Angulo had poisoned him. But Toney said he told her to not tell anybody of his suspicions because he feared Gonzalez-Angulo might hurt him again or hurt her. 'At one point, George said, 'Evette, do not poke the dragon,'' Toney said. Toney testified she helped Blumenschein record telephone conversations he had with Gonzalez-Angulo as part of efforts to try and gather evidence against her. Gonzalez-Angulo did not make a confession on the phone calls, but prosecutors have said they show the obsessive feelings she had toward Blumenschein. While Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys questioned Toney, they suggested that Toney had been upset Blumenschein would not marry her. Blumenschein (centre arriving at court) survived the poisoning but told jurors this week he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function . Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys (pictured) suggested Toney got angry with Blumenschein about an affair she had long suspected. Toney said that Blumenschein was afraid of marriage and that she had moved out of their home in 2009 because he wouldn't make a long-term commitment. But Toney said the two got back together and focused on the future, including having children. Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys suggested Toney got angry with Blumenschein about an affair she had long suspected. Toney said she didn't know about the affair until after Blumenschein told her about it following his poisoning and that she wasn't interested in hurting Blumenschein. 'I didn't follow him. I didn't check his BlackBerry. I trusted him,' she said. Testimony was to resume on Wednesday in the trial, which began September 15. Prosecutors might rest their case on Wednesday.

"Ridesharing app Uber has copped a ferocious backlash after outraged Sydney workers found prices had spiked dramatically in the wake of a terrifying hostage crisis in the city's centre. The city has gone into lockdown after an armed gunman entered the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, holding more than a dozen people at gunpoint and forcing some sobbing customers and workers to hold a black Islamic flag in the store's window. But as workers clamoured to leave the city's Central Business District, many Uber users discovered the price of trips from the city's CBD had more than doubled under the company's 'surge pricing' policy - or pricing during periods of high demand. Scroll down for video . Ridesharing app: Uber has become a popular alternative to catching a taxi - much to the ire of taxi associations both in Australia and around the world . Initial response: Uber responded to growing outrage about the cost of its services by saying it was to 'encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers' Hostage terror: More than a dozen staff and customers are thought to be held prisoner inside the Lindt chocolate cafe store in the heart of Sydney's CBD . Heavily armed: Police toting heavy assault rifles have taken to the streets of Sydney as office buildings and even the city's iconic Opera House were evacuated . Uber initially justified the price hike in a tweet. 'We are all concerned with events in CBD,' the company said. 'Fares have increased to encourage more drivers to come online & pick up passengers in the area.' But commuters weren't buying it. 'What a shameful disgrace,' tweeted web developer Tyson Armstrong. 'How low can you go? Marketing fail is one thing, but lack of compassion is another,' wrote Julie Gozali. Mashable reported an Uber trip to Sydney Airport under the 'surge pricing' rule topped an extraordinary $145 this morning for one user, with a 'minimum $100 fare' briefly listed. Daily Mail Australia witnessed a ride being offered from George St, the city's main artery, to the Airport cost $75 this afternoon. A reasonable taxi fare for such a trip would usually cost $45 and $55 and a typical trip with Uber's famously inexpensive app service would cost even less, according to Sydney Airport. Half an hour after their initial tweet - following a social media frenzy - Uber backed down. 'Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely,' the company said in a statement. Heavily armed: Police swarmed Sydney's centre this afternoon . 'Our thoughts are with those affected and the NSW Police Force. 'We are in the process of refunding rides. 'Please note that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.' NSW Premier Mike Baird this afternoon urged Sydney residents to commute home in the usual manner. 'In terms of matters of transport in the city, can I ask everyone to go about in their usual manner - go about your usual exit from the city as you would,' Mr Baird told reporters. The hostage crisis has continued for more than five hours with little sign of abating.","Uber furore on social media after prices spike during Sydney hostage crisis .

"Horrifying: Court documents have revealed that a doctor burst Clayton Lockett's artery during his execution at Oklahoma state prison . A report into the botched execution of Clayton Lockett has revealed new grisly details of the moments leading up to his agonizing death. According to the document, a doctor tried to insert an intravenous line into his groin in a frantic attempt to save him, but hit and burst an artery instead. It caused blood to splatter over the doctor's jacket before the execution was officially stopped. Lockett's heart stopped beating moments later. In the report, Oklahoma state prison warden Anita Trammell is quoted as saying that the procedure was a 'bloody mess'. The damning brief, obtained byThe New York Times, was filed in a court on Friday in a bid to stop four executions in the state at the beginning of next year. It also sheds light on the lack of training those officiating the execution received, including a paramedic who tried a number of times to put a catheter in place. The line into  Lockett was not properly monitored during his April 29 execution meaning the three drugs were administered locally rather than spread throughout his system. This caused him to writhe and groan in agony. It was then that the doctor tried to insert a new line into his groin, but he hit an artery, causing blood to fly everywhere. The medic told investigators, according to the report, that it was 'kind of marginal' because the needle was shorter than those normally used to reach the femoral artery. Scroll Down for Video . Shooting: Lockett (right) was convicted and given the death sentence for shooting 19-year-old Stephanie Neiman (left) in 1999 and burying her alive . Pitfalls: The damning report sheds light on the lack of training those officiating the execution received, including a paramedic who tried a number of times to put a catheter in place. His reaction led to Governor Mary Fallin halting all upcoming lethal injections in the state until the completion of the review. No One Knew: Anita Trammell, Oklahoma State Penitentiary warden, told investigators that executioners knew nothing about the drug midazolam . Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton had previously said the inmate died from a heart attack several minutes after he ordered the execution stopped. No attempts were made to resuscitate him. But the autopsy report performed for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said all three execution drugs were found throughout Lockett's system. A medical examiner declared that the cause of death was 'judicial execution by lethal injection.' The investigation concluded the viability of the IV access point was the single greatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering the execution drugs,' according to the DPS report. The agency's commissioner was appointed by Fallin. Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began. The state used the sedative midazolam for the first time in Lockett's execution. That drug was also used in lengthy attempts to execute an Ohio inmate in January and an Arizona prisoner last month. Each time, witnesses said the inmates appeared to gasp after their executions began and continued to labor for air before being pronounced dead. Lockett, 38, had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999. Lockett slipped in and out of consciousness during the botched execution that even caught President Barack Obama's attention and died shortly after officials called off the execution, realizing that something went wrong. Drugs: A mix of experimental drugs were used in the lengthy three-drug execution including midazolam . The day of Lockett's execution, he was reportedly tased when he resisted officials who tried to escort him from his cell to the execution chamber. Documents obtained by the Times state that Lockett was treated for 'self-inflicted' injuries. The inmate refused food and refused to meet with his attorney hours before his execution. Six months after Lockett's death, his brother Gary filed a lawsuit against the penitentiary for the botched execution saying that, with the use of the new drug midazolam, his brother was 'cast in the unwitting role of human lab rat.' The lawsuit, obtained by KFOR , states that Lockett spoke numerous times during the painful ordeal and tried to rise from the execution table as he said that something was wrong. The Daily News reports that midazolam had been chosen only month's before Lockett's execution. Trammel reportedly told investigators that 'executioners didn't know anything about (midazolam). No one did.' The Times reports that Lockett's grisly execution came after Oklahoma execution secrecy laws drew criticism and the execution prompted discussion about lethal drug reliability and alternatively used drug combinations. Since Lockett's execution, the state's protocols have been rewritten to include more training and supply better equipment to the execution team and the amount of midazolam used during lethal injection has been increased by five times, according to the Daily News.","Document was filed Friday in a bid to have executions in the state stopped .

'He's obviously a great player, with a strong work ethic and has an equally strong passion for the game of basketball,' Jordan continued. 'I've enjoyed watching his game evolve over the years, and I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes next.' ESPN noted that Phil Jackson coached both players leading Jordan to titles in Chicago and Kobe to a dynasty in Los Angeles. In the coach's book, 'Eleven Rings,' he wrote that Bryant was 'hell-bent on surpassing Jordan as the greatest player in the game.' Bryant has said Jackson's claims are overblown.

"Home cooking may not be as healthy as you think. The longer people spend preparing meals, the worse their health becomes, a study found. The result contradicts the popular public health message that it is better to cook from scratch than rely on ready meals. And it suggests that food isn’t healthy just because it is cooked at home. Possible reasons include home chefs being extra generous with unhealthy ingredients such as butter and salt and feeling they have to eat more because of the time and effort that went into preparation. Shock: The longer people spend preparing meals, the worse their health becomes, a study found . Frequenting tasting of food as it is being prepared can lead to pounds creeping on over time. It is also possible, say the researchers, that convenience foods have become healthier. The researchers, from Rush University in Chicago, analysed 14 years of data provided by more than 2,755 women in their 40s, 50s and 60s. This included information on how long they spent cooking and the results of annual health checks for something called metabolic syndrome. This is the medical term for when someone has three out of five risk factor that raise the odds of heart disease and strokes. Warning signs include high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity. The women who spent the longest cooking and clearing up meals were more likely to develop metabolic syndrome, the journal Preventive Medicine reports. Similarly, if a woman started to spend more time cooking, her odds of metabolic syndrome rose more quickly than average. Surprising: The result contradicts the popular public health message that it is better to cook from scratch than rely on ready meals . However, females who did less cooking as time went on cut their odds of health problems. Researcher Dr Brad Appelhans said that we may have to rethink public health policies that make home cooking a ‘cornerstone’ attempts to improve health. He said: ‘In the past three or four decades, the proportion of our food that we prepare at home has decreased, and the prevalence of obesity has increased. ‘Noting this, public health experts frequently promote home cooking as a way to curb the obesity epidemic and reduce risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. ‘However, our research with over 2,700 women that greater time spent preparing food each week is actually linked to increasing odds of having risk factors for heart disease and diabetes over time. ‘While the reasons underlying this association are still unclear, we think these findings indicate the need to revise our public health messaging, including the need to emphasize healthy cooking methods and to consider the potential benefits of healthy convenience meals.’ He added that it is important to cook healthily, not just frequently. Tam Fry (BOTH CORR), of the National Obesity Forum, said that people shouldn’t use the results as an excuse not to cook. He thinks our dislike of throwing away food leads to those who prepare their own eating more than they need to. In contrast, ready meals usually come in set portions.","Said to be down to big portions and the overuse of unhealthy ingredients .

"'Drugged': Yemeni prisoner Samir Naji . A Guantanamo Bay inmate has described how he is still being subjected to horrific treatment at the notorious jail despite being cleared for release four years ago. Samir Naji told how he had been drugged, threatened with rape and forced to watch videos of other detainees being abused at the prison in Cuba which Barack Obama has promised – but so far failed – to close down. The Yemeni has been imprisoned for nearly 13 years after being accused of serving in Osama bin Laden’s security detail. He was cleared for release in 2009 but remains in the US detention facility with 135 other inmates. Mr Naji released a first-person account of his experience inside Guantanamo through his lawyers. He said he was subjected to ‘dirty and sadistic’ abuse by guards who took turns trampling over his back and forced him to watch pornography, which is against his Islamic beliefs. The inmate wrote that his story ‘starts and ends in the silence of a tiny, freezing cold cell, alone’. His account, published by CNN, continued: ‘The cell door opens. The next session, seemingly the 100th in a row. I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months. 'Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night. Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming.’ Mr Naji described how the room he was in had photographs of faces stuck to the walls. ‘They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them. ‘The shouting and the insults get louder, and then they nod to a man in the corner. He injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance. It’s the last thing I know.’ The inmate also described how the guards had entered his cell, ‘making awful honking noises, like wild animals’. He added: ‘I tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me, in protest at all this. Truth: A US Senate report revealed the horrifying scale of torture operations at Guantanamo Bay, pictured . 'The interrogator laughs at me, but then turns angry; he swears loudly, and pours an army meal pack over my head. They tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously. He inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed.’ Mr Naji continued: ‘The cell door opens. This time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back. ‘I tell the interrogators that I can’t face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig. They won’t let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants.’ On another occasion, he said, the guards took him to ‘a sort of cinema room’. He added: ‘I have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused. Inmates were made to stand in stress positions, and some were waterboarded and 'rectally infused' 'Then they tell me that I have to dance for them, and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains. Every time I try and refuse, they touch me in my most private areas.’ Mr Naji said that four years ago, his case had been reviewed by six US security agencies. ‘Their conclusion? That I was innocent of any crime and should be released. ‘America cannot keep hiding from its past, and its present, like this. Our stories, and our continued detention, cannot be made to disappear.’","Samir Naji, from Yemen, has been held at U.S. base in Cuba for 13 years .

"Jennifer Pan was found guilty Saturday of hatching a fake home invasion in order to try and murder her parents in November 2010 . An Ontario woman was found guilty Saturday of hatching a plan to kill her parents and then faking a home invasion that left her mother dead and her father seriously wounded. Jennifer Pan, 28, will spend the next 25 years in prison at minimum after masterminding her mother Bich Ha Pan's murder in November 2010. Found guilty alongside Pan were her boyfriend Daniel Wong and the two thugs she hired to help carry out her diabolical plot--Lenford Crawford and David Mylvaganam. According to the prosecution, Pan was obsessed with Wong and snapped when her parents forbade her from seeing him. The Toronto Sun reports that Pan spent years lying about her relationship with Wong and even lied to her parents about attending a university--to which her father paid tuition--in order to be with him. She was actually living with Wong in a nearby town and when her parents caught wind of the deciet, they ordered her home. That, prosecutors say, is when Pan started to hatch her murder plot. She paid her drug dealer boyfriend's drug contact friends $10,000 to help her carry out the deed, reports the National Post. On November 8, 2010, Pan, Wong, Crawford and Mylvaganam--and, allegedly, a third thug named Eric Carty, who will stand trial at a later date--entered Pan's parent's home. Her mother would later be found dead of a point-blank gun shot wound. Her father was shot in the face and placed in a medically induced coma for days, reports the Toronto Star. Hours earlier, Pan had sat at her parents' kitchen table and laughed with them as they ate dinner. On Saturday, Pan and three others stood in court where they were all deemed guilty of first degree murder. Mandatory sentencing requires they serve at least 25 years in prison before the possibility of parole. All will receive life sentences at a formal hearing scheduled for January 23. Pan enlisted the help of her drug dealer boyfriend Daniel Wong (pictured) for the devious crime, which left her mother dead and her dad seriously injured with a bullet to the face .

"The BBC licence fee could be cut after the Culture Secretary warned that it was a big expense for families and that ‘nothing should be ruled out’ when it is reviewed next year. In the clearest signal yet that the Conservatives are preparing to overhaul the Corporation’s funding and governance if they remain in government after the general election, Sajid Javid said the annual £145.50 payment would be scrutinised. Mr Javid also said the BBC Charter, which sets out its scope and remit and will be renewed for another decade in 2016, must take into account big technological changes in how people watch programmes. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the £145.50 licence fee was a 'large amount' of money for ordinary families . The former Economic Secretary to the . Treasury was speaking to BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday in his first . big interview since being appointed in April. The ex-banker was a surprise replacement for Maria Miller, who stood down amid a scandal about her expenses. Asked about the future of the licence fee, which raises £3.6billion a year for the BBC, he said: ‘That’s a very important issue. 'One . thing we did when we came into government was to freeze the fee at . £145.50. I  still think that’s a large amount for many families up and . down the country. This needs to be looked at when we have the Charter . review process.’ MPs . are considering scrapping the licence fee and replacing it with a . subscription system or a household levy similar to council tax. John . Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture Select Committee, warned . last month that the fee was ‘designed for a different age’ and ‘will not . survive’. Mr Javid . said he would look at the alternatives after the election and when a new . BBC chairman is appointed to replace Lord Patten, who quit last month . after heart surgery. He . said: ‘Since the last Charter review technology has changed. Think of . the number of people who consume  programmes through platforms like . Netflix or iTunes or even the BBC’s own iPlayer. Lord Tony Hall, the BBC's Director General, could face a significantly smaller budget if the Government slashes to licence fee in 2016 . ‘That’s . been a big technological change. When we have the review it needs to . take all this into account... nothing should be ruled out and nothing . should be ruled in.’ The MP for . Bromsgrove, who has taken criticism from some figures in the arts who . say he lacks knowledge of the subject, also said he had always enjoyed the . theatre and the last play he saw was ‘War Horse’ with his daughter. His comments come after John Whittingdale, the chairman of the influential Culture Select Committee warned last month that the licence was ‘designed for a different age’ and ‘will not survive’. Mr Whittingdale told the Mail it would either be dropped at the next renewal of the BBC Charter in 2016, or if no alternative is agreed on, it may be kept for the start of the next ten-year Charter period. Alternatives being considered by his cross-party committee of MPs, which will make recommendations to Mr Javid, are a ‘TV tax’ for every home, perhaps added to council tax or another utility bill; or a subscription service whereby people who want to watch television have to purchase a pay-TV box. He said last month: ‘It’s outmoded and was designed for a different age. We have a situation where if you watch live TV online you have to pay the licence fee and if you watch it on a five minute delay you don’t. Even if someone watches live TV online and doesn’t pay its very difficult to detect. It’s also regressive and there’s no help for people who can’t pay. Changes: On-demand service iPlayer does not require users to have a licence unless shows are watched live . ‘Support for it is weakening by the day. The original settlement was that everybody gets something from the BBC so everybody pays it. But the explosion of choice in terms of channel and different ways to access it.’ Labour’s culture spokesperson Harriet Harman has also conceded alternatives need to be looked at. There is understood to be no appetite among MPs for introducing adverts to fund the BBC. In March MPs backed plans to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence fee – which accounts for one in ten magistrates court cases, from next year. The BBC fears it could lose £200million a year from the change and could be forced to close channels. There is a growing clamour from MPs and the public to reform the BBC Trust, but Mr Javid said this ‘important decision’ would also be left until after a new chairman has been appointed. A BBC spokesman said: ‘He simply said . that the next negotiation will need to consider changing technology, . which is what every negotiation since the first has done. ‘The . licence fee, at 40p per day, remains much more popular than alternative . methods of funding the BBC and we are working hard to offer the public . the best value possible for every penny.’","Minister says £145.50-a-year fee is a 'large amount' of money for families .

"When the people whose houses hug the narrow warren of streets paralleling the busiest urban freeway in America began to see bumper-to-bumper traffic crawling by their homes a year or so ago, they were baffled. When word spread that the explosively popular new smartphone app Waze was sending many of those cars through their neighborhood in a quest to shave five minutes off a daily rush-hour commute, they were angry and ready to fight back. They would outsmart the app, some said, by using it to report phony car crashes and traffic jams on their streets that would keep the shortcut-seekers away. Scroll down for video . Traffic! Paula Hamilton stands on a street outside her house in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. 'The traffic is unbearable now. You can't even walk your dog,' said Hamilton, who lives on a once quiet little street . Paradise interrupted: When the people whose houses hug the narrow warren of streets paralleling the busiest urban freeway in America began to see bumper-to-bumper traffic rushing by their homes a year or so ago they were baffled . Months later, the cars are still there, and the people are still mad. 'The traffic is unbearable now. You can't even walk your dog,' said Paula Hamilton, who lives on a once quiet little street in the Santa Monica Mountains in a neighborhood called Sherman Oaks. Hamilton's winding little road up the low-slung mountains that separate the city's traffic-clogged San Fernando Valley from its equally traffic-clogged west side is now filled each weekday morning with a parade of exhaust-belching, driveway-blocking, bumper-to-bumper cars. So is practically every other nearby street that parallels the busy Interstate 405 freeway. On the other side of the mountain, where cars cruise down roads into tony Brentwood, traffic has also been the hot topic of late, with several people telling each other they will fool the app with their phony accident reports. 'I don't know if you could find anyone who would admit to doing it, but several people have said they will,' longtime resident Joann Killeen said. If they have, they've obviously failed. Killeen said her four-mile commute to UCLA, where she teaches a public relations class, can take two hours during rush hour. 'The streets on the west side are no longer a secret for locals, and people are angry,' she said. That's because the app can't be outsmarted, Waze spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Cut-through? When word spread that the explosively popular new smartphone app Waze was sending many of those cars through their neighborhood in a quest to shave five minutes off a daily rush-hour commute, they were angry and ready to fight back . Accident ahead? Some residents signed up to the app and created 'fake' accidents in the hope that traffic would be sent elsewhere. The tactic failed . 'With millions of users in LA, fake, coordinated traffic reports can't come to fruition because they'll be negated by the next 10 people that drive down the street passively using Waze,' she said. Besides, Mossler added, 'people are inherently good,' meaning most wouldn't really screw with the app, no matter what they might say. Indeed, of all the angry people interviewed for this story, none would admit doing so, although most said they heard someone else had. Many, however, have been complaining to local officials. 'First thing this morning, my field deputy took an earful from a resident up there,' said City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents Hamilton's neighborhood. There are some things that can be done to mitigate the situation, said Los Angeles Department of Transportation spokesman Bruce Gillman, like placing speed bumps and four-way stop signs on streets. Lanes could even be taken out to discourage shortcut seekers, but a neighborhood traffic study would have to be done first. 'Road diet, they call it,' Gillman said. 'It's to make streets so people can walk, people can bike.' But the bigger problem, Gillman said, is that everybody is using smartphone apps these days and they will quickly find every shortcut out there. 'I plead guilty to that,' said Richard Close, who is president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association that represents Hamilton's neighborhood. As soon as he gets over the hill to Killeen's neighborhood, Close said, he uses the app to find the fastest route to his office in Santa Monica. Killeen herself admitted she uses Waze and also Sigalert.com to get around town. Get used to it: Using a smartphone along with GPS, Waze is just one of many apps that is changing the way we live our lives . Which seems to speak to Mossler's contention that the real problem facing LA residents isn't the traffic app. It's the traffic. Los Angeles County has 7.6 million registered vehicles, more than some states. The Interstate 405 Freeway that parallels the unhappy neighborhoods carries 379,000 cars a day. So while a shortcut down a sleepy street might not be a problem in a place like Des Moines or even Detroit, it's a different story in a city that last year was again ranked No. 1 for the nation's most time-consuming traffic jams. 'Los Angeles is a powder keg of cars, construction and population that will only continue to get worse,' Mossler said she wrote to a person from the 405 neighborhood who complained. 'With or without Waze, drivers will be looking for alternatives to major thoroughfares.'","People living in Sherman Oaks in Los Angeles used to enjoy the peace and quiet on their secluded streets .
Drivers keen to save time were directed down their residential roads creating lengthy traffic jams .
Some residents even created 'fake accidents' on the app to try and keep traffic away but it didn't work ."
"Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has condemned the media releasing details from the emails hacked from the accounts of Sony executives in an op-ed for The New York Times . Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has denied accusations that he is 'broke' and having an affair with an author whose book he is using as a source for his next screenplay. The accusations were made by Sony co-chair Amy Pascal and came to light last week as part of a batch of hacked emails released by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace. The author in question is Molly Bloom, the poker hostess who was arrested after hosting games with Hollywood A-listers such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Tobey Maguire. The games, which initially took place in a back room at the infamous Viper Room bar on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, frequently saw huge amounts of money won and lost on games. After an FBI sting put pay to her $4m-a-year job she revealed all the A-list names in her book Molly's Game - now being used by Sorkin for a screenplay. Sorkin, the creator of The West Wing and The Newsroom used an op-ed for The New York Times on Monday to deny the relationship with the author is anything but professional. He wrote: 'The widely published documents that were stolen include an email to Ms. Pascal in which I advocated going to Tom Cruise for the lead role (I did), a second email from one executive to another speculating that I’m broke (I’m fine) and a third that suggested that I might be romantically involved with a woman whose book I’m using as source material for a new script (I wish). He added: 'I know there’s juicy stuff in the emails and I know some of us have been insulted and I know there’s more to come. No one’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny. But this is much bigger than hurt feelings and banged-up egos.' The op-ed piece went on to condemn the media for releasing the details hacked from the accounts of Sony executives and 'doing the bidding of the Guardians of Peace.' He referred to it as 'morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable.' The hacked emails from senior executives at Sony Pictures have so far played havoc with its computer network, revealed confidential information regarding its staff and A-list actors, exposed explosive internal squabbles among senior executives and their emails revealing their true feelings about certain A-list actors. Angelina Jolie has been described as a 'spoiled brat with minimal talent' while Leonardo DiCaprio has been called 'despicable', the emails have revealed. The most damaging hack so far came in the form of email 'banter' between co-chair Amy Pascal and film producer Scott Rudin in which they speculated about the type of films liked by President Obama before reeling off a list of titles that had cast African-Americans and dealt with issues such as slavery. Sorkin was accused of having a romantic relationship with high-level poker hostess Molly Bloom. Her book Molly's Game reveals she arranged games for a number of Hollywood's well-known names . The email exchange took place before Ms. Pascal attended a breakfast for Mr. Obama that was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation. She wrote: 'What should I ask the president at this stupid Jeffrey breakfast?” Ms. Pascal asked Mr. Rudin in an opening query. She then speculated that she might ask if Mr. Obama liked “Django Unchained,” about a former slave. Mr. Rudin countered with a suggestion about “12 Years a Slave,” while Ms. Pascal suggested other films involving African-Americans. Finally, Mr. Rudin wrote: “Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart.” The email referred to a broad comedy, from Universal Pictures, that starred Mr. Hart and Ice Cube. It is still unclear who the Guardians of Peace area and what their motive is for hacking Sony Pictures, although North Korea is widely believed to be the culprit and retaliating against Sony's upcoming film, The Interview, which involves a CIA plot to kill Kim Jong Un, the country's supreme leader. Sorkin, who has also penned the script to the long-planned Steve Jobs biopic, insisted in his op-ed that Sony had not done anything illegal and did not deserve this kind of breach. He wrote: 'I'm not crazy about Americans calling other Americans un-American, so let’s just say that every news outlet that did the bidding of the Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable.' As the emails continued to be leaked, more information regarding a number of celebrities has eben uncovered. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Beyonce Knowle's father Matthew emailed Sony executives in 2013 to suggest a biopic about Destiny's Child. Representatives of Kanye West also contacted staff about a possible feature film about the rapper while the idea of a female Spiderman or an assistant was floated.

'That person who was wielding and welding that knife, had to know exactly what he was doing and he certainly had to be familiar with a knife. OJ wasn't,' Mr Dear said in his documentary. Despite these alleged findings, Jason Simpson's DNA and fingerprints were never compared to those found at the crime scene. He was never interviewed by police, either, the Post reports. No arrests other than Simpson's were made in the murders. OJ Simpson was the prime suspect for the murders because he helped to cover up his son's crimes and, in effect, allowed himself to take the fall, the book claims. 'The LA PD and the district attorney had made a rush to judgement,' Mr Dear said. At the time of the trial, Judge Lance Ito said from his bench: 'Those who say the criminal justice system itself is on trial may be right.'

A young woman revealed that her cousin is one of the hostages still being held in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place . The young woman asked not be identified out of fear for her cousin's safety, knowing that every detail released could jeopardise police operations to release the hostages from their 10-hour-long ordeal. 'My aunt has been crying on the phone to me, as well as my dad frantically panicking during cliffhanger moments on the news,' she said. She said that her cousin was a passionate 25-year-old from Sydney who worked in the fashion industry and is adored by her family, including her mother and sibling who are desperate for her to be returned to them safely. 'I'm so worried for her, I keep thinking what she's going through, if she's being tortured, if she's being hurt - I love her to death, I would hate for her to be hurt. 'We're just all so worried and we just want her home,' she said. The young woman said that when she saw hostages fleeing from the cafe she 'had a spark of hope that it was her,' and was crushed when she realised her cousin was still inside.

"Relationships between mothers and stepmothers have often been marked with jealousy, bitterness, and resentment. But one San Antonio mom decided to break the status quo by choosing to 'love and respect' the stepmother of her 14-year-old daughter. In a post that quickly went viral on her blog, 'Women With Worth,' Candice Curry, 39, wrote 'An Open Letter to My Daughter’s Stepmom.' The post isn't what one would expect from a divorcee, harsh words and criticisms toward the woman who 'stole her man.' Instead the mother-of-five wrote of her love and thankfulness for 29-year-old Ashley Parish, her ex-husband's wife. Blog: Candace Curry, 39, (photographed) wrote a heartfelt blog post, that quickly went viral, praising and thanking her daughter's stepmother . Young: Photographed are Curry (right), Stiles, and Curry's ex-husband (left) when Stiles was younger . In the post, Curry admits that before meeting Parish she hoped the woman would be a mean, 'old hag' who her daughter Stiles would want nothing to do with. She planned to resent her child's stepmother, as many bitter divorcees have done in the past. 'My plans were foiled,' Curry wrote.'You’ve accepted my daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy, that’s a true gift to all of us. 'You’ve included my daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted. You put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace.' Ex: Photographed is Ashley Parish, 29, (right) and Stiles (left) at Parish's wedding to Curry's ex-husband . Text: Curry shared that she and Parish send text messages to each other, reminding the other of the love and respect they share . Parish has been co-parenting the teen with Curry for seven years, two as stepmother, New York Daily News reports. Curry shared that she and Parish send text messages to each other, reminding the other of the love and respect they share. Curry wrote that she never planned for Parish to be a part of her life and had a negative view of her being a part of her daughter's life. Before she met Parish, Curry thought she would be a 'terrible beast' who was 'semi unattractive' and she prayed that Stiles wouldn't look up to the woman who was with her ex-husband. Curry wrote: 'When I first met you I’ll admit you weren’t what I had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body. You were supposed to be hideous, remember? But you weren’t, you were stunningly beautiful. You were supposed to be a mean old hag, remember? But you weren’t, you were a young, sweet woman.' She expressed that she is thankful to have Parish by her side, guiding her daughter, and is grateful that the two women are able to rise above their circumstances. Filling In: Curry thanked Parish for respecting her position as the teen's biological mother and wrote that she views Parish as her daughter's mother . Co-Parenting: Parish (right) has been co-parenting the teen (left) with Curry for seven years, two as stepmother . Curry went on to thank Parish for respecting her position as Stiles biological mother and wrote that she doesn't view Parish as a 'fill in' for her, but she sees the woman as the mother of her child. 'I promise to always respect your input for our daughter,' Curry wrote. 'I promise to never lessen the position you hold in her life or make you feel like you are not her mother. I promise to raise her to be grateful to have two strong and brave women in her life that have the courage to mother her together. Even though our situation is peaceful I pray that she is never in it, but if she ever finds herself here I promise to set an example for her of what co-parenting should look like. The Nov. 30 blog post has since been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook and has been syndicated on many sites, according to Yahoo Parenting. Curry told the Daily News that her daughter was at her father's home when the 'letter' was posted and Parish cried when she read it. Both Parish and the teen decided to leave a comment on Curry's post: 'Candice, I don't know what to say. I am not good with words like you are and the way you express yourself. All I can say is I am crying like at the end of The Notebook ...you make me feel so special … Thank you for this letter. It made my day and I will keep it close to my heart always. Love you.' To My Daughter’s Stepmom . I never wanted you here. You simply were never part of the plan. Growing up and dreaming of my family I never included you. I didn’t want help from another woman to raise my child. The plan was for my family to include me, daddy and our children, not you. I doubt you ever wanted me in your life. I doubt you planned to mother a child that you didn’t give birth to. I can bet that your plan for your family included you, daddy and your children together, not me or my daughter. I can almost bet that when you dreamed of becoming a mother it would be the day you gave birth and not the day you married your husband. I’m pretty sure you never planned on me being here. But God has plans that far exceed our own and when my little family dissolved to form two families I knew you would be coming. In my mind you would be a terrible beast and my daughter would not want you to mother her at all, ever! I was hoping that you would be semi unattractive and prayed my daughter wouldn’t look up to you. Her daddy would know that he was settling for second best. Evil swirled in me because I never wanted to face the fact that another woman would mother my child in my absence. Then you arrived. When I first met you I’ll admit you weren’t what I had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body. You were supposed to be hideous, remember? But you weren’t, you were stunningly beautiful. You were supposed to be a mean old hag, remember? But you weren’t, you were a young, sweet woman. My plans were foiled. I realized by the look on your face that meeting me was just as hard as it was for me to meet you. My heart immediately softened. Dang your kind smile! I was planing on really hating you. Why are your ruining my plan?! I wanted to resent you but you made it impossible and I quickly grew thankful for you. You’ve accepted our daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy, that’s a true gift to all of us. You’ve included our daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted. You put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace. I knew when her daddy and I decided to divorce and live in separate homes there would be times when she would need me, her mommy, and I wouldn’t be there. I’m so thankful that you are there in my absence. I’m grateful that you have mercy on her teen years and never reject her. She needs a mommy at your house and you’ve done an amazing job being that for her. You’ve respected my position as mom from the very start. I appreciate that you always check with me when you question if you are making the right decision with her. I know our situation is rare. It’s not often that a mom and stepmom text each other to remind each other that they love and respect each other. You are a gift. Because of you and your courage to mother our daughter the way that you do, she will be a better woman. She will grow up with more love than I could have ever imagined. It wasn’t her choice to have divorced parents and even though I wouldn’t wish that on any child I am so thankful that she now has 4 parents who love and respect her and each other. She’s compassionate because of it and understands that a failure in one area can turn into a blessing in another. I don’t see you as a fill in for when I’m not there. You are her mother when she’s with you and when she’s with me. She’s excited to call you and tell you her stories when she’s at my house and that makes my heart want to jump from my chest with joy. I fill with pride when you wrap your arms around me and squeeze for a genuine and loving hug each time we see each other. I am extremely aware of what it looks like when a mother cannot emotionally accept her childs stepmother in their life. Gratefulness pours heavily from me that we are able to rise above anything like that and do what is truly right for ourdaughter. Thank you for being mature enough and respectful enough to co-parent with me. I promise to always respect your input for our daughter. I promise to never lessen the position you hold in her life or make you feel like you are not her mother. I promise to raise her to be grateful to have two strong and brave women in her life that have the courage to mother her together. Even though our situation is peaceful I pray that she is never in it, but if she ever finds herself here I promise to set an example for her of what co-parenting should look like. Precious woman, you are a rare and beautiful gem. God bless you and I love you.","Candace Curry, 39, wrote a heartfelt blog post, that quickly went viral, praising and thanking her daughter's stepmother .

"American Hustle director David O. Russell was called a 'loon' for 'feeling up' his transgender niece's breasts, in new emails leaked by Sony hackers. Russell, according to the message, 'got in trouble' for the act, which a gossipy executive discussed alongside an anecdote of him bringing actress and director Sally Field to a party and making her cry. Beleaguered co-chairman Amy Pascal was sent the message by Columbia Pictures executive Michael De Luca discussing the incident involving 19-year-old Nicole Peloquin, according to the New York Post's Page Six. 'Got in trouble': The emails dealt with American Hustle director David O. Russell . 'Felt up': Russell's niece Nicole Peloquin was on the wrong end of the director's wandering hands . It said: 'David’s a loon, talented, but geez once I saw him bring Sally Field to a party and reduce her to tears. Plus remember when he got in trouble for feeling up his transgender nieces [sic] boobs?' The incident, which went public in 2012, did not result in criminal charges after Florida sheriffs investigated. Nicole Peloquin, who was born a boy, filed a police report after Russell groped both of her breasts while the two were working out at a hotel gym in Broward County on December 30, 2011, TMZ reports. Peloquin, who was just 19 at the time and is not blood-related to Russell, said the encounter made her feel uncomfortable. Russell - who has always denied wrongdoing - claimed that the incident was consensual and happened after Peloquin, who was undergoing the transition from male to female at the time, complained that her breasts were different sizes. He also blamed her for calling police: 'Russell stated she is always causing drama since the transgender transformation and has become very provocative and seductive,' according to a police report. However, a family friend told TMZ that Peloquin called the cops because she felt 'violated by someone who was very close to her' and wanted him to be 'held accountable.' The emails, extracted from Sony Pictures in an enormous security breach last month, have been leaked in batches by hacking group Guardians of Peace. The latest round of correspondence was published Saturday night in what the hackers called a 'Christmas gift'. They wrote: 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift. The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. Exposed: The new round of leaks promised to be more damaging than those before. Pictured is Sony Corporation CEO Kazuo Hirai . Disclosures: Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures, was revealed to have insulted President Obama and referred to Angelina Jolie (right) as a 'brat' 'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.' The latest rounds of revelations also included details of an embryonic Destiny's Child movie, a Kanye West biopic starring the musician himself, and a Spider-Man film featuring a female lead. According to technology site Re/code, the new information will also deal with a 2006 acquisition of a video site called Grouper, later renamed Crackle. Sony has been battered by the disclosures. Earlier dumps featured racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children. Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job. Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Pressure: Emails showed Seth Rogen, left, was pressured to change scenes showing the death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (right) George Clooney has also been sucked in to the growing Sony email hack maelstrom after emails emerged showing he was  mortified by the failure of 2014 film The Monuments Men, which he co-wrote. In an email to Ms Pascal, Clooney begged for 'protection from all the reviews' as critics began to widely pan the Second World War drama. 'Let's just make it a hit. I haven't slept in 30 hours. And it's 7 am,' he told the Sony co-chairman. 'I fear I've let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I've just lost touch,' he wrote, according to the Independent. 'Who knew? Sorry. I won't do it again.' Pascal reassured Clooney, saying: 'We will protect you by making money… that's the best revenge.' Despite the WWII film, which is based on a true story, only receiving a 31 per cent rating on movie review site Rotten Tomatoes, it still had worldwide gross takings of $154,984,035. The film, which had a $70million budget, is said to have made $78million in the U.S. and $76million overseas. Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene. Some have claimed that the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime. In other leaks, a hilarious email apparently from Channing Tatum showing the actor's enthusiastic reaction to the box office earnings of his comedy sequel, 22 Jump Street, has been revealed. Box-office winner: 22 Jump Street had the second-highest opening weekend at the box office for an R-rated movie, behind only The Hangover Part II . 'F YOU TED !!!! SECOND OF ALLLL TIMMMMME BEEEOTCH!!!! COME ON JUMPSTREETERS WE GOT CATE BLANCHETT WIT DIS BOX OFFICE B****ES!!!!!!!!' read the beginning of the e-mail. The mention of Cate Blanchett in the e-mail was a reference to a joke in 22 Jump Street, where Tatum's character, Greg Jenko, didn't have 'Cate Blanchett with the budget'. After few seconds of confusion, Jonah Hill's character, Schmidt, quietly corrected Jenko, saying he meant 'carte blanche'. Meanwhile, Channing's 'F YOU TED' referenced the Mark Wahlberg movie, released in 2012, which was knocked down a spot in the opening-weekend rankings by 22 Jump Street. With $57.1 million earned, 22 Jump Street landed behind only 2011's The Hangover Part II in opening weekend box offices for adult-themed comedies. In a separate revelation, it was also revealed that Beyonce's father approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child. Another repercussion of the hack has been the alleged collapse of Sony's financial systems. According to reports on Friday, the company is now unable to process transactions, which has led to external companies canceling film shoots. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin condemned the releases, saying news outlets who published details taken from hacked emails as 'morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable'. He also denied accusations stemming from an email sent by Ms Pascal claiming that he was 'broke' and having an affair with a woman whose book he was hoping to use as a source for his next screenplay. The hack attack against Sony Entertainment is airing the film studio's dirty laundry in public - revealing. Revelations from tens of thousands of emails - many of them from Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal - have rocked Hollywood for nearly two weeks.","David O.

Mortified: George Clooney has been revealed in Sony's hacked emails to have been mortified by the critical failure of his 2014 WWII drama The Monuments Men . Clooney's co-stars in  The Monuments Men include Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman. It's based on the true story of a WWII 'tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves' according to IMDB. Despite the abundance of star fire power, the film scores an uninspiring 31 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. And Clooney appears to have shouldered the blame. 'I fear I've let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I've just lost touch,' he wrote, according to the Independent. 'Who knew? Sorry. I won't do it again.' Pascal, who's featured heavily in this email hack, reassured Clooney, saying: . 'We will protect you by making money… that's the best revenge.' Wrote to the top: Clooney's emails to Sony's Amy Pascal reveal the star's embarrassment that The Monuments Men, a film he co-wrote and starred in, was a critical failure . With a budget of $70 million and a domestic take of $78,031,620, according to Box Office Mojo, Pascal's reassurance--at least stateside--did not come to fruition. However, taken with overseas earnings of $76,952,415 for a worldwide gross of $154,984,035, the film's performance could have been far worse given the tepid reviews. The revelation is just the latest among the spectacular leaks that are causing continuing embarrassment for Sony. Highly sensitive material is being leaked almost daily, including an exchange between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman, Amy Pascal. Rudin called Angelina Jolie a 'spoiled brat' and made racially offensive jokes about President Barack Obama's presumed taste in movies. Rudin and Pascal have apologized.

The French will buy an estimated six million self-help books written by 700 different authors this year, and are said to be adopting a fondness for Pharrell Williams, singer of the hit single Happy.

Mother-of-three Mrs Lewicki, who now lives in Los Angeles, California, is campaigning against pessimism in France - and is pushing for her fellow nationals to say ‘thank you’ instead of moaning. Economist Jacques Attali has written Become Yourself, urging the French to ‘take control over your own lives’ – and using artist Damien Hirst and chef Jamie Oliver as positive role models. Another economist, Claudia Senik, said the French had been found to be 20 per cent less happy than their counterparts in other European countries.

She told The Times: ‘The French are in a spiral of self-fulfilling pessimism. They have a very high social ideal, which is unreal and unrealistic, and in fact this makes them unhappy.’ Last month, President Francois Hollande’s popularity hit a new low - with his 12 per cent approval rating the worst score for a French president in modern-day polling. Mr Hollande failed to meet his goal of reversing the rise in unemployment by the end of 2013, and many commentators say he has no hope of being re-elected as president again in 2017.

"A frenzied mob set fire to Union Flags outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday in an ugly protest over the Falkland Islands. More than 100 Argentinian militants marched on the building while urging their government to sever diplomatic links with London. They bellowed insults about David Cameron and held up banners declaring: ‘England out of the Falklands’ and ‘Break ties now’. Tensions heat up: Argentine activists burn a Union flag during a demonstration in front of the British embassy in Buenos Aires today in protest against comments made by British Prime Minister David Cameron .

Ugly protest: Left-wing activists are furious at remarks made by Mr Cameron accusing Argentina of being colonialist in their demands for sovereignty over the Falklands . The mob took to the streets after the . Prime Minister accused Argentina of being ‘colonialist’ for repeatedly . demanding sovereignty over the South Atlantic territory. His remarks to Parliament last . Wednesday provoked a furious response and escalated tensions ahead of . the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War on April 2. Riot police were mobilised to protect . the embassy and ensure the march, led by nationalist group Proyecto Sur . and left-wing political party MST, passed off peacefully. The 1982 conflict over the islands, . when an invading Argentinian army was thrown out by a British task . force, claimed the lives of 255 British troops and 649 Argentines. On the march: Other banners said: 'British out of the Malvinas (Falkland Islands)' as they called on President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to cut diplomatic ties with the UK . Call for action: A protester holds a sign that reads in Spanish 'Government break the relationship now', referring to Argentina's diplomatic relationship with Britain . On guard: Police officers stand in front of the British Embassy during the rally over the disputed Falklands Islands . Tensions have risen again after the discovery of oil in the seas around the islands, which lie about 300 miles off Argentina. Mr Cameron used his appearance at . Prime Minister’s Questions this week to reassert that Britain would . never hand over the Falklands – a dependency since the 1830s – against . the wishes of the local 3,000 population. He also revealed the Armed Forces had drawn up contingency plans for combating a threat to the archipelago. Stinging retort: Argentine Vice-President Amado Boudou (left) said Mr Cameron's comments were clumsy and historically inaccurate . But his remarks infuriated . politicians in Buenos Aires. Amado Boudou, acting leader while President . Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recovers from surgery, said Mr Cameron . was ignorant and told him to re-read his history books.

Foreign Secretary William Hague . risked inflaming tensions in Latin America by revealing Prince Harry . will make an official visit to Brazil next month.

Eurofighter Typhoons, while the surrounding seas are patrolled by the . frigate Montrose, the offshore patrol vessel Clyde and survey ship . Protector. Frictions between the two countries intensified in 2010 when . British firms discovered oil offshore in the North Falklands Basin. Last month tensions erupted after the Mercosur trade bloc – Argentina, . Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil – agreed to block ships that flew the . ‘illegal’ Falklands flag. The dispute overshadowed the first official . visit by Mr Hague to Brazil. He conceded Britain and Latin America . disagreed but said: ‘We believe in the self-determination of the people . of the Falklands.’ Last night former military top brass raised serious concerns about . whether Britain would be able to defend the Falklands amid sweeping cuts . to the Armed Forces.

"She was the beautiful German air hostess who won the heart of an American circus tycoon and married him just five weeks later. Now some of the vintage clothes worn by Hannelore Nagel, the widow of Billy Smart Jr., are to go on sale in London in aid of the Alzheimer Society. A treasure trove of 70's and 80's pieces, the collection includes crimson silk jumpsuits, Pretty Woman style skirt suits with oversized shoulders and several thigh-scraping Thierry Mugler dresses. Glamorous: Hannelore Nagel, whose wardrobe goes on sale next month, had her dress dyed to match her car . But gorgeous though the clothes are, Nagel's own rags-to-riches tale is arguably the more eye-catching. At the beginning of 1973, Nagel, now 69, was an air hostess working for Pan Am on the London to Los Angeles route. But a chance meeting with circus impresario and notorious lothario Billy Smart Jr. would change her life forever - just five weeks after meeting, the besotted pair were married. The lavish wedding, held on a beach in the Mexican resort of Acapulco, was held in front of guests that included footballer George Best and catapulted Nagel into the world of the international jetset. Her new husband Billy Smart was the tenth and youngest child of the legendary founder of the world famous Billy Smart Circus. Quirky: A much-loved Victorio & Lucchino dress worn by Hannelore (left) and a bold polka dot number (right) Rags to riches: Hannelore Nagel was a Pan Am air hostess when she met future husband, Billy Smart Jr . But despite his success, dry businessman he was not and during the 1960's, he set about wooing some of the era's biggest stars, with Jayne Mansfield, Shirley Bassey and Diana Dors among his conquests. That all ended when he met Nagel, who, with her striking looks, fun-loving personality and fabulous figure, would remain at his side until his death in 2005. With her new husband, the once air hostess travelled the world, mingling with everyone from film stars to royalty and building a reputation for her glamorous style. Now the wardrobe she built up during that time is go under the hammer, with a feast of dramatic dresses, 80's power suits and glamorous Chanel ski gear - including the ski helmet itself - all set to be auctioned off. Changing fashions: Hannelore embraced power dressing in the 80's (left) and was a fan of a Chanel ski suit . Colourful: Brights were a favourite and she had this magenta dress (far right) dyed to match her Rolls Royce . Ticking off nearly every 70's, 80's and 90's trend imaginable, highlights include classic figure hugging pieces by Alaia, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler. Other eye-catching pieces include the fruits of her  experiments with Westwood and Commes des Garcons and a 1983 Mugler dress dyed to match the magenta paintwork of her favourite Rolls Royce Corniche. More still are by Chanel, Schiaparelli and Lacroix, and come in a rainbow of bright hues, with turquoise, crimson and pink clearly among Nagel's favourites. Nagel might be selling off her wardrobe but as her extensive collection makes plain, she's without doubt still a fashion fan at heart.","Hannelore Nagel, now 69, was an air hostess before marrying a tycoon .

"Workers in France are flocking to Marks & Spencer to enjoy classic British dishes - with chicken tikka masala now the biggest-selling ready meal in Paris. The nation, which is fiercely proud of its culinary heritage, appears to be ditching more traditional French food in favour of treats such as Stilton, crumpets and curry which are sold across the British company's French stores. At the flagship store in Beaugrenelle - which features the largest food hall outside of the UK and Ireland - chicken tikka masala flies off the shelves, according to the company's head of international food. Scroll down for video . French workers are flocking to Marks & Spencer to enjoy classic British dishes instead of their native cuisine . And Jill Bruce told the Guardian is has now become the top-selling ready meal in its store across the entire capital. The Champs Elysees store also sells more chicken tikka masala than any branch in the UK and also prides itself on shifting the fifth highest number of BLT sandwiches. The surge in popularity of British food means Marks & Spencer, which saw sales in Europe up 3.9 per cent this year, now has ten food-selling stores in Paris. Five of these are standalone stores, including the one at Beaugrenelle, which features the largest food hall outside of the UK and Ireland. The company's chicken tikka masala has now become the top-selling ready meal across all its stores in Paris . And a new franchise partnership with French company Relay France will also see ten more food stores open around Paris. In total, there is expected to be another 20 stories in the capital alone over the next three years. The planned expansion would make Paris M&S’s largest food market outside of the UK. Steve Rowe, M&S Executive Director of Food, said: 'M&S Food is in much demand globally. Pret A Manger is also experiencing a popularity surge in the French capital, along with several other British brands . 'From toasted crumpets in The Hague to red wine in China, our international customers are very quick to tell us what their favourite M&S products are. 'This is why expanding our fresh food offer presents us with a strong growth opportunity.'

"Actor Andrew Garfield may be booted from the Spider-Man movie series, according to the latest revelation from hacked emails at Sony . Actor Andrew Garfield may be booted from the Spider-Man movie series, according to the latest revelation from hacked emails at Sony. The correspondence reveals that Sony - which was reportedly already not happy with Garfield - might give up the franchise to comic book giant Marvel. It is believed that Marvel would prefer to start the series from scratch, putting Garfield's role as Peter Parker, which he has played in two movies, in jeopardy. The 30-year-old has played the role of the superhero in the 2012 and 2014 releases of the series, alongside Emma Stone as love interest Gwen Stacy. If Marvel does take over the production of The Amazing Spider-Man, as suggested in the emails revealed by hackers Guardians of Peace, then it is possible both stars could face the axe. Garfield angered bosses at Sony when he pulled out of a dinner with top company executives at the last minute, Mashable reported. Sony CEO Kaz Hirai was due to mention the fact he was at the dinner in July to impress senior board members, who are said to have been offended by his absence. Poor box office figures and tame reviews of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are also said to affected Sony's decision to consider giving up the franchise to Marvel. According to Latino Review, if the takeover goes ahead then the new films will take a different turn, focusing on Peter's difficult childhood dealing with his powers, as well as romance side-story instead of being just an action film. There have also been suggestions that the next Spider-Man film will feature a female lead, but it is understood that Marvel does not support this idea. Plans for an Aunt May spin-off are also said to have been shelved. The Spider-Man emails are just the latest in a series of Sony correspondence revealed by hackers. Other new developments include an email from Columbia Pictures executive Michael De Luca to Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal, suggesting that American Hustle director David O. Russell was caught 'feeling up' his transgender niece's breasts. If Marvel does take over the production of The Amazing Spider-Man, as suggested in the emails revealed by hackers Guardians of Peace, then it is possible both Garfield and Emma Stone could face the axe . The email said: 'David’s a loon, talented, but geez once I saw him bring Sally Field to a party and reduce her to tears. Plus remember when he got in trouble for feeling up his transgender nieces [sic] boobs?' The incident, which went public in 2012, did not result in criminal charges after Florida sheriffs investigated. Earlier hacks featured racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children. Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job. Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene, with some suggesting the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime. Disclosures: Amy Pascal (left), chairman of Sony Pictures, was revealed to have insulted President Obama and referred to Angelina Jolie (right) as a 'brat' Pressure: Emails showed Seth Rogen (left) was pressured to change scenes showing the death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (right) George Clooney has also been sucked in to the affair after emails emerged showing he was  mortified by the failure of 2014 film The Monuments Men, which he co-wrote. In an email to Ms Pascal, Clooney begged for 'protection from all the reviews' as critics began to widely pan the Second World War drama. 'Let's just make it a hit. I haven't slept in 30 hours. And it's 7 am,' he said. Emails from Channing Tatum and the father of Beyonce have also been leaked, with posts online suggesting the hackers are set to reveal even more internal correspondence before Christmas. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin condemned the releases, saying news outlets who published details taken from hacked emails as 'morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable'. He also denied accusations stemming from an email sent by Ms Pascal claiming that he was 'broke' and having an affair with a woman whose book he was hoping to use as a source for his next screenplay.","Andrew Garfield may lose his role as Spider-Man, according to Sony leaks .

"Do you see yourself as a bit rock 'n' roll-style mum while you strut your stuff with your toddlers in tow? Or has having kids made you pile the pressure on yourself? Perhaps you're one of those 'always looks amazing in the playground' mothers - and you don't even know it? Well, it's time to find out. Take this quiz from new mothering bible by Jenny Scott, How To Be A Hip Mama Without Losing Your Cool, and whichever section gives you the most 'yes' answers will determine your maternal style.

Take the  quiz below to discover what kind of maternal style tribe you belong to . SECTION A . The definitive quiz comes from Jenny Scott's book about retaining your style after motherhood . SECTION B . SECTION C . SECTION D . MOSTLY SECTION A = YEP, YOU'RE PLAYGROUND MUM . This is the kind of mum you can normally smell before you see her as she stalks past you in a fog of Chanel, all tousled blonde mane, pouty lip gloss and a perfect glow. She is the mum that everyone assumes has an army of helpers, her 4x4 always looks immaculate and it is pretty much guaranteed she wears matching underwear. The school gates are an opportunity to 'touch base', 'incentivise' and 'go forward' together. All the mums want an invitation from Playground Mum, not just to have a nose around her obviously interior-designed home, but also because you've heard rumours you'll have a warm glass of pinot grigio pushed into one hand and a DIY Botox needle in the other.

Smug in the knowledge her healthy lifestyle sets a good example to her kids, she just wishes everyone else would realise that looking and feeling great really isn't hard - even if it does mean a Spinning class in a swimming pool while meditating. Eco mums like Gwyneth Paltrow look good and still  incorporate their planet saving ways into parenthood . MOSTLY SECTION C = YOU'RE ROCK 'N' ROLL MUM . She's the kind of mum that doesn't just have your average partner - her partner is the drummer in that hot new band and she has a little black book of friends that include the whole back catalogue of the Nineties' musical heroes. This mum is never seen in anything that isn't leopard print and is never without a slick of red lippy. She certainly isn't interested in sport or getting fit. Her favourite kind of night in involves sitting with a bottle of beer surrounded by vinyl talking about the good old days when Courtney and Kurt had just met. This mum rarely has time to stand around talking at the school gates – being rock 'n' roll cool is a full-time occupation. The rock 'n' roll mum exudes effortless cool and never leaves the house without her trusted red lippy . MOSTLY SECTION D = YOU'RE A MOTHERS MEETING MUM .

Jenny Scott is the founder of Mothers Meeting and has now launched an inspirational book on motherhood . When a woman embarks on the whole new world of motherhood, it can be an overwhelming time. Some may seem to take to it like a duck to water - but you can be sure they're paddling like crazy beneath those deceptively serene waters. Other women openly throw their hands in the air in 'this is just too hard' exasperation (and exhaustion). But what most have in common is the underlying fear that their lives will disappear into a fug of daytime TV and mindless web surfing while feeding and changing nappies. One of those mums was Jenny Scott, 32, who lives in London. Jenny was already a successful graphic designer and after the birth of her first son, she found herself searching for support groups to meet women intent on embracing motherhood while sharing similar interests and hobbies. In the end she decided to create her own and Mothers Meeting was born. Jenny says: 'When I had my son at 28, everything changed. I thought I was prepared but in reality I had no idea of the challenges of motherhood. 'I decided to search out a new social group to meet mums with same interests and who were embracing motherhood as a new exciting chapter in their lives. 'But the more I looked the more I realised there was nothing out there for mamas like me. There was nothing out there that spoke to mothers like women, not just 'mums'. 'I'm so happy I went with my gut instinct as my business has grown from something that started out from organising an exhibition visit with a couple of other mums, to organising huge festivals, partnering with Nike. 'Our events are aimed at empowering women, whether it's a workshop to learn the importance of body language at something such as a job interview or a hypnotherapy session to teach yourself how to be more confident. 'We even have a book club, a running club and lots of regional events.' Jenny says How To Be a Hip Mama Without Losing Your Cool is about 'celebrating real women doing the hardest job in the world' and brings together the network of amazing women Jenny's met along the way. Each woman shares her honest advice on embracing motherhood while keeping her own identity. Plus there's no shying away from the challenging subjects of breast feeding, maternity leave and the baby blues.","Quiz created by Jenny Scott, founder of mums' network, Mothers Meeting .

"Pauline Cafferkey has been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery having spent three weeks battling the disease in an isolation unit . A British nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone used classical music and The Archers to help speed her recovery, it has emerged. Pauline Cafferkey says the iPad she was given in hospital was a 'lifeline' while she recovered from the potentially deadly disease, as she used it to keep her morale up. On the ward she listened to Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt and the popular Radio 4 soap - and restored her energies with Irn Bru and Sugar Puffs. Ms Cafferkey was fighting for her life for more than three weeks in the Royal Free  Hospital in London after testing positive for the deadly virus upon her return to her native Glasgow. The 39-year-old health worker had been volunteering in an Ebola treatment centre in Kerry Town when she became exposed to the disease which has claimed more than 8,000 lives. After undergoing experimental treatment using blood cells from another nurse to have recovered from the virus, Ms Cafferkey was released from hospital yesterday. She credited staff at the hospital's high level isolation unit for her life, adding that 'lots' of Irn Bru had also 'helped her through'. 'I am just happy to be alive. I still don't feel 100 per cent, I feel quite weak, but I'm looking forward to going home,' the health worker said on her departure. 'I want to say a big thank you to the staff who treated me - they were amazing. They were always very reassuring and I knew I was in the best hands. They saved my life.' Ms Cafferkey has spoken of her relief at being able to listen to music thanks to the gift of a tablet computer - one of the few bright spots as she struggled with the illness. 'I was given an iPad by the Royal Free Charity and that was like a lifeline for me - I don't know what I would have done without it,' she told Scotland on Sunday. 'My concentration was pretty poor as I recovered, so I was just using it for short periods. It let me listen to music and that was the main thing. 'I listened to a lot of happy music and the pharmacists put together a playlist for me. I don't remember exactly what was on it but it helped.' She said she knew she was on the road to recovery when she regained enough strength to pick up her iPad and use it herself for the first time . 'The past week or so I've started to get into a daily routine which has helped me settle down and helped me stop getting frustrated,' Ms Cafferkey added. 'I had a favourite piece of classical music, which is Peer Gynt by Edvard Grieg, that I'd do my stretches to, then I'd get my blood tested while listening to The Archers, then I would go to sleep for an hour.' The 39-year-old contracted the disease while volunteering at a Save the Children treatment centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone . Asked whether there was a point at which she thought she might not make it, she said: ‘There was a point which I remember clearly saying, I don’t remember which doctors were with me, but I do remember saying ‘that’s it, I’ve had enough’.’ Recalling the progress of her illness, she said: ‘The first few days I was very strong and felt absolutely fine. Then day three or four I did start to get symptoms and things, and then I started deteriorating. ‘I pretty much lost a week of my life that I just can’t remember. I remember having a discussion with my sister, because we had to speak via telephone because I was in a tent, and I was saying ""oh that’s me been here a week now"" and she was saying ""no you’ve been here two weeks"", and I was saying ""no, it’s a week I’ve been here"", and then just realising I’ve lost a week of my life at some point.’ Asked how the experience has changed her perspective on life, she said: ‘Many people would say ""I’m going to go out there and live life now"" but I was doing a pretty job at that before all this.’ Though she has no immediate plans to return to Sierra Leone, Ms Cafferkey said she wouldn't rule out returning to the poverty and disease-stricken country in the future. 'I’ll be having a break from aid work and I’ve no plans to return to it at the moment, but who knows in the future?’ The nurse is pictured with Dr Michael Jacobs, who led the team treating her for Ebola . She continued: ‘Thanks to Dr Mike and his amazing team of doctors, the matron, the nurses and all the other people that I didn’t meet working behind the scenes to keep things going. ‘I’m definitely going to keep in touch, I’ve got a strong bond with the place and I’ll be sad to leave but I want to go home.’ Dr Michael Jacobs who led the team overseeing her recovery said he was 'very proud' of the staff's handling of her case. 'We are delighted that Pauline has recovered and is now well enough to go home. I am very proud of the staff who have been caring for her. 'It is because of the skill and hard work of the entire team that she is now able to go home.' Save The Children has launched an investigation came to be infected Ms Cafferkey but admits they may never know how the virus entered her system. Its chief executive Justin Forsyth today said: ‘We are delighted for Pauline Cafferkey and her family that she has fully recovered from Ebola. Pauline is a dedicated humanitarian who worked tirelessly and selflessly in the fight against Ebola. ‘Despite the risks to her own safety, she volunteered to use her nursing skills to help save lives and treat those in dire need in Sierra Leone. The bravery of Pauline and everyone who has worked to defeat Ebola makes us even more determined to redouble our efforts to beat the disease.’ Meanwhile  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘I am delighted to hear that Pauline Cafferkey has now been discharged from hospital. 'Ebola is a terrible disease, and the fact that she has made this recovery is a tremendous tribute to the work of the NHS staff who have been committed to her care over the last few weeks. ' Ms Cafferkey spent more than three weeks in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London (above) The Royal Free is designated as Britain's main centre for treating victims of the Ebola virus . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt added: ‘I am delighted that Pauline Cafferkey has been discharged from hospital and can now return home. Her selflessness and courage are remarkable and she represents the very best of NHS values. ‘I would like to thank all the staff at the Royal Free who have worked tirelessly to provide her with world class care and treatment.’ Following Ms Cafferkey's diagnosis in December critics slammed procedures at Heathrow Airport where the nurse was allowed to board a flight to Glasgow despite complaining of a temperature. Within hours of landing, Ms Cafferkey was rushed to Gartnavel Hospital before being transferred to the Royal Free in a military aircraft. Following her diagnosis authorities frantically tried to hunt down the dozens of people she may have come into contact with at the airport and on board flights from Sierra Leone to Casablanca and London to Glasgow. Anyone on board the aircraft was urged to seek medical treatment as soon as possible, with an estimated 32 people having already left the UK by the time Ms Cafferkey's condition became known. After being admitted to the Royal Free Hospital on December 30, concern grew for the nurse's life as doctors revealed her condition had deteriorated. The lack of wonder drug ZMapp which aided the recovery of several others to have been infected, was among factors making her chance of recovery ever more slight. While in hospital she was treated with convalescent plasma taken from the blood of recovered European patients and the experimental anti-viral drug ZMabb, which is not the same as ZMapp, which was used to treat William Pooley - a British nurse who recovered from the disease in August. Mr Pooley was the first British person to test positive for the disease in Africa. He was hurriedly removed from Sierra Leone following his diagnosis in August and recovered in time to deliver a heart wrenching speech released on Christmas Day. The 29-year-old, who has since returned to the disease-stricken country to help treat sufferers, described Ebola as 'a global problem' which 'will take the world to fix'. Anyone who returns from working in Ebola-hit regions like Sierra Leone are handed or sent self-monitoring kits to be used for 21-days after they return to the UK. They contain items to help them test their temperature and help them cope if they were to have the killer disease before the authorities arrive. Controversially Public Health England did not have enough of these kits at Heathrow for the 30-strong group including Pauline Cafferkey that arrived in the UK on Sunday night. As a result the authorities had to courier some to their homes. The kit is split into two parts, the first to monitor their health and the second to be used if they fall ill. They have an electronic ear thermometer to measure temperature accurately because a high fever can be a sign of Ebola. They also have recording sheets to note them down. Some of the highest risk patients are asked to call in each day before midday to tell Government staff whether they are unwell. If they are showing symptoms they have a number of items to help clear up fluid like vomit and diarrhoea, then disinfect and dispose of the hazardous waste. These include bags for hazardous waste, super strength disinfectant, disposable gloves and super-absorbent gel to soak up liquid.  This is because bodily fluids are one of the key ways Ebola can be spread. If they are ill they must immediately call a doctor and they will be taken into hospital and put into isolation while they are tested for Ebola.","Pauline Cafferkey was discharged from the Royal Free London Hospital .

"A lone gunman who shot two people at a UPS warehouse in Birmingham, Alabama, this morning, had been fired from the company just one day earlier, it has been revealed. Police say the shooting occurred at the mail giant's facility in Inglenook, an industrial area near Birmingham airport, about 9.30am, and that both of the male victims were supervisors. According to WIAT.com,the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office have identified the shooter as 45-year-old Joe Tesney. The married man, who has two young daughters, was wearing his UPS uniform at the time of the attack, police said. He then turned the gun on himself. Scroll down for video . Responsible: Local media in Alabama are reporting that 45-year-old Joe Tesney (pictured) - a married father-of-two - is the UPS employee behind the shooting deaths of two co-workers in Birmingham on Tuesday. He then killed himself. Tesney is pictured here in a photo from his LinkedIn profile, which lists him as a truck driver for UPS . Shooting rampage: Police stormed a UPS warehouse in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday after a gunman shot dead two workers before killing himself . The UPS warehouse was closed off after a UPS employee opened fire Tuesday morning inside one of the facility in Alabama, killing two people before taking his own life . Tesney had reportedly been served his final papers on Monday and was not expected to return to work, police said. Tensey shot dead two of his managers. The killer was a member of the North Park Baptist Church along with his wife and two children according to pastor Bill Wilks. Wilks described Tesney as being 'troubled' over his work and financial situation. 'I think it's been an ongoing situation. In his own spirit he's been troubled, and he's asked for prayer about that.' Tesney . and his wife, Melissa, are listed as distributors for Advocare, a . multi-level marketing company that sells health and fitness products. They have a website advertising the business that says: 'Just tell us . your needs, your dreams your desires ... and we'll make it happen!' Police said Tesney had gotten that final notice in the mail. Court . records showed a Birmingham business sued Tesney and UPS in 2010 . claiming he had wrongly picked up a $4,000 radiator for shipment either . intentionally or by mistake. The lawsuit went on for years before a . judge ruled in favor of Tesney and the shipping company exactly one year . ago - Sept. 23, 2013. However, it was not immediately clear why Tesney had been fired or whether that lawsuit may have played a role. The . UPS warehouse, a light brown building sitting on a hill with company . logos on the front and side, is used to sort packages and send them out . on trucks. About 80 drivers had already left on their routes, and a . small number remained when the shooter drove up in a private vehicle .

Roper told AL.com. 'We have a pretty good idea about what transpired inside the business. 'We want to make sure we get a good picture of what led up to today and what we can do in the future to prevent it.' According to AL.com, Tesney's family are in shock over what has transpired. 'He was one of the best men I have ever known,' his mother-in-law, Wanda Binney, told the website. 'He was a kind husband and a wonderful father. 'He never hurt anyone in his life.' Tesney was reportedly fired a month ago and tried to appeal the decision. However he lost. Court documents obtained by AL.com show he was the subject on a 2012 lawsuit, with a business claiming Tesney removed a $4000 radiator while picking up a package. The radiator was never returned, however a judge found in favor of Tesney and UPS in September last year. No other people were injured. Police did not fire any shots.

"A Washington cold case of a missing boy has been all but solved, police announced Tuesday, now that a man already in prison for stabbing to death his wife, has confessed to killing his toddler son in 1983. Stanley Guidroz told police from a Louisiana prison that he 'just lost it' on his fussing son Wallace all those years ago. He says he smacked the 3-year-old to the ground, where he hit his head and died. Guidroz confessed he then buried the toddler in a shallow waterside grave in Tacoma before calling police to say the boy had gone missing. Cold case solved: Stanley Guidroz says he got away with the murder of his 3-year-old son Wallace for 31 years. The 57-year-old was charged with the 1983 slaying on Tuesday after Guidroz finally confessed . Shallow grave: Here, Tacoma Police detective Brian Vold starts a second hole during the search for the remains of Wallace Guidroz   in Washington in 2011 after Guidroz drove his Mustang, along with the body of the wife he stabbed, to a Louisiana police station and confessed. The confession suggested to police that Guidroz may have also killed his son who went missing in 1983, but his confession wouldn't come for 3 years . It was a family the father and son had met while fishing that January day, Guildroz told police, who he believed kidnapped the boy. Police never found a family matching the description Guildroz gave, and he remained a suspect himself, but a body was never found and Guildroz would quietly slip out of Washington by the following year. His shadow would never again darken the Evergreen State and nearly 30 years would pass before police got a break in the heartbreaking case. Fast-forward to 2011, and a glimmer of that break would finally come as Detective Gene Miller of the Tacoma Police Department's Cold Case Unit reviewed the case. Miller chose to reopen the case when he found inconsistencies in Guidroz's statements to police, according to a Pierce County Prosecutor's Office release. Miller tracked Guidroz to Louisiana, where he was in prison for manslaughter after stabbing to death his wife--not Wallace's mother--and driving around with her body in the car until confessing in a nearby police station. 'Child killer': Police reopened Wallace's case after Guidroz stabbed to death his wife Pepettra (left) then drove around with her body in the back of his '99 Mustang for hours before confessing at a Louisiana police station. He eventually confessed that he killed Wallace, but covered up that crime for fear of being labeled a 'child killer' in prison . 31-year-old cold case: It was eventually Guidroz's confession from a Louisiana prison, where he's serving time for murdering his wife--who was not Wallace's mother--and not a discovery of a body that led authorities to finally charge Guidroz. Wallace's remains were never found . The 2011 murder of Pepettra Guidroz is likely what spurred Washington police to reopen Wallace's ice cold case. Miller would hear several more versions of Guidroz's story before hearing the jarring truth, according to WWL. Guidroz said he simply 'lost it' while feeding his fussy son in a high chair and a backhanded slap was all it took to leave Wallace lifeless on the floor. So why didn't Guidroz's guilt get the best of him then, as it did when he'd later kill his wife? He told police he was more afraid of being labeled in prison as a 'child killer.' Soon, though, he'll likely be labeled that in spite of himself. 'This is another success for the Cold Case Unit,' said Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. 'Justice matters, no matter how long it takes.' A warrant has been issued for his  return to Washington state, where he'll answer to a manslaughter charge in the first degree for taking the life of his own son. Truth emerging: Back in 1983, Guidroz told police that a family he'd met while fishing with Wallace here at Point Defiance Park were likely the missing boys kidnappers. In fact, Guidroz now says he'd killed the boy and buried him here in a shallow grave . Dreamed up: Pictured are sketches of the likely fictional family that Guidroz told police in 1983 had likely kidnapped Wallace during their father-son fishing trip .","Now aged 57, Stanley Guidroz, initially told Washington State investigators little Wallace went missing during a father-son fishing trip .

"Ally McCoist's time as Rangers manager appears to be up after the club told the Stock Exchange he had resigned. Three days after reports first surfaced that McCoist had offered his resignation, a statement on Monday morning confirmed he had tendered it. A 12-month notice period has now been triggered, with the club saying they will now hold talks with their record scorer. Rangers have confirmed that Ally McCoist has resigned from the club . In the meantime, the 52-year-old's wage, according to the statement, is increased to £750,000 per year. The statement read: 'The company announces that Alastair McCoist, manager of the first team squad, has resigned. His service contract dated December 28, 2010, which was subsequently amended, has a 12-month notice period ('Notice Period'). 'The directors will hold discussions with Mr McCoist to seek an amicable solution in the best interests of the company, and expect to be in a position to make a further announcement before the end of the week. During the notice period, Mr McCoist's salary will increase significantly to GBP750,000 per annum.' McCoist led Rangers in their defeat at Queen of the South on Friday night immediately after the initial reports surfaced, but refused to talk about his future in the wake of it. The Rangers mnager watched his side lose to Queen of the South on Friday night . 'I have absolutely no comment on rumours,' he said. 'I can't have any bearing on speculation. I will deal with cold, hard facts. I think you know me well enough that I will give you an opinion on that. But I can't comment on speculation.' But when he was asked if he believed he would still be the Light Blues boss next season, McCoist - who was famously quoted saying he 'did not do walking away' - said: 'Absolutely. I'm the Rangers manager and that will hopefully be the case for the foreseeable future. 'I told the (players before the match) I was the Rangers manager and I would continue to be the Rangers manager.' Rangers fans have stood by their manager in the past, and they will not be diverted by this sideshow . Sources have claimed that McCoist's resignation offer - which could cost the club up to £1.4million in severance payments - was knocked back by the Light Blues' cash-strapped board. Reports in recent weeks have also claimed football board chairman Sandy Easdale and his brother James, a PLC director, have been behind attempts to axe the manager. Both were at Palmerston to watch McCoist's side lose for the third time in the Scottish Championship this season. McCoist (with Ian Durrant) was a popular striker during his time at the club . The club reported £8.3million losses last month and need to raise a similar amount before the end of the financial year if they are to stay afloat. Billionaire Newcastle owner Mike Ashley - who holds a nine per cent stake in the Ibrox club - could yet have the final say on whether McCoist keeps his job. McCoist took over at Rangers in 2011 and has been at the helm throughout their financial meltdown and subsequent attempts to return to the top - a bid which has stalled this season with Hearts running away with the Championship title.","Rangers confirm to the Stock Exchange that Ally McCoist has resigned .

"The average waiting time to speak to a real person at HMRC was 18 minutes - with one person left hanging on the line for 41 minutes. File picture . The tax office helpline has been branded a 'lottery' with almost a third of callers cut off before they even get to speak to an adviser, according to new research. The average waiting time to speak to a real person was 18 minutes - with one person left hanging on the line for 41 minutes. Consumer champions Which? tested Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) helplines ahead of the self-assessment tax return deadline on January 31st. Which? researchers made 100 calls to HMRC's self-assessment and general enquiries helplines to see how easy it is to get through to an adviser. Nearly a third of the calls (29 per cent) were cut off by the automated system before the caller could speak to anyone, with callers being told it was because the helpline was 'very busy'. In the 71 calls where researchers did manage to get past the automated system, they were then put on hold. On average it took 18 minutes to speak to a real person, but one caller was left waiting for 41 minutes. The Which? researchers found the later in the day they called, the longer the wait and the more likely they were to be cut off. The automated system also struggled with certain words and phrases. A query about 'my tax code' was fine but when asked 'Do I need to pay tax on premium bond winnings?' it asked if the caller was asking changing a name, or about a VAT surcharge notice. In a separate survey of more than 1,000 Which? members, one in five (20 per cent) who had contacted HMRC in the last year said they found contacting them difficult, compared with 15 per cent of those who contacted the Department of Work and Pensions, 12 per cent who contacted their local authority and eight per cent who contacted the DVLA. In a separate survey of more than 1,000 Which? members, one in five (20 per cent) who had contacted HMRC in the last year said they found contacting them difficult. File picture .

"A lobby group that supports publicly funded universal health care has claimed that under the federal government's proposed changes to Medicare the average upfront cost of a 15-minute consultation with a GP could exceed $100 within two years. The Doctors Reform Society says Tony Abbott's government's plan to reduce the Medicare rebate for doctors by $5 and freeze it until 2018 is promoting a 'return to a failed privatised system of the past'. The Newcastle Herald reported that the cost hike is likely to be the case with doctors free to charge what the market will bear in the future. Society national president and GP Con Costa said extending the current two-year-long freeze on Medicare rebates for another four years would hit GP clinics' budgets hard. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott's government's plan to reduce the Medicare rebate for doctors by $5 and freeze it until 2018 . It's a move that would drive many doctors away from bulk-billing and into increasing their fees for patients who do not have concession cards. In 2012, the former Labor government froze the Medicare rebate for a standard ""Level B"" consultation of up to 20 minutes at $37.05. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) recommends GPs charge $75 for such consultations, meaning patients without concessions are usually out of pocket $37.95. But Dr Costa told The Newcastle Herald that because some doctors were already charging $80, it was likely some would be charging at least $100 by 2016. Under the government's new proposal, if a doctor charges $100 up front, a non-concession patient would receive a rebate of $32.05, leaving them out of pocket $67.95. It's claimed that the current two-year-long freeze on Medicare rebates for another four years would hit GP clinics' budgets hard . 'We're predicting a rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor,' Dr Costa said. 'Up until now, Medicare and high rates of bulk-billing have kept a lid on doctors' fees and charges in general practice. Once you destroy this cost control, you basically open Pandora's box.' The AMA has always argued that Medicare rebates for GPs' work have not kept up with inflation and average weekly earnings. Prime Minister Abbott has come under fire for his Medicare proposals .

"The billionaire lover of writer Alexandra Tolstoy has had his assets frozen by the High Court. Russian oligarch Sergei Pugachev, a former ally of President Vladimir Putin, faced legal action by the liquidator of his failed bank. Now the High Court has placed a world-wide order freezing more than £1billion of his assets. Lovers: Alexandra Tolstoy, right, has three children with Sergei Pugachev, left . Broadcaster and writer Miss Tolstoy, a distant relative of War And Peace author Leo Tolstoy, has three children with Mr Pugachev and they share homes in London and the South of France. She has claimed he is the victim of a high-level conspiracy in Russia to take over his empire. Mr Pugachev, who was once known as the ‘Kremlin’s banker’,  was taken to court by the liquidator of his bank Mezhprombank, which went bust in the global financial crisis, owing hundreds of millions of pounds. Liquidator, the Deposit Insurance Agency, was granted an injunction this week freezing £1.17billion of his assets across the globe, including two London homes and a villa in Nice. The freeze prevents him from selling the properties or doing anything to diminish their value. Alexandra Tolstoy, pictured, has claimed her lover is the victim of a  high-level conspiracy in Russia to take over his empire . He is also banned from spending cash in bank accounts. Mr Pugachev, 51, is still allowed to spend up to £10,000 a week on living expenses plus legal bills. Miss Tolstoy, whose relatives moved to Britain in the 1920s, said that one of the properties affected by the action is a £12million house in Battersea. Recently, she claimed that she owed nearly all her wealth to Mr Pugachev. The Deposit Insurance Agency, represented by City law firm Hogan Lovells, alleges Mr Pugachev transferred hundreds of millions of dollars from his company to an account at a private bank in Switzerland. It also claims he is ‘vicariously liable’ for the bank’s collapse. The injunction declares: ‘If you, Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev, disobey this order you may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have your assets seized.’ The same potential punishment applies to anybody who assists in breaching the order. Miss Tolstoy was educated at Downe House, the same Berkshire boarding school that the Duchess of Cambridge briefly attended, and went on to study at Edinburgh University. In 2009 she made the BBC documentary series, Horse People with Alexandra Tolstoy, in which she explored remote communities around the world where horses are central to the culture. While spending a decade travelling around China, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan she met her first husband, a Cossack horseman. During that marriage she lived in Moscow, where she gave English lessons to Mr Pugachev. There was a minor scandal when she became pregnant by him while still married to the horseman. When they split there was a legal row over the £250,000 Moscow apartment they shared. The High Court has placed a world-wide order freezing more than £1billion of Sergei Pugachev's assets. He is pictured here with lover Alexandra Tolstoy . She says this property and a cottage in Oxfordshire are the only assets she independently owns. The deeply religious Mr Pugachev was the man who ignited Putin’s career by introducing him to the daughter of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Despite once looking after the money of Putin’s inner circle, he fell out of favour in 2010 and was eventually forced to flee the country. Having quit as a senator, Mr Pugachev lost immunity against prosecution in Putin’s courts.","Russian oligarch Sergei Pugachev has his assets frozen by the High Court .

"If you ever came this close to a rampaging rhino it is unlikely you would live to tell the tale. But fortunately wildlife photographer Dhritiman Mukherjee was not behind the camera when the one-horned rhino smashed into it without any provocation at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India. He was using a remote trigger to take the shots from the heavily camouflaged camera after trying to get close to the animals for almost 14 days. 'After some initial disappointment, I finally got a rhinoceros close enough to the camera. But then, it came charging in,' he said. 'Despite the fact that I was using heavy camouflaging around the camera, the rhino came charging towards the camera without any provocation, undoubtedly seeing it as a threat. Scroll down for video . A raging rhinoceros charged at a camouflaged long-lens camera at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, north-eastern India . Fortunately wildlife photographer Dhritiman Mukherjee was not behind the camera when the one-horned rhino smashed into it . 'I was using a trigger to click the rhinos. Had I been ducking there near the camera, the results would have been disastrous.' The forcefulness of the impact meant that Mr Mukherjee had little hope of finding his camera in one piece - but amazingly it survived the encounter. 'As the rhino attacked the camera, it went flying in the air. I found the camera covered in mud, but to my utter surprise, it was intact,' Mr Mukherjee said. 'I had a feeling that the camera would be gone. But, it was working fine even after the bulldozing effect of the rhino's charge.' Illegal rhinoceros horn poaching is one of the major environmental issues in the park, with animal body parts such as the toenails and skin having a high value on the Asian medicinal market. The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the one-horned rhino, is listed as a vulnerable species as the number of one-horned rhinos has dropped drastically in recent years.

They are also known to have lived in Myanmar, southern China and Indochina. The rhinos have a thick grey-brown skin with pinkish skin folds and a black horn. Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps and they have has very little body hair. Among terrestrial land mammals native to Asia, the Indian rhinoceros is second in size only to the Asian elephant. It is also the second-largest living rhinoceros, behind only the white rhinoceros with males growing to 12.5ft in length and females growing to 11.2ft in length.

"A father was shocked when his Amazon parcel was left in a filled dustbin by delivery men when he was out of the house. Phil Norris said he was 'mystified' to discover a note pushed through his letter box to inform him that his purchases had been put in with the rubbish. While his package was undamaged, the 43-year-old from Up Hatherley, Cheltenham, said it could easily have been taken away by bin collectors the following day had he not returned home. Scroll down for video . Mr Norris was left this note by a delivery driver informing him his package had been left in the wheelie bin . 'We only spotted the note at about 10.30pm and were a bit mystified. 'We went to our wheelie bin round the corner and saw two parcels on top of the bags of rubbish. The parcels were fine, but they could have easily have been left there overnight. ''Our neighbours would have moved the wheelie bin for collection and it would have been collected by the refuse collectors,' he added. But after sharing his experience on social media, Mr Norris was told he was lucky to have received his package. 'Delivery people get a hard time - let's stop and remember they are trying to earn a living. If you don't like the way things are done then don't order for home delivery,' said one Facebook user, while another added: 'I don't understand what the big ordeal is about this? You're getting your parcel, it's safe and not getting rained on?' One man, who claimed to work for a delivery company, said requests to leave parcels in wheelie bins outside people's houses were more common than thought. 'You'd be surprised the requests we get for parcels and one of the most common that's stated in the delivery instructions is ""please leave inside bin"". Some online shoppers were defended the online retailer and its delivery drivers who are sometimes asked to leave parcels in strange places . Couriers for Yodel are paid as little as 50p per delivery and must deliver up to 160 parcels a day, it is claimed. Yodel, voted the worst parcel service in the UK, delivers for firms from Amazon and Waterstones to Boots and Argos. But complaints have stacked up in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. There are claims of items left in bushes, in bins or with unknown neighbours, and of deliveries at night. Now stories have emerged of drivers paid just a few pence per parcel. On an online forum where staff rate employers, a man in Nottingham said he was offered the equivalent of 50p a parcel. He said: ‘How they expect you to earn even a half decent wage is beyond me.’ He worked out that by delivering one parcel every six to eight minutes, he would earn £2.50 an hour after deducting petrol, which seasonal couriers must buy. Job ads for seasonal drivers say they work ‘at some pace’, warning: ‘It’s no mean feat.’ A Scottish driver, who spent seven years at Yodel until 2012, said: ‘December is always the worst time. Some workers were out until 10pm. The workers had a target . . . it ranged from 110-160 parcels a day. You couldn’t bring back more than 2 per cent. Guys were coming back with 20 to 30 parcels saying they couldn’t do it. A lot of the workers were off with stress.’ Customers were just as unhappy. Twitter user ‘Yodelhell’ said: ‘All we want is our packages delivered intact. Is it too much to ask?’ Rachel Webber said her order showed she missed a delivery at 1am. She said: ‘I am going to assume I was asleep.’ Yodel said deliveries should be no later than 9pm. A spokesman said many workers had a regular salary but some were self-employed and paid per delivery. I agree you shouldn't do that unless given specific instructions to do so! If I feel there isn't a safe, dry and hidden place when I will leave a polite note stating my reasons and that it will be delivered the following day.' Unfortunately not all delivery drivers shared Mr Carter's approach, with one shopper's experience going entirely to waste. 'My friend had a parcel left in the bin... same day the bin men came.' Laura Miao from Liverpool was shocked to discover a ps4 bought for her son as a Christmas present had been left in a neighbour's wheelie bin two doors down. While Amazon offered to refund her for the package, it would not offer an exchange of the expensive gadget. 'The bin wasn't actually out and had to look in all the neighbours bins. 'We had to dispose of the packaging because it smelled of food. 'When we contacted Amazon to try and understand why this had happened they did offer a compensation refund but no offer to exchange a smelly damaged parcel. 'I have requested answers again and they have now said they can't help any further. 'It is Amazons reply that has really frustrated us and they take No responsibility and say that they don't choose the courier.' Steph Cosway in Prestwick was horrified when a courier placed her parcel in a filled skip in her front garden. She was forced to retrieve the cat perch bought for her two pets from the 'smelly' skip herself. 'This skip was not only full of rubbish, and vomit due to a lovely drunk, from a house and garden clearance but was also due to be picked up that day. 'It was only by luck that my partner had forgot to phone the skip company that day or my parcel would be gone. 'I  had to fish about in the skip to trail out my parcel which now smelled. News of the pricing glitch spread fast on social media, with dozens of people taking to Twitter to report the bargains they had snapped up thanks to the technical glitch. Amazon said many orders had been cancelled . One trader, called Belle (pictured), said her firm - which stocks toys and games - had seen its stock sell-out at the hugely discounted price and claimed the company faced losses of about £30,000 due to the price error . It comes after shoppers cashed in on a computer glitch in Amazon's system today which priced scores of items at just 1p. Products ranging from clothes and toys to home furnishings and health products were advertised on the site for a fraction of their usual price due to a fault with a piece of software. Business owners have now hit out at the retail giant, claiming they risk going bankrupt because the glitch resulted in them losing large amounts of money. Judith Blackford, of Kiddymania, claims to have lost £20,000 overnight due to the error, while another seller, called Belle, said her business is facing a loss of about £30,000. Other business owners said they had heard reports of sellers losing up to £100,000. Amazon said the majority of orders were cancelled immediately and said it would be working with sellers who had seen orders processed. A surge in the number of people doing their Christmas shopping online has 'swamped' retailers, contributing to fears that gifts may not arrive on time. Last week a string of High Street chains including Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Waterstones were said to be 'in chaos' due to an overwhelming number of orders. Yodel, the UK's largest delivery service after Royal Mail, admitted it was three days behind on orders this weekend. The company – employed by a string of retailers including Amazon, Boots, Argos, Waterstones and Tesco Direct – said it will not resume normal collections until Monday at the earliest. But yesterday chairman Dick Stead apologised for the delays, promising to get services 'back on track'. A spokesman said: 'We are aware that a number of Marketplace sellers listed incorrect prices for a short period of time as a result of the third party software they use to price their items on Amazon.co.uk. 'We responded quickly and were able to cancel the vast majority of orders placed on these affected items immediately and no costs or fees will be incurred by sellers for these cancelled orders. 'We are now reviewing the small number of orders that were processed and will be reaching out to any affected sellers directly.' Earlier this month the website was inundated with orders over Black Friday and Manic Monday, which saw thousands of prices slashed dramatically. While Amazon was one of the few websites to withstand the pressure of a surge in traffic (Curry's, Argos and Tesco Direct all crashed), some sales were disrupted. Among hiccups was the sale of an Apple Macbook Pro for less than £3. Two men are understood to have placed orders for the laptops through Amazon when the deal was announced, though each transaction was cancelled by the online retailer.","Phil Norris was shocked to discover note pushed through letterbox .

"A few nifty tricks will allow you to access U.S. bargains from the comfort of your own home . From cheap computers to half-price clothes and huge savings on cameras, we’re forever hearing how much less goods cost across the Atlantic. Yet while few of us can afford to jet off to America for a Christmas shopping spree, there is a way to access those bargains and save huge sums — all from the comfort of your sofa. For although online shopping overseas sounds daunting — and is not as simple as just redirecting yourself to U.S. websites — with a few nifty tricks you could save yourself thousands of pounds, especially on big-ticket electronic items. And that’s even when adding postage and tax costs. Take a digital SLR camera, for example. One of the best and most popular on the market now is the Canon EOS 5D Mark III, which on the British version of Amazon costs a whopping £4,499 new, plus £6.15 postage. But find yourself on the American site of Amazon and you can pick it up for £2,369 — nearly half the price. Even when you’ve added on taxes, shipping and duty — upping the total to £3,009.70 — you still pay £1,495.45 less. Elsewhere, an Apple iPad Air 2 64GB from the U.S., with taxes and postage added, would cost £444.98 from Walmart.com, compared with £479 from Apple.com in the UK. You can end up with a J. Crew cardigan and Levi’s jeans for half price. Such are the savings — and the ever-easier buying process — more people are shopping and shipping abroad. And there is still time to order and receive goods in time for Christmas Day. ‘With online retail we’re seeing geographical boundaries breaking down,’ says Chris Morton, founder of fashion aggregation site Lyst.com. Scroll down for video . ‘It’s getting easier for the customer to ship things over, and cheaper, too — especially if you’re interested in designer brands like Ralph Lauren or Michael Kors or J.Crew. Those clothes items are often on sale for the same figure in dollars as in British pounds, making them around 50 per cent cheaper in the States.’ That is why most international companies make it difficult to shop from their U.S sites and automatically redirect visitors from the UK to a website specifically for the British market. But there are ways round this. For some, such as Amazon.co.uk, it’s as simple as changing the ending of the web address to Amazon.com on the address bar. For others, such as Apple, the more complex web address will include the letters ‘en’, as in ‘England’ — try changing that to ‘US’ and you may find yourself on the American site. In most cases though, it’s a question of looking at the top and bottom of the homepage for a tiny Union Jack flag or the words ‘United Kingdom’. Near these should be the option to change your territory to ‘United States’ or to click on an American flag. Huge savings can be made on expensive electronic products such as the Apple iPad Air by buying them on U.S. websites . Once you have found the correct site and currency, remember that operations abroad do not always work the same as in the UK. When calculating prices you should remember that in many states, sales tax is added at the checkout rather than marked on the selling price. ‘Even if you’re buying through an eBay seller that looks great, you’re often still going to have to pay duty, so be careful buying abroad unless the pricing is absolutely transparent,’ says consumer expert Sarah Willingham, who works with the Government’s online safety campaign Cyber Streetwise. For goods sold within the U.S. tax varies from state to state and is generally calculated after you’ve added your delivery address, because it usually depends on which state the item is being delivered to. The highest is 9.4 per cent in Tennessee, while shipping to Oregon or Washington carries no sales tax at all. While delivering direct to the UK might seem a better option, many U.S. companies will deliver only to a U.S. address and insist you use an American credit card. But you can get around this by using a shopping and shipping site, which will handle the transaction and delivery on your behalf — then send the goods to the UK. This is when the U.S. state taxes become important. One reputable service is MyUS.com, which is free to subscribe to after a $10 (£6) joining fee and gives you what is effectively a PO Box for your deliveries. This is in Florida, meaning a middle-ground 6 per cent sales tax. It also provides a ‘personal shopper’ service, which can place orders on your behalf to avoid the need for an American credit card. It will also check orders when they arrive to make sure they are undamaged, sort out the tax and UK customs payments, and deal with any paperwork, such as that needed to transport hazardous materials, which include the lithium batteries in laptops or flammable products such as nail polish. It then puts your packages into one parcel to send to you, potentially saving hundreds of pounds on shipping packages individually. It will not deal with certain major issues, however, such as negotiating items that could be considered a threat to national security, like advanced electronics and firearms. The double delivery means you must allow time for a product to reach MyUS.com — for Apple, that is two days — and time for it to ship from its depot to the UK. That’s an average of three days, though over the Christmas period its fastest courier, FedEx Priority, says December 18 is the final day for shipping to the UK. Although online shopping overseas sounds daunting - and is not as simple as just redirecting yourself to U.S. websites - with a few nifty tricks you could save yourself thousands of pounds . That means tomorrow is the last day on standard delivery within America, though some U.S. firms have same-day or one-day delivery, which may extend your window. It’s still down to you to check whether the U.S. saving really does add up once taxes, shipping costs and also custom duties have been added. If you have goods delivered to the UK you must also pay duty and import VAT on anything over £135. While this can be quite complicated and differs depending on the type of item and price range, services such as MyUS will work the charges out and some sites, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, calculate it at the checkout. For example, on a Michael Kors handbag with a U.S. price of £142.57 (MichaelKors.com), sales tax at 6 per cent is around £8.55, shipping is £35.08, duty is 4 per cent, so £5.70, and import VAT is 20 per cent, around £28.51 — all told about £220, compared with £285 in the UK. Further details of the duty on different items can be found at customs.hmrc.gov.uk. Just remember to check these factors first, or you could pay more despite lower prices. The UK price for the 11in 256GB MacBook Air is £899, compared with £699.50 from the Apple store in the U.S.. Yet by the time you’ve added sales tax, shipping and UK duty, the actual cost is £925.30 — £26.30 more. The only way round this is to wait for a sale or try a discount dealer such as Best Buy, which has MacBooks for $100 less. And not all items will have guarantees. Apple has an international warranty on many products but not on iPhones, because they are bought with a service provider. The same applies to cellular iPads, which are not likely to be covered, while wifi iPads are. You can get refunds, but this can be complicated and expensive. As services such as MyUS.com check products for damage, you can send products back before they leave the U.S., however. Sometimes savings may seem small, but if you bulk-buy, you can consolidate shipping prices, making it possible to save thousands on a big spree. That could make it ideal for those doing Christmas shopping in one go — without all the jet-lag.","Shoppers can save thousands of pounds on big-ticket electronic items .

"This is the dramatic moment a man, wanted by police, held a meat cleaver to his girlfriend's neck and threatened to kill her unless they let him go free. With a crazed look in his eye, suspected thief Zheng Mengjie held the knife at his terrified girlfriend's throat when police turned up to carry out an arrest warrant. The 26-year-old told officers to leave his house in the city of Huizhou, in southern China's Guangdong Province, or they would have the blood of Xiu Shao, 23, on their hands.

He told officers to leave his house in the city of Huizhou, in southern China's Guangdong Province, or they would have the blood of Xiu Shao on their hands . He then grabbed a shard of glass that he used to keep officers at bay, while gripping the meat cleaver firmly at his girlfriend's neck. Police spokesman Wen Tsou said: 'There were numerous charges against him all related to theft and as a result we wanted to bring him in for questioning. 'But when officers broke down the door after he refused to open it, he was inside with the meat cleaver at his girlfriend's throat.' 'The officers refused to leave and kept their guns pointed at him, and when they saw blood trickling from the young woman's neck because he was cutting her, they approached him and tried to get her away, but he stabbed at them with the glass injuring two. 'They then made a decision to shoot him.' Zheng was shot in the chest and dropped the meat cleaver, clutching his chest in agony. An ambulance was then called to treat the two injured officers, and the suspected thief. Both Zheng and the wounded officers were taken to a local hospital for treatment with no life-threatening injuries. Once he recovers, he will be charged with attempted murder as well as the original theft charges.","Zheng Mengjie held cleaver to girlfriend's neck and threatened to kill her .

"Charles Ashton, a funeral director, has admitted fondling a woman's breasts before the service . An octogenarian funeral director fondled a woman’s breasts minutes before a service, a court heard. Charles Ashton, 83, could face jail for the assault in which he made a series of inappropriate comments about the woman’s figure before grabbing her. The incident happened at the family funeral directors business which Ashton runs with his son. The pensioner, who is a former director and chairman of Castleford Rugby League Football Club, pleaded guilty to sexual assault at Leeds magistrates’ court. Robert Campbell, prosecuting, told the court: ‘There was a funeral about to take place and they were in a room [together] . . . He put his arm around her, kissed her on two occasions and fondled her breasts.’ Mr Campbell added: ‘He had also made inappropriate remarks about the size of her breasts.’ Stephen Swan, mitigating, asked for sentencing to be adjourned so that a report could be prepared into the circumstances of the case. He added that the assault was out of character for Ashton. Mr Swan said: ‘It is entirely out of character for this man who it’s fair to say is devastated about what’s happened. I think it’s a measure of him that he is so upset about what’s happened.’ Before leaving the hearing last week Ashton, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, told magistrates: ‘I am sorry to have troubled you.’ They warned that he could face jail for the offence. Earlier this year an undertaker who poured flour over a neighbour’s Mercedes for blocking in his hearse was jailed. Funeral director Julian Riley, 39, and Peter Elliot, 60, had argued for weeks over parking spaces after property developer Elliot bought a house opposite Riley’s business, a court heard. In September 2013 Riley was caught on CCTV emptying a 2lb bag of self-raising flour over Mr Elliot’s black Mercedes E-320. A court heard it set ‘like cement’ in the rain and removing it scratched the car’s paint. Police arrested Riley after following a line of white powder. The incident was said to be out of character for 83-year-old Ashton who could face jail for the sexual assault .","Charles Ashton, a funeral director, admitted sexually assaulting woman .

"The family of a man who was run over and killed by his wife following an argument have slammed the courts for not jailing her. Kareen Pope was convicted in October of causing father-of-two George Pope's death by careless driving, but was spared jail and was sentenced instead to community service. Mr Pope, 42, died after his estranged wife, 45, a qualified nurse, ploughed her car into him as he walked down the street in December 2012. Kareen Pope (pictured left) was convicted in October of causing father-of-two George Pope's (right) death by careless driving, but was spared jail - his family are calling for the 'unduly lenient' sentence to be reviewed . She had been giving Mr Pope a lift home in her Ford Focus when they argued about his drinking. He was dropped off and got out to walk, but seconds later was hit by her car. The 'slap on the wrists' sentence has outraged Mr Pope's distraught mother, Morag McManus. Now, she is calling for the sentence to be reviewed, claiming it is 'unduly lenient'. 'The justice system has let us down,' said Mrs McManus, 67, from Paisley. Mother Morag McManus (right) and Christina Simmons (left), sister of George Pope are upset at the sentence . An undated photograph of married couple Kareen and George Pope before their relationship broke down . 'It took the jury just half-an-hour to find her guilty of running him over, but the judge only gave her community service for killing her husband. 'It is just not right. I have been left without my son and we want to see justice for what happened to him.' Pope, who is appealing her conviction, was initially arrested for causing her husband's death by dangerous driving. However, the charge was dropped and replaced with the lesser offence of causing death by careless driving. Her trial, at Paisley Sheriff Court, heard the couple had been arguing on December 6 2012. The court heard Pope gave Mr Pope lift from their house to his flat, but instead of going inside, he staggered into the middle of the road. Pope drove behind him for about 90ft before striking him, trapping him underneath the car. Her son Glen Hodgkinson, 21, was also in the car with her at the time. Paramedics who rushed to the scene were unable to save Mr Pope's life. He was pronounced dead at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Last night, Mr Pope's sister, Christina Simmons, 33, said she burst into tears as Sheriff Robert Fife sentenced Pope to just 200 hours of community punishment. Pope had been banned from driving for three years at an earlier hearing. Father-of-two George Pope died after his estranged wife ran him over in her car after an argument . 'I couldn't believe it,' the mother-of-two said. 'Even she thought she was going to jail - she had a rucksack and hold-all with her. 'But she turned the water-works on and was given unpaid work and a driving ban, all for taking somebody's life. 'It is disgusting.' Mrs Simmons admitted the couple had a drink-fuelled and turbulent relationship, but described Mr Pope as a 'happy-go-lucky guy' who was 'loved by everyone'. She added: 'When she killed George, she killed half of me as well. That is why I just can't let it go.' Mrs Simmons is now backing an online petition set up by her brother's friend, Chris Beaton, calling for a review of evidence in the case. Mr Beaton, 40, of Clydebank, said: 'There was evidence from George's family and friends about Kareen Pope's background that was never heard during her trial. 'We are very concerned about this and want the procurator fiscal to look into the case again. 'She is still living the life she used to, while George's friends and family know that he will never have that luxury.' In October, qualified nurse Pope said she was left 'paralysed with shock' when she realised her estranged husband was pinned under her car. She said: 'I had killed him. I had run over him in my car, killing him instantly, and I just broke down in hysterics. 'George was gone and it was all my fault.' Pope said that before the incident she managed to get her 'alcoholic' partner 'into the back seat' with help from her son. 'After giving him a very good talking to, I dropped him off outside his house,' she told the court. 'But instead of going inside, he started staggering slowly in front of the car and refusing to move out of the way, so I had no option but to drive slowly behind him to get to the end of the narrow street. 'The road was dark as it was winter, but I could clearly see him in front of the car bonnet and he stumbled slightly then disappeared. Mr Pope pictured with his sister Christina - she says the sentence given to Kareen Pope is 'disgusting' 'I quickly did an emergency stop and looked at my son in a panic. I tried to reverse and, when the car wouldn't move, I realised George was under the car. 'I am a qualified nurse but I panicked when I saw him lying there. I just froze. 'He was my husband and I loved him and when I took his hand and held it, I knew he was dead.' During the trial, Pope's lawyer, Manus Tolland, said: 'This incident is something that is going to live with her for the rest of her life.' Sheriff Fife also told the hearing: 'This is a tragic case. She was careless, that is the bottom line, but I am not going to send her to jail. This is a very long and tragic case which has gone on for years. 'It is very sad.' He added: 'I do not want to upset you. I am not going to send you to jail. You were careless and it had a terrible consequence. 'There needs to be an element of punishment for what took place. Now, you can put it behind you.' Mrs McManus said she struggles to comprehend why the sheriff said he did not want to upset her son's ex. She said: 'How can the sheriff tell her not to get upset and that he wouldn't jail her? 'I was furious with what he said, taking pity on George's ex but totally overlooking the feelings of his family.' Mrs McManus said 'I have been left without my son and we want to see justice for what happened to him' The procurator fiscal's office last night explained it 'has a limited right of appeal against sentence'. A spokesman added that for an appeal against sentence to be successful, it must be outside the range of sentencing options which could be imposed. Sentences for causing death by careless driving can range from ordering a re-test to five years' imprisonment. The spokesman said it would therefore be 'inappropriate' for the procurator fiscal to appeal against Kareen Pope's sentence. 'We will be contacting Mr Pope's next-of-kin to explain the reasons for this decision to them,' he said.","Kareen Pope convicted in October of causing husband George's death .

"Portland police have arrested Lonzo Murphy in connection with a shooting outside an alternative high school . A 22-year-old man arrested in connection with a shooting outside an alternative high school in Portland had ties to a gang, as did two of the victims, police said Saturday. Sgt. Pete Simpson said Lonzo Murphy is a 'person of interest' in the Friday shooting, but officers aren't prepared to say whether he was the gunman, Simpson said. Authorities are trying to find two other people connected to the shooting near Rosemary Anderson High School. Three were hospitalized, including a 16-year-old girl who was critically wounded, and a fourth person was grazed by a bullet and treated at the scene. Simpson says two male victims have ties to gangs. The victims are students or in affiliated job training programs, authorities say. 'The nexus of it had to do with gang activity,' Simpson told reporters outside police headquarters. 'The proximity to the school was happenstance, if you will. It doesn't sound like it had anything to do directly with the school.' Investigators received information that led them to look for Murphy, Simpson said. He was pulled over early Saturday and arrested on a parole violation. Officers found a handgun 'consistent with what we were looking for related to this case,' Simpson but officers can't say yet whether it was tied to the shooting. After the arrest, investigators searched Murphy's apartment, which is located five blocks from the shooting scene. School officials planned to hold an open-house on Sunday so students, staff and community members could drop in, be together and get support, the Oregonian reported. Police identified the hospitalized victims as Taylor Michelle Zimmers, 16, who was upgraded from critical to serious condition Saturday; David Jackson-Liday, 20; and Labraye Franklin, 17. Jackson-Liday and Franklin remained in fair condition, police said. Olyvia Batson, 17, was treated at the scene after a bullet grazed her foot. Scene: Police guide students from Rosemary Anderson High School following a shooting at the school . Police have designated Jackson-Liday as a gang member, a formal process that requires officers to develop evidence and provide the alleged gang member an opportunity to appeal, Simpson said. Franklin is known by officers to be affiliated with a gang but has not been designated a gang member, he said. Zimmers and Batson have no apparent gang affiliations, Simpson said. Gang violence in Portland isn't new. Some of the violence occurs between rival gangs, but bystanders have also been hurt. Portland police have said they saw a spike in gang crime over the summer and have complained they don't have adequate resources to address the problem. A man died in a drive-by shooting in June and another man was killed in a separate shooting. A 5-year-old boy also was shot in the leg while playing at an apartment complex. A Multnomah County report on gang activity released in June said crime in the county that includes Portland actually decreased from 2005 to 2012. As inner-city Portland gentrifies, the report said, criminal activity is shifting from northern neighborhoods to areas farther east, including the city of Gresham. The north Portland neighborhood where the most recent shooting occurred exemplifies the trend. Before Friday, the place once known for gangs had not had a shooting with injuries in nearly four years. There was another school shooting in the Portland area in June, but it was not gang-related. A freshman killed another boy in a locker room, and a bullet grazed a teacher before the shooter went into a bathroom and died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said.

"With stunning views and a beachfront location, it is widely considered the best finishing hole in golf. But today, Pebble Beach's iconic 18th hole looks a bit different from usual after a ferocious storm uprooted one of the two Cypress trees dotting the fairway. The trees, which were planted near the landing area in 2004 in the place of another pair of diseased trees, play into the strategy of the tee shot at the hole in the California coastal resort. Wrecked: Pebble Beach's iconic par-5 18th hole looks a bit different from usual today after a violent storm uprooted one of the two Cypress trees dotting the fairway. Above, the downed tree is seen on the fairway . Famous: Golfer Davis Love III plays his second shot beside the now-wrecked tree in September this year . Speaking of the uprooting, United States Golf Association (USGA) official Ron Read said: 'I was standing on the 18th tee and conservatively, the wind was blowing at least 40 miles an hour.' He added that despite taking a photo of the fairway during the winter storm, he did not notice the downed tree until he examined the picture later,Golf Digest reported. Following the incident on Thursday, only one Cypress tree still sits on the fairway, around 300 yards from the championship tees, that would continue to affect players' strategies. However, it is possible that officials may not be able to find and plant a replacement tree in time for the PGA Tour's annual stop at the site as part of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Stormy: The two Cypress trees were planted near the California golf course's landing area in 2004 in the place of another pair of diseased trees. Above, the downed tree is seen lying on its side in the top left of this photo . The competition is due to be played from February 12 to 15, 2015. The tree is the third to fall on a golf course in 2014. Earlier this year, the Eisenhower Tree on the 17th hole at Augusta National was completely damaged in an ice storm in February. Meanwhile, an overhanging tree at the sixth hole at TPC Sawgrass, was cut down in October.

"Investigators searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 say they could finish scouring the priority zone by May, more than a year after it vanished, if there are no delays with vessels, equipment and weather. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) told AAP on Sunday that decisions about the future of the search would continue to be made in collaboration between Malaysia, China and Australia. Last week, families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the March 8 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing provided DNA samples to assist in identifying loved ones once the plane was found.

A computer-animated video and sonar images of the Indian Ocean seabed where the search has been focused has also been released. The latest JACC update said the survey vessel Fugro Equator was continuing to map the ocean floor and would return to Fremantle when it completes its current phase this month. About 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed so far. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) told AAP on Sunday that decisions about the future of the search would continue to be made in collaboration between Malaysia, China and Australia . Fugro Discovery arrived back in the search area on December 4, while GO Phoenix returned last Tuesday, and both have recommenced underwater search operations. Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on the missing flight, wrote an article for the Sunday Times. She said when she and her two young children said goodbye to him they never thought it would be for the last time. Last week, families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the March 8 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing provided DNA samples to assist in identifying loved ones once the plane was found . 'But now, March 7 is permanently engraved in my mind and often on rewind,' she wrote. 'Not only as the day we kissed Paul goodbye at Perth Airport, but because mentally, for me, it is still March 7.' Ms Weeks said not knowing what really happened to her husband continued to haunt her. A computer-animated video and sonar images of the Indian Ocean seabed where the search has been focused has also been released . 'Every waking minute, your mind runs scenarios of what might have happened,' she said. 'You are searching the news constantly for any small piece of information that may give you a clue to their whereabouts, and your heart pounds every time the phone rings. Is this it? Have they found something?' Those hunting for debris of the plane have revealed footage of what they've found on the ocean floor. Lead search agency, Australian Transport Safety Bureau, released this sonar acoustic image on Thursday of the ocean floor as teams continue to scour the Indian Ocean . The picture, released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Thursday, shows what search vessels are recording as they continue to scour the Indian Ocean for any signs of the Malaysian Airlines plane. 'The image is a synthetic aperture sonar acoustic image of the sea floor gathered by GO Phoenix. This is indicative of the resolution and quality of the data and that it is revealing important detail of the sea floor,' the ATSB, who is leading the search, said in its latest operational report. The GO Phoenix vessel returned to the area on Tuesday to recommence underwater search operations. Another vessel, Fugro Discovery, is also searching underwater as the Fugro Equator continues to conduct bathymetric survey operations in the search area. More than 9,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean floor has been searched to date, but there's been no signs of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight . 'In addition to locating the aircraft, the underwater search aims to map the MH370 debris field in order to identify and prioritise the recovery of specific aircraft components, including flight recorders, which will assist with the Malaysian investigation,' the ATSB said. 'The ATSB has utilised the data from the bathymetric survey work to prepare the initial plan for the underwater search, to be followed and referred to by all parties involved. 'The plan includes search timings, methods, procedures, safety precautions and the initial search areas for the various vessels. About 200,000 square kilometres of the search area have been surveyed via bathymetric surveying . 'The equipment used on the vessels is providing extraordinary data.' More than 9,000 square kilometres of the ocean floor has been searched to date and about 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed, according to the ATSB.

"Don’t throw orange peel, used teabags, fish bones and over-ripe tomatoes on the compost heap. They can have some surprising beauty benefits. From improving nails and hair to deflating puffy eye bags, Mandy Francis takes a look at the foods in our diet that are actually beauty secrets . . . Scroll down for video . Broccoli leaves to beat bumpy arms . Eating plenty of dark green vegetables like broccoli leaves will help to boost skin condition . A 30mg serving of these leaves — a small handful — can provide 70 per cent of your daily vitamin A requirement — almost twice as much as is in the equivalent serving of the florets. ‘One of the first signs of a diet that is deficient in vitamin A is dry, rough skin,’ says nutrition therapist Alice Mackintosh, who specialises in treating skin conditions through diet. ‘Eating plenty of dark green vegetables like broccoli leaves, which contain both betacarotene (a protective antioxidant converted into vitamin A by the body), and omega-3 fatty acids, will help to boost skin condition.’ Used teabags to deflate puffy eyes . To make your own caffeinated eye-booster, squeeze the excess fluid out of two used teabags — black or green — and put them in the fridge for ten minutes . A U.S. study in the Eighties showed that when applied topically, caffeine — the stimulant in tea and coffee — can have powerful anti-inflammatory effects. Many major skincare manufacturers now use caffeine as a significant ingredient in their eye creams to help freshen and tighten skin around the eyes. To make your own caffeinated eye-booster, squeeze the excess fluid out of two used teabags — black or green — and put them in the fridge for ten minutes. Then lie back and place the cold bags over your eyes for five minutes. Dr Adam Friedmann, consultant dermatologist at the Whittington Hospital in North London, says: ‘While more research is needed to prove caffeine will work wonders around the eyes, the combination of the cool, wet bag and powerful antioxidants in tea could help to soothe inflammation and puffiness around the eyes.’ Fish bones for strong nails . Fish bones can be a great source of calcium . ‘Don’t pick the bones out of tinned fish like salmon, pilchards and sardines,’ says Alice Mackintosh. ‘They are soft, edible and a great source of calcium.’ She adds: ‘Good calcium levels in the diet also have a positive impact on the skin. It’s an important mineral, alongside zinc, which is also found in fish bones and flesh, for keeping cell turn-over steady and consequently the complexion clear and itch-free. Avocado skin for a radiant complexion . Avocados — a good source of protective antioxidant vitamin E and heart-healthy fats — are a welcome addition to our diets, and the skin also has hidden beauty benefits. Even Victoria Beckham, who can afford top skin care experts, is said to favour homemade avocado face masks. So try this trick. Rub the inside of the skin over your face. Leave any pulp on your skin for 15 minutes then remove the residue with warm water and pat dry. Dr Adam Friedmann says: ‘Applying anything oily and vitamin-rich, such as avocado pulp, to your complexion can help to moisturise skin.’ Even Victoria Beckham, who can afford top skin care experts, is said to favour homemade avocado face masks . The fats in the avocado oil will help replenish moisturising factors in the skin. Antioxidants in the pulp have useful protective and healing qualities, too. Melon seeds ward off wrinkles . Don’t bin melon seeds, either. ‘They are an excellent source of zinc, a mineral that is vital for efficient collagen production in the body,’ says Alice Mackintosh. Collagen is a protein in the skin that helps to keep it looking plump and firm. Although collagen levels drop as we age and can be damaged by UV exposure, smoking and poor diet, they can be preserved and boosted with a healthy diet and lifestyle. Rinse the seeds and dry them with a clean cloth. Toast them in a medium oven or frying pan with a spritz of oil over a medium heat until they’ve started to brown on both sides . Rinse the seeds and dry them with a clean cloth. Toast them in a medium oven or frying pan with a spritz of oil over a medium heat until they’ve started to brown on both sides. Once cool, eat as a snack or on a salad. Cabbage leaves for a flatter tummy . Turn tough, outer cabbage leaves into sauerkraut for a flatter, less bloated stomach. ‘Sauerkraut, which is finely chopped cabbage fermented in salt with a few spices, contains up to 100 times more probiotic bacteria gram for gram than yogurt,’ says Alice Mackintosh. Probiotics develop from the bacteria on the leaves as the sauerkraut ferments. ‘Probiotic foods help to keep our digestion healthy and improve intestinal function,’ says Ms Mackintosh. Turn tough, outer cabbage leaves into sauerkraut for a flatter, less bloated stomach . Coffee grounds to rub away cellulite . Most cellulite-busting treatments contain caffeine these days, predominantly for its stimulant and diuretic effects — so why not apply used coffee grounds as a caffeine-rich scrub to your hips and thighs? Dermatologist Dr Friedmann says: ‘There’s no proof that caffeine helps to reduce cellulite, but gentle exfoliation can improve circulation and the superficial look of skin on the hips, bottom and thighs.’ But he warns that coffee grounds might be too scratchy and harsh as a scrub on their own. So you could follow the lead of actress Halle Berry who, it’s rumoured, makes a body scrub by mixing a fistful of coffee grounds with a moisturising body wash in the shower. Why not apply used coffee grounds as a caffeine-rich scrub to your hips and thighs? Rub the mixture over damp skin in circular movements, then rinse. Tatty tomatoes to protect your skin . In a study by researchers from the Universities of Manchester and Newcastle, lycopene — the protective antioxidant in the red pigment of tomatoes — was shown to boost the skin’s natural sun protection factor by as much as 33 per cent when eaten daily as tomato puree. Chopping and cooking tomatoes boosts the amount of lycopene by releasing it from the cells of the fruit. So with sun damage the main cause of premature skin ageing — even in winter — it’s well worth turning your squashed, tatty tomatoes into antioxidant-rich soup or pasta sauce. ‘Don’t forget to add olive oil, too.’ says dietitian Sarah Schenker. ‘Lycopene is a fat soluable nutrient. The oil will help to release it from the fruit during the cooking process and allow the body to absorb it more readily when you eat it.’ The protective antioxidant in the red pigment of tomatoes was shown to boost the skin’s natural sun protection factor .","The antioxidant in the red pigment of tomatoes protects skin from the sun .

"Dreams of a white Christmas might just come true this year – with bookies slashing the odds on snow falling on December 25. After a spell of spring-like weather this week, forecasters expect it to become progressively colder into next week and say snow on the big day is looking more and more likely. And with only ten days to go, many punters are convinced. A final forecast by the Met Office is usually made about five days before Christmas, but bookmakers have already been swamped with bets.

Crisp morning: A deer relaxes in London's Richmond Park yesterday morning as the warm sunshine begins to melt the early heavy frost . One company, Coral, has cut the odds on a white Christmas to 4/7 anywhere in Britain, with Aberdeen the favourite at 3/1. Spokesman Nicola McGeady said: ‘The Christmas spirit is alive in punters, who are queueing up to bet on a white Christmas in their local city. As December 25 nears, the odds on it actually happening continue to fall.’ Some weathermen are warning that the end of this week will herald the start of a long and cold winter, with signs of a severe big freeze on the cards. Before that, however, this week will see rising temperatures with figures of 13C (55F) in some parts by Wednesday – almost double the average for the time of year. The Met Office said westerly winds will bring a warm feel to southern parts of the country early this week. Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: ‘From Monday morning it is going to be milder, although there is the risk of some rain and wintry showers to the North where it will be colder.

Despite brief respite from the cold snap today, forecasters issued a weather warning of ice for Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of northern England today (right) ‘The first real push of milder conditions is expected into Wednesday. This is due to a westerly pattern, though behind that it is again looking cooler. ‘Temperatures generally will be around average towards the weekend, and feeling more typical for the time of year.’ James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said a huge area of cold in the Atlantic Gulf Stream, which usually drives warmer air to our shores, threatens to trigger a particularly nasty winter. ‘Without the influence of this vital heat source, we can expect a horrific winter to develop with frequent blizzards, strong winds and extremely cold conditions across many parts of the country,’ he said. However, thousands of families due to leave Britain for an Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the prospect of a green Christmas. Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 to December 13 after warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy. But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs, which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain, found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering where inches of snow would usually have fallen by now.

"A court has allowed a suspected cannibal accused of killing his wife and her two sisters and then eating their bodies to walk the streets. Convicted rapist Vasile Lavric, dubbed 'the Women Eater', argued it would ruin his car mechanic business if he were kept in jail ahead of his trial. And a court was forced to agree and release him because the bungled police investigation has already taken such a long time. Convicted rapist Vasile Lavric, dubbed 'the Women Eater' has been allowed to stay at home before his trial . He is accused of killing his wife, Nicoleta (pictured) and her two sisters and then eating their bodies . The introduction of electronic tags in Russia means people awaiting trial can now argue they deserve the right to stay at home if their case has been dragging on. But the country cannot afford the electronic tags and so police have no means to ensure Lavric keeps to his curfew. Instead police have to make occasional trips to his home in Radauti, a city in north-eastern Romania, to make sure he is in. The 60-year-old suspected cannibal was arrested in April over allegations he killed his 18-year-old wife, Nicoleta and her two sisters Iuliana and Ramona Lordache. Detectives investigating the case have confirmed that human bones had been discovered in his backyard, yet they have not managed to launch a case against him. They have even said there was evidence some of the remains had been cooked and eaten. A court was forced to release him because the bungled police investigation has already taken such a long time . Lavric married Nicoleta after his second wife died of a heart attack in 1993. Her parents allege that Lavric also had an affair with their youngest daughter, Iuliana, 18, who disappeared in 1995. The mother of the three girls, Cornelia, said: 'I saw her for the last time when she got into Vasile's van, and never saw her again after that.' Despite their suspicions, nothing happened and they say police ignored their missing person report. Her body was never found, and Lavric remained with Nicoleta. But in 1999, it was alleged he started an affair with his wife's other sister, 13-year-old Ramona. He impregnated her and she gave birth to a boy. He admits to the relationship but claims he was taken advantage of. He said: 'She was flirting with me. We had a party, we all drank vodka and beer, and when we ran out of booze my wife went to buy some more drinks. Then Ramona came to my room, took off my trousers and pushed me on the bed. I can't remember anything much after that. I was drunk.' Then, in 2005, Nicoleta disappeared. The last time she was seen was by a witness who say her climbing into his car, according to the police reports quoted in local media. When he was questioned about the disappearance, he said he last saw her when she moved out because she was jealous of his affair with her younger sister. Ramona, now aged 19, moved to Lavric's house soon after. But she also went missing two months later. Lavric was arrested in April after being accused of killing his wife and her sisters and then eating the bodies . But despite all the suspicious circumstances, the lack of a body meant the investigation over his involvement only started in April. A Romanian police insider said: 'We made a big mistake on this one, despite all the evidence it took far too long for it to be put together, and it was only when a special team was put together to investigate it that we had him. 'It's crazy that a man with this much evidence is allowed to be free but that's what happens when a case is not tackled for so long. To my mind the EU rules never considered electronic tagging in country's that did not have electronic tags.'","Vasile Lavric is accused of killing his wife and her two sisters in Romania .

"Just moments before the hostage situation at Martin Place began, police announced the arrest of two Sydney men  as part of a major counter-terrorism investigation. At least thirteen people are currently being held hostage by at least one armed gunman at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place - a major business, legal and media centre in Sydney's central business district. The Australian Federal Police apprehended a 25-year-old terror suspect in Beecroft in Sydney's leafy north-western suburbs this morning, reportedly as he was leaving a prayer hall. Seven News identified one arrested man as Ali Al Talibi but police would not confirm this information to Daily Mail Australia.

Beecroft, where this morning's raid occurred, is located in Sydney's lower north-western suburbs . In a statement early this morning, the Federal Police said the suspect was taken into custody 'as part of continuing investigations into the planning of a terrorist attack on Australian soil'. The investigation also concerned the 'facilitation of travel of Australian citizens to Syria to engage in armed combat'. Another man is understood to have already been in custody. Many shaking and sobbing witnesses have been seen pressed up against the glass windows of the cafe along with a black flag featuring white Islamic writing. Radio 2GB host Ray Hadley has reported the hostagetaker 'is telling negotiators he has got control of the city'. The Sydney Opera House was evacuated and the Prime Minister announced the National Security Committee had been convened in Canberra. Armed guards were present out the front of Parliament House in Canberra . The Lindt chocolate cafe is located in the legal and administrative centre of the Sydney CBD .

'It's a very fluid situation at the moment,' an AFP spokesman told Daily Mail Australia this morning. The AFP has cancelled plans to hold a press conference about the raids.

"Jade Burke, 14, from Glasgow, woke up to thousands of messages after the American radio station shared her video on its Facebook . A Scottish teenager who uploaded a video of herself singing Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You has become a hit in America after it was shared on Facebook by a Seattle radio station. Jade Burke, 14, from Glasgow woke up on Thursday morning to thousands of messages after her mother, Wilma Burke, let 95.7 KRJ station share the clip with their 2.5million fans. The schoolgirl, who shoots and edits all her own videos, had recorded the clip eight months ago - when she was 13 - as a practice for the Edinburgh Mela Festival. She said: 'I was a bit worried because I thought that I'd slept through my alarm but I then saw my phone was buzzing like crazy. 'It's quite a big and unexpected jump to go from just a few thousand views on my YouTube channel to over a million on Facebook in such a short space of time. 'I've posted quite a lot of videos up there but I think that one shows off the range of my voice the best. 'Mum would play a lot of Whitney Houston in the car when I was growing up and it's obvious why she's such a musical legend. 'My dream duet would be with someone like Adele or Ed Sheeran. If they ever wanted to then that would be brilliant.' Jade is keeping her feet firmly on the ground for now however as she prepares for her 4th year exams at Rosshall Academy in the Crookston area of the city. The busy teenager, who recently picked up her Duke of Edinburgh award, volunteers at a local animal A&E and says that if she doesn't make it as a singer she would like to become a vet. Jade added: 'Auditioning for a show like Britain's Got Talent is something that I'd want to do after my exams when everything is a bit quieter. 'I know how difficult it is to be successful as a musician and that's why I want to get as many qualifications as I can and I'd love to be a vet if music doesn't work out.' Her proud mother, Wilma Burke, 55, is very supportive and bought her a professional microphone and a new laptop to allow her to make videos slicker and quicker. Jade was 13 when she recorded the video of herself singing Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You . It was a practice video she recorded for the Edinburgh Mela Festival before it became an overnight sensation . She said: 'That video is actually from about 8 months ago so she was 13 at the time and the radio station approached me to see if it was ok. 'And I said it was fine not noticing just how popular their page was because we get quite a lot of requests and we usually just say ""yeah, that's fine"". 'So, that was just a practice video that she had sent to the Edinburgh Mela festival who had asked her to try singing it.' Jade, who is currently studying for her exams, records and edits all her own videos and says if she doesn't make it as a singer she would like to become a vet . The American radio station have 2,541,478 likes on their Facebook page. Their post said: 'AMAZING! She is only 13 but her voice has much POWER and SOUL to sing 'I Will Always Love You'. 'Jade you have an amazing Future.'","Jade Burke, 14, from Glasgow woke up to find she'd become hit overnight .

"Despite no solid proof of its existence ever being found, it is one of Britain’s most feared animals. But newly-unearthed records have revealed a six-month Government investigation into the Beast of Bodmin Moor proved it was far from a monster – and, rather, just a large pussycat. The probe in 1995 into the Cornish ‘beast’ and other unknown animals reported to have been roaming Britain found there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic cats loose in the UK. Scroll down for video . Previous 'sighting': In July, there was an alleged sighting of the Beast of Bodmin Moor when a teenager taking photographs in fields near his home in Cornwall spotted 'something run across the field' Feared animal: The Beast of Bodmin Moor was first ‘spotted’ in 1983, and there have since been at least 60 reported sightings - including this one . A group of experts found the 'beast' was actually a black cat about 12in (30cm) tall, after spending £84,000 in today’s money looking at photographs and videos, as well as staging reconstructions. Sheffield Hallam University journalism professor David Clarke - an expert on contemporary myths - found the findings in a file at the Public Record Office, reported The Sun journalist Paul Sims. The 'beast' was first ‘spotted’ in 1983, and there have since been at least 60 reported sightings. But the report in 1995 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food declared it a phantom. Found in 1995: A skull with large fangs and what was thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey near the moor by a boy . However the researchers also concluded that they had been unable to prove that big cats were 'not present'. But shortly after the report was published, a skull with large fangs and what was thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey near the moor by a boy aged 14. The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, central London, for verification - where it was found it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard. They also found that the cat had not died in Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. Then in 1998 a 20-second video was released and said by some experts as the best evidence yet that big cats had roamed the moor. In July, MailOnline reported a recent alleged sighting of the 'beast' when a teenager taking photographs in fields near his home in Cornwall spotted ‘something run across the field’. Henry Warren, 19, said at the time that the animal was ‘absolutely massive and was hopping up and down like a large cat - there's no way it was a fox or a dog’. Mr Warren managed to take several frames before the animal disappeared into undergrowth in the field at Gwinear, just a few miles from remote Bodmin Moor where the 'beast' is said to roam.","£84,000 probe into Cornish 'beast' 19 years ago found it was a 12in cat .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has dismissed claims of any instability within his government after it emerged MP Warren Entsch  lodged a formal complaint with chief whip Philip Ruddock. Speaking to 9 News, Tony Abbott said he refused to be drawn into 'insider gossip' regarding his members of cabinet and believes the Australian public have grown tired of government bickering. 'People are sick of insider gossip and I'm not going to indulge in any' Mr Abbott said. ‘I'm not going to be distracted by it, I'm just getting on with the job.' Scroll down for video . In the candid interview, the Prime Minister also discussed his broken promises, including the controversial decision to cut funding from the ABC. Mr Abbott explained his decision grew from the Labor Party's 'budget black hole' deficit of $30 billion. 'When circumstances change, you do have to change your position, so yes, we did break that commitment,' he said. Mr Abbott said the ABC had been flying under the budget radar for years and had entirely escaped an efficiency dividend for the past 20 years. 'We discovered, when we looked at the ABC, that unlike every other media organisation which has had to tighten it’s belt dramatically in the last few years, the ABC was basically getting more money from the government every year,' Mr Abbott said. His comments come after MP Warren Entsch hit back at the Prime Minister's claims of sexism within the Liberal party, after Mr Abbott labelled recent criticisms of his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin as motivated by gender. Queensland Liberal MP Warren Entsch has hit out against the statement, lodging a formal complaint against the Prime Minister and accusing Mr Abbott of undermining cabinet ministers . Along with longstanding Federal MP and former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, Mr Entsch lodged a formal complaint against Mr Abbott, defending concerns about Ms Credlin's level of power. 'It's not about her bloody gender for God's sake. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter if her name is    H-A-R-R-Y or  D-I-C-K,' Mr Entsch said. 'To suggest there's an issue because of gender I find offensive. He (Mr Abbott) has basically said, ""If they don't like it they are sexists"". If he thinks our legitimate concern...is trivialised to suggest we are sexist is mind-boggling,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. Statement: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has the attacks on his chief adviser Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism . 'He needs to be very careful because there's a lot of cabinet ministers who have a problem with how the Prime Minister's office is operating. It's as bad as it's ever been,' Mr Entsch said. The MP's comments follow Mr Abbott's slap down of members of his own party on Friday amid growing reports of tension between Peta Credlin - his top adviser - and coalition ministers. 'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott asked. 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': Earlier this week, that is what a Liberal frontbencher reportedly said about Ms Credlin, left, and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . Mr Abbott said on Friday that if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him, and was backed by supporters who said that unhappy ministers should confront Ms Credlin, rather than air grievances through the media. 'If they've got any balls, they would go and talk to her herself,' said junior minister Jamie Briggs, calling his colleagues 'gutless', The Age reported. Mr Entsch appears to have taken this advice to heart, lodging a formal complaint against the Prime Minister and hitting out at structural issues within the government. Ms Credlin's husband currently holds the position of Liberal Federal director, making it difficult to discuss internal problems with either figure, who have held their respective roles for the past two elections. On Sunday morning, Mr Abbott continued with his Prime Ministerial duties, visiting Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club on Sydney's north shore . Earlier in the week reports emerged that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had decided not to take any orders from Ms Credlin. 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank,' a senior Coalition source told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday. Ms Bishop told The Sunday Telegraph that she had a positive relationship with Ms Credlin, declining to comment on Mr Abbott's 'sexism' claims. Ms Bishop said that she never sought to define issues through the 'prism of gender'. The Prime Minister spoke to Surf Life Saving Australia's president Graham Ford (right) at the launch of the National Coastal Safety Report . 'Peta Credlin and I have fought battles together and will continue to do so. I have a positive and professional relationship with her,' said Ms Bishop. Mr Entsch also criticised the public display of Ms Credlin, who frequently appears in photographs with Mr Abbott, labelling it unusual behaviour. Mr Abbott's claims of sexism has already set the Twittersphere tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics over his apparent 'women problem.' Some commentators have alleged that Mr Abbott's comments were made to distract from the decline in popularity of his leadership. Colleagues:  Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin . Target: Prime Minister Julia Gillard, pictured here, rounded on Mr Abbott in her famous 'misogny' speech . Mr Abbott continued his official duties on Sunday morning, attending the launch of the National Coastal Safety report, despite admitting last week that the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way recently. The Prime Minister was still convinced of the ability of his office, however, and said that it remained a solid force. 'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances,' he said. Mr Abbott is no stranger to accusations of sexism, having been famously savaged by then Prime Minister Julia Gillard when he was Opposition Leader. 'I will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man,' Ms Gillard said of Mr Abbott's perceived attitudes to women in a speech that soon went viral. 'I shouldn't have done it, Karl': Mr Abbott later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker . Mr Abbott's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading 'Ditch the witch' and 'Julia is Bob Brown's b****' was similarly controversial. And in May, Mr Abbott was forced to apologise after he winked at ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker. Late last week, the Australian Financial Review reported that Ms Bishop 'went bananas' at Mr Abbott when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to 'chaperone' her to a climate change conference in Lima, Peru. It was claimed Trade Minister Andrew Robb was accompanying Ms Bishop to ensure Australia did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises. The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change.","Tony Abbott has dismissed rumours of any instability within government .

"The patient opens his yellow eyes wide but makes no sound as acupuncturist Edurne Cornejo pricks four fine needles into his legs. It is hard to tell whether he is surprised, as his eyes are wide at the best of times. He is an owl - and no newcomer to acupuncture therapy. Two months ago this 10in 'little owl', or Athene Noctua, hurt his back when he flew by mistake into a stovepipe at a factory in eastern Madrid. The city lies on a mountainous plateau teeming with such birds. What a hoot: A 'little owl', or Athene Noctua receives acupuncture treatment at Brinzal, an owl-rescue charity based in a park in the west of Madrid. Aerial accident: The owl hurt his back when he flew by mistake into a stovepipe at a factory in eastern Madrid . He was sent to Brinzal, an owl-rescue charity based in a park in the west of the city. Now he lies, his speckled brown and white breast puffing in and out, as the acupuncture needles stimulate key points in his nervous system. 'When he first came, he couldn't stand up. Then he started taking little steps. Now he is flying again,' says Cornejo. She has given the unnamed owl 10 weekly acupuncture sessions so far. 'It stimulates self-curing mechanisms in the organism. It does not cause side-effects' as some medicines do, she says. Acupuncturist vets recommend it in animals for muscle and joint problems - such as the owl's bad back - as well as for nerve, skin, breathing and gut complaints .

"The woman who forced the United States to criminalize police searches without a warrant has died at the age of 91. Dollree Mapp won a landmark 1961 Supreme Court case that transformed civil rights after cops barged into her Ohio apartment and used the findings to charge her with possession of porn. Her case ultimately prompted the nation's high court to rule that evidence obtained by illegal searches and seizures could not be used in state court. Defiant: Dollree Mapp's insistence that police have a warrant before searching changed civil rights in the U.S. The case, Mapp v. Ohio, is a staple of law school textbooks and considered a milestone case on the Fourth Amendment, which requires law enforcement officers to get a warrant before conducting a search. Mapp died on October 31 in Conyers, Georgia. A relative and caretaker, Carolyn Mapp, confirmed her death Wednesday and said she died on the day after her birthday at the age of 91. She made her name after trying to block officers from entering her Ohio home in 1957. There had just been a bombing at the home of Don King, who later became famous as a boxing promoter, and police believed that a person wanted for questioning was hiding in Mapp's home. The officers demanded to enter, but Mapp refused to let them in without a search warrant. More officers later arrived and police forced open a door, according to a summary of the case in the Supreme Court opinion. When the officers confronted Mapp, one held up a piece of paper, claiming it was a warrant, and Mapp snatched it away. Passed away: Mapp, who blocked officers entering her Ohio apartment in 1957, died aged 91 in Georgia . After a struggle an officer got the paper back, Mapp was handcuffed for being 'belligerent,' and officers searched her home. They didn't find the person they were looking for, but they did find some pornographic books and pictures. At the time, an Ohio law made having obscene material a crime, and Mapp was convicted, though she said the materials belonged to a former boarder. Prosecutors never produced a search warrant at trial. Ultimately, the Supreme Court overturned Mapp's conviction in a 6-3 decision, ruling in 1961 that illegally obtained evidence could not be used in state court. The court had previously ruled that this was the case in federal court, but Mapp's case extended the 'exclusionary rule' to states where the vast majority of criminal prosecutions take place, broadening the protection. Following the landmark ruling, Mapp sold real estate in New York, said Carolyn Mapp, who called her 'a force to be reckoned with.' 'A force to be reckoned with': Mapp's great niece Carolyn Mapp said Dollree, left, was a strong woman . She made news again in 1971 when she was convicted of heroin possession in New York and sentenced to 20 years to life. Her sentence was ultimately commuted. Mapp was briefly married to Cleveland heavyweight boxer Jimmy Bivins who died in 2012. Her only daughter, Barbara Bivins, died in 2002. A memorial for Mapp will be held in New York. Late in life Mapp told a professor who wrote a book about her case that she was pleased the ruling helped protect other Americans but always considered her case a personal struggle. 'Any time someone is abused by the system, they have a right to stand up for themselves,' she told Carolyn N. Long of Washington State University Vancouver. Mapp also told Long she never got back the pornographic books that touched off her case. 'I guess they're having a good time with them,' she said.","Police tried to search Dollree Mapp's apartment without warrant in 1957 .

"Online campaigners Collective Shout has released their annual 'Cross 'em off your list' candidates, revealing the retailers they claim objectified women and used sexual exploitation to sell products throughout the past year. The grassroots campaign movement is calling for shoppers to boycott the stores when purchasing gifts for Christmas, sending a clear message to the companies they allege used marketing which glorifies violence against women, rape, and pornography. The list includes retail giants Myer, Bonds, Ultra Tune, General Pants Co, American Apparel, Schick, and Priceline, some of whom Collective Shout spokesperson Melinda Liszewski said are repeat offenders. Scroll down for video . Collective Shout's 'cross 'em off your list' identifies retailers who have used sexualised images of women in marketing campaigns throughout 2014 . 'Many companies are more than wiling to engage in dialogue about how they are being ethical towards the environment, but seem disinterested in talking about how they are contributing to a toxic cultural environment,' Ms Liszewski told Daily Mail Australia. 'What we’re wanting to do is shine a spotlight on things that might seem fairly benign, so that people will begin to discuss what it is that they are really buying,' she said. 'Collective Shout has a role in bringing forward the public impact of these campaigns on women and girls, to make people more conscious and to motivate people to speak out and challenge the marketing practices of companies who exploit women for their own profits.' One of the companies Collective Shout has identified is 'repeat offender' Cafe Press, who came under fire earlier in the year for selling baby clothes with pornographic content and merchandise which activists say promote rape. The online retailer, which specialises in user-customised products and gifts, had items for sale on their website printed with the slogans, 'You Smell Like Porn,' 'F**k me like a porn star,' 'Awesome butt sex,' and 'Retired XXL porn star,' among many other similar products. 132 items were available in a category labelled 'Adult Sex XXX Porn Baby Clothing', including baby and toddler onesies, shirts, bibs, and blankets. Cafe Press came under fire earlier in the year for selling baby clothes with pornographic content and merchandise which activists say promote rape. City Beach sold explicit t-shirts during the year prompted a 'Say No to Porn' campaign against the products . City Beach was also selling belts with explicit images printed on them . The site has also been accused of promoting rape culture and trivialising sexual assault, by selling a shirt with the slogan, 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal'. 'Café Press has a long history of this kind of behaviour. Many designs are porn inspired, and despite persistent communication the company has continued on with same behaviour,' said Ms Liszewski. A spokesperson for Cafe Press released a statement which said that the company was an automated design community, and that the user-designed products varied in topic, taste and opinion. 'At times, users may upload designs that others find distasteful or offensive. It has been recently brought to our attention certain content on our site that may be considered offensive,' the statement said. 'We have taken action to extensively remove the offensive content and will to continue to review for other designs that do not meet our content usage policy.' Recently added to the list is retailer Big W, which Collective Shout has condemned for continuing to sell the controversial Grand Theft Auto V, which depicts women being brutally murdered as part of the game. Fresh Boost, a coffee retailer, was added to the list for their explicit marketing campaign which depicted a woman on her knees and a man with his pants around his ankles in an 'implied depiction of oral sex', which Ms Liszewski said has no relevance to the product Fresh Boost was selling . 'Even Bonds 'Boobs' campaign, which is supposedly celebrating body diversity, is placing an emphasis on women's bodies and saying that we are defined by our body parts,' said Ms Liszewski . Big W came under fire earlier in the year for selling this girls shirt with a sexualised slogan on the front . 'Big W chose profits over ethics, despite the fact that K-mart and Target pulled the game after being contacted by hundreds of campaigners against violence,' said Ms Liszewki. 'The retailer also sold shirts for girls with sexual slogans on them, flouting their corporate responsibility.' Fresh Boost, a coffee retailer, was added to the list for their explicit marketing campaign which depicted a naked woman with her legs spread, with the view obscured only by the company's logo. The company also released an ad which showed a woman on her knees and a man with his pants around his ankles in an 'implied depiction of oral sex', which Ms Liszewski said has no relevance to the product Fresh Boost was selling. The other 11 stores have all used sexual exploitation of women and girls to sell products, claim Collective Shout, including Priceline, Bra's 'n Things, and Adairs, who sell the Playboy lingerie range. 'Any retailer that is selling the Playboy brand is actually supporting a corporation which exploits teenage girls,' said Ms Liszewki. 'The Playboy company was failing until it began licensing merchandise, which now props up one of the main brands in the porn industry that own not only the magazine but hardcore pornography companies,' she said. Collective Shout is campaigning against the use of outdoor advertisements for sexually explicit marketing campaigns . 'The bunny logo is cute and teenage girls will look at the nice underwear and won't understand what the symbol actually means, and it's sinister because older men will.' 'Even Bonds 'Boobs' campaign, which is supposedly celebrating body diversity, is placing an emphasis on women's bodies and saying that we are defined by our body parts.' Collective Shout is campaigning against the use of outdoor advertisements for sexually explicit marketing campaigns and ads that knowingly target the youth demographic without considering the impact these might have. 'How obviously wrong is it for City Beach to sell a pencil case with a naked woman on it, or for Ultra Tune to use references to BDSM to sell tyres?' Ms Liszewski asked. A recent study released by Flinders University has shown figures which indicate that girls from the ages of 8-10 are becoming increasingly preoccupied with their body image, a statistic which Ms Liszewski said shows that ads such as this are encouraging younger and younger women to see themselves as objects to be valued on appearance. 'In older girls, these issues lead to body image problems, anxiety, eating disorders, depression and poor academic performance,' she said. 'Sexualisation is a toxic culture and it is actually making girls sick. If we want a society where sexual harassment isn't a problem then we need to start tackling the culture of objectification.'

"It's been a difficult year for Joe Hockey and it's not about to get any easier. The treasurer is expected to reveal revenue has taken a further hit of $6.2 billion in just over six months as he explains  why his federal budget has deteriorated more than forecast at the time of its release in May. Mr Hockey, who will deliver his midyear economic update on Monday, has promised he won't be making any significant budget cuts amid reports of a forecast of $379.5 billion in receipts following a figure of $385.7 billion in May. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey is expected to reveal revenue has taken a further hit of $6.2 billion in just over six months as he explains why his federal budget has deteriorated more than forecast at the time of its release in May . The outlook will point to tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue over the next four years as a result of falling commodity prices, according to Fairfax Media. The Australian reports deficits over the period will almost double to $100 billion, signalling little hope of economic improvement without unpopular reforms to taxes and spending. Mr Hockey warned on Sunday of job losses and an end to Australia's prosperity ahead of the update, with plummeting iron ore prices the chief cause. Prices have dropped to $60 a tonne - halving in a year - with the resultant fall in the terms of trade the largest since records were first kept in 1959. 'If we don't use the budget as a shock absorber for this extraordinary fall in the terms of trade, then Australians will lose jobs and we will lose our prosperity,' Mr Hockey said. Mr Hockey, pictured here with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, warned on Sunday of job losses and an end to Australia's prosperity ahead of the update, with plummeting iron ore prices the chief cause . Falling income tax revenues from rising unemployment and weak commodity prices are to blame for the huge dent in the government's finances. There's also been some slippage in budget savings, including concessions to get the abolition of the mining tax through the Senate and tinkering with yet-to-be-legislated measures in a bid to make them more palatable. The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook will contain Treasury's latest economic forecasts. They come at a time when a growing number of economists are tipping interest rate cuts in 2015. Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan is expecting two cuts to the Reserve Bank's cash rate, already at a record low. 'There is no doubt that growth is very uneven at the moment,' he says. Mr Hockey, who will deliver his midyear economic update on Monday, has promised he won't be making any significant budget cuts . The recent national accounts showed a sombre economy running below three per cent and putting upward pressure on the unemployment rate. The jobless rate struck a 12-year high of 6.3 per cent in November, above Treasury's forecast of 6.25 per cent for mid-2015. National Australia Bank economists now expect the rate to peak at 6.75 per cent. On the up side, inflation is expected to remain benign thanks in part to the government's scrapping of the carbon tax, which has triggered a fall in electricity prices. Deficits over the period will almost double to $100 billion, signalling little hope of economic improvement without unpopular reforms to taxes and spending . Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told ABC radio that despite Labor attacking the government for being too pessimistic in its forecasts, 'it turns out we weren't aggressive enough in downgrading the revenue assumptions that we inherited'. He confirmed the government wasn't going to chase the fall in revenue. The ABC reported the foreign aid program would be slashed in Monday's budget update.","Joe Hockey is expected to reveal revenue has taken a further hit of $6.2 billion in just over six months .
The treasurer will deliver his midyear economic update on Monday as he explains why his budget has deteriorated more than forecast .
The outlook will point to tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue over the next four years as a result of falling commodity prices ."
"Hundreds of people have braved snowy weather and blustery conditions to recreate one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of the Second World War. American and Belgian nationals gathered in the Ardennes region of Belgium yesterday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, one of the U.S. Army's bloodiest encounters with Nazi forces. People young and old donned period U.S. Army uniforms for the re-enactment of the battle, which was fought for nearly six weeks from December 16, 1944. Hundreds of people gathered in the Ardennes region of Belgium yesterday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge 1944 . The battle was one of the U.S. Army's bloodiest encounters with Nazi force and one of the greatest tank battles in American military history . People young and old donned army uniforms for the re-enactment, which saw people act alongside tanks including this German Jagpanther . A U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer was also used for the 70th anniversary commemoration, which went ahead despite the snowy conditions . The re-enactment was put on to remember more than 100,000 casualties who died or were wounded in the Ardennes counter-offensive . Military vehicles were also used for the re-enactment of one of the greatest tank battles in military history, including a German Jagpanther tank destroyer and a U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer. Jean-Claude Klepper, 62, of Virton, Belgium, and his 15-year-old daughter Aurelie, dressed up like Second World War soldiers to mark the occasion. Mr Klepper told Associated Press: 'We must never forget what happened in 1944. Many American soldiers came here to defend Europe. We must honour them for what they did.' Stephen Sams, 41, a U.S. soldier based in Germany, said for him the battle waged in the dense forests and narrow valleys of Belgium and neighbouring Luxembourg epitomised 'the unwillingness of American forces to give up in the face of adversity.' Starting on December 16, 1944, more than 600,000 American soldiers, fighting in freezing conditions, took part in desperate efforts to contain, then throw back, a surprise German counter-offensive masterminded by Adolf Hitler. Starting on December 16, 1944, more than 600,000 American soldiers, fighting in freezing conditions, took part in the Second World War battle . Total Allied casualties of the battle are estimated at 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War . In total, there were 80,987 U.S. casualties, including 10,276 who died, 47,493 who were wounded and 23,218 who went missing during the battle . The total number of German casualties is estimated at 81,834 people, including 12,652 who died and 30,582 who were reported missing . The re-enactment and commemorations (pictured) paid tribute to the American divisions which tirelessly defended the 70-mile stretch of woodland in the 1944 battle, known for having been fought under thick, cold mist. Military uniforms, weapons and tanks were all used . In the final months of 1944 and keen to take control of the crucial port of Antwerp, Hitler launched one of the Nazis' bloodiest offensives on the West. Taking U.S. forces by surprise, tens of thousands of German troops descended on Ardennes - a heavily forested region stretching through Luxembourg and Belgium. Thick winter fog plagued the Allied forces' efforts to destroy German strongholds, and with Nazi troops donning U.S. Army uniforms to sabotage communications between divisions by snapping phone lines, victory was unlikely. However, after depleting the German's armored tanks and resources, Western Allied forces triumphed. Total Allied casualties are estimated at 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War. At the time, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill hailed the ultimate result as 'an ever-famous American victory.' But it came at a high cost, with the total number of Allied casualties estimated to be 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War. In total, there were 80,987 U.S. casualties, including 10,276 who died, 47,493 who were wounded and 23,218 who went missing, according to the U.S. Army's official history. The total number of German casualties is estimated at 81,834 people, including 12,652 who died and 30,582 who were reported missing. After the battle ended on January 25, 1945, Allied forces attacked Germany in unison, eventually leading to the Nazi surrender and the end of Second World War in Europe. In the town of Bastogne, where soldiers of the 101th airborne held out despite being cut off and surrounded, shops and windows were decorated yesterday with American and Belgian flags. One local restaurant displayed a drawing of an American flag and the message 'thank you.' The country's King Philippe and his wife, Queen Mathilde, threw nuts into crowds of revellers as veterans were pushed in wheelchairs through the streets of the southern Belgium province. The commemorations paid tribute to the American divisions which tirelessly defended the 70-mile stretch of woodland in the 1944 battle, known for having been fought under thick, cold mist. Dressed in black, the Belgian royal family braved blizzards and freezing temperatures to lay wreaths at the McAuliffe monument in Bastogne, named after the American general who spearheaded the ferocious defence. King Philippe also greeted veterans who took part in the courageous battle who had travelled to Bastogne for the festivities.

"Protesters were arrested as they took part in a demonstration about paying cleaners the living wage at a flagship John Lewis store. Police were called after a group of chanting protesters descended on the Oxford Street store in London, amid dozens of customers doing their Christmas shopping on one of the busiest weekends of the year. At least one protester was bundled to the floor as officers tried to contain demonstrators and get them to leave the busy shop. Scroll down for video . Protesters were arrested in John Lewis in Oxford Street in London on Saturday after they staged a protest calling for the firm to pay cleaners the living wage and give them the same benefits as other John Lewis staff . The protest was part of a campaign by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to protest against cleaners at the John Lewis partnership, who are employed by an external contractor and are not paid the the living wage. They also want cleaners to be included in the partnership's annual bonus scheme and given the same rights as other workers in the building. However the partnership said they believed in fair pay but could not enforce pay levels well abover market rates on the contractors they use. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said a number of protesters were arrested for 'breach of the peace' on Saturday afternoon and taken to a police station in central London. However officers are yet to confirm how many in total were held. Police were called to the store in Oxford Street at about 2.30pm on Saturday after protesters gathered on the fifth floor and in the basement gift section. One shopper, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's bad enough shopping in Oxford Street two Saturdays before Christmas without a load of idiots coming between you and the kitchenware section. A number of protesters were arrested during the demonstration at the department store in Oxford Street . 'It was absolutely packed in there and so when they started shouting I think the staff panicked a bit and then before we knew it there a load of police officers descended on the place. 'They were trying to get them to leave but the protesters were having none of it. 'A couple of them got bundled up the escalators by the police and at least one was on the floor. 'You could just see his legs sticking out from behind a board games display. 'I felt a bit sorry for the staff as they looked really stressed out.' At least one campaigner was bundled to the floor on Saturday as police tried to contain the protesters . Customers said they saw about 10 police officers at the shop on Saturday afternoon after the protest started . People in London posted messages on Twitter about the protest at John Lewis, which took place on Saturday . A member of staff, who also did not want to be named, said: 'They are protesting about the cleaners. 'Apparently the cleaners are employed by an outside company and don’t get the living wage and aren’t partners like the rest of us. 'The bosses are obviously panicking about it. There are loads of senior people here, the head of branch is down here, so it must be pretty serious. 'It is probably the most exciting thing that has ever happened at John Lewis.' John Lewis Partnership is owned by a trust on behalf of all its employees, who are known as partners. It runs the John Lewis department stores as well as Waitrose supermarkets. Partners have a say in how the company is run, as well as a share of the annual profits through a bonus scheme. It is one of the largest private companies in the UK. This year partners received a bonus of 15 per cent of their annual salary- equivalent to almost eight weeks' pay. John Lewis Partnership employs around 90,000 people. Cleaners are employed by an external contractor but IWGB Union wants them to receive the same benefits as John Lewis partnership staff. Some demonstrators were seen hanging banners over the railings which said: 'Justice for the Cleaners' and going down the escalators blowing horns. Campaigners were seen holding boards which said: 'John Lewis your customers say pay your cleaners the living wage.' Customers at the store posted messages on Twitter on Saturday. Jo described the demonstration as 'very loud' and added: Not sure they are winning over many fans, my son is distraught.' A spokeswoman for the John Lewis Partnership said they shared the living wage campaign’s objectives but achieved this through different means. She said: 'Our policy is to pay the market rate for a job and as much above that as can be justified by performance. 'In relation to cleaning, with a few historical exceptions, the majority of cleaners who work in our branches are, as with almost every organisation, contractors. Most work for more than one employer, often on the same day. Like all retailers, we work with many different contractors of various kinds throughout our supply chain. We could not operate effectively if all our contractors were partners. 'We take our responsibilities to all our suppliers and contractors very seriously. We expect them to uphold good employment standards. However, we don’t believe it’s right for us to insist our suppliers or managing agents adopt pay policies that are different to our own by setting base pay levels well above the market rate.' IWGB has targeted a number of large firms in recent weeks, calling for cleaners to be paid the living wage, calculated according to the general cost of living. They say workers should be paid at least £7.85 an hour or £9.15 an hour in London. More than 124,000 people have already signed an online petition calling for the board at John Lewis to pay cleaners the minimum wage and include them in the company's annual bonus scheme.","Protesters staged a demonstration in John Lewis in Oxford Street, London .

"Australian babies struggle with their native lingo and find it easier to understand Canadians, a new university study shows. Boffins from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) conducted research on 48 Australian babies of 15-months-old and were astonished to discover they can't distinguish certain vowels. Yet when they heard the same words  in a Canadian accent they found them easier to understand. 'Tie me kangaroo down?' Australian babies are baffled by the accent and find Canadians easier to understand . Associate Professor Paola Escudero, who led the research with the university's Dr Karen Mulak, says: 'Young infants are more likely to understand words spoken in their native languages. 'We wanted to find out what accent they would be most comfortable when learning the words. 'But surprisingly our study found the normal home-ground advantage doesn't always apply for babies exposed to Australian English.' Researchers from the University of Western Sydney split 48 babies into two groups to teach them words . Australian English is easily recognised by its distinctive vowel sounds and rising inflection so to test the tots researchers divided them into two groups. One half of the group listened to Australian English and the other 24 Canadian English. 'We tried to see whether children had more difficulties if they heard words spoken in one accent as opposed to another accent in English,' adds Professor Escudero. The babies in each group were shown an object, and heard the name for the object repeated over and over, spoken by a speaker of Australian English or Canadian English . The babies in each group were shown an object, and heard the name for that object repeated over and over, spoken by a speaker of Australian English or Canadian English. They were also taught a made-up word, 'deet' and showed picture associations for easy recognition. Shortly afterwards they were then tested again to see if they noticed when the sound  changed to 'dit' and 'doot' and the babies listening to the Australian speaker didn't notice the vowel changes. But the infants listening to the Canadian English speaker picked up the change in the word. Researcher Dr Mulak, from the Univerity's MARCS Institute, says that by the age of 15 months babies' brains understand sounds, and picking up new words and the new vowels can be confusing. Researcher Dr Karen Mulak from the UWS MARCS Institute says that by the age of 15 months babies' brains understand sounds, are picking up new words and the new vowels can be confusing . 'Some Australian English vowels, such as the ones in ""sheep,"" ""ship"" and ""shoot"" are very close to one another,' adds  Professor Escudero. 'As opposed to the same Canadian English vowels which are more distinct. We now know these Australian English vowel differences are not easy to learn.' Mothers instinctively emphasize the different vowels when they talk to their babies and Professor Escudero says the research can help with teaching the language to immigrants. Surprisingly the babies understood the Canadian accent better than the same words said in Australian . 'The Australian accent may make it a little harder for Australian infants to master some vowels,' she says, 'but it doesn't make a difference in the long run. 'For adult migrants to Australia who are just starting to pick up the language, they may take a bit longer to master Australian English.' The researchers are now going to re-create the study with Canadian babies to see which accent they understand better, and they're also going to test older infants. Mothers instinctively emphasize the different vowels when they talk to  their babies and Professor Escudero says the research can help with teaching the language to immigrants .","University study finds Aussie babies prefer Canadian accents .

"Celebrities, civil rights campaigners and politicians today called for Barack Obama to secure the release of a father from London who has spent 13 years languishing in Guantanamo Bay without trial. Their plea, in a letter to the Daily Mail, urges the Prime Minister to ‘pick up the phone to President Obama, and bring Shaker Aamer home’. The letter comes days after the Mail exposed how the British resident – who has a British wife and four children – has been held without being tried for more than a decade in the notorious Cuban jail. Scroll down for video . 13 years without trial: Shaker Aamer, pictured with two of his four children, who live in Britain, has been held in Guantanamo Bay since he was captured in 2001 despite being cleared for release from the Cuba base twice . It will add to pressure on the Government to step up its efforts in the case and secure Mr Aamer’s return to this country. Organised by the We Stand With Shaker campaign, the letter has been signed by MPs from across the political spectrum, including former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis, Lib Dem MP and former Home Office minister Norman Baker, and Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn. Celebrity backers include Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, TV presenter Janet Ellis and her singer daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the actress Juliet Stevenson. It is also signed by journalist and author Peter Oborne, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, and novelist Gillian Slovo as well as prominent human rights campaigners including the Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti. Appalled: Supporters of his release include the actress Juliet Stevenson (left) and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters . They say Mr Aamer’s continued detention without charge or trial is ‘in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned that was enshrined in Magna Carta’. Calling on the PM to address the case ‘urgently’, they say the Briton’s ongoing imprisonment is ‘all the more shocking’ because he has twice been approved for release by the US government. Journalist Jemima Khan is involved in the campaign . They refer to a letter Mr Cameron sent to Mr Aamer’s daughter Johina last June, in which he said the decision regarding release was ‘ultimately in the hands of the US Government’. Their letter also refers to ‘rumours’ that the US would like to send Mr Aamer back to Saudi Arabia, where he was born, claiming this would leave him ‘unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment’. It adds: ‘What the US would like to do with Mr Aamer is irrelevant, as the British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident. ‘We can find no reason why, given the special relationship between our two countries, the PM cannot call President Obama and tell him that Mr Aamer must be returned to the UK as swiftly as possible.We urge Mr Cameron to pick up the phone to President Obama, and to bring Shaker Aamer home.’ Mr Aamer’s case was given new prominence following the release of a US Senate report into how the CIA tortured terror suspects. According to his family, who live in Battersea, South London, the 46-year-old is desperate to stand trial over claims that he is a terrorist with close links to Osama Bin Laden. His lawyers say he is being held at the US base because intelligence officials fear he could expose more evidence of torture in the presence of British intelligence officers. Signatories: Singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor (left) and comedian Frankie Boyle (right) are among the big names . Last week, Downing Street insisted that the UK continued to press the case at the ‘highest levels’ – diplomatic code for the White House . A spokesman for Mr Cameron said the Government was pushing for Mr Aamer’s release ‘as a matter of urgency’. She said: ‘We will keep pressing it. It is our objective to get him back to the UK. That decision is in the hands of the US government.’ Mr Aamer has twice been cleared for release, originally in 2007, but his detention has been extended again and again because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, rather than home to Britain. Torture: A US senate report last week laid bare the full, horrifying extent of detainees' treatment at the base . He was detained in Kabul, in 2001. His representatives claim he had travelled to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity. They say he was captured by bounty hunters and eventually handed to US forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base, near Kabul. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains with about 130 prisoners. The Prime Minister MUST make Obama free this Londoner: Read the campaign letter in full . As we approach 2015, the 800th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta, which introduced habeas corpus to the world, we call on David Cameron to urgently address the case of Shaker Aamer, a legal British resident with a British wife and four British children. He continues to be imprisoned without charge or trial in the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned which was enshrined in Magna Carta. Mr Aamer’s ongoing imprisonment is all the more shocking because he has been approved for release by the U.S. on two occasions — by a military review board under President George W. Bush in 2007 and by a high-level, inter-agency task force under President Obama in 2009. The British Government has been requesting his return since 2007, and we received assurances from Mr Cameron in June 2013 that he had raised Mr Aamer’s case with President Obama. Torture at Guantanamo including waterboarding and rectal feeding was dubbed 'brutal and ineffective' In a letter to Mr Aamer’s daughter, Johina, last June, the PM wrote: ‘Despite efforts to secure his release, it remains the case that he has been cleared for transfer but not for release.’ He added: ‘It also remains the case that any decision regarding your father’s release remains ultimately in the hands of the U.S. government.’ Does Mr Cameron’s comment to Mr Aamer’s daughter about being cleared for transfer refer to rumours that the U.S. government would like to send Mr Aamer, a Londoner, back to Saudi Arabia, the country of his birth? This would, no doubt, be convenient for the U.S., as from there Mr Aamer would be unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment. However, what the U.S. would like to do with Mr Aamer is irrelevant, as the British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident. We can find no reason why, given the special relationship between our two countries, the Prime Minister cannot call President Obama and tell him that Mr Aamer must be returned to the UK as swiftly as possible. We urge Mr Cameron to pick up the phone to President Obama, and to bring Shaker Aamer home. Support: Actor Mark Rylance is a signatory .

"The Ukip official charged with vetting the party’s election candidates has revealed he spends half his time ‘weeding out the lunatics’. David Soutter told Ukip activists he was not able to spend enough time finding good new candidates – because he was too busy getting rid of people ‘who shouldn’t be there’. The remarks come after one Ukip candidate  was recorded making homophobic, racist and obscene comments - while another was exposed as a fantasist after becoming embroiled in a public sex scandal. Nigel Farage is battling to contain a series of scandals which have hit Ukip over the past week . Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn played down the revelations - claiming they were 'hand grenades rolling down the corridor' In recorded comments passed to the Sunday Times, Mr Souter said the party needed to become more disciplined, . He said: ‘One of the things that Ukip has lacked as a party — and looking at it the way I’ve been able to from the outside — discipline is one of the things that’s really been missing. ‘Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn’t be there.’ Mr Soutter had even resorted to ‘doing tests to make sure people were vaguely sane and that they could string their words together more or less’, Ukip's Scottish MEP David Coburn said. Mr Souter’s role vetting party candidates was thrown into the spotlight last week over his failure to spot a series of glaring errors on the CV of leading Ukip candidate Natasha Bolter. Ms Bolter was introduced to the Ukip party conference as a Labour defector, who taught at a local comprehensive school and had a degree from Oxford University. But after she accused the party’s general secretary Roger Bird of sexual harassment it emerged that she never attended Oxford – and may not have been a teacher. Doubts were first raised about her account after a series of affectionate text messages she sent to Mr Bird were published. Kerry Smith (centre) was recorded making a series of astonishing comments including a baseless claim Nigel Farage had accepted 'a nice fat envelope' for promoting a Ukip ally . In a shock announcement on Monday evening, Ukip announced Mr Bird had been suspended while it investigated allegations of 'impropriety'. On Tuesday Mrs Bolter gave an interview claiming to have been the victim of sexual harassment. But Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’ The scandal came after a series of tape-recorded phone calls were leaked to The Mail on Sunday, showing party candidate Kerry Smith, chosen to fight Ukip target seat of Basildon South in Essex making a series of offensive remarks. In the tape he mocks ‘f***ing disgusting old pooftahs’ who belong to a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning group, calling them ‘BLTs’ – bacon, lettuce and tomato. He also jokes about ‘shooting peasants’ and refers to a woman with a Chinese name as a ‘Chinky.’ But Mr Farage last night refused to sack Mr Smith. A well-placed Ukip official said: ‘Kerry wants to make a full apology and is hoping it all blows over.’ Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn today defended Mr Smith - claiming he had been drugs at the time. He said: “This was a phone call sometime ago while he was on sedatives by his own account, not really speaking, thinking rationally. He was on prescription sedatives after suffering an injury.' But he said: 'Using derogatory terminology, this slang, is not right at this level of politics and you shouldn’t do it.' 'Clearly what he said there is unacceptable. He’s apologised unreservedly, there are big mitigating circumstances, it’s from some time ago, and we’re willing now to judge him on his performance going forward from this.' Ukip game to rate 'blacks' and Muslims to win £100... or golf umbrella: Farage in another race row over 'rate on immigrant' survey . The Ukip leader has found himself embroiled in another row over race . Nigel Farage was in another race row last night after asking supporters to rate ‘blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans’ in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. The ‘rate an immigrant’ survey is part of a Ukip private survey of members aimed at helping the party draw up its policies. Sent last week by Ukip chairman Steve Crowther, it asks members to say ‘how close they feel’ to a number of groups. They include ‘Blacks, Asians, Muslims, English, Eastern Europeans and Whites’ as well as the four main political parties. Ukip activists are urged to rate each on a scale from 0 for ‘not close at all’ to 10 for ‘very close.’ But the survey was slammed as a racist stunt after details were leaked to The Mail on Sunday. Last night, senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge condemned the Ukip survey as ‘shocking’. Mrs Hodge, who won a campaign against the BNP in her Barking constituency in east London, said: ‘This openly brings race into politics. It’s shameful, it’s shocking and it’s offensive. 'It lifts the lid on the unacceptable face of Ukip.’ The survey comes after a series of claims of racism involving Ukip, although Farage has insisted ‘stupid or offensive’ comments by a handful of candidates ‘never have and never will’ represent the views of his party. The email to thousands of Ukip members from chairman Crowther is headed: ‘Help the Party and Win Prizes!’ It declares: ‘Ukip is growing quickly. We want to strengthen our party by understanding our rapidly growing membership. We are asking all our members to complete a new survey.’ The aim was to ‘use the insights to strengthen the Ukip operation… Your responses will be invaluable in making sure we fulfil our promises over the coming years – and in government! ‘So please, do complete the survey. It should be fun! You might even win some prizes!’ Prizes included ‘one prize of £100, two of £50, three prizes of a Ukip golf umbrella, four prizes of £25, five Ukip notebooks and six Ukip pocket diaries.’ Other Ukip race rows include: . A Ukip spokesman denied the survey was racist, claiming every major employer carried out similar research of their staff.","David Soutter said he did not have time to find good new candidates .

"A Sydney woman is preparing to face court in Kuala Lumpur where her lawyers say she was caught unknowingly carrying drugs. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 51, will on Friday face charges of carrying 1.5kg of crystal meth into Malaysia, and a mandatory death sentence if she's convicted. Her lawyers say the mum from suburban southwest Sydney is a 'naive and innocent mule' who was deceived. Lawyer Tania Scivetti said her client had not yet come to terms with how grave her predicament is. 'I don't think it has really hit her yet,' she told AAP ahead of the appearance. Scroll down for video . Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, centre, escorted by the police as she leaves the lawyer's room after meeting her legal team at the magistrate court in Sepang, Malaysia on Wednesday . Exposto was intercepted while transiting through Kuala Lumpur airport on December 7. She mistakenly followed the other passengers off her flight from Shanghai and had to return back through customs and immigration to join her planned flight to Melbourne. There, say customs authorities, she volunteered her bag for scanning. The ice, worth the equivalent of $A100,000, was found in a stitched secret compartment. A relative of Mrs Exposto revealed the family's shock at hearing the news she had been arrested. Joao Noronha said the grandmother is his wife's auntie, and he and his family lived in her Cabramatta West home, in Sydney's south-west, in  for a year with their children. Mr Noronha refuses to believe Mrs Exposto willingly smuggled any drugs, echoing her lawyer's sentiments that she had fallen into a trap or been otherwise misled. 'It's not like her, the Maria that we have known for more than 20 years is not a drug user and not a drug dealer,' he told Daily Mail Australia from his home in Dili, East Timor earlier this month. She was travelling on Malaysian Airlines flight 387 when she was arrested last week at Kuala Lumpur airport . Exposto is accused of having 1.5kg of the drug ice in a backpack, an offence that could see her hanged . Exposto smiles after leaving her lawyer's room at Magistrate Court  in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur on Friday . 'I believe that my auntie is just a victim in this case. 'I believe that she does not even know types of drugs at this time like the 'ice',' he continued adding that he had never heard of the methamphetamine either. Mrs Exposto has a 'nice, quiet' husband and four sons, who Mr Noronha described as 'good boys'. He described her as 'easy going, very friendly' and someone with many friends who enjoys making jokes. The grandmother-of-two stays with Mr Noronha and his wife Ladhy in their East Timor home when she comes to visit, and is very close to their family. 'Maria is very close to us in Timor, every time she comes to Timor she lives with us.' Exposto, 51, (C) sits in the lawyer's room in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur on Friday . The family of Exposto said they don't believe she knowingly tried to smuggle drugs out of Malaysia . On the reports that Mrs Exposto was carrying documents for another man,  her nephew said he knew nothing of that. 'I know nothing about that honestly, and I was surprised that I read the news.' Mr Noronha reinforced that the woman he knows so well had nothing to do with what she was accused of. 'We worry about the news, we worry about the laws and law enforcement in Malaysia especially in relation to drugs,' he said. 'It makes us worry so much about her, we can only pray and we believe that Maria is not that Maria.' The woman, from Cabramatta in Sydney's west, told her lawyers she was not guilty and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Defence lawyer Muhammed Shafee Abdullah said Ms Pinto had been 'used by unscrupulous people' and would likely be able to prove she was not guilty of the charge. Mr Noronha also said he doesn't think the grandmother even knows what the methamphetamine 'ice' is . The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers that she was innocent and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs . 'There is a very strong chance that she is one of those naive and innocent mules that has been used by some unscrupulous people,' he told reporters at the court. After her appearance at a Kuala Lumpur court earlier this month, Mr Shafee told reporters Ms Pinto was told by the soldier that he needed documents inside the bag to be taken to Melbourne in order to organise his discharge. Ms Exposto's children said they have been concerned about their mother. 'We all love our mum,' the family told the Nine Network. 'We are all worried for her and all praying for the best.' The mother - who could face the death penalty - was told she would then hand over the bag to another person at Melbourne airport. But before Ms Pinto was able to board the next leg of her flight, she was stopped by airport customs while she was en route to the Victorian capital from Shanghai. Customs director Chik Omar Chik Lim said the Liverpool woman was about to board about 5pm when the scanner picked up the methamphetamines 'wrapped in plastic and stashed inside a secret compartment in her travel bag'. She was then questioned by police about the drugs that were detected, which are worth $93,000 in Malaysia. Since 1960, more than 440 people have been hanged in the south-east Asian country. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto was taken into custody before she was about boarded a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport (above) in Malaysia . The mother, 51, said she was carrying the bag on behalf of a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan who told her she was going to pass it on to someone at Melbourne airport (above) Hanging is inevitable for people who are found guilty of smuggling more than 50 grams of methamphetamines. The arrest follows the release of 22-year-old Australian Kalynda Davis who was arrested in China on drug smuggling charges earlier in December. Ms Davis faced execution by firing squad along with New Zealander Peter Gardner for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Australia from China. While Miss Davis returned home to Sydney earlier this week, Mr Gardner remains in Chinese custody.

"Britain's most expensive one-bedroom home has gone on the market for a staggering £1.8 million despite boasting just 726 sq ft of space. The cosy Mayfair mews house is in a 'descreet' central London address about a minute from where a house 25 times larger sold for almost £50million earlier this year. It has an open plan kitchen / living room with a balcony measuring 17ft by 14ft on the first floor and a study and guest cloakroom on the ground floor.

The bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the top floor of the home in Red Lion Yard is 18ft by 14ft. The three-storey home is ten times the average price paid for a home in England and Wales and more the price normally paid for a mansion in upmarket Clifton, Bristol. It is also the most expensive one-bedroom house currently listed on Rightmove. Susan Cohen, head of sales and lettings at Pastor Real Estate, said: 'This is a unique opportunity to own the smallest mews house currently on the market in Mayfair. The bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the top floor of the home in Red Lion Yard is 18ft by 14ft . The study and guest cloakroom on the ground floor of the three-storey house measures 17ft by 8ft . 'The property has been finished to an excellent standard and is spread over three floors, providing well-proportioned rooms which have been designed to maximise space. 'The freehold property is situated in a charming quiet cobbled street in the heart of Mayfair, making it ideal for those looking for a quirky pied-a-terre.' The tiny pad is located just behind The Red Lion, a converted pub which was on the market for £25million. According to LonRes, which tracks the London property market, the smallest mews house ever sold in the area was a two-bed with just 600 sq/ft. It was sold for £490,000 in 2004.

For the same price outside of London the buyer could have anything from a seven-bedroom country manor to an entire terraced street in West Yorkshire. The freehold for Scandinavia Terrace in Cleckheaton town centre, near Bradford, includes a shop, 24 houses and lapsed planning permission for eight more. It is on sale for £1.8million and estate agents claim it could reel in £110,000 a year in rent for a canny owner. Buyers more in search of country luxury could buy Aylesby Hall in Lincolnshire, which is currently on the market for £1.75million. It has seven bedrooms, 12 acres of walled gardens and parkland and a vintage-style drawing room, home cinema, triple garage, office suite, pond, wood, 'party barn' and five ovens in the kitchen. Or for £1.85million they could have Perryston House, an eight-bedroom home on Ayrshire's 'golf coast' which has been described as 'one of the finest art deco houses in Scotland' - though admittedly, it's a slightly longer walk to the shops.

"As images of the terrifying hostage crisis in a cafe in central Sydney were broadcast around the nation, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the government does not know the gunman's motivations and urged Australians to go about their lives as usual. At least thirteen people - possibly more - are being held hostage in the Lindt  cafe in Martin Place, in central Sydney, with shocked and sobbing victims seen holding an Islamic flag against the windows of the popular chocolate store. As heavily armed police swarmed the streets, buildings went into lock-down across the CBD and even the city's iconic Opera House was evacuated, Mr Abbott urged Australians to go about their lives as usual. 'The whole point is to scare people out of being themselves': Prime Minister Tony Abbott has called on Australians to continue to go about their usual lives . Terror in Martin Place: Armed AFP and NSW police officers have taken to the streets with heavy assault weaponry . City in lockdown: A woman, pictured, was assisted as thousands of people were evacuated from their offices in Martin Place, in the city's centre, and the surrounding area . Fearful workers: Lindt chocolate staff were pictured pinned against the window of their store, holding up an Islamic flag . Crisis: There have been varying reports about the number of hostages being held by the armed gunman . 'We don't yet know the motivation of the perpetrator,' he said. 'We don't know if the motivation is politically motivated although obviously there are some signs it could be.' 'The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,' he said. Mr Abbott continued: 'Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society. 'Nothing should ever change that and that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual. The Prime Minister said the National Security Committee - which includes the Foreign Minister, Treasurer and Attorney-General - has today met in Canberra. He revealed he has been constantly briefed by with Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin, New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione and the state premier, Mike Baird. Map: The Lindt chocolate cafe is located in Martin Place - the city's legal, business and media heart . Guns: The hostage crisis began when a woman made a report to police around 9:40am this morning . Thousands evacuated: As many as a dozen workers and customers at the Lindt cafe are being held prisoner . But while the crisis will make many Australians fearful, Mr Abbott said everyone should keep their thoughts and prayers of the victims of the crisis. 'This is a very disturbing incident and I can understand the concerns and anxiety of the Australian people at a time like this. 'Our thoughts and prayers must go out to the individuals in this,' he said. 'I can think of almost nothing more distressing and terrifying than to be caught up in this situation.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today said he had offered Mr Abbott his full support. He said: 'Australians can be assured that we are one when it comes to keeping Australians safe.' The government will this afternoon go ahead with the release of its MYEFO (Mid Year Economic Forecast and Outlook) report.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott urges Australians to go about their normal lives .

"It earned its place in history as the site where Churchill helped mastermind Britain's victory over Hitler. But now the former War Office, which boasts more than 1,000 rooms, has been sold and could become a luxury hotel. The iconic building, in Whitehall, London, contains a wealth of history, having been a key site during both world wars and home to secretaries of state including Lord Haldane, Lord Kitchener and David Lloyd-George. Scroll down for video . The old War Office in Whitehall in London, where Churchill came up with plans to defeat Hitler, has been sold on a long lease to overseas developers and could become a luxury hotel or transformed into apartments . Secretaries of state including Lord Kitchener (left) and Lord Roberts (right) have used the old war office . It was built in 1906 at a cost of £1.2million and has been sold for £300million to overseas property developers. The Grade II-listed, 580,000 sq ft property has been described as one of the biggest 'trophy assets' sold by the government in recent decades. It was sold as part of the Ministry of Defence's cost-cutting programme, and staff are expected to move out of the building during the next year. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The building has played an important part in our country's history and now presents a unique redevelopment opportunity in the heart of Westminster. 'The purchaser will be granted a new 250-year lease to ensure that the heritage and security of the building is well managed.' The Old War Office has previously been closed to the public but as part of the sale it is understood that access will now be granted. The procession for the coronation of King Edward VII passes the construction of The Old War Office building in Whitehall, London in 1902 . The old War Office in Whitehall was an impressive building when it was built in 1906 for a record £1.2m . The building has two and a half miles of corridors and more than 1,000 rooms making it able to be developed . The old War Office site, which has more than 100 years of history, could become a luxury hotel in future . It has 1,100 rooms and two and a half miles of corridors, and is expected to be converted into a hotel and luxury flats with a combined value of £1billion. The building has been sold on a long-lease to the India-based Hinduja Group in partnership with Spanish group Obrascon Huarte Lain Desarrollos. It is made of 25 million bricks and 30,000 tonnes of Portland and York stone and is a minute's walk from Downing Street, The Houses of Parliament, the Horse Guards Parade and Nelson's Column. William Young was commissioned as architect of the war office in 1898 but died two years later. The work of designing the iconic building was completed by his son Sir John Taylor. Former Prime minister Winston Churchill used the  War Office in Whitehall during World War Two . It was designed in a trapezium shape to maximise the usage of the land in Whitehall. The building took five years to be completed from the first brick being laid in 1901 until it was finished in 1906. Several fine marble fireplaces were incorporated into the rooms from the former war office in Pall Mall and all are more than 200 years old. The War Office has been home to several notable secretaries of state including Lord Haldane, Lord Kitchener, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. With the start of World War One the staff of the War Office increased, with different teams spread throughout London. In October 1940 four bombs hit the War Office, causing superficial damage and killing one person. It was hit by a further seven bombs over the course of the Second World War but damage to the building remained minimal. The War Office declined greatly in importance after the First World War, a fact illustrated by the drastic reductions in its staff numbers during the inter-war period. On April 1 1920, it employed 7,434 civilian staff; this had shrunk to 3,872 by April 1 1930. Its responsibilities and funding were also reduced. However it remained the centre of the Army's administration until the Ministry of Defence unified in 1964 and most of the department transferred to the main MOD building.","Old War Office building where Churchill planned Allied manoeuvres sold .

"A taxi company has come under fire for supplying white drivers on request. Privately-run 35 Taxis, based in Hull, claim they are simply responding to requests and are doing nothing wrong. Hull City Council have agreed that the policy does not run contrary to the conditions of its licence - but a local councillor has slammed those people requesting white drivers, saying it sends out a 'very sad message'. Privately-run 35 Taxis of Hull (pictured) send white drivers out on jobs when customers request them - they claim they are simply responding to requests and are not discriminating or doing anything wrong . Taxi firm owner Gary Wilkinson said: 'You cannot stop customers making requests. 'We will try to send a white, British driver, if we are asked, but we do tell our customers we can't always guarantee it.' Mr Wilkinson insisted his company was not discriminating and said he had 25 drivers of non-white, British origin who all did 'a fantastic job'. He added: 'I am totally against racism of any kind. I am married to an Arabic woman and our children are mixed-race. 'A customer may have had a bad experience with a coloured driver in the past. Councillor Rosie Nicola said it is 'really sad' that people in Hull are demanding white drivers . 'Maybe they have felt a driver has ripped them off. Some people will then say, ""I only want a white British driver"". 'It's racist, because these people are not ringing up the next day saying don't send me a white driver if they happen to think a white driver has overcharged them.' Wayne Harrison, owner of rival firm 50 Taxis, claimed up to one in five of all his customers also demand a white British driver - but he refuses to oblige them. He said: 'Customers will ring you up and say ""Don't send me a..."" They'll then use a racist word. 'We don't give them a choice. We will send a car. It's up to them if they get in or not.' He said he employs 50 drivers, including four or five who are not white British and added: 'They are super workers. 'They just want to earn a living.' The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin. However, there is no suggestion private-hire companies who respond to customers' requests are breaking the law. Councillor Rosie Nicola is the Hull City Council's cabinet member for equality and community cohesion. She said: 'I find it really sad that people in Hull are ringing up our taxi companies making these kinds of demands. 'It's a really sad message to be sending out that people aren't happy with someone based simply on the colour of their skin. 'If someone doesn't want to get into a taxi driven by someone with a different skin colour, make them wait in the cold.' Hull City Council (pictured) have said 35 Taxis' policy does not run contrary to the conditions of its licence . One local lawyer, who did not wish to be named, said: 'This is a very thorny issue - a nest of vipers. 'There may be discriminatory issues under the Equality Act 2010 committed by call operators if they were to offer a job only to a white British driver.' In October it was revealed that a taxi company in a town tainted by a child sex-grooming gang scandal offers customers white drivers on demand. Rochdale minicab firm Car 2000 offers the choice after two taxi drivers of Pakistani origin were jailed for their part in the sex trafficking and rape of young white girls in the town. The firm, which bought out Eagle Taxis - a company at the centre of the grooming scandal, has revealed that many customers were asking for white or ‘local’ drivers. It came out amid rising tensions in Rochdale following revelations of gang rapes, grooming and trafficking of white girls at the hands of mainly Asian gangs.","Taxi company claims they are responding to demand from customers .

"The British Army will be reduced to a ‘largely ceremonial’ rump if the Tories are allowed to push ahead with their planned spending cuts, Business Secretary Vince Cable said this morning. The Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister said George Osborne’s plan to balance the books would be ‘devastating’ for public services. He accused the Chancellor of ‘veering off to extreme ideology’ with the general election less than five months away. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister Vince Cable said George Osborne’s plan to balance the books would be ‘devastating’ for public services . It comes as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the public sector would have to shrink to a size not seen since the 1930s to hit the Chancellor's budget deficit forecasts. Mr Cable said the Tories had been ‘let off the leash’ and were becoming ‘extreme’. The intervention comes after a poll showed voters now saw the Tories as more right wing than UKIP. Referring to the poll, Mr Cable said: ‘This is what happens when you remove the restraints we put on them in Coalition government.’ He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that he would be ‘really worried’ if the Conservatives were able implement the cuts outlined after winning the next election. The Business Secretary said: ‘There’s a table in the Autumn Statement which suggests that if those plans were realised we would roughly halve the total spending on the Home Office, i.e., the police, on the defence services, which would become largely ceremonial. ‘We would be almost halving the spending of local governments on areas like social care, let alone all the things that I and my colleagues are doing around training and science. It would be devastating and it would be ideologically-driven and I would be very strongly opposed to it.’ Mr Cable, one of the most common critics of the Conservatives from inside Government, said there are ‘big differences’ in the way the Liberal Democrats wanted to cut the deficit compared to the Tories. Members of the Grenadier Guards march during the Colonel's Review, Horse Guard's Parade, London, - the annual military parade  a week before the 'Trooping of the Colour' which marks the Queen's official birthday . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne wants to eliminate the budget deficit within three years of the election . He said Mr Osborne's plan ‘destroys public services in the way we do them’, adding that ‘just continuing’ cuts ‘on ideological extreme grounds is very, very foolish’. Mr Cable did not rule out another power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if, as widely expected, the general election fails to deliver any party an overall Commons majority, and said there remained ‘a lot of common ground’ between them. But he pointed to a poll showing voters - especially Tories themselves - considered the party to be further to the political right than Ukip as evidence of a major lurch to more extreme positions. ‘While we have been in coalition we have kept the Tories on quite a tight leash and they have been well behaved,’ he said. ‘Now they have been let off the leash and confronting the possibility of majority government we are getting into all kinds of extremes. ‘This is what happens when they are removed from the constraints we put on them in coalition.’","Business Secretary said Tory plan to balance books would be 'devastating'

The properties in Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire were scouted as the ideal backgrounds for filming the Henry VIII drama starring Damian Lewis as the king, Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn and Mark Rylance as the king’s advisor Thomas Cromwell. Wolf Hall, which was released in 2009, charts the story of Cromwell's rise to power in the court of the notorious monarch and won both The Man Booker Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award. Now, the National Trust, which looks after the houses - Barrington Court, Lacock Abbey, Chastleton House, Great Chalfield Manor, Montacute House and Horton Court - is expecting an influx of visitors after the six-part series airs on the BBC next month and on PBS in the US. Scroll down for video . Stately homes used as sets for the BBC's Wolf Hall adaptation are expected to see a rise in visitor numbers after the series airs next month. Barrington Court, in Somerset, was used to portray York Place, later called Whitehall, where Cromwell's predecessor Cardinal Wolsey lived . Standing in for Greenwich Palace, Henry's main seat London was Montacute House in Somerset and also used to film Anne Boleyn's arrest . Period dramas have previously caused a rise in visitors, including Highclere Castle in Hampshire, which saw an incredible increase in tourists who wanted to visit the location used to depict ITV's Downton Abbey. Producers have planned to film in Belgium to cut costs, but ended up using UK spots after tax breaks were introduced for filming in the country. Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire was used for courtyard scenes in two Harry Potter films and will be seen in the series as the exterior of Wolf Hall - the Seymour family seat. Barrington Court, in Somerset, stood in for the interior of York Place – later known as Whitehall – where Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell's mentor and friend, lived before his fall from grace. The Grade I listed Chastleton House in Oxfordshire, pictured during filming in July, is used for one of the opening scenes of Wolf Hall . Great Chalfield Manor in Wiltshire was used as the interior of Thomas Cromwell's home. The show charts the rise of Cromwell in Henry's court . Montacute House, also in Somerset, was used to portray Greenwich Palace, which is Henry VIII's main London seat and where Anne Boleyn will be shown as she is arrested. Its grounds will also provide the backdrop for a jousting tournament. And the exterior of Chastleton House in Oxfordshire, depicts Putney, and is used for the programme's opening scene where a young Cromwell is seen viciously attacked by his father. But the interior is used to show Wolf Hall, where Jane Seymour first attracts the king's attention. And Great Chalfield Manor, in Wiltshire, will stand in as the inside of Cromwell’s home. The final National Trust properties to be used, Horton Court, is the only one not open to the public. Scenes have also been filmed in Bristol Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral as well as Dover Castle in Kent. Harvey Edgington, head of filming and locations at the National Trust, said the Trust hoped the BBC series would bring a new audience to the carefully preserved properties. He said film-makers had been subject to strict rules to protect the houses, such as using no-drip candles and having conservators on hand to ensure historic artefacts were kept safe. The candlelit scenes had left the interiors looking 'beautiful', he said, as well as highlighting the reality of life in the Tudor period. 'It's quite exciting,' he told The Telegraph. 'It's been proven in the past that you get a massive boost in visitor numbers, and we hope people will want to find out more about the real locations and history behind them.' The BBC's adaptation of Hilary Mantel's best-selling novel Wolf Hall stars Claire Foy, left, as Anne Boleyn and Homeland star Damian Lewis, right, as King Henry VIII . Lacock Abbey, in Wiltshire, will be seen in the series as the titular Wolf Hall, which is the seat of Jane Seymour's family . The only one of the National Trust filming locations not open to the public is Horton Court in Gloucestershire, which acted as Austin Friars . Barrington Court, near Ilminster in Somerset . The Tudor manor house, which is currently free from collections and furniture, was saved from ruin and restored by the Lyle family in 1920s . Arthur Lyle chose the manor house as a family home and used it as a place to install his collection of historic oak panelling, personally supervising its installation from 1922. Barrington Court was later home to many young evacuees during the Second World War. Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire . The Abbey, which is located at the heart of the picturesque Lacock village features its own woodland grounds. The quirky country house amalgamates various architectural styles and is built upon the foundations of a former nunnery. Visitors can experience the atmosphere of the medieval rooms and cloister court - which was used for outdoor scenes in two Harry Potter movies - which give a sense of the Abbey's monastic past. A museum in the village celebrates the achievements of former Lacock resident, William Henry Fox Talbot, who became famous for his contribution to the invention of photography. Great Chalfield Manor, near Melksham in Wiltshire . A beautiful medieval manor, it was first built between 1465 and 1480 for clothier Thomas Tropenell. Part of an original moat still survives. Visitors can enjoy romantic gardens which feature terraces, topiary houses, a gazebo, lily pond, roses and views across the spring-fed fishpond. The location has been used for filming numerous times, including The Other Boleyn Girl starring Scarlett Johansson and the BBC adaptation of Tess of the D'Ubervilles. Chastleton House, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Oxfordshire . This Jacobean country house was built between 1607 and 1612 by a prosperous wool merchant as an impressive statement of his wealth and power. It was owned by the same increasingly impoverished family until 1991 and the rare gem has remained essentially unchanged for nearly 400 years while the interiors and contents have gradually succumbed to the ravages of time. And with almost no sense of the 21st century, including no shop or tearoom, visitors can truly feel as it they have stepped into the past. Montacute House, Somerset . A masterpiece of Elizabethan Renaissance architecture and design, Montacute House features towering walls of glass, the glow of ham stone, and is surrounded by beautiful gardens. Completed in 1601, the visionary and money behind the mansion was Sir Edward Phelips, it was built under the instruction of master mason William Arnold. The Long Gallery, which houses more than 60 Tudor and Elizabethan portraits on loan from the National Portrait Gallery, is the longest of its kind in England. Horton Court, near Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire . The 16th century stone building was originally built as a Norman hall in the 12th century, but is now a manor house and a Grade I listed building. The house was built by William Knight in about 1521 and the building was expanded to add a new well-glazed east facade, but also incorporating much of the original historic hall, leaving Horton Court with a mix of styles and periods. The National Trust opened the ground floor on Friday and Sunday afternoons during July and August 2011 and are considering how to make it more readily accessible to the public.

"A mother  found dead in a suspected murder-suicide had taken out an intervention order against her estranged husband which expired just four days earlier. The former couple’s flatmate heard moaning noises coming from a bedroom in the moments before Shikha Godara Beniwal died, but he did not intervene because he thought they were having sex. Homicide detectives have confirmed the ex-couple, who had a three-year-old son, were known to them due to a history of domestic violence going back at least two years. Scroll down for video . Melbourne physiotherapist Shikha Godara Beniwal was murdered by her estranged husband Sunil just four days after the intervention order she had in place against him expired . It is believed Sunil Beniwal, 36, killed Shikha Godara Beniwal at his home in Deer Park, in west Melbourne, on Saturday night or in the early hours of Sunday before committing suicide by veering into an oncoming truck. The Beniwal's  son was in the house at the time of the suspected murder, along with Sunil's unsuspecting flatmates, James Negri and his girlfriend. Negri's younger brother, Jackson Kelly, said his sibling had heard the little boy crying and  the sound of a woman moaning but didn't call the police as he thought they were having sex. He said his brother is 'shaken up' and had never witnessed any fights between the estranged couple and thought they were trying to get back together as Shikha was a regular visitor to the house. Sunil Beniwal, 36, committed suicide after murdering his estranged wife and mother of their three-year-old son . Kelly,17, told Fairfax Media: 'They had just come back from India. I thought they were trying to work it out. 'He seemed like a nice, normal guy. I don't know why he turned like this. I can't believe it.' Although the police won't release how Shikha, 32, died until after an autopsy, they said they are yet to find a weapon and are not looking for anyone else in connection with her murder. The couple had a history of domestic abuse and were known to police but Sunil's flat-mate thought they were trying to work things out and said they recently travelled to India together .

"Leading Labour figures yesterday demanded that Tony Blair face a grilling over torture. As the clamour for a judge-led inquiry grew, Alan Johnson and Yvette Cooper called for the former prime minister to be quizzed on Britain’s role in the barbaric treatment of prisoners by the US. It comes as the Daily Mail publishes a letter from more than 40 prominent figures, including politicians and authors, calling for David Cameron to secure the release of a British father of four held for 13 years without trial in Guantanamo Bay. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw are facing questions over what they knew about CIA torture . Shadow home secretary Miss Cooper also broke ranks to say she believed an investigation by a judge might be needed to get to the truth about torture. Her intervention means the Labour front bench is on the verge of supporting an inquiry that could be hugely embarrassing for both Mr Blair and David Miliband – the brother of the party’s current leader. MPs said former foreign secretary Jack Straw – who has been interviewed Jack Straw – who has been interviewed as a ‘witness’ by detectives investigating the rendition of two Libyan dissidents – must also be held to account. Last night, former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve backed the calls for a judge-led inquiry once the police investigations are over, saying it was needed to provide ‘finality’. And former shadow home secretary David Davis told Sky News a judge must take charge. He said: ‘One must understand the sheer weight of pressure that comes from the Establishment to try and stop this sort of stuff coming out, so I think this needs to be a judicial inquiry.’ At Westminster, the weekend was dominated by the continued fallout from last week’s Senate Intelligence Committee report, which detailed how detainees had been subjected to torture such as waterboarding. Mr Cameron continues to cling to the position that an inquiry by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee is the best way of finding out the level of Britain’s involvement. In a publicity blitz, ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind yesterday said he had asked the Senate committee to reveal the redactions, requested by British security officials, which led to all mention of MI5 and MI6 being removed from the 499-page report. Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning that he would seek to question former ministers over Britain's role or complicity in torture . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her 'instinct' was to call for a full judicial inquiry into UK torture . Former foreign secretary Jack Straw was grilled by police investigating the abductions of two Libyan dissidents who claim they were handed to Colonel Muammar Gadaffi and tortured by his regime. Mr Straw was interviewed as a 'witness' by Scotland Yard amid claims the British government was complicit in the 'rendition' of the two men and their families. The dissidents, Abdel Hakim Belhadj and Sami al-Saadi, have accused Mr Straw of signing off on the operations in 2004. A decision on whether to lay any charges could be made in the new year. He also said his committee would ask any former or serving minister with a contribution to make to give evidence – putting the spotlight firmly on Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Miliband. Sir Malcolm added: ‘If they refuse to do so, that in itself would imply they have something to hide. If there is evidence they knew or were involved then of course they would be priority figures for our investigation. ‘If people deserve to be embarrassed it’s our job to embarrass them. We have a statutory obligation to carry out this task without fear or favour.’ However, he admitted that he had no way of compelling the Americans to hand over an uncensored copy of the report. He also conceded he could not say he was ‘confident’ of success. Home Secretary Theresa May will be grilled today by the Home Affairs Select Committee on the extent of her contact with the Senate committee and whether she personally lobbied for any redactions. ISC member George Howarth said it was right to seek details of redacted material but questioned why it should come from the US. He said the priority should be to seek answers directly from the Government and intelligence agencies. The Labour MP added: ‘It could take months and what we are asking for already exists in London.’ Miss Cooper said she doubted the ISC ‘have the capacity and the scope’ to carry out an inquiry, adding that her ‘instinct’ was that a judge-led process would still be required to ensure confidence. She told the BBC that Mr Blair and other former ministers had ‘always said that they would co-operate with all investigations and have said that they would be very keen to do so’. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair met the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi at his desert base outside Sirte south of Tripoli in 2007 . A Parliamentary committee has called on the US government to hand over any evidence of British complicity in torture. Last week a US Senate report exposed the ""brutal"" treatment of al-Qaeda terror suspects in the wake of 9/11. Downing Street has admitted that some material was removed from the report at the UK's request, for national security reasons. But it said no redactions related to British involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners. The House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by British intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who heads the intelligence committee, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would request to see redacted material in the Senate's public report if it referenced the UK. He said that if British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture. ""That would be quite against all the standards of this country, it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain,"" Sir Malcolm added. Miss Cooper added that it was important to get to the truth to make sure there was no ‘shadow of innuendo or allegations cast over the vital work that the [security] agencies rightly do to keep us all safe every day of the week’. Former home secretary Mr Johnson said Mr Straw and Mr Blair should go before the committee. Asked on the Andrew Marr show if they should give evidence, he said: ‘Yes, absolutely, yes.’ Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also called for a judicial inquiry. He wrote in his Sunday Mirror column: ‘We must have a transparent system that reflects our values of fair play and justice, not one that turns a blind eye and deaf ear to claims of the abduction and torture of innocent people.’ Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called for Mr Straw and Mr Blair to reveal what they knew about the CIA’s torture and rendition programme when they were in office. He said: ‘Obviously it’s for them, it’s for former ministers to account for the relationship then. I hope they will co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry.’ Civil liberties groups and campaigning MPs accuse Britain of repeatedly turning a blind eye to torture during Mr Blair’s ‘war on terror’ – when he worked hand in glove with the Bush administration. There are allegations that British agents were present when torture took place and that the UK helped with rendition flights. Yesterday, one of the two psychologists who were paid to run the interrogation programme by the CIA insisted UK agents were at torture sites. Dr James Mitchell, who devised the brutal ‘enhanced interrogation’ programmes, said: ‘I’d see their special operations people at the sites I would visit.’ Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the ISC and police investigations into the Libyan renditions should be allowed to ‘run their course’. He added: ‘If at the end of it, it doesn’t appear that the truth is emerging, that people imagine there is some kind of cover-up, then of course a judge-led inquiry is the right way to proceed.’ Isabella Sankey of human rights group Liberty said: ‘Until our Government sets up a transparent, judicial inquiry, cover-up and official impunity will persist.’","Former PM and Foreign Secretary face Parliamentary grilling over torture .

"Kerry Smith has quit as Ukip's candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments. In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. They were revealed just days after he was reinstated as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock. Kerry Smith (centre) has quit as Ukip's candidate just days after he was reinstated as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock . He initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong pain killers. He blamed the rant on 'strong morphine based prescription medication for a back injury'. But in a statement, he said: 'I have this evening offered my resignation as Ukip PPC for South Basildon and East Thurrock. 'I want the best for South Basildon and East Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people. 'Therefore I have chosen to resign so that Ukip can win this seat next May.' Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn had earlier tried to play down the revelations - claiming they were 'hand grenades rolling down the corridor' Earlier, Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn had said: 'This was a phone call sometime ago while he was on sedatives by his own account, not really speaking, thinking rationally. He was on prescription sedatives after suffering an injury.' But he said: 'Using derogatory terminology, this slang, is not right at this level of politics and you shouldn't do it.' 'Clearly what he said there is unacceptable. He's apologised unreservedly, there are big mitigating circumstances, it's from some time ago, and we're willing now to judge him on his performance going forward from this.' The row came after a Ukip official charged with vetting the party's election candidates revealed he spends half his time 'weeding out the lunatics'. David Soutter told Ukip activists he was not able to spend enough time finding good new candidates – because he was too busy getting rid of people 'who shouldn't be there'. In recorded comments passed to the Sunday Times, Mr Souter said the party needed to become more disciplined, . He said: 'One of the things that Ukip has lacked as a party — and looking at it the way I've been able to from the outside — discipline is one of the things that's really been missing. 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' Mr Soutter had even resorted to 'doing tests to make sure people were vaguely sane and that they could string their words together more or less', Ukip's Scottish MEP David Coburn said.","Councillor Kerry Smith has quit as Ukip's candidate in top target seat .

"Gerald Malcolm. 48, has been jailed for eight years for raping a woman on the side of the road in broad daylight . A rapist who had to have cold water poured over him by strangers to stop him attacking a woman in broad daylight has been jailed for eight years. Gerald Malcolm was attacking a woman so drunk she could not walk or talk on the side of the road when shocked motorists pulled over shortly after 4pm in April. A couple poured water over the 48-year-old who had plied the woman with alcohol at a pub near his home in Halesowen, West Midlands, before launching the attack. Malcolm, originally from Jamaica, was jailed for eight years at Wolverhampton Crown Court . The court heard how he met his 28-year-old victim at a library before convincing her to join him in a pub. He then took her back to his home where the woman drank more alcohol and became unwell. After offering to walk her home, he was walking by on the roadside when he launched his attack. Speaking after his sentencing the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was so drunk she could barely move or speak. 'The assault has had a lasting effect on me; I still cannot believe that this man attacked me and I don't know how I got so drunk. 'It is awful that I cannot remember what happened to me, this was in the street in broad daylight. I would never have done anything like this in the street. 'I keep blaming myself, I keep thinking that this is my own fault because I got so drunk, but he shouldn't have done this to me, he shouldn't have taken advantage of me. 'I couldn't move and I could barely speak let alone say no or fend off my attacker. I willingly went to his home for a drink but I did not at any point agree to sex, that prospect was not in my mind at all.' West Midlands Police said it hoped Malcolm's sentencing would deter other attacks. Dc Sarah West, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: 'Rape is rape and there are no excuses, there is no grey area. 'Men need to understand that if a woman says no or is incapable of consenting, for instance through drink or drugs, they are committing a criminal offence. 'I hope today’s sentence will help the woman move on with her life knowing the person responsible is behind bars.' The man was jailed for eight years at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) over the sexual assault .","Gerald Malcolm attacked woman at 4.10pm on the side of the road .

"The gay prostitute who had sexual encounters with Shrien Dewani says the family of slain bride Anni treated him like a long-lost son when he met them as the 34-year-old millionaire faced a murder charge over the death of his  wife. Leopold Leisser, AKA 'The German Master', from Birmingham, met Anni Dewani's parents Vinam and Nilam Hindocha in Cape Town, South Africa. Prosecutors claimed Dewani ordered a hit on Anni because he was gay and wanted a way to get out of his marriage without shaming his family. Leopold Leisser, AKA 'The German Master', met Anni Dewani's parents Vinam and Nilam Hindocha in Cape Town, as Shrien Dewani faced a murder charge over the death of his 28-year-old Swedish wife . Grieving: Vinod and Nilam Hindocha with a photograph of their daughter on her wedding day. They met Mr Leisser in the Cape Town Lode Hotel during the trial in October . Dewani, who was cleared of plotting the murder last week and has now returned to the UK, admitted he was ‘bisexual’ in a three-sentence statement read to the Western Cape High Court, as a series of witnesses - including Mr Leisser - prepared to testify he was gay. Mr Leisser, 43, admitted he was nervous about meeting the family in October, fearing they would judge him for how he makes his living. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was apprehensive to meet them because of the line of business I am in and because of the nature in which I met Shrien. 'I was apprehensive and thought they would see me as a dirty, disgusting man. But it was the opposite. They were so grateful I had come forward. Dewani was cleared of plotting the murder of his wife Anni last week and has now returned to the UK . 'I was welcomed like a long lost son, in a way. It was surreal, sitting in a chair, surrounded by her family and them treating me like they’d known me for years.' Anni’s uncle Ashok Hindocha said: 'We have got nothing against homosexuality or what he does or that he is a prostitute. 'He is still a human being and we’re grateful for what he did for us.' After graduating, Dewani trained as an accountant and worked for Deloitte before joining his brother in the family business as a financial director. By his early 20s, he had joined a gay dating website called Gaydar, using the name ‘asiansubguy’ – thought to be a reference to the fact that he liked to be submissive during sex with men. And he became a regular at the notorious Hoist nightclub in South London. Yet his strict family and religious background meant he kept the truth about his sexuality secret. There was also, increasingly, pressure on him from his parents to get married, particularly after Preyen, his elder brother, settled down. Shrien struggled in relationships with women. In 2008, he was introduced to a tycoon’s daughter called Rani Kansagra. They were engaged within three months, but split up soon afterwards. Three months after that relationship collapsed Dewani was introduced to Anni Hindocha, a Swedish engineering graduate, whose family had fled Uganda during Idi Amin’s bloody rule, and built up a business and a new life four hours from Stockholm. On a visit to see her cousin, Sneha, in Luton in 2009, she was introduced to Shrien by mutual friends. The pair continued to see each other, spending alternate weekends in Bristol and Stockholm. Shrien proposed to Anni at the Paris Ritz with a £25,000 diamond ring after flying his girlfriend out from London by private jet in 2010. Behind the scenes, however, the relationship was in turmoil. Dewani and Anni rowed repeatedly and, it is claimed, broke up several times during their 18-month courtship because of his ‘controlling’ behaviour and lack of sexual interest in her. Leopold Leisser pictured shopping in Cape Town after giving evidence in the Shrien Dewani trial in October . Her cousin Sneha Mashru, who was close to Anni, said: ‘Anni felt embarrassed and hurt, and we both felt it was weird. Anni and I speculated that maybe he was a virgin or perhaps just being proper.’ Mrs Mashru added that Dewani was always ‘very critical’ of Anni’s appearance. Anni even broke off their engagement at one point. But Mr Hindocha says Dewani’s father phoned him and pleaded that Anni could ‘not do this’ as it would bring the Dewani family’s reputation ‘down to earth’ if he had a second failed engagement. So Mr Dewani instructed his eldest son Preyen to get Shrien to be more affectionate, and Anni finally agreed to marry him, despite significant ‘misgivings’. Throughout their relationship, he had begun secretly meeting Mr Leisser. Anni and Dewani’s rows continued. Even as they planned the wedding in India, they argued over the colour of decorations, the theme for functions and the style of clothing. At one point, Anni texted her cousin: ‘Fighting a lot with Shrien. Wish I never got engaged. Everyone tells me how fortunate I am…absolutely sick.’ Shrien Dewani had begun secretly meeting Leopold Leisser, even after he started going out with Anni (pictured) Yet when the £200,000 wedding finally did go ahead at the five-star Mumbai Marriott set on the banks of Lake Powai, there were few public signs of tensions as 300 guests watched Shrien and Anni dance to the hit Bollywood song Pehla Nasha – First Love. But after they went to the honeymoon suite, there was little romance. Shrien scolded Anni for not folding her clothes and spent the night on the sofa, their marriage un-consummated. ‘Crying has become my new hobby,’ Anni told a friend in one text. She also told friends she was already considering divorce before they left for their fateful honeymoon in South Africa. Anni’s father, Vinod, said when he last spoke to her by phone on the afternoon of November 13 she said she had a ‘lot to tell him’ and needed to speak to him when she returned the following Tuesday. They never spoke again. Later that night, Anni was shot dead after their car was hijacked in a township outside Cape Town, apparently on a sight-seeing tour because, according to Dewani, she wanted to see ‘the real Africa’. Hours after her body was found, police found Dewani had logged on to Gaydar, the gay dating site, from the luxury hotel where they had been staying in Cape Town. Ashok Hindocha, the uncle of Anni, told the Mail: ‘We couldn’t care less if someone is gay or not. ‘But Shrien was determined to marry a beautiful heterosexual girl. Whatever else happened, by marrying her knowing that he was gay, he had already ruined her life. For that we can never forgive him.’","Leopold Leisser, 43, admitted he was nervous about meeting the family .

"A recent survey has found that around half of people in Britain believe they would never worry about money again if they had £1 million - and a third would need just £500,000 for them to be happy. A YouGov poll asked people to pick the amount they believed would allow them to be comfortably well off, with 29 per cent saying £500,000 or more, while 44 per cent thought £1 million of assets, not including their house, would set them up for life. A further 62 per cent said they believe £2 million would rid them of all money worries for life. A poll asked people to pick the amount they believe would guarantee being comfortably off, with 29 per cent saying £500,000 or more, while 44 per cent thought £1 million of assets would set them up for life . Peter York, social commentator and co-founder of market research firm SRU told The Sunday Times that the ‘relatively low’ amounts shows the extent of regional disparities – as affluent people living in London and the South East might be surprised by the modest amounts. £250,000 or less – 15% . £250,000-£500,000 – 14% . £500,000 to £1 million – 15% . £1 million-£2 million – 18% . £2 million-£5 million – 14% . £5 million to £10 million – 6% . More than £10 million – 4% . Don’t know – 14% . He said: ‘In the nation at large a million is still magical, even if in London an Edwardian semi might be worth £2 million.’ That regional disparity has made headlines recently with vastly different properties hitting the market at the same price. Newsham Grange, a Grade-II listed manor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds and was put on the market for £1 million in September. For the same price, last month potential buyers could snap up London's first ever £1 million council flat in Chelsea. On the market for £999,950, the current owner stands to make a profit of £952,000 after the buying it for £48,000 under the 'right to buy' scheme. The poll also found that of those surveyed, 32 per cent would continue to work even if they did receive the amount they thought would make them happy, while just 27 per cent said they would stop working. The rest of those surveyed were undecided, at 11 per cent, or did not have a job, at 30 per cent. Regional disparity: £1million could get you this Grade-II listed manor in North Yorkshire (pictured left) or Britain's first £1 million council flat in Chelsea, West London (right) which went on sale last month . Of the largest social grade group, ABC1, 20 per cent picked the amount of £1 million to £2 million as the amount they believe would guarantee a comfortable life. More than half of the 1,941 people surveyed said they would buy property if they were given their dream amount of money – at 56 per cent. A further 51 per cent said they would spend it on travel and holidays, while 49 per cent said they would invest. However, it was not all sensible investment purchases – 16 per cent said they would spend the money on cars, yachts and private planes and 13 per cent on fine foods and wine. Around 10 per cent said they would spend their money on private education. A further nine per cent said they would spend the money on on jewellery, eight per cent on high fashion and five per cent on works of art.","Survey found half wouldn't worry about money if they had £1 million .

"The time and date that aligned for a baby girl born in Montana on Saturday came close to making the event truly unique...if only it hadn't happened for another girl 1,500 miles away. Quincy Kessler was born at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings at 10:11 a.m. on 12/13/14 - a consecutive string of dates not to be seen again for many years to come. Nearly a continent away in Cleveland, Ohio, Hazel Grace was born to Leisha Campbell and Shawn Zimmerman. Scroll down for video . Leisha Campbell, right, rests with her newborn daughter, Hazel Grace, along with her husband, Shawn Zimmerman, left, and daughter Adalynn at Fairview Hospital in Cleveland on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2014.

'We knew she was going to be born today [Saturday], we just didn't know it would be at 10:11 a.m.,' Campbell said in a statement as reported by ABC News. 'Everyone is telling us we should play the lottery. We feel this is a lucky day and are excited to get family photos with Santa.' However, little Quincy did her best to pull ahead in this numbers game. Her birth weight, at 7.84 pounds, almost aligned with the other numbers. A fraction of an ounce more, and she would have weighed 7.89 pounds. The baby is the second daughter born to Trenton and Melida Kessler.

"Russia's aggressive incursions into UK airspace could lead to a passenger jet being brought down by accident, the Defence Secretary warned yesterday. Michael Fallon warned that Vladimir Putin was playing a ‘provocative and dangerous’ game by ordering Russian Bear bombers to fly over British waters. Mr Fallon said Mr Putin’s new aggression could even spark a war with Nato forces. In a blunt message, he said Britain should ‘prepare for the worst’ as the Russian President flexes his muscles. Scroll down for video . Unwelcome visitor: An RAF Typhoon intercepts a Russian Bear off Scotland in September, one of 100 occasions so far this year that RAF jets have scrambled to meet Russian bombers near British airspace . RAF jets have been scrambled more than 100 times this year to escort Tu-95 Bear bombers away from British airspace. Mr Fallon said the deliberate move had placed crews ‘under pressure’ – and risked a serious incident. He accused Russia of playing a ‘provocative and dangerous’ game – and warned there was a danger that a Russian military aircraft operating secretly could accidentally crash into an airliner which might not become aware of its presence until it was too late. Asked whether he was concerned that shots might be fired, he replied: ‘I’m more worried about a mid-air collision where they are flying directly on top of the UK border. Their Bears should stay in the woods.’ Incidents have taken place all over northern Europe. In March this year a Scandinavian Airlines 737 which had just taken off from Copenhagen carrying 132 passengers had a near miss with a Russian reconnaissance aircraft which did not transmit its position. A crash was only avoided because of good visibility and the alertness of the passenger jet crew. Russian jets have also had a string of near misses with military aircraft in recent months. In one case, a Russian jet came within 30ft of a Swedish reconnaissance plane as it intercepted it in international airspace. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were also scrambled in October to track this Tu-95 Bear bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Followed: These RAF images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoons near British airspace . The European Leadership Network think-tank, which studied 39 incursions by Russian jets over Europe this year, found a ‘highly disturbing’ pattern was emerging. A spokesman said: ‘Even though direct military confrontation has been avoided so far, the mix of more aggressive Russian posturing and the readiness of Western forces to show resolve increases the risk of unintended escalation and the danger of losing control over events.’ Ministers were accused of allowing mission creep in Iraq last night after it emerged hundreds of British troops will help local forces take on Islamic State extremists. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said troop numbers in the ‘low hundreds’ would train Iraqi and Kurdish fighters, accompanied by combat-ready troops on protection duties. At the moment, only about 50 British military trainers and advisers are in Iraq. The move represents a major expansion of Britain’s military role in the country, and critics fear it could suck troops into another bloody conflict. Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ‘No mission creep we were promised. This lot just can’t help themselves.’ Russia’s annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine has led to tough new sanctions on Moscow and a show of strength by Nato forces in Eastern Europe. More than 1,300 British troops were deployed to Poland last month in Operation Black Eagle, the largest Nato exercise in the region for six years. Ministers insist there is ‘no military solution’ to the Ukraine crisis. But, in an interview yesterday, Mr Fallon suggested this did not necessarily mean war can be avoided. Asked if a military conflict between Russia and Nato was now a possibility, the Defence Secretary replied: ‘I don’t trust Putin at the moment, and we have to prepare for the worst.’ Defence sources insisted last night that Mr Fallon did not believe a war between Russia and the West was likely. A source said: ‘He was talking about Nato and the point of the exercises we are doing in eastern Europe, as well as collective self-defence, all acting as a deterrent.’ █ British apple growers say they face bankruptcy as a result of President Putin’s decision to back separatists in Ukraine. In response to sanctions against Russia imposed by Brussels, he has banned imports of foods supplied or grown in the EU. This has led to a glut of apples in Europe, causing prices to plunge by more than 50 per cent. English growers say they are now being offered so little for their crops that many are leaving fruit to rot on the trees or selling it at knock-down prices.","Michael Fallon warns of danger of a mid-air collision with Russian plane .

"Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys said the BBC ignored mass immigration for fears it would be considered racist . One of the BBC’s top presenters has admitted that the corporation ignored mass immigration because it feared critics would say it was racist. Radio 4’s Today interviewer John Humphrys accused his employer of being ‘soft’, ‘complacent’ and ‘institutionally nervous’ when it came to tackling the story or questioning multiculturalism. And he said that BBC employees are unable to understand the concerns of ordinary people because they typically lead ‘sheltered’ middle-class lives and are overwhelmingly ‘liberal Oxbridge males’. The criticism, which is the latest in a string of admissions of Left-wing bias by senior BBC figures, comes weeks after the Government accused the Today programme of misrepresenting its spending cuts. George Osborne hit out at a one of its reports, which said his reforms were ‘utterly terrifying’. The Chancellor said the BBC coverage was ‘nonsense’ and had been ‘hyperbolic’. Now Humphrys, 71, has told the Sunday Times Magazine that the corporation is facing an ‘existential crisis greater than it’s ever been’ because ‘people, serious, thoughtful people, talk seriously and thoughtfully about the future of the BBC in a way that they haven’t before’. The veteran presenter admitted that the last Labour government’s controversial immigration policy was not sufficiently ‘interrogated’ by the BBC, saying: ‘The Labour government underestimated by a factor of ten the number of people who were going to move from Poland.’ He said the BBC was ‘frightened of appearing racist’, adding: ‘We were too institutionally nervous of saying, isn’t immigration getting a little bit out of hand? And can we be critical of multiculturalism? ‘We didn’t interrogate immigration rigorously enough. We failed to look at what our job was.’ Humphrys claimed he was partly responsible for the BBC’s ‘complacent’ approach towards immigration, because he failed to challenge Labour’s decision to allow migrants from Poland and Hungary to work in Britain from 2004, and the flawed prediction that only 13,000 would arrive. After more than a million Eastern European immigrants moved to the UK, senior Labour figures eventually admitted the policy had been a huge mistake. Humphrys said: ‘I do remember, vaguely, interviews with ministers at the time and saying, “Are you sure that’s all there’ll be?” And when they said “yeah”, accepting it.’ He said BBC employees are unable to understand the concerns of ordinary people because they typically have ‘sheltered’ middle-class lives and are overwhelmingly ‘liberal Oxbridge males’ The star went on to say that too many BBC staff were ‘arrogant’ and thought they knew ‘what was best for the country’. He added: ‘It was and still is relentlessly middle class. Unfortunately. There was a predominant voice – the liberal Oxbridge male.’ Tory MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘This is a refreshing outbreak of candour, honesty and rare insight from one of the big beasts of the BBC. Their bias has gone unchallenged for too long.’ Humphrys is not the first senior BBC figure to criticise the corporation’s failure to challenge Left-wing assumptions. This year former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman accused the BBC of being ‘smug’. He has also said its coverage of climate change ‘abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago’. Last year the BBC’s former head of TV news, Roger Mosey, criticised the corporation for shutting out critics of the European Union, saying: ‘On the BBC’s own admission, it did not give enough space to anti-immigration views or EU-withdrawalists.’ And another senior executive, current radio chief Helen Boaden, claimed the BBC had a ‘deep liberal bias’ when she became head of news in 2004. A BBC spokesman said: ‘John Humphrys was merely echoing other senior BBC figures who have acknowledged that we were slow to reflect changing opinions on immigration. This was a historical issue and we now believe our reporting is in the right place and we cover this complex issue in depth.’ Sir Michael Parkinson says the BBC has far more bureaucrats than it did during his time at the corporation and that programmes have suffered as a result. Speaking to the Yorkshire Post newspaper, he said: 'I was very lucky that when I was there it was run by programme makers... They were either very good journalists or very good at showbusiness. They weren’t bureaucrats. 'Now it seems to me there are more bureaucrats than anything else. It shows in the broadcasting.' The veteran presenter said that when he was with the BBC he was able to talk ideas over with bosses while having a drink, but added that times have changed. 'Nowadays it would take about three years to circumnavigate the varous committees it would have to pass through before it passed under his nose,' he said. 'But I’m a BBC man through and through and think it’s the greatest broadcasting system throughout the world.'","John Humphrys says BBC ignored critical stories about mass immigration .

"If you're one of those people who wake up in the middle of the night and reach for the phone then you're not alone. A recent survey from the  Sleep Health Foundation has found that rather than being a place of rest and intimacy, the bedroom is becoming more like an office due to the amount of electronics in it. Out of the of 1,500 people studied, a whopping 45 per cent regularly take a laptop, electronic device or watch TV in bed, hindering their chances of some quality shut-eye. Scroll down for video . A recent study of 1,500 people by the Sleep Health Foundation and led by Professor Dorothy Bruck found 45 per cent  regularly take a laptop, electronic device or watch TV in bed, hindering their chances of quality sleep . But as well as disturbances from alerts, texts and telephone calls, the blue light from the screen can block the hormone melatonin, which encourages the body to relax and sleep. The foundation's sleep psychologist Professor Dorothy Bruck says: 'A standard guideline for good sleep is that the bed should be reserved for sleep and intimacy only. 'So it was alarming to learn that so many people were using their sleep sanctuary to email, cruise the web and watch movies, all activities that are not conducive to sleep.' Animals are a big no and should be banned from the bed and bedroom if they are noisy says Professor Bruck . Professor Bruck says that Australians are not taking their sleep seriously enough which is worrying as being over-wrought and sleep deprived can cause illnesses and hazards. As well as the obvious risks with operating machinery and driving, those with regular fragmented sleep are more at risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Lack of sleep has also been linked to depression and weight problems like obesity. 'Solutions exist for many of these disturbances but this data reflects a widespread failure to prioritise sleep,' adds Professor Bruck. Professor Bruck says try to avoid using your phone or computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy. She also says to cut back on coffee . Interestingly, 70 per cent of those studied said they 'often look at the clock' when they wake up during the night but it's not clear whether it's a quick glance or clock watching. The latter leaves those with fragmented sleep agitated and frustrated, which in turn causes more disturbance and those struggling to drop off are advised to to cover the clock. 'A quiet and comfortable bedroom environment is an obvious prerequisite for maximising sleep quality, adds Professor Bruck. More than 70 per cent of those studied said they 'often look at the clock' when they wake up during the night . 'Great sleep relies on a quiet room, a relaxed mind and a comfortable bed. 'But you'd be surprised how many people ignore these important guidelines and snuggle up with their iPhone in their overheated bedroom after drinking too many glasses of wine.' The survey showed that 22 per cent believe they drink too much alcohol, a quarter admitted drinking coffee after 2pm and more than a third confessed to not winding down before hopping into bed. Make it stop: Lack of sleep can cause arguments, frustration, anxiety and magnify whatever bad is happening . 'Lots of people believe coffee doesn't affect their sleep but research proves it actually makes deep sleep lighter up to 14 hours after it's consumed,' adds Professor Bruck. 'Likewise alcohol. It might seem like that tipple is making you relaxed but it will actually make the second half of your night's sleep more fragmented.' Four in ten blamed a snoring partner for their lack of sleep while others said they were kept awake or aggravated by noisy pets, the temperature and uncomfortable clothing and bedding. 1. Have a regular sleep pattern. Try to go to bed at the same time every evening and get up at the same time every morning. This will help your body to work out a healthy sleep routine. 2. Spend the right amount of time in bed. Most adults need about 8 hours sleep every night. Some require more and some less. Many poor sleepers spend much more than 8 hours in bed and this makes fragmented sleep a habit. Except if you have lengthy sleep requirements, limit your time in bed to no more than 8.5 hours. If you often take hours to fall asleep, go to bed later. Remember that children need more sleep than adults. 3. Bed is for sleeping, not entertainment. Ditch the TVs, mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices. Your mind needs to be in the habit of knowing that if you are in bed, you are there to sleep. Don't stay in bed if you are wide awake. 4. Wind down and relax before going to bed. Have a buffer zone before bedtime. Sort out any problems before going to bed or allocate a 'worry time' during the day to go over the day's activities and work out a plan of action for the next day. Try to avoid using your computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy. Don't exercise too late in the evening. Find a relaxation technique that works for you. 5. Make sure your bedroom is comfortable. You should have a quiet, dark room with comfortable bedding and good temperature control.

"Michael Clarke says there's a chance he 'may never play again' after suffering a hamstring injury during Saturday's final day of play in the first Test against India. Clarke was sent for scans after limping from Adelaide Oval with a right hamstring injury. 'The scans are not great, they have certainly showed a tear there. The experts are looking at them and I can pretty confidently say that I won't take part in this Test series,' Clarke said. 'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for,' said Michael Clarke at a post-match press conference after suffering a hamstring injury in Saturday's first Test match against India. 'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for. 'There's no doubt there's certainly a chance, well there's a chance I may never play again. 'I hope that's not the case and I'll be doing everything in my power to get back out on the park, but I have to be realistic as well.' Clarke has suffered serious right and left hamstring injuries in the past four months, and he was given injections to sooth his his chronic back injury when it flared up on Tuesday. 'I did my left hamstring (three times in the past four months). I've done my right side of my back, I've just done my right hammy. 'I have no regrets about playing this Test match. I have no regrets about going back on the field after I retired hurt,' he said. 'I don't have one regret. This is the most important Test match of my career. 'Once you walk into the game, you have to do whatever it takes to finish that game,' he said. 'Now I've got to go back and do what the experts tell me, to give myself my best chance of being fully fit.'

Michael Clarke, collapsed beside Chris Rogers (right) limped off Adelaide Oval on Saturday with a devastating right hamstring injury . The injury is a devastating blow to Australia on an otherwise exceptional day for the Australian team after Nathan Lyon dismantled the Indian batsmen in a remarkable 48-run win. Virat Kohli crafted a career-best century, but Lyon's maiden 10-wicket Test haul proved the difference as the hosts clinched victory on Saturday. The enthralling battle between chief protagonists Lyon and Kohli ended in the 82nd over. India's stand-in skipper holed out on 141, Mitch Marsh misreading the ball but completing an awkward catch in the deep. Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson claimed a wicket each after the final drinks break. But Lyon fittingly ended the game when he had Ishant Sharma stumped and India all out for 315 in the 88th over.

Lyon finished with incredible match figures of 12-286, bouncing back superbly after an underwhelming tour of the UAE, where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140. Australian captain Michael Clarke went down fielding a ground ball at mid wicket after lunch and left the field clutching his right hamstring. He was assisted back to the sheds by team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris. This latest setback continues a terrible run of injuries for Clarke, who had been in doubt of playing the first Test scheduled for Brisbane before the freak accident which caused the death of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes. Clarke strained his left hamstring in a one day international in Perth last month, then suffered a recurrence of a degenerative back injury that forced him to retire hurt on 60 while batting on Tuesday. The 33-year-old returned the next day after extensive treatment to post a courageous 128 and was fielding in pain during the Indians' two innings.

At tea, India was 2/205, with stand-in captain Virat Kohli on 82 (off 112 balls) and Murali Vijay on 85 (off 208). Earlier, Mitchell Johnson had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Brad Haddin for 21, while Haddin also caught Cheteshwar Pujara off Nathan Lyon for 21.

"A woman who shouted 'f*** the police' as she cycled past officers in the street has been awarded a $100,000 settlement from a federal court because it violated her free speech. Amy Elizabeth Barnes was arrested after screaming abuse, including 'Cobb police suck', and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in Marietta, Georgia. The political activist was then placed in solitary confinement when she was taken into custody on Easter Sunday in 2012. Settlement: Amy Elizabeth Barnes was arrested after screaming abuse, including 'Cobb police suck', and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in Marietta, Georgia, in 2012 . She then went to court saying her First Amendment rights were violated while claiming she was maliciously prosecuted when she was jailed on charges of disorderly conduct and the use of abuse words to 'incite an immediate breach of the peace.' A judge ruled that even though her language was 'offensive', in constituted 'political speech'. Cynthia Counts, her lawyer, told The Atlanta Constitution-Journal: 'Ms. Barnes’ comments to the police may have been offensive, but no one in the United States of America should be chased down and arrested for their free speech. 'The officers argued that it was a bad neighborhood and you shouldn’t disrespect the police because it could create issues.' Judge Melodie Clayton said Miss Barnes had not confronted the officers when she shouted the abuse and instead rode away on her bicycle. In her judgement, she described how it was then that the cops stopped questioning the suspect and pursued her instead. Activist: She went to court saying her First Amendment rights were while violated claiming she was maliciously prosecuted. A judge said even though her language was offensive it constituted 'political speech' She wrote: 'The evidence at trial showed that the Defendant was not engaged in a face-to-face confrontation with the officers which tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace when the words were spoken. 'In addition, the word “su*k”, used as an epithet, is now common enough in modern society that it cannot reasonably provoke a threat of violence. 'The defendant’s other statement, “(expletive) the police,” was a fleeting epithet that was insulting and inappropriate, but it did not create an immediate threat and danger of violence. 'The defendant’s statements, although offensive to this court, clearly constitute political speech.'

"An MP has called for a top air traffic control boss to be stripped of his bonuses after a computer glitch caused flight chaos for tens of thousands of passengers. Dozens of flights were cancelled on Friday and Saturday with hundreds more delays after a computer system at air traffic control company Nats suffered a catastrophic failure. MP Paul Flynn said Richard Deakin, chief executive of Nats, should lose his bonuses for overseeing the travel crisis. Labour MP Paul Flynn (left) called for Richard Deakin (right), the boss of air traffic control company Nats, to lose his bonuses because of the travel chaos . The Labour MP told the Sunday Times: 'I hope after the chaos, which was dreadful, though a rare event, he will have his bonuses stripped from him.' Around 70 flights were cancelled on Friday following the glitch, which shut down airspace over London and parts of southern England, leaving planes circling as engineers tried to fix the problem. A total of 38 more short-haul flights were cancelled yesterday at Heathrow as the airport tried to clear the backlog. Gatwick Airport said there had been 16 cancellations and seven diversions of inbound flights on Friday, but normal service resumed yesterday. Airports as far north as Aberdeen and Edinburgh were also affected by the computer problem. Other airports that reported delays on Friday included Manchester, Stansted, Luton and Bristol. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the disruption was 'simply unacceptable'. Dozens of flights were cancelled on Friday and Saturday with hundreds more delays after a computer system at air traffic control company Nats suffered a catastrophic failure . Around 70 flights were cancelled on Friday following the glitch, which shut down airspace over London and parts of southern England, leaving planes circling as engineers tried to fix the problem . MP Louise Ellman, chairman of the Transport Committee, said Mr McLoughlin will be asked about the the computer failure at Nats headquarters in Swanwick, Hampshire, when he appears before the panel tomorrow. Mr Deakin, who was paid more than £1million a year, including £272,000 in bonuses, told the BBC: 'The problem was when we had additional terminals brought into use and we had a software problem that we haven't seen before which resulted in the computer which looks after the flight plans effectively going off line. 'The good news is of course that everything came back online 45 minutes later, the back-up plans went into action as they should have done, so everything performed normally there, the skies were kept safe. 'Unfortunately there was reduced capacity and I would just like to reiterate our apology that we have made to passengers and indeed to airlines and airport customers for the disruption that was caused. 'But I think the key message is that the skies were kept absolutely safe during that 45 minutes of problems that we experienced at Swanwick.' Mr Deakin added that it was a 'very unusual event' which had not occurred before. Airlines are claiming the unprecedented IT failure was beyond their control - which enables them to dodge compensation claims from passengers. Pictured are passengers stranded at Heathrow . Frustrated passengers queue in the luggage hall at Heathrow's Terminal 5, where those arriving at the airport were told that they would have to go home without their bags following the Nats computer glitch . Cancellations and delays were experienced across all five London airports, including City (pictured), on Friday . He said: 'The challenge is that we have around 50 different systems at Swanwick and around four million lines of code. This particular glitch was buried in one of those four million lines of code.' Nats gave the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) a report earlier this year following major disruption caused by a communications problem last December. Nats bosses were told months before this weekend's flight chaos that their contingency plans for technical failures lacked 'detail and clarity'. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) told Nats earlier this year, after disruption to flights last December, that they needed to be better prepared for computer glitches, the Independent on Sunday reported. Around 300 flights were cancelled after last year's technical failures, leading the CAA to ask Nats to explain how they would ensure it would not happen again. The regulator said 'themes on avoiding a recurrence' were a 'good first step but lack detail and clarity'. A spokesman for the CAA said the report lacked detail. 'We asked them to do a little bit more work on it,' he said, adding that Nats said this weekend's chaos was unrelated to what caused last December's disruption. Despite thousands of passengers qualifying for up to £470 in compensation because of the long delays and cancellations, airlines may not have to pay up because of an EU loophole allowing them to refuse to pay out if the issue was caused by 'extraordinary circumstances'. It is unclear whether the computer glitch falls into that category, with experts warning that passenger payouts are not a certainty. Under EU rules, delayed passengers can claim compensation if they arrive at their destination more than three hours late. There are differing limits on payouts which depend on the length of the delay and how far the intended destination is away. But airlines can refuse to pay up if the issue which caused the delay was out of their control. Some airlines used this clause as reason not to pay out after the Icelandic volcano ash cloud caused chaos in 2010.","MP Paul Flynn calls for air traffic control boss to be stripped of bonuses .

"A serial sex offender who murdered teenage model Sally Anne Bowman has been moved to a new prison for his own protection, his victim's mother has revealed. Serial sex offender Mark Dixie, 44, was jailed for a minimum of 34 years after he killed the 18-year-old and had sex with her while she lay 'dead or dying' in 2005. Her partially naked body was left in a pool of blood in the driveway to her home in Croydon, south London. Killer: Serial sex offender Mark Dixie, 44, (left) who murdered teenage model Sally Anne Bowman (right) has been moved to a new prison for his own protection . Sally Anne, a student at the BRIT School for Performing Arts, had been stabbed seven times, bitten and subjected to a gruesome sexual attack. Dixie, a violent, sex-obsessed chef, was found guilty of her murder on February 22 2008 and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey. The judge recommended Dixie should not be released for a minimum of 34 years, by which time he will be 70 years old. This is among the longest minimum terms ever imposed upon a single murderer. Dixie was moved from Belmarsh Prison to HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire after inmates at the south London jail vowed to maim him after he was sentenced in February 2008. Mother: Sally Anne's mother Linda Bowman (left) has revealed that Dixie has been transferred for the second time after being 'slapped about' by fellow prisoners . Now Sally Anne's mother Linda Bowman has revealed he has been moved again after being 'slapped about' by fellow prisoners. This time he has been moved to HM Prison Frankland in County Durham - the same prison as child killer Ian Huntley. It is understood he was transferred earlier this year. 'Dixie is living in fear of being stabbed or beaten to death and I think that is the least he deserves,' said Mrs Bowman. 'He got himself put on a Vulnerable Person wing at Long Lartin because he said he feared for his life. First move: Dixie was moved from Belmarsh Prison to HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire after inmates at the south London jail vowed to maim him after he was sentenced in February 2008 . Transferred: This time Dixie has been moved to HM Prison Frankland in County Durham - the same prison as child killer Ian Huntley. It is understood he was transferred earlier this year . 'I've heard that he has been slapped about a couple of times but if you ask me, that's not far enough. 'He deserves a slow and painful death for what he has done. 'I can not get my head around the fact that there will be an empty space my Christmas table this year while he is looking forward to a festive party with his inmates. 'He doesn't deserve a fresh start. 'I want everyone to know what he is.' Dixie, who pleaded not guilty to murder, told the Old Bailey he had stumbled across Sally Anne's body outside her home and had sex with her before realising she was dead. However, he was found guilty of the teenager's murder, which took place while he was high on cocaine and alcohol on his 35th birthday. Grieving: Mrs Bowman (pictured centre with Sally Anne's sisters Nicola, left, and Michelle at the Old Bailey in 2008) says what Dixie has done to her family 'can never be undone' Mrs Bowman said: 'It may have been nine years to everyone else but to me and the rest of the family it may as well have been nine hours. 'We have all suffered so much because of that thing - I can't even bring myself to say his name sometimes. 'I have been unable to work since Sally Anne was killed and my health has deteriorated. 'What he has done to this family can never be undone. 'I wish someone would put a rope and a chair in his room and let him get on with it.' It was reported in 2009 that Mrs Bowman had heard there was a £50,000 bounty on Dixie's head. She said his repulsive crimes had made him a 'marked man' and disliked more than the other offenders. A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said he could not comment on individual cases.","Mark Dixie, 44, jailed for life after he killed 18-year-old Sally Anne Bowman .

"A stray bison which charmed a village of Poles has been shot dead by local farmers who feared the animal was seducing all of their cows. The animal, nicknamed Bartek the Bison, first appeared in Lakiele in autumn and quickly became a staple of village life. But after spending time grazing with cattle herds, the bison attracted the attention of the village's cows. Bartek the Bison (pictured) was shot dead by farmers who feared the rare animal was seducing all their cows . After growing accustomed to life in the village of Lakiele in northern Poland, the animal became acquainted with the local cattle herds . To the horror of local farmers, the livestock stopped returning to their barns to be milked at night instead staying in the field with Bartek. After calling a village meeting, the farmers agreed the animal should be killed despite protests from other residents. They hired two hunters to shoot Bartek dead before carting him off in a truck. The town's mayor, Jan Zaborowski, said the animal was causing no harm to the majority of the village. 'Despite his great size he was very gentle and was even given the name Bartek. We have no idea where he came from or how he got there, but he didn’t do any harm. 'He interested the locals and so he was fed and nobody bothered him. As a result although he was nervous at the start he began to spend more time in the local pastures than in the forest. The animals stopped returning to their barns at night to be milked, instead staying out to graze with Bartek . Local farmers hired two hunters to kill the animal, to the dismay of some villagers who had grown to love him . Mayor Jan Zaborowski (pictured) said Bartek the Bison was gentle and did not harm anyone in the village . 'At night the cows would stay with him rather than in their barn. I guess he was building himself a family and a herd of his own which is perfectly natural. 'But that didn’t impress the owners of the cows who were used to them coming home in the evening to be milked. All of a sudden they were staying out with the bison instead.' Millions of bison are thought to have roamed north America at one time, with slightly smaller versions of the animal found in Europe. The last wild European bison is thought to have been killed in 1929, with the only remaining members of the species protected in zoos or conservation efforts. A small number were released into the wild in the 1950's, with herds roaming across Eastern European countries today.","Bartek the Bison befriended villagers in Lakiele, northern Poland .

"With an open plan kitchen and a cosy corner bed, it's all you could want from a poky city flat. But this is a detached suburban home - and it's one of the smallest of its kind in the country. At just 14ft wide, the former Victorian coach house looks more like a childhood crayon sketch than a couple's first-time buy. Estate agents, however, insist the £99,950 price tag makes it just that. Bolthole: At just 14ft by 13ft, this former coach house in Sheffield could be Britain's smallest detached home . Cosy: The house is on sale for £99,950 - less than a fifth of the price of a garage sold in Chelsea, London . The property stands in the grounds of a larger Victorian house which was converted into 11 flats in the Sheffield suburb of Brincliffe. Measuring 14ft 1in by 12ft 9in, it has 359 sq ft over two floors excluding a garage which comes with the price. Into that space, the couple who live there currently have fitted an open-plan kitchen with a sofa and TV along with a bathroom, double bedroom and even a tiny landing. The bedroom measures 9ft 9in by 8ft 4in, enough room to squish in a double bed and a small shoe rack, along with a built-in wardrobe. The house's unusual design means it has had a wave of interest, say its estate agents - especially as detached houses in the same street have sold for up to £500,000. A room with two views: The bedroom measures 9ft 9in by 8ft 4in, enough room to squish in a double bed . Squeeze: The floor plan shows how the stairs rise over the electric hob, and there is even a small landing . Richard Atkinson from Haybrook estate agents claimed the house could be snapped up before Christmas. 'It's the smallest detached house I've ever seen,' he said. 'Despite only being on the market for about three weeks we've had lots of viewings - it's been a mixture of first time buyers and buy to let enquiries. 'The Coach House is such a unique place - it was incredibly hard to value. 'The living room takes up the entire ground floor which is exactly what people who after open plan living want. 'And you'll be hard pressed to find another detached house, with off-street covered parking, around here for under £100,000.' The price is indeed cheaper than the average detached home in Sheffield, which sells for £280,000, or even the average terraced house at £127,000. Bargain: The house is almost a third of the price of the average detached home in Sheffield, at £280,000 . Downside: Sadly its external walls and use of electric storage heaters mean it will cost more to keep warm . Bonus: The house comes with this garage. Estate agent Richard Atkinson said: 'You'll be hard pressed to find another detached house, with off-street covered parking, around here for under £100,000' But all those external walls mean the house is likely to cost far more to heat than the average home. It comes only with electric storage heaters and not gas central heating. The kitchen hob, too, runs on electricity. And the price will seem like a dream to anyone in London, where Britain's most expensive garage went on sale just weeks ago - for £550,000. The ramshackle lock-up off the King's Road in Chelsea earned the enormous auction house price tag because it had planning permission to be demolished and turned into a small house. Technically, there is a detached home which claims to be an inch smaller than the one in Sheffield - but it's a bit of a push. Developer Peter Hunter built the 14ft wide property last year in what used to be a parking space between two end-of-terrace houses in Northenden, Manchester. Unsurprisingly, his neighbours were not impressed - as the 70-year-old left a gap of just four inches on each side of his skinny home, blocking out a gable window. Technically, this 'detached' home in Manchester is an inch smaller - squeezed between two terraced homes . Comparison: Developer Peter Hunter, who built the 14ft wide property last year in what used to be a parking space between two end-of-terrace houses in Northenden, Manchester, left just a 4in gap on either side .","Former coach house was converted in Sheffield suburb of Brincliffe .

"Police arrested 173,0000 foreign crime suspects last year – one in every seven people who were apprehended nationwide. The figures from Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Records Office reveal the extraordinary strain being placed on the justice system by overseas criminals. In many cases, the suspects have lengthy criminal records back home which should have prevented them from entering the UK – or would allow for them to be deported. Police arrested 173,0000 foreign criminals last year – one in every seven suspects who were apprehended nationwide . But, alarmingly, police are only bothering to carry out checks in only 30 per cent of cases and in some force areas it is as low as six per cent. It means offenders who should have been detained are being bailed or, when they appear before the British courts, are not being sentenced properly because judges do not know about their criminal past. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said: ‘It is simply unacceptable that people with serious convictions could be allowed to enter the UK in the first place. ‘We need to tighten up our borders and get as much information as possible from our EU partners.’ The figures, released by ACRO to a BBC Five Live investigation, showed 14 per cent of all arrests in England and Wales last year were foreign nationals. (MUST) The National Audit Office told the BBC that the failure to carry proper checks is the result of the Home Office not having access to up to date computer and information sharing systems. In 2006, the Labour Government declined to join up to a Europe-wide information sharing regime, known as the Schengen Information System that would have given access to alerts on known criminals. It leaves Britain as one of only four countries out of 32 in the European Economic Area that cannot access the data. Under the Schengen arrangement, 2.5million alerts about EU criminals are issued every year. The UK does receive some information under separate data sharing arrangements – but missing out on half, or a disturbing 1.25million. There is a separate computer system, known as ECRIS, which the UK does have access to – but can only be used when a suspect is already inside the UK’s borders. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said the revelations were 'simply unacceptable' In only three out of every ten cases are officers bothering to use it. During October, there were huge differences between the number of checks carried out by individual forces. London’s the Met – which is running a specific operation to deport more foreign offenders – did checks in 100 per cent of cases. But for Greater Manchester Police the figure was only eight per cent. For Cleveland and the British Transport Police, it was just six per cent. The NAO said the system for tracking foreign offenders was in chaos. The Home Office has lost track of 760 of the 4,200 criminals who have been freed back on to our streets, including 58 ‘high harm’ individuals – a category that includes rapists, killers and drug dealers. Despite a ten-fold increase in case workers, the number of foreign prisoners has gone up by four per cent, to 10,649. Meanwhile, one in six overseas inmates freed from jail has absconded . The row follows a devastating report last week by the Chief Inspector of Immigration which revealed how foreign criminals – including a killer – had been able to obtain British citizenship. Home Office staff are not bothering to check for criminal records in a person’s homeland which could lead to their application being turned down. Yesterday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper claimed that, under Labour, ‘stronger checks’ will be carried out. Anyone seeking citizenship would have to produce the equivalent of Criminal Records Bureau documentation from their homeland. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ‘I think it's shocking that we have had people including serious criminals and killers being given British passports and British citizenship because the Home Office failed to do basic checks.’ Conservative backbencher Peter Bone blamed EU rules on free movement for allowing criminals into the UK. He said: ‘If someone is coming from the European Union, and we're talking about hundreds of thousands each year, there are no controls. They're not allowed to have controls, the EU won't let you.’ ACRO Chief Executive Ian Readhead said that, while criminal record checks had been carried out on only 30 per cent of suspects in 2013/14, progress had since been made. For the single month of October 2014, checks were made in 67 per cent of cases.","Figures from Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Records Office .

"A mother-of-three and her landlord have been arrested after she made her 10-year-old son wear a dress and put on make up as punishment for wetting the bed. Christle Prado and  Keith Driscoll from Winter Garden, Florida, were charged with cruelty toward children and infliction of mental injury on Thursday after an image of the boy dressed as a girl was posted on Facebook.

Arrested: Christle Prado and her landlord Keith Driscoll from Winter Garden, Florida, were charged with cruelty toward children and infliction of mental injury on Thursday . Prado reportedly laughed as she took pictures of her distressed son and when investigators arrived at the house, the boy was supposedly raking leaves in the yard. He is now in the care of his grandmother, who says that the boy has a known mental illness and that the abuse has gone on for far too long. She also claims that the pair also made him take a cold shower, threw ice at him and forced him to run around outside in the dress so all his friends could see him. She told Click Orlando: 'Tears were just pouring from his eyes, and I guess she seemed to think it was OK. 'I told him that it wasn't his fault and he didn't deserve it. He shouldn't be punished for something that is not his fault.' The grandmother has now taken Prado's three children into her custody. The Department of Children and Families added that there had been other investigations involving the woman. The cruelty charge is a second-degree felony. Representative Kristi Gray told WFTV: 'It was clear to me and anyone else who saw these pictures that this boy was clearly distraught and fearful about what was happening to him.' 'It becomes mental injury when the child is traumatized during the event and after the event,"" said Gray.'

"A man of 85 has died after the chaotic evacuation of a care home that was closed suddenly because of fears for its residents. He is understood to have passed away at another home less than 48 hours after he and 24 other residents were moved in freezing conditions in the dark. Residents of Merok Park, ordered to be shut by the Care Quality Commission, were seen waiting by the front door wrapped in blankets as they were removed with the help of police and paramedics. Evacuated: The 85-year-old-man, pictured in this photograph, died less than 48 hours after being removed from the care home in Surrey . Some were carried from their beds in nightclothes, belongings were moved in bin liners, and families complained that they were left with no information about transport for their loved ones. The home in Banstead, Surrey, described by families of residents as a ‘dump’, is owned by Mauritian businessman Soodressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee. Another of their homes, Grantley Court in Sutton, has also since been evacuated on the instructions of council officials. The death of the former resident of Merok Park has led to calls for the owners to be investigated. It will also draw attention to conditions in the home and others owned by the Cooppens, and the way the authorities dealt with the evacuation of residents. A spokesman for the Warrengate Nursing Home in nearby Kingswood, where the man was taken, said the sudden move could have been a shock for him. Holiday: Care home owners Soodressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee were sen enjoying their daughter's 18th birthday party in Mauritius . The Cooppens, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the inspectorate earlier this year for failing to keep proper records . Zeenat Mehboob Rajan, director of Claremont Care Services, which owns the home, said it was a ‘well-known fact’ that moving elderly people could cause premature death. He added: ‘Two people were moved here. One is doing well and the other was quite sick, and his death was an expected one. ‘It may have been a few days later that he died if he wasn’t moved, but obviously when you move people it creates shock.’ Mr Rajan said he believed the family were ‘in bereavement’ and would not wish to comment. It is understood the man is survived by a widow, a son and two daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is believed to have died at Warrengate in the early hours of last Thursday, after being moved there in the evacuation on Tuesday. A post mortem examination is understood to have been carried out and the circumstances of the death are likely to be examined at an inquest. South East Coast Ambulance Service said an ambulance and a response car were sent to the Warrengate home just after 5.30am on Thursday. Leslie Shields, whose 78-year-old father was one of the residents moved from Merok Park, said the man’s death should be investigated by the police. The CQC said it carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1 and, after the visit, it was decided that the care facility had to close immediately . It was reported that staff at the care home were working up to 60 hours per week and that they had not been given relevant training. A recent care quality inspection found that residents were being washed in cold water . ‘We did warn the care home that moving these elderly residents was a complete mistake, but no one cared,’ he said. ‘We were told that the stress of moving my father would be detrimental to his health, and maybe his life.’ His father, who has dementia, is now in another home. The 53-year-old car mechanic said: ‘I’ve seen animals in better condition than the residents at Merok Park. The care home owners should face criminal charges. ‘You shouldn’t be able to make money on the misery of others.’ Merok Park was closed on the instructions of the CQC after elderly residents were found in unsanitary conditions and discovered to have been forced to wash in cold water by untrained staff. Surrey Police confirmed uniformed officers assisted with the closure of the home and removing residents . Inspectors found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine at the home, which charged residents £500 a week for their places. The home was given a clean bill of health by the watchdog in January, despite numerous complaints from relatives going back years. The Cooppens, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the inspectorate earlier this year for failing to keep proper records. Grantley Court was evacuated by Sutton council after an inspectors’ report said the dignity of residents was not respected and some were left in soiled and wet clothing. Mr Cooppen, 51, and his wife, who is 42, take frequent holidays in Mauritius. On Saturday the Mail published pictures of a lavish party on the island for their daughter’s 18th birthday. The Daily Mail could not reach the couple for comment.","Merok Park, in Surrey, ordered to be shut by the Care Quality Commission .

"Supermarkets are slashing the cost of champagne this Christmas with bottles of bubbly are on offer for as little as £8. Many are touting quality wines and champagnes at half-price in an attempt to compete with budget retailers like Ali and Lidl. Asda sparked the price war by cutting the price of Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to just £10, giving customers almost a 60% saving with an offer that runs until January 1. Scroll down for video . Asda sparked the price war by cutting the price of Pierre Darcys champagne, left, to £10, and Tesco responded by dropping the cost of award-winning Louis Delaunay to a bargain £8 . Moet & Chandon is offered at a discount in many supermarkets, including Sainsbury's for £25 and right, Morrisons are touting Nicolas Feuillatte Brut champagne at half price . Tesco responded by knocking two-thirds off the official list price of award-winning Louis Delaunay champagne - from £25.99 to only £8, making it the cheapest on offer in Britain until the deal expired on December 2. The drink, which comes from the town of Dizy, in the Champagne region of France, has strong floral aromas and an elegant citrus flavour. This summer, it won a bronze medal at International Wine & Spirit Competition – an event considered the Oscars for the wine and champagne industry. Tesco's champagne buyer Charlie Craven said: 'This is a quality, award-winning champagne and to find something this good for £8 on British high streets you'd have to go back at least 10 years. Aldi's bargain Veuve Monsigny, left, priced £9.99, and Lidl's cheap Comte de Senneval, right, at £11.99 have been flying off the shelves . 'We're delighted that we can bring this to our customers at such a fantastic price.' And many major shops are offering deals on Moet & Chandon, including Sainsbury's who have discounted the popular bubbly by £10 - from £35 to £25. Morrisons is offering Nicolas Feuillatte Brut champagne for half price, slashing the cost from £29.99 to £14.99. Discount emporiums Aldi and Lidl's cut-price bubbly has sent the cost of champagne to a ten-year low. This year has seen the cut-price retailers attract new shoppers with delicacies and luxury ranges offered at bargain prices. Aldi's bargain Veuve Monsigny, priced £9.99 and Lidl's cheap Comte de Senneval at £11.99 flew off the shelves, but also saw favourable reviews. Suppliers fear the loss-leading tactics are unsustainable and have no bearing on the cost price of champagne . But a leading supplier has hit out at the loss-leading tactics, adding champagne is being held 'hostage' in the bubbly price wars. Julie Campos, managing director designate at Nicolas Feuillatte, told Off Licence News: 'I had difficulty believing Tesco was selling champagne for £8. 'I had to go to the shop to see it for myself. It was obviously being sold at a loss. 'Selling champagne at £8 a bottle has no bearing on the cost price. It's extremely misleading to the consumer. 'Champagne has become a bit of a hostage. The retail market is not expanding so the only way to improve figures is to grow market share.' Ms Campos explained that tactics employed by rival retailers are not sustainable and send the wrong message to consumers. She added: 'There has been a tendency in the past few years to cut prices on a few key products, such as champagne, to get consumers in the door, even if you sell at a loss. It attracts consumer attention, but it's dangerous for champagne. 'How long can it continue? It's not sustainable and it sends the wrong message to the consumer.' She added: 'There's nothing we can do. It's illegal to sell at a loss in France but not in the UK. 'It's a very touchy issue, because consumer spending power is down and making popular things cheaper doesn't get attacked - it's popular politically to do it. 'It's unfair on the companies that spend years investing in the vineyards and cellars and ageing the wines to deliver year-on-year quality, and spending a lot of money on marketing, to have people come in on the back of all that and sell it at a loss, it's frustrating to say the least.'

"This is the astonishing moment a Polish man solved a Rubik’s cube in just 21.17 seconds – while blindfolded.

The speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the Rubik’s cube and then, while blindfolded, he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in Szczecin in western Poland. A judge held a piece of paper between Marcin's face and his hands to make sure he couldn't peek under his mask. His celebration was subdued, however, as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle.

"An Australian mother, 51, has appeared in court on charges of drug smuggling in Malaysia. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto was allegedly found with 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamines - also known as ice - at Kuala Lumpur airport during a stopover. The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers she was not guilty and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers that she was innocent and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs . Defence lawyer Muhammed Shafee Abdullah said Ms Pinto had been 'used by unscrupulous people' and would likely be able to prove she was not guilty of the charge. 'There is a very strong chance that she is one of those naive and innocent mules that has been used by some unscrupulous people,' he told reporters at the court. She faced a Kuala Lumpur court on Sunday - which was closed to the public and the media - when she remained in custody and is set to reappear again on Friday when she is expected to be charged. After her appearance, Mr Shafee told reporters Ms Pinto was told by the soldier that he needed documents inside the bag to be taken to Melbourne in order to organise his discharge. Ms Exposto's children said they have been concerned about their mother. 'We all love our mum,"" the family told the Nine Network. 'We are all worried for her and all praying for the best.' The mother - who could face the death penalty - was told she would then hand over the bag to another person at Melbourne airport. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto was taken into custody before she was about boarded a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport (above) in Malaysia . But before Ms Pinto was able to board the next leg of her flight, she was stopped by airport customs while she was en route to the Victorian capital from Shanghai. Customs director Chik Omar Chik Lim said the Liverpool woman was about to board about 5pm when the scanner picked up the methamphetamines 'wrapped in plastic and stashed inside a secret compartment in her travel bag'. She was then questioned by police about the drugs that were detected, which are worth $93,000 in Malaysia. The mother, 51, said she was carrying the bag on behalf of a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan who told her she was going to pass it on to someone at Melbourne airport (above) Since 1960, more than 440 people have been hanged in the south-east Asian country. Hanging is inevitable for people who are found guilty of smuggling more than 50 grams of methamphetamines. The arrest follows the release of 22-year-old Australian Kalynda Davis who was arrested in China on drug smuggling charges earlier this month. Ms Davis faced execution by firing squad along with New Zealander Peter Gardner for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Australia from China. While Miss Davis returned home to Sydney earlier this week, Mr Gardner remains in Chinese custody.

"Members of the House of Lords have been attacked after claiming their exclusive restaurants had become 'downmarket'. Peers are said to be angry that ordinary office workers with a Parliamentary pass are now allowed to join them at their taxpayer-subsidised dining areas. Lords catering officials allowed other people into the dining hall to cut the eye-watering £2.3million subsidy. Peers have criticised the House of Lords catering facilities for becoming 'downmarket' like high street pizza chains . The exclusive Barry Room was turned into a brasserie where ordinary workers can now bring up to six guests. But one diner was left unimpressed – firing off a complaint against the 'downgrading' of the restaurants and 'the appalling search for mediocrity'. Other complaints — revealed by the Sun under Freedom of Information rules — attacked the quality of food and angry staff. One lord said he could get better food in a 'down market establishment like Prezzo or Ask'. Another suggested the chef who had made a mushroom roll 'should be sent to Pizza Express or Zizzi and probably Cafe Rouge'. One peer even complained he would get a better-value breakfast for £36 at London's five-star Ritz Hotel. Last night the TaxPayers' Alliance said the complaints 'beggared belief'. It comes after it emerged the House of Lords had refused to share catering services with MPs - because they were worried about the quality of champagne. A plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both Houses of Parliament was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly, according to a former Commons chief. While the Lords and MPs share IT, cleaning and archive services, reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far. The House of Lords refused to merge catering contracts with the Commons because they 'feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service' Governance committee chairman Jack Straw expressed astonishment at the revelation about champagne from former Commons Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack (right) A group of MPs is examining the way the House of Commons is run, following the row over John Bercow's plan to install an Australian woman as Clerk. But one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines. Former Clerk Sir Malcolm Jack revealed the tensions between the two Houses of Parliament when the committee took evidence. He insisted that 'joint services must be a good idea' and they already exist in ICT and the running of the estate. 'Nevertheless, there are historical differences between the Houses.' He said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated Pugin Room, complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets, belongd to the Commons or the Lords. Sir Malcolm added: 'The person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service, and it was eventually thrown out in the House of Lords because the Lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.' Former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, chairman of the Commons governance committee, was taken aback by the claim, asking: 'Did you make that up? Is that true?' But Sir Malcolm insisted it had happened. 'Yes, it is true, he said. 'It should not be beyond the wit of man, Chair, to brigade the services together and deliver them differently. Former Lib Dem minister David Heath, who sits on the committee, remarked: 'You can never underestimate the capacity for self-parody in this place.' Since 2010 the House of Lords has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £265,770. It is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer. A Lords spokesman said: 'The House of Lords would not reject a merger of catering services with the House of Commons simply on the supply of champagne. 'The House of Lords catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the House of Commons, and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the House of Lords. All alcohol sold in the House of Lords is sold at a profit.'","Peers  angry that ordinary office workers are now allowed to dine with them .

"Are you dreaming of a white Christmas? If so, this map may - or may not - be the answer to your wishes. According to the NOAA graphic, residents of Minnesota, Maine, upstate New York, Idaho, West Virginia and the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania are likely to see snowfall on December 25. Meanwhile, those in the bottom half of the Lower 48 states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia, have a significantly lower chance of experiencing a white Christmas. Scroll down for video . A white Christmas? According to this NOAA map, residents of Minnesota, Maine, upstate New York, Idaho, West Virginia and the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania are likely to experience a white Christmas . The map, posted on the Administration's website, measures the historic probability of there being at least one inch of snow on the ground in various American states on Christmas Day. It is based on 'climate normals' from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, from 1981 to 2010. Dark gray shows the states where the probability of a white Christmas is less than 10 per cent, blue depicts where chance is around 50 per cent, and white shows probabilities higher than 90 percent. According to the graphic, Aspen, Colorado, is one of only around a dozen locations in the Northwest boasting a 100 per cent historical probability of seeing snowfall on December 25. Winter: This graphic, also by NOAA, shows snow depth across the US today (Sunday, December 14) Snowy: This NOAA satellite image, taken on Saturday, shows an area of low pressure over the Intermountain West. Snow is shortly expected to move across Montana and Idaho - and could stick around for Christmas . Unsurprisingly, the Rockies or the Sierra Nevada Mountains are also expected to see the white stuff. Despite the predictions, there is always the chance that the weather will take a surprising turn, potentially resulting in a white Christmas for areas that do not expect it. In 2004, a snowstorm on Christmas Eve brought the first white Christmas in 50 years to New Orleans, and the first one ever recorded to Houston, Texas. Meanwhile, the Florida winter storm of 1989 brought snow to a number of unsuspecting cities, including Pensacola and Jacksonville, on Christmas Day. Snowy: Michael Russell uses a snowblower to clear snow along South Nice Street in Frackville, Pennsylvania on Thursday. The state's Allegheny Mountains  are likely to see snowfall on December 25, the map reveals .

Thomas breaks down in tears several times in the interview following the August 5 incident, which focuses on the moments before Crawford was shot dead after picking up a BB gun in the Beavercreek Walmart outlet. A 911 caller had told police the replica gun was actually a real assault rifle, which led officer Sean Williams to gun him down. A grand jury later decided not to indict him for the killing. Tasha Thomas swore repeatedly on her own life, and the graves of her dead relatives, that she was being honest, despite Curd telling her she was phrasing her answers like 'someone not telling the truth', and saying he expected her testimony to change later. Shot dead: Crawford, pictured right with his mother, Tressa Sherrod, was killed after a 911 caller said he had a gun in the store . Moments before: Crawford can be seen above moments before he is killed by officer Sean Williams . Officer Curd: 'You and John went into Walmart, at some point as I understand it, John produced a gun. You were with him just moments before that, weren't you?' Tasha Thomas: Yes, sir . Curd: OK, Tell me where he got the gun from. Thomas: Sir I don't know - I honestly don't know. Curd: And the truth is you knew at some point he did carry a gun, isn't it? Thomas: No sir, I didn't know. I swear I didn't know. Curd: You see, I'm having trouble with this. Thomas: [Through tears] Please, give me a lie detector test! Footage from 94-minute interview, released to the news site by the Ohio attorney general, shows Curd grilling Thomas at length on her version of events, at times banging his hand on the table for emphasis. He also pursues a theory that Crawford had taken his own, real, gun into the store in order to shoot his ex-girlfriend, LeeCee Johnson. At one point he asks her: 'Did he ever mention ""I'm gonna shoot that bitch"", or something like that?' Thomas replied that he didn't, and that as far as she was aware she was in Cincinnati and not in the store. Although the grand jury concluded that the shooting was justified, federal officials are looking into the case. Earlier this month it was reported that Officer Williams, who also killed a man in 2010, will remain on leave until after that investigation. MailOnline has contacted the police department for comment.","New footage shows interview with partner of slain John Crawford III .

"If you devour your Christmas dinner but can't bring yourself to sample the cook's Brussels's sprouts, you may now have an excuse: it's in your genes. A chemistry teacher has created an infographic explaining the chemistry and genetics behind why some people can’t stand the taste of bitter vegetables. Those who loathe the seasonal greens, Andy Brunning explains, may be especially sensitive to naturally occurring chemical compounds called glucosinolates. Hate sprouts? You've got a new excuse: A chemistry teacher argues that there may be a chemical and genetic reason why some people can’t stand the taste of Brussels sprouts. People who loathe the seasonal green vegetables may be especially sensitive to chemical compounds called glucosinolates, which occur naturally in sprouts . The Bournemouth-based teacher, who runs the blog Compound Interest, explained that these compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked. These compounds, while bitter to everyone, taste especially unpalatable to almost three quarters of humans. A similar phenomenon is observed in a synthetic compound called Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), not found in sprouts, that tastes bitter to 70 per cent of people, while remaining tasteless to the remaining 30 per cent. It was discovered when a chemist called Arthur Fox, who was working at DuPont in 1931, accidentally spilt some of the chemical. While it did not affect him, his colleague complained of a bitter taste, leading the scientists to not only discover that it only tastes bitter to some people, but that those that the ability to taste it is genetic. Bournemouth-based teacher Andy Brunning, explained that the compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked, which have similar properties to man-made compounds that taste bitter to almost three quarters of people, causing them to find the small festive vegetables unpleasant (pictured) Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates. While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer. This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties. Similarly, another compound called propylthiouracil (PROP) only tastes bitter to certain people. Mr Brunning explained that while neither compound can be found in sprouts, they both contain a thiocyanate group in their molecular structures, which is thought to be related to their bitter taste. And the same group is found in glucosinolate compounds, which occur naturally in Brussels sprouts. They are also found in broccoli, cabbage and kale, known as cruciferous vegetables. It’s thought they protect the plants against diseases and ward off insects that nibble on them. Mr Brunning writes: ‘There seems to be a strong association between the ability to detect the bitter taste of PTC and PROP and a sensitivity to the bitterness of these vegetables,’ suggesting that the reason why some people find sprouts so unpleasant, may be genetic. ‘It’s not the case that sensitivity to PTC and PROP automatically implies a dislike of cruciferous vegetables. ‘But if you’re a Brussels sprouts hater, you can now suggest a potential chemical reason for your dislike if you’re ever berated for your perceived vegetable prejudice.’ Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, which is a product of the glucosinolates. While research is ongoing, it suggests that sulforaphanes may protect against neurodegenerative diseases and even cancer. This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigate for its antioxidant properties.","People who loathe Brussels sprouts may be especially sensitive to chemical compounds called glucosinolates .

"Geoffrey Edelsten has vehemently denied he owes the Australian Tax Office $14 million in taxes. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Edelsten said the idea he owed ATO that much money was 'not possible and fictitious'. It comes as News Corp reported the bankrupted businessman had $14.1 million in fines and taxes outstanding. Scroll down for video . Geoffrey Edelsten has vehemently denied he owes the Australian Tax Office $14 million in taxes . But the 71-year-old said it was just a figure that had been quoted in court and was forecasting what he was expected to pay to the ATO by December 2015. 'I'm not earning enough to warrant $14 million,' he said. 'It was said in court and the media has got hold of it. There's no truth to it at all.' Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Edelsten (pictured here with his fiancée Gabi Grecko) said the idea he owed ATO that much money was 'not possible and fictitious' Mr Edelsten said the most the ATO could chase him for was $5 million, which he would be satisfied to settle on. 'We would be happy for them to get that claim,' he said. His comments come after the office took steps in the United States to recover what is owned to them through a deal settled between the businessman and his overseas creditors, News Corp reported. It comes as News Corp reported the bankrupted businessman had $14.1 million in fines and taxes outstanding . The ATO was able to secure a place at a mediation - which will take place within 60 days - with other creditors. During this meeting, they will decide among them how to divide up Mr Edelsten's remaining assets. But according to a lawyer who took part in securing the agreement, the ATO would only be able to recover five cents for every dollar. Mr Edelsten said the most the ATO could chase him for was $5 million, which he would be satisfied to settle on . The ATO will face opposition from U.S. creditors who will not be keen to let it get a slice of an already small pie as Mr Edelsten's properties are now worth much less then what he paid for. Florida's Marwadi family have settled with Mr Edelsten over a merger that went bad and has left the 71-year-old broke. The businessman said he was persuaded to invest more than $20 million on distressed properties like a derelict casino in the Dominican Republic he had not seen before his purchase. His comments come after the office took steps in the United States to recover what is owned to them through a deal settled between the businessman and his overseas creditors, News Corp reported . Robert Stok - the Marwadi family's lawyer - told News Corp the ATO should have seized the opportunity to get its money when Mr Edelsten was meant to pay his taxes after he sold off a Victorian Allied super clinic in 2011 for $30 million. He also pointed out the office had known about the court action for a year and did not make their intentions known until now. 'They should have acted like any taxing agency and enforced payment of the tax obligation by one of its citizens,' Mr Stok said. According to a lawyer, the ATO would only be able to recover five cents for every dollar . 'That's what they should have done. They declared he owed them $10m on 2012 — it's even on Wikipedia. Now they're swooping in and trying to upset the applecart.' Mr Stok, who claimed the ATO would be lucky to get five cents for every dollar of its money owed, said the government agency would be able to recover more if investigations found Mr Edelsten had other assets, such as unsubstantiated interests in the Indonesian coal mining industry, which is worth $10 million. But Mr Edelsten said Mr Stok had no way of knowing how much the ATO could recover as it was dependent on what the trustee was able to uncover and legal fees spent to recover that sum. The businessman (pictured with ex-wife Brynne) said he had spent US$3 million on legal fees in the past two years on the U.S. court action. The businessman added he had spent US$3 million on legal fees in the past two years on the U.S. court action. The ATO refused to comment on the matter but it was understood by News Corp that the agency could start looking into Mr Edelsten who was accused of moving his money around trusts. But the Australian Federal Court was able to confirm that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has precedence over any other foreign agencies and it was up to the Florida court to see how money would be handed out. It was reported judges are pleased with the outcome and were surprised by the result.","Geoffrey Edelsten has denied he owes the Australian Tax Office $14 million .

"A strange white speck of 'light' on a recent photograph taken by Curiosity rover has led some to believe that life is thriving on Mars. UFO blogger Scott Waring claims that the new photograph taken by the rover suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground. But Nasa, perhaps rather unsurprisingly, are not quite heralding it as the discovery of the century just yet. Scroll down for video . Life on Mars? In this photo taken by the Curiosity rover a light of unknown origin can be seen in the distance . The Curiosity rover is currently exploring an area of Mars known as ‘the Kimberley.’ Named after a region of western Australia, the area sees four different types of rock intersect and is scientifically fascinating. The particular spot the rover is in ‘gives us a great view for context imaging of the outcrops at the Kimberley,’ Melissa Rice of the California Institute of Technology said in a release. Over the next few weeks, Rice will be leading the science for the rover as it drills and analyses rocks at the location. But it’s not the fact that a car-sized vehicle is exploring an alien world 57 million miles (92 million km) away that piqued the interest of Waring. Rather, what appears to be an anomaly in a photo has caught the attention of him and other UFO enthusiasts. Enhance: Closer up it's not any clearer what the light source is, but it's probably just an anomaly in the photo . ‘An artificial light source was seen this week in this NASA photo which shows light shining upward from… the ground,’ Waring writes on his website. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. ‘This could indicate there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do. He goes on to claim: ‘This is not a glare from the sun, not is it an artifact of the photo process. ‘Look closely at the bottom of the light. ‘It has a very flat surface giving us 100 per cent indication it is from the surface. ‘Sure Nasa could go and investigate it, but hey, they are not on Mars to discover life, but there to stall its discovery.’ According to NASA, however, the bright spot is not that unusual. Curiosity takes images using two cameras, one in its right eye and the other in its left. While the image from the right eye shows this bright spot, the same image from the left eye does not. Now you see it, now you don't: In a image taken by Curiosity's other camera at the same time the bright spot has disappeared, suggesting it was merely a glint or an artifact in the first photo . 'One possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun,' a NASA spokesperson tells MailOnline. 'When these images were taken each day, the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot, west-northwest from the rover, and relatively low in the sky. 'The rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be caused by cosmic rays striking the camera's detector. 'Among the thousands of images received from Curiosity, ones with bright spots show up nearly every week.' Ben Biggs, editor of All About Space magazine, says we should not jump to any conclusions when seeing images like this. 'While the ""light"" is as yet unexplained, it's quite a leap to assume that it has an intelligent source,' he says. 'The public can afford to speculate wildly but Nasa is an organisation internationally renowned for credible science. 'It needs to exhaust every other likely explanation before it can begin to explore less realistic phenomena.' Curiosity has been operational on Mars since August 2012 and is now on its way to Mount Sharp. This 'find' came a few days before Curiosity celebrated a Martian year - 687 Earth days - on 24 June, having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once could support life . This is not the first time a photo from Mars has incorrectly caused some to declare we’ve made first contact. One famous occurrence was the ‘Face on Mars.’ On . 25 July 1976 Nasa’s Viking 1 orbiter released an image of a region . called Cydonia that seemed to show a human face on the Red Planet. In . reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia, . where the human brain picks out faces in an object, in this instance a . chance aligning of shifting sand. In . 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) imaged the region and again . and showed that the sand had continued shifting, erasing the ‘face’ from the surface. In 1976 the Viking 1 orbiter snapped an image of a region of Mars that looked like a human face (left), leading some to claim it was a sign of intelligent life, but 30 years later it was proven to just be a sand dune (right) Over the next few weeks the Curiosity rover will perform some of its most extensive investigations on Mars since it landed in August 2012. Once it has examined this region of Yellowknife Bay it will continue its journey to its ultimate destination of Mount Sharp. This fascinating geological region will provide scientists with a multitude of data about the history of the Red Planet. And they may even be able to prove that the planet was once habitable enough for life to exist. But it’s unlikely they’ll detect any life currently residing on Mars.","A new Nasa photo appears to show an artificial light on the Red Planet .

"These incredible self-portraits shot in remote landscapes capture the essence of a young photographer's wanderlust. Taken across Iceland, Wales and her native Canada, snapper Elizabeth Gadd scouts out breath-taking locations and drops herself right in the middle of her amazing photographs. In one photo, Elizabeth, from Vancouver, Canada, strides away from the abandoned hull of a plane as snow-tipped mountains watch over in the distance. Elizabeth Gadd's 'Be Still' image is her favourite and she described it as being one of the 'calmest moments in my life' One of Ms Gadd's incredible images from Skgafoss Waterfall in southern Iceland, with the force of nature spectacularly overwhelming . Taken across Iceland, Wales and Canada, snapper Elizabeth Gadd scouts out breath-taking locations and drops herself right in the middle . Her favourite photo is entitled 'Be Still', where she is stood in the middle of a foggy lake surrounded by mountains. Elizabeth said: 'I remember it being one of the quietest, calmest experiences of my life. 'I set up the camera on the shore and then walked knee-deep into the cold water and stood still for several minutes. 'Every time the water stilled completely, I would move slightly to create ripples around me for the photos. 'The only other movement around was a small flock of geese quietly floating across the water in the distance. 'With everything so quiet and still, it felt almost as if that moment was frozen and I was suspended in time.' Ms Gadd's incredible self-portraits are shot in remote landscapes and they capture the essence of the young photographer's wanderlust . The scene of Ms Gadd surrounded by snow-covered mountains and trees in the US state of Oregon is like something out of a fairy tale . Ms Gadd uses a remote control to take the photos and often does several takes to get the light and setting just right . Many of Ms Gadd's photographs involved her running through scenic landscapes; this one is taken in a park in Vancouver, Canada . This incredible image was taken in jungle a forest in Hawaii, where Ms Gadd almost blends in with the tree trunks . As a result of being the subject of her own pictures, self-confessed introvert Elizabeth is often hundreds of metres away from her camera. She has to use the remote to continually take pictures, but because of the distance the weather and light often change throughout each shoot. Subsequently, each picture can take up to two hours to perfect before the conditions are just right. Stunning backdrop: There's friends to be made as Ms Gadd snaps herself with horses in Iceland . This misty mountain shoot leads the viewer to do a double take to realise the expanse of forestry in the background .

A photograph of Iceland's Fjadrargljufur canyon, with Ms Gadd's position perched on the edge of an overhang looking precarious . The wonders of nature are beautifully demonstrated in Ms Gadd's stunning set of self-portrait photographs . Elizabeth said: 'There's a lot of running back and forth between the camera and where I want to be in the photo. 'I take a lot of test photos and making sure the scene is how I want it to be but I often find the whole process quite therapeutic. 'I've always loved nature but wanted to challenge myself to take self-portraits to expand my repertoire. 'I am continually awe-struck by nature and the landscapes both humble and inspire me endlessly. 'Hopefully the resulting images depict the feelings of nostalgia, wonder and peace that I regularly feel when I'm out in nature.'","Photographer Elizabeth Gadd scouts out breath-taking locations and drops herself right in the middle .

"A superyacht firm has unveiled plans for its latest luxury vessel – a 115ft power boat shaped like a catamaran. Sunreef Yachts have released images of the new design, the Sunreef Power 115, which is expected to cost £8million to £10million to build. It offers around 7,320 square feet of living space, and vessel can accommodate up to 12 guests. Scroll down for video . Shaped like a catamaran, the Sunreef Power 115 from Sunreef Yachts is expected to cost £8million to £10million to build . The yacht includes a sprawling 860-square foot living room, a galley, office, gymnasium and a 540-square foot master stateroom with an outdoor terrace. The suite features a separate dressing room and en-suite bathroom. Also on the main deck are a kitchen and dining area. Buyers are also being given the opportunity to tweak the design to their own specifications. The superyacht includes a sprawling living room, office, gymnasium and a master stateroom with a terrace overlooking the sea . The lower deck offers plenty of space for a 12-person motor dinghy, two personal watercraft, four sea bobs, and a diving set. The Sunreef Power 115 has been created by the company's Gdansk-based yard in Poland. It can also accommodate six crew members and will manage a top speed of 30 knots. The company's website said: 'Power was designed for the type of client who truly loves everything a catamaran has to offer, especially the large open spaces and increased stability, but one who also admires the sleek look of superyachts.' Sunreef Power 115 offers around 7,320 square feet of living space and can accommodate up to 12 guests and six crew members . Sunreef have designed and created more 60 superyachts since they were set up in 2002. The company is now a world leader in the design and construction of large, customised luxury catamarans.

"Monaco has declared a public holiday on January 7th to celebrate the birth of twin heirs, Prince Jacques Honore Rainier and Princess Gabriella Therese Marie. The babies, who were born last Wednesday by caesarean section, will also make their public debut - from the balcony of the Palais Princier in their parents' arms. The news of the royal celebrations comes as their mother, South African born Princess Charlene, 36, prepares to leave hospital with the twins. Scroll down for video . Going home: Princess Charlene, who has been recovering from the birth, is expected to leave hospital today . On her way: The royal and her babies have been inside the Princess Grace Hospital since Wednesday . Charlene has not been seen since an appearance on Monaco's National Day last month and has been in hospital since arriving to give birth on Wednesday morning. Husband Prince Albert, 56, has been a regular visitor but took an afternoon off on Friday for the official birth certificate ceremony held in the throne room at the Palais Princier. The ceremony, which involves having the certificates signed and witnessed by 20 guests, was also celebrated by Princess Stéphanie, who, with her daughters Pauline Ducruet, 20, and Camille Gottlieb, 16, clinked champagne glasses with Albert as they celebrated the birth. Away from the Palais Princier, the birth of the twins was celebrated with a 42-shot cannon salute on the night they were born which swiftly brought excited Monegasques onto the streets. The following day saw a formal announcement of the birth in a ceremony held outside the flag-festooned palace. Proud: Prince Albert found himself cheered to the rafters as he attended an AS Monaco match last night . Delighted: The new father also oversaw a formal birth certificate ceremony for the babies on Friday . Visit: Prince Albert II, pictured left, has been a regular visitor to the hospital . Legitimate: The babies are the heirs to Albert's throne and replace his sister Caroline . New father Albert, who has two illegitimate children from previous relationships, also found himself cheered to the rafters when he took his seat in the stands at an AS Monaco football match last night. Babies Gabriella and Jaques arrived within minutes of each other on Wednesday evening, with the little girl born first at 5.04pm and her brother following two minutes later at 5.06pm. Despite being the younger, it will be Prince Jacques who succeeds his father on the throne, thanks to Monaco's continued embrace of Salic law which states that male heirs always take precedence over their older sisters. She will, however, get a title, becoming the Countess of Carlades, while Crown Prince Jacques will get the traditional style of Marquis of Baux - a name always given to the first born son. The children, who are the first for 36-year-old Princess Charlene, were delivered at the Princess Grace Hospital, which is named after their late grandmother. Love: The Prince, right, and Princess Charlene, left, were married in 2011, eleven years after they had first met . Celebration: The Royal Palace was illuminated in red and white to mark the arrival of the baby twins . Colourful: Red and white Monagasque flags hang from every window at the Palais Princier . Albert, who was once considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors, succeeded his father Prince Rainier in 2005 at the age of 47. He already had a daughter, Jazmin, 22, after a fling with former waitress Tamara Rotolo. He denied being her father for years before DNA tests proved otherwise when she was a teenager. The prince also has a younger son, Alexandre Coste, 11, from an affair with Nicole Coste, a Togolese former Air France hostess. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of them have any claim to royal titles or to be considered as heirs to Albert because they were born outside of marriage. They do however have legal rights to a share of his huge personal fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine to exceed $1 billion (800 million euros). Formal: Two placards, one in French and one in English, were used to announce the royal birth . Tradition: Royal births are usually announced with 21 blasts but this time, 42 cannon blasts were needed .","The Monaco royal twins will make their public debut on 7th January .

"Many men shy away from the yoga studio, dismissing it as 'too feminine and spiritual'. But a new, 'manlier' form of the exercise loved by Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has  launched to help  men tone up. Yoga for men is being dubbed 'broga' and a photographer has released a photo series showing tattooed and bearded men practicing the spiritual exercise. Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, a new photo series created by a U.S.-based photographer shows  tattooed and bearded men practicing the work-out . Photographer Amy Goalen, 40, from Santa Monica, California, has released her photo project, called Inside the Warrior, in the hope of proving that yoga has changed. From downward dog to warrior pose, Amy says that these tattooed and bearded men prove that you don't need to be a spiritual female or a hippy vegetarian to enjoy this activity. Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, photographer Amy Goalen has released the project, which she calls Inside the Warrior, to prove that yoga has changed . Proof: Amy wanted to capture men practicing the gentle work-out to show that it's becoming more and more fashionable among macho men . Seeing things from a different perspective: The photo series shows macho men doing broga at every opportunity, including in the middle of a busy New York street . Work out: Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme, says broga's founder . Popular: Clearly popular over in the states, as these images prove, more and more broga studios are opening their doors in the UK, too . And it seems that the exercise is taking off. 'Yoga is not just for girls,' broga's creator Matt Miller, a college American football star turned bodybuilder and nutrition expert, recently told Men's Fitness magazine. 'Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme.' Miller learned that the hard way, dealing with injuries from years of running, colliding and lifting that left him with what he calls a 'severely limited' range of motion. He discovered yoga after signing on as an ambassador with clothing brand Lululemon - and soon started to wonder why he'd never done it before. Flexible: Experts say that broga can help athletes recover from injuries and boost their range of motion . Strength training: Fitness experts say that certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training . Beneficial: Experts say that broga helps with increased mobility and, as a result, helps men lift heavier weights and boost their work-outs . Combining his studies with his own personal training experience, he created broga, a style designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability. It's now being taught at locations around southeast England, with more trainers and locations being created on a near-monthly basis. Personal trainer Jack Braniff added: 'Broga helps with your mobility, flexibility, strength, core, balance and also an increased blood flow to your muscles, all which can help with weight loss. Tranquil: Broga was designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability - and helping you relax . Picturesque: Amy wanted to promote the benefits of broga in her new photoseries of men practicing it in various locations across the U.S. 'Increased mobility, in particularly hip and shoulder will see a marked improvement in your big lifts, full ROM (range of motion) squats, deadlifts, overhead press etc and especially the Olympic lifts. All tools to get massive. 'Likewise, certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training. 'Pro cycling teams for instance, use sun salutations before their rides, something I also use before my sessions. 'Although the breathing and chanting does have it's place to help calm, you take what you want from yoga, and in my case it's a more structured way to improve my mobility and help with my other gym activities, not to meditate.' Professional fans: Pro cycling teams apparently use sun salutations before their rides .","Photo series shows tattooed and bearded men practicing  spiritual exercise .

"The grandmother of the first child who died in the suspected murder and attempted murder of four young boys in the Queensland 'house of horrors' case has declared her grandson, 3, was 'murdered'. The woman, who cannot be identified, has said in a social media post he 'was murdered he didn't die of natural causes'. She also claimed another grandmother was 'suspected of murdering [her grandson] and his 7 month old half brother and attempting to murder his two other half brothers by setting their bedroom alight but luckily they escaped ... it is all very sad'. The grandmother made the statements following an outpouring of family support for the grandmother suspected of killing the woman's grandson, aged three years old, in 2013. Scroll down for video . 'The last photo of me and my grandson': The grandmother of the youngest child who died in Queensland's 'house of horrors' believed he was murdered . She is also suspected of killing the seven-month-old boy and attempting to keep two other boys, aged, nine and 11, in a house which was on fire. All four boys are the children of the same mother. The mother and her most recent partner are parents of the seven-month-old boy who died in September this year. That partner's mother is a police suspect in the two murder and two attempted murders of four children at Morayfield between April 2013 and September this year, all alleged incidents happening on the 27th of each month. Earlier on Sunday the grandmother police describe as as a 'person of interest' in a 'mind-boggling' series of crimes that involves two children's deaths and a fire has denied any involvement in the crimes. Asked by Seven News if she killed her grandchildren, the grandmother replied: 'Absolutely not. I’m not a heartless person. Someone with no heart would do that.' Queensland Police have provided vision of a recreation of the case, above, featuring police staff and an unknown woman . No one in the 'mindboggling' series of alleged crimes committed at Morayfield, north of Brisbane, can be identifed. This picture shows the father of a toddler who died in July last year. The father of two boys believed to have been locked in their room to burn to death in a failed murder bid says he fears for their lives 'every day' they are in the house. The surviving boys, aged 9 and 11, remain in the care of their mother and stepfather under supervision. Police say the pair are not suspected of being involved and they have told of their grief at losing two children. On Saturday the surviving boys’ father, who sees them only sporadically, said: 'It shocks me. I’m disgusted. I fear for their lives every day. I don’t know what’s going to happen next.' Meanwhile the father of the toddler police believe was murdered in the house has called for 'justice for his 'little buddy''. The man's three-year-old son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found dead at a Morayfield home, on the Sunshine Coast on July 27 2013. His seven-month-old half-brother was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014. Father and son: The father of a three-year-old boy police believe was murdered in a crime linked to his grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler. The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son. Each of the alleged crimes occurred on the 27th of the month, prompting police to investigate the 'coincidence'. Until Friday, the father of the three-year-old believed his son had died of complications from a virus. Today, he was calling for justice for his boy, as well his son's half-brother and the two other boys. 'I just want to know what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was my little buddy.' On Saturday, the man changed his Facebook profile to feature a picture of his son below the words: 'Justice for (the boy's name)'. He had also written the message: 'Justice for all 4. 3 other boys went though hell to so please dont forget about them'. A relative of the man had posted: 'RIP my little pumpernickel I knew it would all come out in the end. Luvs ya and miss ya heaps (boy's name) xxxxx I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you.'

Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom . Blaze: A scene from the police recreation of the attempted murder of two kids . Another user posted: 'How could someone be so evil? Such a innocent little boy' The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother and was not living with his son when he died, has pleaded for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. ‘How did my little buddy die?’ Detectives have described a grandmother as being a person of interest in the investigation into the deaths of the two boys and the alleged attempted killing of the other two children as they slept in their beds. The alleged crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield and the grandmother was present during each incident. No one has been charged. The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, toward the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane . The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said. On February 27 this year two boys aged nine and 11 were asleep in their beds in the same home when the house was set ablaze. The children survived but based on a forensic recreation of the arson attack, detectives believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape pathway from the bedroom. Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mindboggling,' he said. Supt Hansen would not identify any family members. Both children and other occupants of the burning house were treated for smoke inhalation. 'The children were inside the room and could not exit the room,' he said. One child suffered burns to his lower limbs and was treated at Caboolture Hospital. 'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific . Firefighters: The incidents all occurred at the one address in Morayfield . Police are investigating whether there is a reason why the crimes all occurred on the 27th of the month, Supt Hansen said. 'It's a matter being investigated,' he said, although he ruled out any religious or cult links to the crimes. The detective would not rule out the involvement of other people but said police have 'strong leads'. 'We are very confident we have the right line of enquiry with this investigation and will have a conclusion in the near future,' he said. The surviving children are now in state care.

"You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in Västmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. Nature vs nurture: You may not have been born anti-social, but a combination of your genes and your environment could control your fate when it comes to criminal behaviour, a new study claims . As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood. German neurologist Dr Gergard Roth claims to have found the 'evil patch' in the brain's central lobe (ringed) that lurks in violent criminals . Last year, a German neurologist claimed to have found the area of the brain where evil lurks in killers, rapists and robbers. Bremen scientist Dr Gerhard Roth said the 'evil patch' lies in the brain's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on X-rays. He discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for German government studies. 'We showed these people short films and measured their brain waves,' he said. 'Whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions. In the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow, nothing happened.' The dark mass at the front of the brain, he says, appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence. His research has led him to believe that some criminals have a 'genetic predisposition' to violence. He added: 'When you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals, there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain. 'There are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area, and after an operation to remove the tumour, that person was completely normal again. 'Or there are physiological deficits, because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively. 'But this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks.' 'Among females it is the high activity variant of the MAOA gene that interacts with adversity in childhood to increase the likelihood of anti-social behaviour.' Another gene examined was BDNF, which impacts neuronal plasticity. This refers to the brain cells' ability to reorganise pathways and connections throughout our lives. 'The low expressing variants of BDNF are carried by approximately 30 per cent of individuals and some previous studies had shown that this variant was associated with aggressive behaviour if carriers were exposed to aggressive peers,' said Professor Hodgins. The third gene variant studied was the serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR, which is carried by approximately 20 per cent of individuals. Born killer? Overall, the study found that the three genetic variants interacted with each other and with family conflict and sexual abuse to increase the likelihood of delinquency . 'Among carriers of this low activity variant, those exposed to adversity in childhood are more likely than those who are not to display antisocial and aggressive behaviour,' said Professor Hodgins. Overall, the study found that the three genetic variants interacted with each other and with family conflict and sexual abuse to increase the likelihood of delinquency. 'Among carriers of the low activity variants of all three genes, those exposed to family conflict or sexual abuse or both reported high levels of delinquency while those who reported a positive and warm relationship with their parents reported little or no delinquency,' said Professor Hodgins. 'These findings add to those from other studies to show that genes affect the brain, and thereby behaviour, by altering sensitivity to the environment,' Professor Hodgins said.","Study questioned 1,337 students in Sweden about their life experiences .
It also took DNA to test for gene variants MAOA, 5-HTTLPR and BDNF .

"It is a scene repeated in curry houses around the world - male customers trying to prove their manhood by eating the hottest curry on the menu. But now is seems this rite of manliness may actually be based on scientific fact after researchers have shown that only real men go for the spiciest food. Physiologists at the University of Grenoble, in France, have found that men with a taste for spicy foods tend to have higher levels of the hormone testosterone. Scroll down for video . Eating a beef vindaloo while out for a meal may do more than make you sweat - it can prove that you have higher testosterone levels, according to the research by scientists at the University of Grenoble . Testosterone is known to make men more adventurous, aggressive and sexually active. Those with the highest levels tend to be more dominant, or the alpha male, of a group. The researchers believe that by eating hot curries, men may also be boosting their hormone levels as chili peppers have been shown to increase testosterone levels in rats. The heat of chili peppers is commonly measured using the Scoville heat unit scale. This is a measure of how much chili extract can be diluted in sugar syrup before it becomes undetectable to tasters. Pure capsaicin, the chemical in chili peppers that gives them their heat, measures at 16 million SHU. Some scientists are investigating whether this chemical can be used to help people in chronic pain due to the way it binds to nerve cells. The world's hottest chili is the Carolina Reaper, which is rated at 2.2 million SHU, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Some of those who have tried it report taking up to 14 hours to recover from its devastating heat. The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion is rated at 2 million SHU while the Bhut Jolokia is rated at 1.58 million SHU. Professor Laurent Begue, who led the study, said: 'We demonstrated a positive correlation between salivary testosterone and the quantity of hot sauce male participants voluntarily and spontaneously consumed with a male. 'Additionally, testosterone levels correlated with participants' perceptions of the spiciness of their meal after a tasting task. 'This study provides new insights into the biology of food preference by expanding our understanding of the link between hormonal processes and food intake.' The chemical in chilli peppers that creates heat is called capsaicin and binds with the pain receptor to produce the characteristic burning sensation. This is known to cause physiological changes in the body, raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and releasing endorphins and adrenalin. It is this that produces the uncontrollable sweating  that can sometimes accompany eating really hot food but some research has also shown it can trigger the release of hormones involved in happiness. The researchers involved in the lastest study, which is published in the journal Physiology and Behavior, tested 114 men between the ages of 18 and 44 from from Grenoble after advertising for participants to take part in food tasting panel for a food research company. They were asked to indicate their preferences regarding spicy food and had the levels of testosterone in their saliva measured. They were then asked to season a sample of mashed potatoes with Tabasco hot pepper sauce and salt before then evaluate the spiciness of the meal. The researchers found that those with higher levels of testosterone tended to put more chili sauce on their potato while there did not seem to be any correlation with salt. Professor Begue said it could be that the higher levels of testosterone are leading men to seek thrills and take risks by eating hotter food. Previous research in rats has shown that eating chili may also increase levels of testosterone, particularly if they consumed a regular diet containing capsaicin during adolescence. Writing in their paper, titled 'Some like it Hot', Professor Begue and his colleagues said that further research would be needed to see if a preference for spicy food produced similar changes in humans. The Brick Lane Curry House in Manhatten, New York, serves a curry contains eight of the hottest chilis in the world including the Bhut Naga Jolokia, which is used by the Indian military to make tear gas . Watch Gordon Ramsay and Alan Carr try the hottest curry in the world (Warning: contains some mild swearing) Heat in chilis is measured using the Scoville heat unit scale, with the hottest known rated at 2.2 million SHU . They said: 'To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a behavioural preference for spicy food has been linked to endogenous testosterone. 'Future administration studies will be necessary to evaluate the causal relationship between elevated testosterone and preference for spicy foods.' There are several restaurants around the globe that lay claim to serve the hottest curry in the world. The Bindi restaurant in Grantham, Lincolnshire, sells a dish it calls the Bindi, which is made with 20 Naga Infinity Chilis, the second hottest on the planet. The fumes it produces are so potent that it needs to be prepared by chefs wearing facemasks and the curry has been rated at more than six million units on the Scoville Scale. The Crocodile Inferno at the Dilshad restaurant in Cannock is so hot it is reputed to cause halicinations in those that eat it. It contains the Ghost chili pepper, The Trinidad scorpion Butch T. chili pepper and the Carolina Reaper. Brick Lane Curry House in New York serves the Phaal curry, which is around 200 times hotter than Tobasco sauce and is rated at 1 million units on the Scoville scale. While the effect of hot peppers on women is still to be tested, testosterone does also play an important role in the female body, so it may also affect them. The latest findings may also lead to an ever more competitive edge to in curry houses as men attempt to show off their virility and manliness. However, it could also just lead to a lot more indigestion.","Researchers from the University of Grenoble compared the hormone levels of 114 men to the amount of chilli sauce they added to mashed potato .
Those with highest testosterone were found to add more chilli to their food .
Chilli peppers have also been found to increase testosterone levels in rats .
Testosterone is known to increase risk taking behaviour and could explain why men with higher levels seek out hotter food to prove themselves ."
"China’s environmental woes are common knowledge to most of the world; take a trip to Beijing and you’ll quickly see the effects deforestation can have on a city’s way of life. There, toxic dust clouds and high levels of pollution threaten the lives of people on almost a daily basis. But the Chinese government has an ambitious plan to improve conditions. For several decades they have been planting a ‘great wall of trees’ to block the impacts from the Gobi Desert - and a study says the measures are working, despite previous criticism. Scroll down fir video . China is planting huge strips of trees to stop the Gobi Desert (illustration shown). For decades the desert has been advancing and causing serious dust storms to key cities such as Beijing. Since 1978 the government has been planting trees to reverse the widespread deforestation that took place in China . The Three-North Shelter Forest Programme, more commonly known as the Great Green Wall (GGW), is a series of huge forest strips designed to hold back the expansion of the Gobi Desert. Every spring the country is subjected to devastating sand storms as winds sweep down from the North, bringing the Gobi Desert with them. And as the desert expands - partly due to human deforestation to make room for agriculture, livestock and mining - the situation had the potential of getting worse and worse. This project, also known as the Three-North Shelter Forest Programme, is being carried out in the North, Northeast and Northwest of China. It is designed to halt the expansion of the Gobi Desert. By 2050, strips of trees and vegetation 2,800 miles (4,500km) long will have been planted, covering about a tenth of the country in greenery. Several methods have been employed to increase vegetation. In some instances, farmers have been given cash incentives to plant trees and shrubs. In the last decade, aerial seeding has been used to cover wide areas of land. There have been criticisms of the project, though. Some say the trees may soak up large amounts of valuable groundwater, weakening the soil and preventing people from getting suitable access to water. In 1978, though, China made a bold decision to begin the GGW project - and it seems they are now beginning to reap the benefits of that decision. By 2006, 25 million hectares of forest were growing. By 2050, more than 100 billion trees will occupy a 2,800-mile (4,500km) belt, 1.6 million squre miles (4.1 million square km), more than a tenth of the country. Critics have suggested the plans are ultimately doomed to fail; Hong Jiang of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told New Scientist: ‘Instead of controlling nature, we need to follow nature.’ And some think that planting trees in the sandy ground of the Gobi Desert will not work, with the mortality rate of the trees being unknown. This means the longevity of the project has been called into question, with continual replanting of trees required long into the future to maintain their effectiveness. But the latest study, led by Dr Minghong Tan from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says the measures are working - and they will continue to do so. Every spring some of China's cities, such as Beijing (shown on 9 April 2014), are ravaged by dust storms that make their way South from the Gobi desert. It is hoped that the Great Green Wall project will improve the quality of life for the people living in cities like this . Pictured are workers planting part of the shelterbelt at the Mu Us Desert of Baijitan shelterbelt forest in Wuling City, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, on 23 July 2013. China launched the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program in 1978 as an anti-desertification effort . ‘The results show that in the GGW region, vegetation has greatly improved, while it varied dramatically outside the GGW region,’ the researchers write in their paper. Of most importance, though, is how this vegetation has affected dust storm intensity (DSI) and dust storm frequency (DSF). According to the study, things are looking good. Since 1985 DSI has decreased dramatically, while DSF has also been decreasing continuously. ‘From this result, we infer that the implementation of the GGW programme has effectively decreased DSI by improving the vegetation conditions,’ they write. This photo taken on 27 July 2013 shows the shelterbelt forest at the Sanjiang Plain, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. State Forestry Administration (SFA) data showed that the forest coverage in the treated areas had increased to 12.4 per cent at the end of 2012 from 5.05 per cent in 1977 . While the overall situation seems to be improving, there are some small areas where little or no improvement has been seen. Others have warned that the project could take hundreds of years to successfully turn back the advancing deserts to a significant degree. This project is not unprecedented, though; in the US in 1934, President Roosevelt initiated the Great Plains Shelterbelt project to try to quell the severe dust storms plaguing central America. By 1942, 220 million trees had been planted, stretching 18,600 miles (19,900km) from the Brazos River in Texas to Canada. The project was widely viewed as a success, although a lack of maintenance today means the severe dust storms are threatening to return. And in Africa a project, the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI), is also hoped to improve the droughts and natural resources degradation threatening countries in Africa. Keen eyes will remain on China’s project to see how successful it will be, as other countries also begin to suffer the effects of deforestation.","China is planting huge strips of trees to stop the Gobi Desert .

"In the case of these striking and delicate images, it would appear beauty and brains really can co-exist. Each of the Asian-style designs depict a range of neuroscientific images, ranging from a hippocampus to the tree-like expansion of neurons, and even a slice of a spinal cord. They combine the traditional sumi-e ink painting style with modern images captured by a microscope and on a computer. This 'brainbow' image shows a hippocampus. The hippocampus is involved in forming, organising and storing memories. It also connects emotions and senses, such as smell and sound, to memories. The hippocampus is a horseshoe shaped paired structure, with one hippocampus located in the left brain hemisphere and the other in the right . The images were painted by Greg Dunn who has a Ph.D in neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, in the Asian Sumi-e style, also known as ink painting. This piece is of the crab's stomatogastric ganglion, which is a collection of neurons in the crab that controls its chewing and digestion of food . The work was created by neuroscientist-turned-artist Greg Dunn. He received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. All of the images are painted by hand, but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures. Sumi-e has been practiced for around a 1,000 years, predominantly in Japan. Dr Dunn’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas, or using a syringe to place it on the frame. 'I enjoy Asian art. I particularly love minimalist scroll and screen painting from the Edo period in Japan [and] am also a fan of neuroscience,' explained Dr Dunn. All of the images are painted by hand, but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures. Sumi-e has been practiced for around a thousand years, predominantly in Japan. Dr Dunn’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas, or using a syringe to place it on the frame. This image shows cortical columns which are columns of neurons that perform similar tasks in the brain . This image looks like a butterfly, but is in fact an artistic representation of a cross-section of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is found in the vertebral foramen and consists of eight cervical, 12 thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral and a coccygeal segments. A pair of spinal nerves is between each segment of the cord . The left-hand image of the cerebellar lobe was painted using 22K gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel. The cerebellum is the region of the brain required for movement and motor memory. Elsewhere in the collection is an image depicting a glia cell (right). Glia cells are a type of 'support' cell that take nutrients to neurons, and hold them in place. A brain has around 10 times the number of glial cells than neurons . 'Therefore, it was a fine day when two of my passions came together upon the realisation that the elegant forms of neurons - the cells that comprise your brain - can be painted expressively in the Asian sumi-e style. Dr Dunn has, more recently, began etching images onto metal, too. This process, dubbed microetching, carried out with Dr Dunn's colleague Brian Edwards involves scanning and editing neurons using computer software, which are then etched onto a metal sheet using a process called photolithography. This image shows the brain of a fly from the Drosophila genus -  a type of small fruit fly . The left image is called Crackled Neurons, while the right is called Neuromuscular Junction. 'Neurons may be tiny in scale, but they possess the same beauty seen in traditional forms of [Japanese art]- such as trees, flowers, and animals', continued Dr Dunn. 'I admire the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean masters because of their confidence in simplicity. I try to emulate this idea' This involves printing the images onto a sheet, placed on top of light-sensitive layer above a piece of steel. When ink is placed onto the sheet it blocks light hitting the layer beneath. Ultraviolet light is shone onto the metal and engraves the image in the locations where the photosensitive layer was blocked by the ink. Gold leaf is then placed on the surface. In one image, Dr Dunn has was inspired by the stomatogastric ganglion in a crab. This is collection of neurons that controls the chewing and digestion of food in the crustacean. This image, which resembles a watery landscape, is called Hippocampus II, and depicts a  rodent hippocampus. Dr Dunn uses several mediums in his paintings of the mind, resulting in images that are dreamlike and scientific. He explained that the medical imagery he uses as a springboard for many of his works are just blueprints, because he's 'always trying to walk a line between photorealism and interpretation' Dr Dunn has, more recently, begun etching images onto metal, too.This process, dubbed microetching, carried out with Dr Dunn's colleague Brian Edwards involves scanning and editing neurons using computer software, which is then etched onto a metal sheet using a process called photolithography. This Cortical Circuitboard microetching was designed to resemble a circuit inside a computer . In another, the artist painted a cerebellar lobe in 22K gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel. The cerebellum is the region of the brain required for movement and motor memory. 'Neurons may be tiny in scale, but they possess the same beauty seen in traditional forms of [Japanese art]- such as trees, flowers, and animals', continued Dr Dunn.

The left-hand image is called Hair Innervation. Innervation is a nerve supply, usually to a specific part of the body. It was printed using ink on 22K gold. The right-hand image shows neurons in the maki-e style of painting, which translates as 'sprinkled picture' and involves placing Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder onto a brush . Along with Dr Edwards, Dr Dunn recently received a grant from the National Science Foundation to create a giant microetching of the human brain at as close to full complexity as possible.The full work will be completed and installed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 2016.

Writing on her website, she explains that she's always had 'big dreams'. She said: 'We moved to a small town called Volksrust, in Mpumalanga. Ever since then I was a small town girl with big dreams. 'To be the best me, to follow my destiny and someday be a woman who uses what she was given out of grace; to inspire, to love, to sympathize and to give.' Obviously religious, she adds: 'The following verse never fails to give me goose bumps: “For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” – Jeremiah 29:11. We all have a future of hope, a destiny planned for each as individual. The choices we make are the turns we take on the road to our destinies.' Paying tribute to her country after being crowned, she said: 'South Africa this is for you. I think I will brace myself for what's about to happen. It's a huge responsibility.' Rolene is determined to use her new crown for the good of the community. She told AFP she wanted to help spread education in her homeland and thereby help other people realise their dreams. 'I am what I am today because of the opportunities I have received and I would love to give others the same opportunities; educating, the opportunity to be educated, to make healthy choices and also to live their dreams.' Top three: Miss Hungary, Edina Kulcsar, left, was judged the runner-up and Miss United States, Elizabeth Safrit, came third in the 64th annual competition, contested by women from 121 countries . And she was already getting used to the glittering crown. 'I'll definitely keep it on as long as I can but my parents are staying around here so they'll be hugging me and I'm afraid that it might fall off,' she said. There's good news for all the men out there; Miss Strauss is single. In a recent interview with the South African TV Authority, she was asked how many boyfriends she'd ever dumped. She replied: 'I would say three.' When asked about her relationship status, she said: 'I definitely don't have a public relationship. 'You know, as a Miss South Africa people look up to you and see you as an independent, strong woman. That's the picture I'd like to show people out there and I think it's difficult to be in a relationship because of your busy schedule.' Tough competition: Sunday's show started with a spectacular choreographed dance routine, with all the beauty queens on stage in costumes inspired by their homelands and they had to compete in several rounds to win the crown . Miss Hungary, Edina Kulcsar, was judged the runner-up and Miss United States, Elizabeth Safrit, came third in the 64th annual competition, contested by women from 121 countries. This year's event has been rocked by the murder of Miss Honduras, 19-year-old Maria Jose Alvarado, who was shot dead along with her sister last month. Police in Honduras accuse her sister's boyfriend of shooting them after seeing his partner dancing with another man at a party. Strauss and other contestants will travel to the crime-plagued central American nation to build a school named in the sisters' honour. 'We hope that it will really start to impress on the people in Honduras that the violence, and hurting people like those two innocent women... maybe they can think again before they take a gun,' Miss World chairwoman Julia Morley told AFP. Sunday's show started with a spectacular choreographed dance routine, with all the beauty queens on stage in costumes inspired by their homelands - including Miss Bolivia in a colourful feathered headdress. While beauty remains central to the event, the women taking part are chiefly judged on their talents and involvement in good causes. Miss World began in 1951, a year before its chief rival Miss Universe. Strauss is the third South African Miss World, the country having held the title in 1958 and 1974. Venezuela tops the all-time leader board with six titles, ahead of India and the United Kingdom on five titles each. Julia Morley, Miss World Chairman, said: 'It was great to bring the 64th Miss World Final back to London and where it all began 63 years ago. 'I’m looking forward to travelling with Rolene, the new Miss World, to visit countries around the globe to support this year’s finalists Beauty with a Purpose fundraising projects.'

"A giant mystery sea creature is thought to have been spotted in the turquoise waters of one of New Zealand’s most idyllic bays. A huge unexplained wake can be seen in a Google Earth image of Oke Bay, in the Bay of Islands, an area on the east coast of the Far North District of the country's North Island, captured by satellite at about 11.30am on January 30. Engineer Pita Witehira, who spotted the wake while on Google Earth researching for his holiday home, told Daily Mail Australia the wake could have been left by a creature around 12 metres in size. A long swirled wake was spotted on Google Earth in Oke Bay, part of the Bay of Islands in New Zealand . Pita Witehira said the wake could have been left by a creature around 12 metres in size . Mr Witehira, from Hamilton, New Zealand, said: ‘The Native Maori would call this a ""Taniwha"" ('Troll') as it appears not to be a whale and it is far too big to be a shark. It is moving too fast and turning too sharply to be a whale.’ Mr Witehira also ruled out that a boat was the cause of the wake because there is no white froth like normal wakes created by motors. ‘I spotted it about a week ago. We have some property near Oke Bay and I’m about to build a beach chalet up there, I zoomed down and found that,’ he said. ‘It’s way too wide for a shark and way too long… It’s got to have a lot of weight under the water to create that kind of drag.’ Engineer Pita Witehira spotted the wake while on Google Earth about a week ago . When compared to the white wake that a motoriesd boat in the area makes it is clear to see they are very different . Oke Bay has a quite white sand beach and the water stays shallow for around 40 metres ‘with a sudden deep drop into the bay’. ‘There is a lot of undergrowth in the deeper parts of the Bay,’ Mr Witehira explained. The unusual sighting comes after an aerial photograph appeared to show a giant crab that was at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water in England. The incredible image, shared online in October, could soon have visitors flocking to the seaside town of Whistable, in Kent, in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab. While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

"A University of Virginia (UVA) student claims he tried to call 911 after 'Jackie' told him she was gang raped at a frat house but she stopped him because she 'just wanted to go to bed'. Ryan Duffin - who is revealing his name for the first time - says he had his phone in his hand and told his friend, referred to as Jackie, that she should call the police after claiming she was sexually assaulted by a group of students. But as the 20-year-old started to dial 911, Jackie told him that she 'didn't want to', he has claimed. Scroll down for video . University of Virginia student Ryan Duffin, 20, says he got out his phone and told 'Jackie' to phone 911 after she claimed she was gang raped in a frat house, but she 'didn't want to', he claims . Almost a month after the scathing Rolling Stone article was published, Ryan Duffin and his friends Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock are still trying to set the record straight. The friends told The Associated Press that the article was wrong on a number of key points, especially its assertion that they urged the victim to not report the attack. Duffin, a third-year student was referred to as 'Randall' in the Rolling Stone article. He told the AP: 'I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect.' The AP also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Hendley and Stock, known as 'Cindy' and 'Andy' in the article. A Rolling Stone magazine article suggested the trio did little to help their friend Jackie (pictured)  after she was sexually assaulted . The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus. In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named 'Drew,' who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house. Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched. As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table about a 20-minute walk from the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened. While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out. 'The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep,' the article said. 'Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: 'She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.'' However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie. Stock confirmed this account. As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie. He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Fitzhugh dorm. She was shaking and 'it looked like she had been crying,' Duffin said. 'Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date.' Jackie eventually told Duffin and Stock her version of what happened that night: that she was forced to perform oral sex on five men at the frat house. 'My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'' he said. 'I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there.' He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1, 'but she didn't want to and,' he remembers thinking, ''I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.'' Stock corroborated this version of events. Misrepresented? Identified as Cindy, Andy and Randall in the Rolling Stone article, Kathryn Hendley (left), Mr Stock and Mr Duffin want to set the record straight . 'Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'' Stock said. ''I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.'' Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant. Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to. Duffin said the RA told him that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so. The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened — or whether any discrepancies in her story matter. 'People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do,' Duffin says. 'But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole.' Alex Stock, another friend of Jackie who spoke to her shortly after she says she was gang raped, claims she said she 'just wanted to go to bed' Other news media have also interviewed the friends, but this is the first time Duffin has allowed his full name to be used. The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police. Erdely and Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana did not respond to an email from The Associated Press on Sunday morning seeking comment. None of the three friends was contacted by Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, for which Rolling Stone has since apologized for and noted discrepancies. All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and that she has told them she is re-reporting the story. Hendley told the AP that Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did. A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as 'Jackie,' has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.","Friend of UVA 'gang rape' victim Jackie says she stopped him calling 911 .

"The Cleveland police union's president has branded an NFL player's silent protest against recent fatal Ohio police shootings 'pathetic'. Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins wore a 'Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford' T-shirt over his pads during warm-ups before the game against the Cincinnati Bengals yesterday. Tamar, a 12-year-old who was playing with a pellet gun, was shot by a Cleveland police officer at a park on November 22 and died the following day. Scroll down for video . Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins, pictured, wore a 'Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford' shirt over his pads before the game against the Cincinati Bengals yesterday, which provoked Cleveland police union's president . In August, cops shot dead John Crawford III, 22, who had a BB gun, at a Beavercreek Walmart just outside of Dayton. Hawkins' actions provoked Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer, who attacked players who bring political issues onto the field. 'He's disrespecting the police on a job that we had to do and make a split-second decision,' he told Cleveland.com. In a statement, Mr Follmer said: 'It's pretty pathetic when athletes think they know the law. 'They should stick to what they know best on the field. 'The Cleveland Police protect and serve the Browns stadium and the Browns organization owes us an apology.' Tamir Rice, left, aged 12, was shot by a rookie Cleveland cop in November and right, John Crawford, 22, was shot dead in August just outside Dayton, Ohio . The Browns responded to Mr Follmer with a statement saying they respect the police, but also the right of players to support whichever cause they choose, according to Cleveland.com. It said: 'We have great respect for the Cleveland Police Department and the work that they do to protect and serve our city. 'We also respect our players' rights to project their support and bring awareness to issues that are important to them if done so in a responsible manner.' Police had responded to the scene of Tamir Rice's shooting after a 911 call warned of someone pointing a pistol, which turned out to be fake. Officer Timothy Loehmann shot him two seconds after arriving to  investigate, but police allege the rookie cop had told the boy to put his hands up, but he had reached for the gun in his waistband instead. An autopsy found he died from a single shot to the abdomen in what has now been ruled a homicide. A grand jury will consider whether charges against Loehmann are merited. Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James wore a shirt with the protest message before an NBA game against the Brooklyn Nets on December 8. Right, LA Lakers player Kobe Bryant wears the same shirt a day later . This is not the first time a Browns player taking a stand against police violence. Recently, defensive end Johnson Bademosi wore an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt protesting the death of Eric Garner at the hands of a police officer who held him in an apparent chokehold. He then penned an editorial on his decision on a Sports Illustrated blog. And earlier this month, LeBron James and several Brooklyn Nets players wore 'I Can't Breathe' shirts as they warmed up for a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. It comes after months of tension between the black community and the police after a series of fatal incidents, including the shooting of unarmed Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August.

"Fury: Bill de Blasio (pictured) went to lengths to praise the protesters' 'peaceful' behaviour despite such chants as, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!' New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, has been branded a 'total nicompoop' after he used the word 'allegedly' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants. NYPD top brass are furious at de Blasio's implication that the beating may not have happened, claiming no such skepticism is ever shown when officers are accused of violence against civilians. He made the remarks after the two officers were set upon by protesters during a demonstration on Brooklyn Bridge against recent police killings, including the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner in July. He went to lengths to praise the protesters' 'peaceful' behaviour despite such chants as, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!' He went on to dismiss the assault as 'an incident ... in which a small group of protesters allegedly assaulted some members of the NYPD,' the New York Post reported. 'When cops are the accused, the word 'alleged' never enters into the discussion,' Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD Detectives' Endowment Association, told the paper. Ed Mullins of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, called de Blasio a 'total nincompoop' for his handling of the affair, adding: 'His actions are contributing to the injuries that are being received by the NYPD. 'Maybe he should be out there to take the broken nose for the lieutenant. Ask him if he'd be willing to stand out there and take the punches for the cops.' The incident began when the two officers arrested a City University of New York professor, Eric Linsker, 29, as he tried to pour a rubbish bin onto other cops from a pedestrian overpass. They were punched and kicked in the heads, leaving them needing instant medical attention. Ironically, the officers were from the department's Legal Bureau and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators' civil rights were respected by police. It is the latest controversy in a long-running stand off between New Yorkers and police following a spate of deaths in custody. Scroll down for video .

'Don't insult my sacrifice': De Blasio's comments came days after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association told him to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty, posting a form (above) on its website that members could download and sign . They include the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, with 'chokehold' restraining technique that is banned under NYPD protocol. Thousands of . demonstrators marched in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago and Oakland on . Saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by . police officers. Organizers said the marches were among the largest in a . recent wave of protests against the deaths that have cast a . global spotlight on race relations in the United States. The rallies were mainly peaceful, though police in Boston . said they arrested 23 people who tried to block a highway. Officers in Oakland, California said they detained about 45 . people for vandalism, failure to disperse, resisting arrest and . other charges after thousands took to the . streets. Decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against . the officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri . and Eric Garner in New York have put police treatment of . minorities back on the national agenda. 'We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown ... on all of . the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the . light on,' said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose . National Action Network organized the Washington rally. Marchers, including many parents with children, chanted 'No . justice, no peace, no racist police' and 'Hands up, don't . shoot.' Protesters carried signs that said 'All men are created . equal' and 'Black lives matter.' Relatives of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley, who were killed by . New York police, Brown and Trayvon Martin, slain by a Florida . neighborhood watchman in 2012, all took part in the Washington . rally . Then, last week, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six. The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street. In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.' They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital. His final words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo escaped indictment. A de Blasio spokesman refused to comment on why the mayor chose to include the word 'allegedly' while describing the Brooklyn Bridge attack. 'Last night, the mayor could not have been more clear that violence in protests will not be tolerated and that our police should be commended for the professionalism and service they have displayed throughout these marches,' spokesman Phil Walzak said. The fallout couldn't come at a worse time for de Blasio, whose relationship with the NYPD has soured in recent months. It comes two days after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association told de Blasio to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty for his 'consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve.' The union posted a form on its website that members could download and sign, barring the mayor and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito from their service. It read: 'I, as a New York City police officer, request that Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito refrain from attending my funeral services in the event that I am killed in the line of duty,' the waiver states. 'Due to Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Mark-Viverito's consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve, I believe that their attendance at the funeral of a fallen New York City police officer is an insult to that officer's memory and sacrifice.' In a joint statement, de Blasio and Mark-Viverito described the snub as 'deeply disappointing'.","He was discussing attack on 2 officers during protest on Brooklyn Bridge .

"A US Marine has been charged with the gruesome killing of a transgender Filipino who was found strangled to death with her head in a toilet bowl. 'It's murder,' prosecutor Emily de los Santos told reporters after indicting Marine private Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, with the death of Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey. 'It was aggravated by treachery, abuse of superior strength and cruelty,' she added about the October crime. 'You can see the kind of cruelty she endured, the injuries she sustained. We believe we have a strong case.' Scroll down for video . US marine Joseph Scott Pemberton (left), 19, is accused of strangling Filipino Jennifer Laude, 26, after finding out she was transgender. Ms Laude was found strangled to death in a hotel room with her head in a toilet bowl . Prosecutor Emily de los Santos said she believes that have a strong case against Pemberton. She added that the case was aggravated by treachery, abuse of superior strength and cruelty . Pemberton is currently being held at a Filipino military camp in Manila where he was transferred in October from a US Navy ship. If convicted he could face up to 40-years behind bars . Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met Laude in a nightclub in Olongapo city, a port community northwest of Manila, where he had just finished taking part in joint US-Philippine military exercises. He didn't know she was transgender until they were got to cheap hotel room at the Celzone Lodge, according to an earlier report in the New York Daily News. Laude was later found strangled to death, half naked, with her head in a toilet bowl, police said. She died from 'asphyxia by drowning', according to a police autopsy. Pemberton will have to appear in court to face the charges, de los Santos said. She also urged Laude's loved ones, who had questioned whether he was still in the country, to attend court and see him for themselves. Following formal charges by prosecutors, the local court which has jurisdiction over the case will decide whether there are enough grounds for the accused to stand trial, although there is no timetable for this process. Murder is punishable by up to 40 years in jail, but Pemberton has asked prosecutors to downgrade the charge to homicide, which carries a maximum 20 year prison term. The Laude family lawyer Harry Roque, welcomed the prosecutors' ruling and angrily demanded that Pemberton be thrown into an ordinary jail. Protesters have taken to the street to demand justice for Laude. Her family's lawyer has demanded that Pemberton be thrown into an ordinary jail instead of being held at a military camp . The case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. Another American Marine, Daniel Smith was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005 . 'This is not an ordinary murder,' he told reporters. 'This is heinous because she was beaten up.' He is currently being held at the Philippine military's main camp in Manila. He was transferred from the US Navy ship Peleliu where he had been detained on board in October. The case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. Philippine and US authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another American Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005. US marine Joseph Scott Pemberton could face up to 40 years in jail if he is convicted of murdering Jennifer Laude . Smith was held at the American Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-US protests. Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows US forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members. But the US has custody over them 'from the commission of the offence until completion of all judicial proceedings.' The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted US military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention. Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favour of the US and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946. In the latest case, US Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended Oct. 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed. The US embassy had no immediate comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, is accused of killing Jennifer Laude, formerly known as Jeffrey .

"A northern white rhinoceros that was just one of six left in the world has died at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Angalifu, who was about 44 years old, apparently died of old age on Sunday. He had arrived at the park from the Khartoum Zoo in Sudan in August 1990. 'Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us,' safari park curator Randy Rieches said in a statement. 'Not only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction.' On their Facebook page, zoo officials said the rhino had been 'under veterinary care for geriatric conditions for some time'. Scroll down for video . Angalifu (pictured), one of six remaining northern white rhinoceroses in the world, passed away from old age on Sunday at San Diego Zoo. The others are in captivity in San Diego, the Czech Republic and Kenya . His death leaves only one northern white rhino at the zoo - a 40-year-old female named Nola - another at a zoo in the Czech Republic and three in a preserve in Kenya. Of these, just one is male. Angalifu's death also comes after the death of another white rhino earlier in 2014. Rhino horns are valued as dagger handles and the powdered form is mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac. As a result, poaching has pushed the critically endangered rhinos to the brink of extinction. Attempts to mate Angalifu with Nola weren't successful. Just last week, preservationists at the Old Pejeta animal sanctuary in Kenya conceded that their one male and two female northern white rhinos will not reproduce naturally. Angalifu (pictured) and a female rhino at the zoo failed to reproduce naturally but his semen and testicular tissue were stored to be used with rhinos in Kenya when new reproductive technologies are developed . The northern white rhino is one of the two subspecies of white rhino (the other is the southern white rhino). They were originally found across grasslands and woodlands in East and Central Africa, but now there are just five remaining. All are in captivity - one in San Diego, one in the Czech Republic and three at a preserve in Kenya. Poaching through the 1970s and 1980s saw numbers dwindle. In the early 2000s, it was believed just five to 10 remained in the wild. Rhino horns are valued as dagger handles and are mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac in their powdered form. And it's not just the northern rhino under threat. A rise in poaching has been encouraged by a thriving market in Vietnam and China for rhino horn, which is used  as a traditional medicine believed to cure ailments and diseases, including cancer. Southern white rhinos almost went extinct at the end of the 19th century, plunging down to only 20 at one point. Decades of conservation efforts gradually brought them back to life. According to the WWF, there are more than 20,000 southern white rhinos alive today. The animals were flown from the Czech zoo to the Kenyan conservancy in December 2009 in hopes the natural environment could be easier for them to breed there than in captivity. 'We always knew from the very beginning that the chances of this working were small even if they bred,' said Richard Vigne, chief executive of the conservancy. Efforts will now be made to keep the species alive through in vitro fertilization. That experiment could take place with a southern white rhino surrogate mother. Angalifu's semen and testicular tissue have been stored at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and will be used with the rhinos in Kenya when new reproductive technologies are developed. 'More than two decades ago we started working with the species here at the Safari Park,' Barbara Durrant of the San Diego Zoo Institute of Conservation Research said in a statement. 'Unfortunately we only had three rhinos here at the park and they were all of an advanced age. We were not able to get them to breed and we have been sadly watching their species being exterminated in the wild.' Southern white rhinos almost went extinct at the end of the 19th century, plunging down to only 20 at one point. Decades of conservation efforts gradually brought them back to life. According to the WWF, there are more than 20,000 southern white rhinos alive today.","Angalifu, who was about 44, passed away at the zoo on Sunday .

"Ollie Locke shot to fame as one of the original Sloanes on Made In Chelsea. The 27-year-old became known and loved for his glossy hair, perma-tan and relationships with both men and women. After four years, 70 episodes and a fair share of break-ups, Ollie left the show that catapulted him to fame behind. He has since penned his debut tome, Laid In Chelsea, which became a best-seller and completed a stint on Big Brother. Scroll down for video . New look: Ollie Locke, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, has seen his star rise since leaving the E4 show and now he's hoping to take the male grooming world by storm with his new video tutorials . Now Ollie, who is currently dating a woman, is preparing to take the male grooming world by storm. His first port of call? Launching an online channel dedicated to all things beauty. 'I have always been passionate about the idea of building my own confidence through the way I can make myself look,' he told MailOnline as he exclusively reveals his debut video. 'I feel men have always kept very quiet about male grooming, although 90 per cent of us do it in secret, stealing girlfriends' tweezers, moisturisers and concealers. If women can make themselves look better with some help, why can't men?'. Ollie explains that he plans on taking men on a journey through social media with his male makeover videos on his YouTube channel. These videos, he says, will be showing British men how they can improve their look through some simple techniques. 'I’m not embarking on creating a country full of Ken lookalikes,' he adds. 'I want to show men how they can make themselves look better in the most simple and easiest ways. 'Men obviously think it’s girly. If women can indulge in moisturising treatments, why can’t men? I’m trying to bridge that gap to make the men of the world look and feel better.' Transformation: Ollie has been sporting a different look to the one we first saw on the show, left, and has been testing out Botox and Brazilian blow dries, right . Grooming guru: Ollie explains that he plans on taking men on a journey through social media with his male makeover videos on his YouTube channel. These videos, he says, will be showing British men how they can improve their look through some simple techniques and he kicks things off with a facial . As well as treating men to makeovers, Ollie will also be looking at the more extreme side of male grooming. Indeed, he will be the guinea pig and test out Botox, fat-burning treatments and even Kim Kardashian's favoured vampire facial. Ollie claims that even his male friends in Big Brother were keen to learn about grooming. He said: 'Even the most unlikely of men were eager to know how to reduce their eye bags and improve their complexion, so I quietly made it a personal challenge to change the way four very different men perceived male grooming. 'By the end I had ""showman"" Lionel Blair, ""bad boy"" Dappy, ""south London ladies' man"" Lee Ryan and even Jim Davidson wearing subtle foundations, using facemasks and leaving all of them asking advice on what and where to buy products outside the house, which made me realise that as a nation the time for male grooming is now.' Ollie and N-Dubz star Dappy became so close on the reality TV show that Ollie describes him as 'like a brother'. Guidance: Ollie claims even his male friends in the Big Brother house were keen to learn about grooming . 'We have filmed a show together recently where we did a hilarious five-day fishing challenge, it's out in February on ITV 4,' revealed Ollie. 'Dappy has promised me that he will let me give him a full makeover in a video we would like to call ""Make Dappy Dapper""! 'In my eyes, if I can make him wear subtle make-up and have facials, my job is done!' In his debut video in Ollie Locke's Good Grooming Guide, Ollie, who prides himself on being men's 'beauty and grooming saviour', gives one lucky man a facial along with a step-by-step guide on how to do it at home - and there's plenty more to come. He added: 'This isn’t about the vain man obsessed with sunbeds, this is about the every man, making them feel happier inside. 'I want them to look in the mirror and think ""I look great"". Believe you me, it’s time.' Finding fame: Ollie Locke shot to fame as one of the original Sloanes on Made In Chelsea alongside Binky Felstead, left, and Cheska Hull, right . Speaking about the rapid rise of male grooming and plastic surgery, Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'Across the beauty industry it’s not just cosmetic brands that responded to the demand for grooming products and treatments; plastic surgeons like myself have seen a rapid increase in the number of male patients who are seeking permanent and effective procedures to enhance their image. 'Since I started my practice over 15 years ago, the change in attitude is astounding. Men used to book appointments first thing in the morning or late at night so there was no risk of being faced with a waiting room full of other people; there was a genuine fear of the stigma attached to visiting a plastic surgeon. 'Male patients now visit during peak hours, whether it be on a lunch break for a Botox treatment, or taking an afternoon off for a Fraxel laser session. 'The demand for male non-surgical treatments show defined peaks at certain times during the year, with an influx pre-Christmas and during February bonus season with city workers aiming to impress not only with their career performance but by looking calm and de-stressed. 'Workers are under tremendous pressure to achieve, and my male patients want lasting results that look natural. A single Botox treatment can last four months while the thought of applying cosmetics each day is daunting.'","Ollie Locke, 27, is preparing to take the male grooming world by storm .

"The teenage football player who was shot and killed in Auburn, Alabama, had dreams of working for the FBI, his father has said. Jakell Lenard Mitchell, 18, was fatally shot at a party early Sunday morning during an alleged argument with two men. A 22-year-old man has been charged with his murder and is being held in county jail, Auburn police have said. Victim: Auburn freshman football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell was shot and killed Sunday morning at an apartment complex near the Auburn University campus . His father, Mario Mitchell, described the freshman as a 'good, fun-living kid' who hoped to start as halfback next season. He said Mitchell was a joyous teen who sometimes talked about being an FBI agent and scratched plans of going to college in Florida as soon as he met Auburn University football coach Gus Malzahn. Police have arrested 22-year-old Markale Deandra Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, in connection with Mitchell's murder. Auburn Police Capt. Will Matthews said Hart has been arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder and is being held at a county jail in the state. It was not immediately known if Hart had an attorney and the statement didn't provide any details of how he was taken into custody. Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. He was expected to contend for a starting spot next season at H-Back and tight end .

Scene: Auburn Police investigate a shooting at the Tiger Lodge apartments in Auburn, Alabama, early Sunday morning . Police also disclosed in the statement that Mitchell, who was shot early Sunday at an off-campus apartment complex, received multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. The statement says no additional arrests are expected at this time, but didn't elaborate further on the shooting and arrest. Mitchell was shot and killed Sunday morning at an apartment complex near the Auburn University campus, police and news reports said. Captain Will Matthews said police responded at 12:25 a.m. Sunday to a shots fired call at the Tiger Lodge apartment complex, where the 18-year-old Mitchell was found. Mitchell's girlfriend, Ayanna Hughuley, 17, said he was arguing with someone at a party when a third person opened fire. Ms Hughuley said  the third man 'just started shooting'after which Mitchell fell on the ground, tried to get up and run, then fell again. She said the other man started shooting Mitchell again while he was on the ground. Mitchell was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Suspect: Markale Deandra Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, has been arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder . A car with a license plate bearing the name of Auburn football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell is towed from the Tiger Lodge apartment complex where Mitchell was fatally shot early Sunday .

Mitchell redshirted this season for the Auburn Tigers out of nearby Opelika High School. He was expected to contend for a starting spot next season at H-Back and tight end. On the Auburn Tigers' website, coach Gus Malzahn earlier said of Mitchell 'He's going to play our three back. He's a guy we identified when he was a junior. He runs a very similar offense. ' He can block, he can catch, he's got a little bit of running back skills. He played a bit of wildcat when he was a junior and then hurt his knee. We feel the sky is the limit for this guy.' Mitchell missed his senior season at Opelika as he recovered from an ACL injury. He rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns in 2013 as a junior. 'This is a sad day. It’s terrible — terrible,' Brian Blackmon, the Opelika High football coach, told The Opelika-Auburn News. Auburn University spokesman Mike Clardy said in a statement to GMA 'The thoughts and prayers of all of us at Auburn University are with the Mitchell family during this difficult time.' The shooting Sunday happened at the same apartment complex Desmonte Leonard killed three men at a party in the summer of 2012, according to al.com.

"A Brooklyn Nets superfan who had to be carried out from a game  amid claims that he attacked another supporter with his prosthetic leg earlier this month, has died. Jeffrey Vanchiro, 38, died after falling from a window on the second floor of his father's house in Flushing, Queens, on Saturday night. Mr Vanchiro, a former professional poker player also known as Jeffrey Gamblero, allegedly jumped from the building in a disorientated state. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Brooklyn Nets superfan Jeffrey Vanchiro, 38, died after falling from a window on the second floor of a residential property in Flushing, Queens . Mr Vanchiro had become known fellow Nets fans for his dedication to the team, unique outfits and dancing during games. His fiance said that Mr Vanchiro had behaved erratically since being ejected from the Nets vs. Knicks game at Madison Square Garden on December 2. 'After that, he was a completely different person,' Kristi Evans told The New York Times. 'He was paranoid. He was erratic. He was frightened. He was horrified. He was a bit delusional. 'He was having a lot of trouble sleeping. He couldn’t sleep at all. When he would sleep, or try to sleep, it would only take about 10 or 15 minutes before he would jump up screaming covered in sweat.' A fellow fan filmed Mr Vanchiro being  carried out of Madison Square Garden without his prosthetic leg during a Nets vs Knicks game earlier this month . Footage shows the moment he was hauled from his seat and physically removed by two members of staff . His fiance said Mr Vanchiro had behaved erratically since being ejected from the Nets vs. Knicks game at Madison Square Garden on December 2 . According to witnesses, Mr Vanchiro had been ejected from the venue after removing his prosthetic limb and using it to hit another fan  in the upper deck of the arena. Video shows how he was hauled from his seat and physically removed by two members of staff amid fears the situation could escalate. The drama unfolded with around five minutes to play in the third quarter of Brooklyn’s 98-93 win over the New York Knicks. The New York Daily News quotes a staffer as saying: ‘They grabbed him and pulled him out. I don’t know if he was arrested but they got him out of there so he didn’t start a riot.’ The report says some eyewitnesses dispute the version of events given by Garden security and that he did not attack anyone. After the incident, the man was named on social media as Nets ‘super fan’ Jeffrey Gamblero . One unidentified fan is quoted as saying: ‘I saw what happened. He didn’t deserve to be thrown out. He was just into the game.’ Video posted online by @jeigs, New York comedian Jesse Eigner, showed how the fan, who was dressed in Brooklyn Nets clothing, was carried away from his seat without his prosthetic leg while stunned supporters watched on. A Knicks spokesman said: ‘An unruly fan was ejected after MSG security received multiple complaints from fans sitting in that area. ‘The fan was warned multiple times before being removed. He will not be permitted back into Madison Square Garden.’","Jeffrey Vanchiro, 38, died after 'jumping out of a window' in Queens .

"An expat slapped by a monk on a train in Thailand wants to put the incident behind him, saying he is 'sabai' (fine) about it, after video of the bizarre assault went viral. The video shows the English teacher being struck across the face by the Buddhist monk after an apparent misunderstanding over seats. The man, wearing a pink shirt and three quarter-length shorts, appears to speak with an Australian accent, claiming he was hit 'three times' by the monk. A man known as 'Jeff' is slapped across the face by a Buddhist monk on a train in Thailand . A police officer soon arrived and removed the monk from the carriage to end the incident, which took place on December 7 on a train travelling from Bangkok to Phitsanulok, according to the Bangkok Post. 'Jeff', as he was later named in a video statement posted to Facebook by his neighbour Noojeab Kuntao, said he was 'sabai, sabai' meaning he was fine. 'To me sabai, sabi,' he says. 'Thailand is Thailand, I love living in Thailand.' Smartphone video footage shows 'Jeff' claiming to have been hit 'three times' as a police office arrives . 'I love Thailand very much. Many people supported me over the Internet. I appreciate it. Everything is OK,"" said Jeff, who was described as a tourist in local reports. It later emerged that Jeff was attempting to solve a delicate situation on the train by offering his double seat to two women and sitting next to the monk himself. The angry monk stares at the man, who lives in Thailand, before the monk is taken away by police . The Facebook user who posted the video on the internet, Pui Pupriew, wrote that after the monk took exception to his sitting down, Jeff said 'Fine, fine' in a bid to diffuse the situation. However, it seems the monk misinterpreted the words as 'kwai, kwai', a deeply offensive term in Thai slang meaning buffalo. 'I gave the seats to the ladies, I sat next to the Thai monk, he wasn't happy and I got slapped,' Jeff says in his explanation.

"Thousands of British families due to leave the UK for a traditional Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the possibility of a green Christmas. Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 until December 13 after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy. But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow where inches of snowfall would usually have fallen by now. Scroll down for video . Heading for the mountains: Skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs (pictured here in the summer) - which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain - found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering of snow . At Les Arcs, which is made up of four resort villages, only one lift was in operation. Skiers were being bussed in from the resorts of Arc 1600, Arc 1800 and Arc 1950 to Arc 2000, where a single 0.6-mile (1km) piste was in operation. The resort’s daily ski report yesterday said the nearest fresh snow had fallen 77 miles (124km) away. One Briton, who owns a ski chalet in Arc 2000, said: ‘There is green and brown land visible all the way up the mountain which would normally be covered in snow. ‘Even Mont Blanc doesn’t look itself. There’s snow on the peak but it doesn’t look anywhere near as plentiful as usual.’ The skier, who did not want to be identified, added: ‘Some of the runs here are grey, with just a dusting of powder, rather than the glistening white scene which is normal at this time of the year.’ Locals blamed a freakishly warm November which melted an early winter snow dump at the lower resorts, and a shortage of atmospheric weather depressions which had brought few new snowfalls - even after the weather in the higher resorts dropped to the sub-zero temperatures which are normal for this time of year. In Arc 2000 - the four resorts are loosely named after the approximate altitude of each village - it is said by locals to be the worst conditions at the start of a ski season in 40 years. Put back: Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel (left) and Meribel (right, file pictures) Ski instructor Philippe Arnauld said: ‘At the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy, but from next weekend the resorts will be full for Christmas and New Year. ‘If all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall, perhaps only a few snowflakes, is predicted between now and Christmas. I have no idea what will happen and how we will manage.’ Last Thursday, Chris Fawkes, a BBC weather forecaster, tweeted that an ‘unlucky jet stream pattern this weekend’ was preventing the Alps from ‘getting significant snow’. The Paradiski is the second largest linked skiable domain in the world, with 264 miles of pistes over 14,390 hectares. As well as Les Arcs, it includes the resorts of Peisey-Vallandry and la Plagne. Earlier this month, travel experts urged holidaymakers not to panic over the delayed opening to resorts such as Courchevel and Meribel. They said the delays would not affect British holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of UK tour operators don’t start until late December. Until 25 years ago and the advent of efficient snow-making machines, most Alpine resorts did not open before mid-December, although the machines need the thermometer to fall to -4C to operate successfully. Val d’Isère, normally one of the most reliable resorts in Europe for snow cover, cancelled the men’s World Cup giant slalom and slalom races scheduled for this past weekend, despite investing in the largest snow-making machine in Europe. Temperatures in the resort on the first weekend of December had reached 5C.","Many Alps and Pyrenees resorts had already delayed opening weekends .

"Tourists have always taken selfies of themselves at Sydney's most iconic landmarks, but on a day that has horrified the city many people are taking macabre snapshots for old times' sake as well. All day people were uploading selfies of themselves on Twitter from as close as possible to where the hostage siege was taking place. Just to make the photos more authentic some even took them with television cameras in the background. Two onlookers even looked like they were taking a 'celebration selfie' than one at a hostage siege.

The hostage siege has been going since 10am on Monday with as many as 30 people believed to be held against their will by a gunman in a central Sydney cafe. Not that it stopped people taking selfies in the area. However, the thoughtless actions have created a huge backlash on Twitter, with many users berating the people for putting up the tasteless selfies. One person wrote: 'Awful, do they not have any feelings. People are being held hostage and all they can do is take a selfie.' 'I love a selfie, but how is this ok?,' said another.

"It seems humans aren't the only ones who know how to have a good time at Christmas. Dozens of wrinkly-faced pooches partied at a festive bash organised just for pugs at the weekend, with many dressed as Santa Claus, elves and even Christmas puddings. The pugs played together and enjoyed treats at the Christmas PugFest at ActionPetz in Cardiff - an indoor walking centre for dogs. Merry pugmas!

"Malia and Sasha Obama were the picture of charm and grace last night when they attended a charity Christmas concert on Sunday - in stark contrast to their demeanor at a Thanksgiving ceremony last month. The 'First Daughters' joined their mother and father at the 33rd annual 'Christmas in Washington' concert on Sunday where they greeted a group of children dressed as elves. Beaming from ear to ear, they laughed and joked with the six former patients of the Children's National Health System before presenting them with gifts including a basket of books. It comes a month after the sisters caused a national stir when they were pictured rolling their eyes and looking bored at the pardoning ceremony of the National Thanksgiving Turkey on November 26. Scroll down for video . Taken: Barack and Michelle's eldest daughter, Malia, seemed particularly taken by the children . Have you been a good President? Obama, his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, met six former patients of the Children's National Health System - a hospital for sick youngsters . Care for kids: The Children's National Health System is 140 years old and the 'premier provider of pediatric care in the region and the only freestanding children’s hospital between Philadelphia and Atlanta', says its website . After President Obama had pardoned four-month-old, 49-pound Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey, to which she sullenly replied, 'Nah'. As the photographs were beamed around the world, many observers slammed them for their behaviour, including GOP staffer Elizabeth Lauten who branded them 'classless' in an acerbic Facebook post. She was later forced to apologise for the attack. But last night they were all smiles as they performed their duties alongside their parents at the fundraiser for sick children at the National Building Museum. Before the concert, which included performances from Rita Ora and Earth, Wind and Fire, Obama, his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, laughed and joked with the kids and answered their questions, before presenting them with gifts - including a basket of books. The six youngsters then posed for portraits with the first family. 'Fast and Furious' actor Dwayne Johnson, also known as 'The Rock,' hosted the concert and jokingly sang his own rendition of 'Deck the Halls.' Other performers at the Christmas celebration included Christina Perri, Aloe Blacc and Earth, Wind and Fire. Obama bopped his head to Hunter Hayes' version of the Chuck Berry hit 'Run, Run Rudolph.' Books: After chatting to the children, the Obamas presented them with gifts, including a basket of children's books . Say cheese! The six grinning youngsters, dressed as elves, then posed for portraits with the First Family . Hugs: British singer Rita Ora was among performers at the event, and received a hug from first lady Michelle while meeting the Obamas at the end of the evening .

"Dame Jenni Murray, who presents Woman's Hour, now says having a damehood is useful . She once feared that accepting a damehood would make her a traitor to her class. But Jenni Murray now says that the honour has its advantages. The Woman’s Hour presenter, who was born in Barnsley, admitted she uses her title to get reservations. She joked: ‘It’s very useful if you want to go to a posh restaurant. ‘I don’t phone myself, well I do, but I pretend I’m not myself. I say, “Hello, I’m calling on behalf of Dame Jenni Murray” and put on this slightly high-pitched voice. ‘And it’s very good for getting a table,’ she said while taking part in BBC2’s Celebrity Antiques Road Trip. Just three years ago she wrote about ‘all the reasons to have said “No”’ to the honour and her fears it could have been ‘a terrible mistake’. But while taking part in Celebrity Antiques Roadtrip, she joked that it did have some advantages. In 2011 she wrote in the Radio Times that she hesitated ‘for a heartbeat’ before accepting the damehood. She added: ‘It was only then I thought of all the reasons to have said “No”… Was I making a terrible mistake? ‘Had I become a traitor to my class by rushing headlong into the bosom of the Establishment? ‘Should I, like the poet Benjamin Zephaniah, be repulsed by anything that had the word Empire in it and which, for him at least, recalled the days of colonialism and slavery?’ Her letter concluded that accepting the honour was worthwhile as it proved wrong critics of her feminist beliefs. ‘Surely it couldn’t be a bad thing for a vociferous exponent of equal rights to be acknowledged by those who, a mere 20 years ago, had sought to silence her,’ she said. Dame Jenni, 64, took part in the BBC 2 programme as a celebrity contestant against Baroness Oona King, who was paired with antiques expert David Harper. She and expert Christina Trevanion lost when their items made a loss of £58.84 at auction. During the programme she also recounted how listening to Woman’s Hour on the wireless with her mother had inspired her radio career. Just three years ago she wrote about ‘all the reasons to have said “No”’ to the honour and her fears it could have been ‘a terrible mistake’ but has since made admissions that it can have its advantages . ‘I think it might have been at that point that I decided that’s what I wanted to do,’ she said. ‘The most exciting moment of my life (was) when they said, “And now Woman’s Hour with Jenni Murray”, and you just went, really? Me? It was a good moment.’ Dame Jenni was born in Barnsley and went to a local grammar school before getting a degree from the University of Hull. She has presented Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour since 1987. She was given an OBE in 1999 and her damehood in the 2011 Birthday Honours list. BBC2’s Celebrity Antiques Roadtrip is in its fourth series and is a spin-off from Antiques Roadtrip, which is its ninth series. It sees antiques experts drive celebrities in classic cars to antiques shops around the country to buy items with a budget of £400. They then sell the items at auction and compete for the biggest profit.","Jenni Murray once feared accepting damehood would make her a traitor .

"A secret eater who gorged on midnight snacks while pretending to eat healthily throughout the day has lost more than a stone - after taking up weight lifting. Aysha Hoare, 23, used to regularly binge on bars of chocolate before bed after a day of munching on salads - or sneak in sweets while on the way to the gym. Now a slim size 8, Aysha, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, managed to drop two dress sizes and more than a stone in just 12 weeks after ditching the late-night treats and taking up weight training. By ditching the secret snacking Aysha managed to drop from 10st 5lb (left) to 8st 11lb (right) At night Aysha often found herself  sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on . Aysha, who went from 10st 5lb to 8st 11lb said: 'Even though I was eating well during the day, I wasn't losing the weight I felt I should have. 'Appearances can be deceptive because I was coming home most evenings and tucking in to sugary treats.' Having been slim throughout her teens, when Aysha started work as a retail assistant, her busy routine meant she strayed to eating junk food and sweets. She said she could easily get through a packet of biscuits in just a day and always had sweets in her pocket or in her car to eat while on the go. Desperate to curb her expanding waistline, Aysha started going to the gym and skipping breakfast. Ditching secret snacking for weight training, Aysha has transformed her body, pictured before, left and after . But what she couldn't put a stop to was her sweet tooth, and despite her efforts to stay slim during the day, at night she often found herself  putting her pyjamas on and then sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on. Even spending hours on the cross-trainer every week couldn't fight against her snacking habits. Exasperated at her lack of progress, she decided to try a different approach to shift the pounds. Aysha started a 12-week body transformation programme which meant cutting out all the sweet treats she lived on, and taking up an intensive gym schedule with weight training. Instead of biscuits and toffee sweets, dessert became protein-based puddings that enhanced, rather than hindered, her training. Instead of biscuits and toffee sweets dessert became protein based puddings . And in 12 weeks she had lost 11.2cm from her waist and 5.6cm from her hips. Aysha said: 'I was going to the gym and then coming home and eating junk food - it really defeated the point. 'Because I felt I'd been good all day, I really wanted something naughty to eat and I felt I'd earned it. 'It became my secret habit - I didn't tell anyone that I was snacking away on chocolate after everyone else had gone to bed. 'Thankfully doing the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme helped me stay on the straight and narrow. 'When you've got a programme to stick to, it makes it so much easier. I needed the motivation it gives you to keep going and not give up. 'I genuinely believed that running around and getting cardiovascular exercise should have been enough. 'Never did I think in a million years that weight training would help me but it was on the programme so I thought, ""OK, I'll give this a go"". 'The results were incredible. People at work noticed and even asked me if I was eating enough. 'I had to keep reassuring them, ""I am eating more than you can imagine!"". 'I've always loved my food and could never have done a diet where it meant cutting out all important calories. 'This way I've changed my attitude to food - no more midnight snacks for me - and gained an all-round healthier lifestyle. 'And I have achieved my dream body and the confidence I've always wanted.'","Aysha began to gain weight when she was working in a shop .

"X Factor 2014 went out with a bang last night as Ben Haenow took home the coveted crown. While the show is a singing contest, each contestant has undergone a complete style overhaul, transforming from a fledgling pop star to a stylish X Factor alumni with a wardrobe to boot. The lady responsible for styling the stars each week is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked tirelessly behind the scenes for the last few months. Scroll down for video . Grand finale: As X Factor 2014 drew to a close last night, FEMAIL caught up with the show's head stylist to get all the backstage gossip and find out her highlights from this season . Gemma has dealt with last minute wardrobe changes, demands from Simon Cowell and lots of stitching and sequins. FEMAIL caught up with the styling supremo about all things fashion - and how she's been called in by Tulisa as a stylist. Speaking about the grand finale of the series that she's lived and breathed for the last few months, she said: 'The nature of this show is that every week brings a fresh challenge and a brand new creative. 'There's no denying that the final takes it to another level, especially as we moved to the big stage with a live audience of 10,000.' Style queen: Gemma Sheppard has dealt with last minute wardrobe changes, demands from Simon Cowell and lots of stitching and sequins . Big gig: Gemma and her team curated show-stopping outfits for finalists (L-R) Andrea, Fleur and Ben . Stepping in: Gemma also dressed Tulisa on Saturday night as she is one of her regular clients . Gemma certainly had her work cut out for her. Not only did she have to curate show-stopping outfits for finalists Ben, Fleur and Andrea, but she and her styling team were responsible for everyone on stage‎, as well as past contestants. If that wasn't enough, Gemma dressed Tulisa on Saturday night as she is one of her regular clients. When Tulisa was asked to stand in for Mel B, Gemma got the call  to arrange her wardrobe. She pulled it off in just a few hours with a Stella McCartney dress and YSL heels. Speaking about working with the show's contestants and nurturing their style, she said: 'It has been a real privilege to watch the contestants develop and to be part of the team that nurtures them into stars. 'It is definitely a team effort: creative, hair, make up, styling, voice coaches and the mentors.' She's had a blast: Gemma's  highlights from this year's X Factor include  working with creative director Brian Friedman; the fun backstage with the contestants, and making bespoke pieces . Sharing the golden piece of style advice she has given each of the contestants, she said: 'I've said right from the start that my part is to help the contestants feel confident in their look so it helps them deliver to their best on stage. Andrea: He's got this charming, friendly character and his look is smart but with a softness. So a suit but with upturned trousers or a playful bow tie is his signature . Fleur: It's all about that bod for Fleur! Whether in a beautiful bespoke gown or rocking hotpants and a bra top, Fleur has been a dream to dress as she has embraced the styling process and used it to her advantage to make her performances so unforgettable. Ben: I cite Ben as one of the contestants who has had a really subtle 'makeover'. He came to the show with a naturally casual look - a hoodie and jeans. We've just turned that into a cool rock star style, which he works with ease. 'So for them to go on now, I'd like to think they've all come to realise how their clothes can make an impact on their performance and to use that to their advantage.' While it may seem that Gemma has the world's best job, it doesn't come without its pressures. Indeed, one Saturday night, just hours before showtime, the team decided to completely change Fleur's dress. Despite her hectic schedule, Gemma wouldn't have it any other way and says she couldn't possibly pick a single highlight from her time on the show. 'From meeting the contestants for the first time, working with Brian Friedman, the fun backstage with the contestants, dashing around town with my team visiting fashion houses, working late with my seamstress making bespoke pieces, it's all been amazing. 'Thank goodness for social media as via Twitter and Instagram, I have been able to create a visual diary of the last three months which I'll always look back on with pride and fondness. 'It's all been fantastic and I've been thrilled and honoured to be a part of what I consider to be TV history.' Gemma says it's been a privilege to watch the contestants develop and be part of nurturing them into stars .","Gemma Sheppard looks back on the show's highlights .

"Emily Clark is desperate for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant before the New Year, after doctors revealed she is battling cancer for a second time . Teenager Emily Clark dreams of becoming a doctor. But before she can embark on making her ambition a reality, the 17-year-old has another, more pressing challenge. Emily needs a life-saving bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and she needs it for Christmas. Last month specialists told the teenager a transplant is her only hope. The 17-year-old is fighting non hodgkin (burkitts) lymphoma for a second time. She was first diagnosed in December last year but after four courses of chemotherapy she was declared free of the disease in April. But Emily's world came crashing down again on November 13, when doctors revealed the cancer had returned. Her siblings were tested, but weren't a match for their sister, leaving a donation from a stranger the only option. And so Emily has launched a drive to encourage people to give the gift of life this Christmas, by signing up to the Anthony Nolan donation register. Emily, from Cwmbran in Wales, told MailOnline: 'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, good and proper.' The teenager, whose blog is called Remission Possible, has previously written in support of the charity and other families in need of a donor, not knowing she would one day need a transplant herself. Emily was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December 2013, after she noticed her stomach was swelling and her jeans had become tighter. Scans revealed the swelling was cancer. 'I'd never been to the GPs before. Being ill just didn't happen to me, it was normally my brothers and sisters,' Emily said. 'It was right before Christmas, and was just so much to take in; I knew it was going to change my life. 'I love school, I'm a total nerd so it was just horrible to know I was missing out. With every needle they stuck in, it just sunk in even more.' Following four courses of chemotherapy, Emily was given the news she was clear of cancer on April 17. It was this that spurred her on to start her blog Remission Possible, to help others facing similar journeys. The 17-year-old was first diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin (Burkitts) Lymphoma in December last year. After going into remission in April, her disease returned last month. Doctors revealed her only hope is a transplant from a stranger after tests revealed her sister Holly, pictured left, and other siblings aren't a match . 'It was simply amazing to be told I was in remission,' Emily said. 'It seemed like a great place to start the blog from, April 18, 2014, and my first full day officially cancer free. 'It was such a long time coming. 'I set up Remission Possible to thank everyone who helped me to be in remission and as the blog's tagline says, 'Because you never choose the mission of cancer - we all have to accept it and fight on'. Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. A patient with the disease will make too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. And those lymphocytes live longer than they should. The overload compromises the immune system, which is designed to protect the body from infection and disease. Lymphoma can develop in many parts of the body, including a person's lymph nodes, bone marrow, blood, spleen and other organs. There are two main types of lymphoma - non-hodgkin and hodgkin. Most are non-hodgkin lymphoma - the sixth most common cancer in the UK. Every year, around 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease in the UK. It is more common in older people, with one in six sufferers over the age of 65. Burkitt lymphoma is a rare form of non-hodgkin lymphoma, affecting the B-cells in the body. There are three different forms of Burkitt lymphoma, two of which are linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever. The third occurs in patients who have had an organ transplant and are taking medicines to stop their immune system rejecting the transplant. The most common early symptom is swelling in the lymph nodes. The lymphoma can often appear as a lump or mass in the tummy area, which can cause pain and swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. Some sufferers will also experience night sweats, high temperatures and weight loss. Source: Anthony Nolan Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support . 'I wanted to help young people in their fight and raise awareness so others can see the symptoms of cancer.' While she was in remission, Emily supported various campaigns for people searching for a match like the Help Hollie #pantsonyourhead campaign. At the time, Emily had no idea she would be launching a similar campaign of her own. Last month, after feeling unwell, the 17-year-old went back to the doctors. They revealed her cancer had returned, and for Emily, life was put on hold. She postponed plans to study medicine at university. 'I was devastated, I had just applied to university and my life was getting back on track,' she said. 'Relapsing isn't the end of Remission Possible, it may be our true beginning. 'I have no choice but to accept my new mission. 'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, and forever, not just for me but for the 2,000 other people out there who need a transplant each year.' Since launching her campaign to encourage people to sign the register, Anthony Nolan have received 278 successful applications in Wales. And Emily has received support from celebrity comedian Matt Lucas and singer Michael Ball, who tweeted about Emily's blog. Emily's mother, Donna said: 'When Emily was diagnosed with cancer our world changed in an instant. 'But I now feel empowered to make a difference by signing up as many people to the register as possible. 'I can't thank enough every person who has signed up to the register for Emily and others like her. Together we can help Emily make another mission possible to beat cancer again.' Emily's cancer returning was the latest in a long line of challenges the Clark family have faced in recent years. Since 2006, her siblings, Holly, 16, Evan, 10 and five-year-old Libby, have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, dyslexia and dyspraxia. Mrs Clark, said: 'Our family life has been through a lot of changes over the past year, and we've been as honest as you can be with a four, nine and 15-year-old. 'Christmas had to be rescheduled and having younger children was a juggling act. 'Footie practice, choir and GCSEs exams also had to continue as family life had to go on in some capacity, for everyone's sake. Emily has launched a campaign urging people to give the gift of life this Christmas by joining Anthony Nolan's donation register . Emily's family have faced a difficult few years. Since 2006 her siblings, Holly, 16, Evan, 10 and five-year-old Libby, have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, dyslexia and dyspraxia . 'Emily missed home and the little ones missed her - winter coughs colds kept us all apart at times. 'Myself and my husband Andrew have missed each other, we passed on the motorway like ships in the night. 'Trying to ensure one of us was at the hospital 12 hours a day and the other was home was a mammoth task, as anyone can imagine. 'But we have also been blessed to be able to add to our family. We don't feel unlucky but the complete opposite. We are so lucky to have these children. They enrich our live beyond words.' Ann O'Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'Emily has been a selfless supporter of Anthony Nolan even before she needed a transplant by supporting other families in desperate need online. 'Emily is now reliant upon other strangers to join the register and pledge to save a life by donating their stem cells. 'What many people don't realise is how easy it is to join the bone marrow register – it simply involves filling in a form and providing a saliva sample.'

An armed sniper monitors the row of houses in Pennsburg on Monday where suspect Bradley Stone was believed to be holed up inside . Stone is pictured marrying his wife Jen in September 2013. However he has been involved in an on-going custody battle with his ex-wife . Stone is described as 5'10' and 195lbs with a shaved head. He is known to use a cane or walker to assist him, may be wearing military fatigues, in either sand or green color, and is believed to be armed. The search took place 60 miles from where alleged cop killer Eric Frein was caught after leading cops on a search for months. Earlier in the day SWAT teams surrounded a row of houses in Pennsburg where Stone was allegedly barricaded inside following the shooting spree. Stone abandoned his truck and cell phone and is believed to have taken shelter in a house following the spree. In a statement, the Montgomery Country District Attorney's Office, said: 'Stone should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information about Stone’s whereabouts is asked to call 911 immediately. Do not approach him.' Police zoned in on a row of several homes in Pennsburg where Stone is believed to own property. Using a megaphone, Fox reported that a cop shouted at the house: 'Bradley, this is the police department. Come to the front door with your hands up. You're under arrest.' Authorities revealed yesterday that Stone had served one tour in Iraq and left the Marines as a Sergeant . Neighbours admitted that Stone was involved in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife before the shootings . Several flash-bang devices were set off, typically used to disorientate suspects. Stone has a history of DUI arrests, according to records, and was a reservist until 2011. He served one deployment in Iraq, according to ABC, and left as a sergeant. He is believed to have remarried a woman called Jen in September 2013, but has been involved in an on-going custody battle with his ex-wife. The first shooting was reported around 4am on Monday in Harleysville. The victim was named  as Nicole Hill, Stone's ex-wife. Officers found a woman's body with a gunshot wound to the head in a second-story apartment following 911 calls which reported shots, screaming and sounds of a disturbance. A neighbor told ABC that she heard three or four gunshots in the early hours of the morning and the father leading his two young daughters away from the home in their pajamas without coats. The neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said: 'I heard the kids say, ''Mommy no. I want my mom.'' And I heard [the suspect] say ''Let’s go. We have to go now. We’re leaving.''' The woman said that she opened the window and called to the man to ask him if everything was ok. He responded: 'She's hurt pretty bad', before getting in the car and driving off. The body of Stone's ex-wife Nicole Hill was found this morning . Police had cordoned off the shooting scene in Pennsylvania on Monday where a man is suspected of shooting dead his ex-wife and trying to flee with his young daughters . Bullet holes could be seen in the apartment wall in Harleysville, Pennsylvania where a Marine veteran reportedly gunned down his ex-wife .

A suspect is believed to have barricaded himself inside a property after shootings at multiple homes . Police used stun grenades when they raided one house where they found a seriously injured teenager . Other neighbors claimed that the couple had an ongoing, bitter custody battle over their children. The girls were found safely a short distance away with a neighbor. Around 30 minutes later, two people were found shot and killed at a home in Lansdale, another township that is a short distance from the first scene. Just after 8am, two bodies were discovered at a home in Souderton. The location of the sixth victim is unknown at this time. All the victims were believed to be related to Nicole Hill. A stand-off ensued this morning at a separate home in Souderton after police thought that the gunman had barricaded himself inside. A SWAT team stormed the home and set off a flash-bang device. A teenager was found inside with a gunshot wound and rushed to hospital by helicopter in a serious condition. It was later confirmed by Towamencin Police Chief Tim Dickinson to Bucks County News Feed that the shooter was still being sought by authorities.

"Asda has been named as the best-value supermarket for buying Christmas dinner - with shoppers saving nearly £30 compared to other brands. The prices of 33 festive items - including turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies and Champagne - were analysed across the five major stores, with Asda coming in at number one at £119.96 for the total shop. Tesco scooped second place at £129.40; Morrisons was third at £135.71; Sainbury’s came in at four place with a festive basket costing £139.05. Asda's Christmas basket was the cheapest, research by trade magazine The Grocer found . In fifth place, and the most expensive, was Waitrose at £149.54, which is £29.58 dearer when compared to festive shopping at Asda. The annual mystery shop was carried out by trade magazine The Grocer, which compared prices of 33 must-have items for Christmas. It found that Tesco has the cheapest bacon (£2,22); Asda is best for brandy butter (£1.50); Champagne is best-priced in Morrisons (£16.99); and Christmas pudding costs £1.89 in Asda - compared to the most expensive £3.75 at Waitrose. Quality Street chocolates are £2 in Asda and Tesco; £2.06 in Waitrose and £3 in Morrisons and Sainsbury's. And, when it comes to the all-important turkey, Sainsbury's is the cheapest at £10.16, followed by Asda (£10.40); Tesco and Morrisons (£12.00) and Waitrose (£15.00). This year's prices were compared with 2013's to find out what shoppers will pay as falling commodity prices and deflation take their toll. It found that the baskets at the top five supermarkets were all cheaper this year, with price cuts deepest at Sainsbury's. But the trade magazine said the number of comparable products varies from retailer to retailer making like-for-like comparisons impossible. In terms of products, the biggest fall was on carrots which were down 40 per cent on average as a result of heavy discounting and a much better harvest. However, many prices are at the same level as last year. The price of the frozen turkey is unchanged in most supermarkets and is up 20 per cent at Morrisons. Asda president and chief executive Andy Clarke said: 'We are delighted the 2014 Grocer 33 Christmas basket confirms what our customers already know - at Asda, the premium is in our products not our prices. 'Despite tempting gimmicks, at a time when budgets are stretched, they can be assured their big Christmas shop will cost less at Asda.' The supermarket offered the cheapest prices on two thirds of the products on the list. The biggest high street supermarket chains are offering Britain's shoppers a very merry Christmas this year - with many major drinks brands cheaper than they were a year ago, research has found. Some of the deepest cuts are in the lager market where, on average, multi-packs of the top-five brands are 4.9 per cent cheaper this week than last December, with Stella Artois and Budweiser down 4.5 per cent and Carlsberg down 5.1per cent. The Grocer says that price drops have been driven by the largest formats with packs containing more than 15 cans or bottles down as much as 11 per cent. Cuts have also been seen in the cider category with the average price of the five biggest cider brands down 4.6 per cent a litre. The study also revealed that wine prices are down 2.1 per cent across supermarkets but Champagne has risen by 2.1per cent a litre, while sparkling white is up 1.9 per cent overall.","Study by trade magazine The Grocer found Asda the best value .

"A Russian teenager has been left partially blind and disfigured after a £3 eyelash treatment caused severe chemical burns around her eyes. Singer Masha Kuznetsova has to wear make-up whenever she is on stage. But rather than use mascara for each performance, the 13-year-old's parents decided to tint their daughter's eyelashes instead. Masha Kuznetsova is a singer who regularly has to wear make-up while on stage. The make-up artist who gets her ready advised her parents an eyelash tint could speed up the process . Masha, 13, from Volgograd, was left with severe chemical burns around her eyes . They took Masha to a beauty salon in the city of Volgograd, in south-western Russia's Volograd Oblast. The couple said they paid the equivalent of £3 to have both their daughter's eyebrows and lashes tinted. Masha's father Sergey Kuznetsov, 42, said: 'They never gave us any warning that there were any risks. Her father Sergey Kuznetsov, 42, said the salon they chose didn't warn them of the risks . 'And we certainly never expected in our wildest dreams that she would be left with a disfigured face, chemical burns and partial loss of vision in one eye. 'It all happened two months ago and she is still in pain and unable to perform properly. 'But not being able to perform is the least of our worries, the fact that she is in so much pain and looks like this is a disaster for our daughter. 'She was an outward going and happy individual, and now she's a nervous wreck who just wants to hide in her bedroom the whole time.' He said Masha had been delighted when she was chosen as a soloist to perform in the Volgograd Cossack ensemble. He added: 'The beauty salon that used to do her make-up suggested the colouring would make it quicker to get ready, and we agreed. 'When it all went wrong, I was shocked that they didn't even apologise. 'I am taking them to court, demanding compensation.' Make-up expert Elena Antonova, 33, told Russian media that if the chemicals using during the colouration process not been properly mixed or applied, it could easily cause the damage that the 13-year-old experienced.

"It’s now a three-way battle for ownership of the North Pole, as Denmark revealed it will take on Canada and Russia amid claims its Greenland territory is connected to the pole via a ridge beneath the Arctic Ocean. Huge, sparsely populated Greenland is semi-autonomous Danish territory and its continental shelf is linked to the pole by the 1,800km-long Lomonosov Ridge, which runs beneath the Arctic Ocean. Foreign minister Martin Lidegaard will today deliver a claim to a United Nations panel in New York, as Denmark becomes the latest country to make a play for the vast untapped oil and gas reserves thought to lie beneath the ice. The Lomonosov Ridge (shown in dark blue) links Greenland's continental shelf with the North Pole. The red dotted line shows the extent of the five Arctic countries' claims on the region under existing international law, which allows them to claim ownership of land up to 200 miles from their northern borders .

The Lomonosov Ridge connects the abstract spot to Greenland . Melting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. Global warming is opening up opportunities to tap new mineral resources . Danish soldiers next to a Danish flag on Hans Island, between Greenland and Canada. Denmark has today staked a claim to fly its flag over the North Pole. The five Arctic countries — the United States, Russia, Norway, Canada and Denmark — all have areas surrounding the North Pole, but only Canada and Russia had indicated an interest in it before Denmark's claim. Lidegaard told the Associated Press that the Arctic nations had so far ' stuck to the rules of the game' and he hoped they would continue to do so. In 2008, the five pledged that control of the North Pole region would be decided in an orderly settlement within the framework of the UN, and possible overlapping claims would be dealt with bilaterally. Interest in the Arctic is intensifying as global warming shrinks the polar ice, opening up possible resource development and new shipping lanes. The area is believed to hold an estimated 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its untapped gas. Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard will today take his country's claim to the North Pole to the UN . Lidegaard said he expects no quick decisions, with other countries also sending in claims. He said: 'This is a historical milestone for Denmark and many others as the area has an impact on the lives of lot of people. ‘After the UN panel had taken a decision based on scientific data, comes a political process. 'I expect this to take some time. An answer will come in a few decades.' Between 2007 and 2012, Danish scientists with colleagues from Canada, Sweden and Russia surveyed a 2,000km (1,240-mile)-long underwater mountain range that runs north of Siberia. They concluded that Greenland is geologically attached to the ridge. That prompted the Danes to claim the right to exploit an area of 345,600 square miles (895,00 square kilometres). Christian Marcussen, a senior geophysicist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said: 'The Lomonosov ridge is the natural extension of the Greenland shelf. 'Coincidentally, the North Pole which is a tiny, tiny abstract spot lies in the area.' Under international law, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - the five countries with territories near the Arctic Circle - are allotted 200 nautical miles of territory stretching from their northern coasts. However, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, exclusive claims can be vastly expanded for countries that can prove their part of the continental shelf extends beyond that zone. In 2007, Russia sent a submarine to plant a flag 14,000ft beneath the ice of the North Pole in an audacious bid to lay claim to the resource-rich Arctic. Last year, Canada applied to extend the borders of its seabed in the Atlantic Ocean, including extensions into the Arctic seafloor covering roughly 656,000 square miles (1.7 million sq km). This is roughly the size of Alberta and the Saskatchewan region combined. Now Denmark has made its move, claiming 345,600 square miles (895,000 square kilometres) of new territory.","The 1,800km-long Lomonosov Ridge runs beneath the Arctic Ocean, connecting Greenland's continental shelf with the North Pole .

"A Ugandan maid who sparked outrage when she was filmed stomping on a toddler has been jailed for four years. Jolly Tumuhirwe, 22, was filmed beating and kicking 18-month-old Aneela Kamanzi after she vomited while eating dinner. Horrifying footage, caught on a hidden camera by the girl's father, showed Tumuhirwe attacking the child who had been left in her care. Scroll down for video . The assault happened after the child, seen being shoved off the couch in her family home in Uganda, was sick while being fed a meal by her nanny Jolly Tumuhirwe . Jolly Tumuhirwe, 22, was filmed beating and kicking 18-month-old Aneela Kamanzi . Sentencing Tumuhirwe, Chief Magistrate Lillian Buchan said the nanny had committed an 'unjustifiable and inexcusable' crime. She said the four-year sentence reflected the 'ruthlessness exhibited' on an 'innocent, helpless child'. Tumuhirwe was caught attacking the child when her father, Eric Kamanzi, noticed that his daughter was bruised and limping. Instead of confronting the maid, Mr Kamanzi installed cameras in the family home in Nakawa, watching in horror as he reviewed the footage. The sickening video shows Tumuhirwe dragging the child onto the floor before beating her with a torch, and then kicking and standing on the toddler. Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Kamanzi said: 'It's not for us to decide the punishment for what she committed. 'We hope this has set an example for other maids out there, that you can't just go to someone's house and torture their baby and expect to walk out.' Armed with a torch, the woman is seen repeatedly striking Aneela who lies face down on the floor . Taking a run up, Tumuhiirwe kicks the girl directly in the ribs, sending her sliding across the floor . Erick Kamanzi, left, was arrested for assaulting the nanny after discovering security footage of her attacking his daughter, right, but police later dropped the charges against him after he showed them the tape . Rose Zimulinda, a relative of the girl, said the child was physically but may suffer from long-term psychological problems. The distressing video of the child being beaten caused outrage when it was posted online in Uganda, and has since been shared thousands of times on social media. Mr Kamanzi is reported to have beaten Tumuhirwe, who had been working for the family for three months at the time, 'to a pulp' after watching the video. The nanny later reported the assault to police and Mr Kamanzi was arrested after admitting he had attacked her. But after showing police the security tapes of the assault on Aneela, the charges against the father, who works for an NGO in Kampala, were dropped.","Ugandan maid jailed for four years for attacking an 18-month-old girl .

"It is an iconic landmark that attracts millions of visitors every year, but a particularly sticky form of air pollution is turning the gleaming marble domes of the Taj Mahal brown. Scientists have found that tiny dust particles and soot from the burning of dung, wood and rubbish nearby are sticking to the surface of the famous building. Once on the marble surface of the Taj Mahal, these particles absorb ultraviolet light, giving its normally white domes a dirty brown shade. Scroll down for video . The extent of the staining caused by air pollution on the white marble domes of the Taj Mahal can be seen here next to an area that has been cleaned by workers using clay to peel off the layer of dust and sticky soot . Researchers found that these particles are particularly troublesome as they are insoluble in water and so cannot be easily washed off. Instead workers currently cover the outside of the domes with a layer of clay every few years before peeling it off to restore the white colour of the building. Archaeologists recently unearthed a long forgotten palace opposite the Taj Mahal. The 500-year-old building is thought to have been the summer place of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor. It would have allowed him to gaze upon the Taj Mahal, which he had built in memory of this third wife. The new palace was found earlier this year and is thought to be a baradari - a pavilion with 12 doors designed to allow free flow of air. It was discovered in the garden of Mehtab Bagh, which was known to be a favourite spot for the emperor to relax in. But now scientists hope their findings will help those caring for the 460 year old mausoleum in Agra, India, to develop new methods for cleaning the building. Professor Mike Bergin, an environmental engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who led the study, said: 'The particles are super small and stick to the surface very well. 'They can not be easily removed by wiping the surfaces off or attempting to power wash the surfaces with water. Also the particles we are talking about do not dissolve in water. 'There is some concern regarding the long-term impact of the cleanings on the Taj domes. The only real way to stop the Taj from discoloration is to find the sources of the particles and figure out a way to substantially decrease emissions.' Professor Bergin first became interested in what was changing the colour of the Taj Mahal after seeing workers applying 'facial masks' of clay to the domes of the building. Built between 1632 and 1653 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife Mumtaz Mahal, it was constructed from white marble excavated 230 miles away in Makrana, Rajasthan while some of the outlying buildings were built from red sandstone. Acid rain, sulphurous gas in the air and oxidizing fog have all been blamed for the changing colour of the marble over the years. In 1983 the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Indian Government has set up a 4,000 square mile zone around the monument where strict restrictions on industrial emissions are in place. However, the building has continued to discolour, suggesting something else was the blame. The Taj Mahal was built from thousands of blocks of marble carried to the site on wagons pulled by oxen . Professor Bergin started the study after seeing workers using clay to clean the domes at the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal needs to be cleaned very few years due to the build up of brown dust and soot (right) on its walls . To discover what was causing the discolouration, Professor Bergin, together with scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology and the Archaelogical Survey of India, placed blocks of marble around the Taj Mahal site for a year. They then analysed the particles that had built up on the surface and compared them to air samples taken from the area around the Taj Mahal. They found high concentrations of light absorbing organic carbon, also known as brown carbon, dust and black carbon. These were found to be insoluable in water, meaning they cannot be easily washed off. By measuring the amount of light reflected by these particles, they were able to work out which were responsible for causing the change in colour as seen by the human eye. Writing in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, the researchers said: 'A large fraction of the outer Taj Mahal surfaces are covered with particles that contain both carbonaceous components and dust. 'Our results indicate that deposited light absorbing dust and carbon from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass are responsible for the surface discolouration of the Taj Mahal.' Professor Bergin believes that cutting the amount of organic material and traffic levels around the Taj Mahal may help efforts to return the Taj Mahal to its original colour. He said: 'The Taj Mahal can be thought of as the lungs of India, since the same particles that deposit on the Taj are being breathed in by people living in the region. 'The particles are bad for human health. Cleaning up the Taj will certainly make people more healthy in the region. 'So there is a great health benefit in cleaning up the air in addition to keeping the Taj Mahal beautiful.' Dust and pollution from nearby industry was thought to be causing the Taj Mahal to change colour but the new research suggests local traffic along with the burning of wood, dung and rubbish is causing the damage . The researchers set up air sampling equipment around the Taj Mahal to monitor the levels of air pollution .","Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta hope their findings help to return the World Heritage Site back to its original colour .

"Bronze Age beads found in Denmark match the blue glass inlays found in Tutankhamun's gold death mask, scientists claim. The discovery hints at some of the trade routes between Denmark and the ancient civilisations in Egypt and Mesopotamia 3,400 years ago. It also provides new details that could link the Egyptian cult of worshiping the sun with a similar sun cult that developed at the same time in Denmark. The women from the Ølby site is pictured on the right. Next to the woman's left arm was a blue glass bead from Egypt, two amber beads, and two small bronze spirals. Similar blue beads have been found in the past but never linked to Egypt. On the left is Hesselagergård-pit excavated 1878-81 . Twenty-three blue beads unearthed in an Ølby grave, south of Copenhagen, were analysed using a technique known as plasma-spectrometry, according to a report in Science Nordic. The method allowed researchers to analyse the fragile bead and compare the chemical composition of trace elements with material from Amarna in Egypt and Nippur in Mesopotamia. The comparison showed that the chemicals matched exactly, marking the first time that Bronze Age Egyptian and Middle Eastern cobalt glass has been found outside the Mediterranean area. The blue beads were found in the grave of what is thought to have been a wealthy lady who lay in a hollowed-out oak trunk, wearing an overarm bracelet made of amber beads and other jewellery. Researchers analysed the fragile bead in the Ølby grave, south of Copenhagen, and compare the chemical composition of elements with material from Amarna in Egypt and Nippur in Mesopotamia . Bronze Age beads (pictured) found in Denmark match the blue glass inlays found in Tutankhamen's gold death mask, scientists claim. The discovery hints at some of the trade routes between Denmark and the ancient civilisations in Egypt and Mesopotamia in the Bronze Age 3,400 years ago . The beads had exactly the same chemical composition as ancient Egyptian cobalt glass found in Amarna . The same material was found in Tutankhamun's death mask (pictured), and a number of other burial sites . These 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold . If you dug these up in your garden, you probably wouldn’t think twice about throwing them away. But the unassuming objects are 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold. Unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on Dartmoor last year, they were heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century. Jane Marchand, senior archaeologist from Dartmoor National Park, described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century. She said: ‘The amber beads probably came from the Baltic – and meant they were long-distance trading 4,000 years ago. ‘These artefacts show Dartmoor wasn’t the isolated, hard-to-reach place we thought it was. This mystery is unfolding. 'This has been fascinating to work on, but it’s just one piece in a puzzle. The story is only part-told.' Scientists believe most of the beads were Mesopotamian and made from melted quartz sand and ash from Tigris river grass. Two of them came from Egypt. Previous studies had already shown that Bronze Age amber was exported from Nordic areas to Egypt, with Tutankhamun and other pharaohs burial chambers containing the material. Researchers from the National Museum in Denmark and the Institute of Archaeomaterials Research in France say the latest study shows that as well as amber, Denmark and Egypt traded glass 3,400 years ago . They also believe it links two ancient sun cults, based on the fact that sunlight is able to penetrate the surface of both amber and glass. The study claims that burying amber and glass may have constituted as a prayer to the sun, to ensure that the dead body would share its fate with the sun on an eternal journey.","Blue beads unearthed in an ancient Ølby grave, south of Copenhagen .

"Former President George W. Bush made an unannounced visit to the 9/11 museum on Sunday where he walked in silent contemplation among the exhibits. Bush, who was in office during the terrorist attacks 13 years ago, spent an hour at the Ground Zero site in lower Manhattan. He arrived at 6pm, while the museum was still open to the public, accompanied by his security team. Scroll down for video . Former president George W Bush is pictured at the 9/11 museum in New York City on Sunday evening, the first time he has visited the center . Onlookers said that former president George W Bush arrived quietly at the 9/11 museum on Sunday night and spent an hour look at the exhibits. He reportedly was particularly taken with 'The Final Column' (pictured in stock image from May 2014) According to the New York Post, some fellow museum visitors recognized the former commander-in-chief but respectfully did not approach him. Bush shook hands with police officers at the site and appeared moved by what he had seen, according to one cop. In particular, the former president, spent time viewing The Final Column - the last steel beam removed from Ground Zero at the end of the nine-month recovery effort in 2002. The artifact is covered in pictures  of the fallen along with messages of hope and love from emergency responders and rescue crews. It was President Bush's first trip to the museum at Ground Zero. He was noticeably absent from the National September 11 Memorial & Museum dedication in May which was attended by President Obama and former president Bill Clinton. Instead, Bush's office issued a statement saying he and wife Laura 'thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it'. The September 11 attacks on the U.S. claimed the lives of 2,996 people. A few days after two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, Bush stood on top of rubble on the site, and using a bullhorn, reassured Americans. That bullhorn is in the museum as part of a loan from the the Bush Presidential Library.

"As Apple's antitrust case enters its final stages, a former engineer has revealed the firm deliberately blocked rivals' music from its iPods (pictured) As Apple's billion-dollar antitrust case enters its final stages, a former engineer has revealed the tech giant deliberately blocked rivals' music from its iPods. Rod Schultz, who worked as a senior software engineer at Apple between 2006 and 2008, said he worked on a project 'intended to block 100 per cent of non-iTunes clients.' The project was also set up to 'keep out third-party players' that competed with Apple's iPod, according to the Wall Street Journal. Mr Schultz was subpoenaed by the prosecution to prove Apple restricted rival music on its iPods, which ultimately pushed up the prices of the devices. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this month lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods. The case went to trial in California last month, after being filed a decade ago. Plaintiffs are claiming Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed it to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. Mr Schultz, who worked on Digital Rights Management (DRM), security and data encryption for iTunes and iPods during this time at the firm, said he was an 'unwilling witness' and was not happy about discussing his work, codenamed Candy. Apple, and Mr Schultz, claimed the aim of the project was to improve iTunes and protect its users from malware and other threats caused by downloading non-iTunes music. They added it was not the firm's intention to stifle competition. Earlier in the trial, the prosecution told the court that  Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings.

And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' But Apple insisted the move was a legitimate security measure. The court case was almost dismissed earlier this month when the judge disqualified one of the claimants because her iPod wasn't bought during the time period detailed in the case. The other claimant withdrew her claims. But 65-year-old Massachusetts business consultant Barbara Bennet read about the floundering case online and volunteered to represent consumers in the suit. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has repeatedly shown impatience with the attorneys for not doing a better job of vetting the original named claimant in the case, who are supposed to represent the 'class of affected consumers'. 'We shouldn't have been here in the first place,' Rogers said as attorneys on both sides debated how to proceed Tuesday morning. A video testimony of late Apple boss Steve Jobs was played earlier in the trial, filmed six months before his death in 2011. In the testimony, Mr Jobs defended the software and said: 'We were very scared' of the prospect that hackers could break Apple's security system. He added that this might jeopardise Apple's contracts with music recording companies that didn't want their songs to be pirated. 'We would get nasty emails from the labels,' he added.

"Pam Pope, 65, from Surrey had nine organs removed by surgeons trying to save her life when they diagnosed a very rare form of cancer . A cancer patient underwent a 13-hour operation to remove all the organs she could live without as surgeons battled to remove an aggressive and rare form of cancer from invading her body. The morning after the procedure, dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries', Pam Pope's surgeon stood by her bedside and listed all the organs his surgical team removed in order to save her life. By the time he reached the ninth, the 65-year-old had burst into tears. The gruelling operation carried out at The Hampshire Clinic in Basingstoke, aimed to remove all cancerous tissue in the body. In Ms Pope's case her appendix, large bowel, most of her small bowel, gall bladder, spleen, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and cervix were removed, as well as most of her stomach lining and navel. 'I just wasn't expecting to be told so much of my body had gone,' she said. 'The list of organs that had been removed was so long that I actually lost count. 'I just could not fathom how I could still be alive when so much of me was missing.' The operation, carried out by a team of six leading UK surgeons, is known in medical circles as the 'mother of all surgeries', with good reason. It was followed by a ‘chemo bath’, where the abdominal cavity is filled with warm chemotherapy liquid - normally for 90 minutes, while the patient is still under anaesthetic. It is one of the most invasive operations performed  and the only way to treat a rare cancer thought to originate in the appendix - pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). The disease quickly spreads around the abdominal cavity meaning diagnosis usually comes with a death sentence. Now the mammoth operation to remove as many organs as possible while keeping patients alive means sufferers like Ms Pope, who would previously have been considered too sick to treat, are being offered a lifeline. 'I was already stage four when they operated because the cancer had gone undetected for so long,' she said. 'I would not be here now had it been left for a few more months.' Though Ms Pope suspects her cancer may have developed earlier, she had been complaining of symptoms for 15 months before her final diagnosis. 'I just did not feel right,' she said. 'I had stomach pain and nausea.' After several visits to her GP, the insurance executive from Camberwell, Surrey, was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 'I felt that was not accurate,' she said. 'I had always been very fit and very healthy with a good diet but my GP did not want to consider anything else.' Ms Pope returned to see her GP several more times over the course of the next year, each time requesting a referral to hospital which was denied. It was only after she reported a change in bowel habits to a different doctor that alarm bells finally rang. Doctors initially diagnosed Ms Pope with IBS, but not convinced, she sought a second opinion. Further tests revealed the 65-year-old was suffering pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) - a cancer which is thought to spread from cancer of the appendix, causing tumours to grow on other abdominal organs . 'The new GP agreed my symptoms warranted further investigation, which was a huge relief because by then I was in no doubt that it was not IBS,' she said. In December 2012 a laparoscopy - where a fibre optic instrument is inserted through the abdominal wall to look at organs - quickly identified that abnormal cells were present. She said she felt 'strangely relieved' to hear this news having spent so long insisting she did not have IBS. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare cancer, affecting around one in 500,000 people a year. It is characterised by the presence of mucin-producing tumours in the abdominal cavity. There are a number of possible origins of PMP, but the most common source is appendix cancer. There is no known underlying cause of PMP but there are a number of theories around its origin. Cells from a tumour in the appendix are thought to leak into the abdominal cavity and implant on other abdominal organs. The tumours then replicate and produce a mucinous byproduct that then spreads throughout the abdomen. Many patients lack clearly defined symptoms, making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages. The most common symptoms are: . Source: PMP Research Foundation . It was like 'being proved right', she added. But when her consultant told her she was the one in a million patient suffering with rare PMP, like many people, she had never heard of the cancer. He explained the disease had started in her appendix but may have spread around the abdominal cavity in mucus leaked from the organ. The microscopic cells can then attach themselves to other organs and tissue the mucus comes into contact with. An operation to 'debulk' the body of cancerous cells, she was told, was her only hope of survival. The surgeons had no idea how far spread the cancer was and how many organs they needed to remove until they operated. Ms Pope was hopeful when she was wheeled into theatre in May last year that surgery would be minimal because she had not suffered the weight loss or thickening of the waist common with advanced PMP. Just 24 hours later she was told surgeons had removed her appendix, large bowel, most of the small bowel, gall bladder, spleen, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix as well as most of her stomach lining and navel. 'I cried because I could not believe I was still alive,' she said. 'I had thought I might lose one or two organs but not all that. I realised then why it was called the ""mother of all surgeries"" - everything that I could live without had gone to give me the best chance of survival. 'It was a shock but the surgeon was very supportive in offering to arrange counselling,' she said. The radical operation had been followed by a radical procedure called a chemotherapy bath. This is where the cavity was filled with hot chemotherapy liquid in an attempt to wash away any remaining cancer cells. Ms Pope said: 'Despite everything that they had taken I was told five per cent still remained on my small bowel. Six surgeons removed Ms Pope's appendix, large bowel, most of her small bowel, gall bladder, spleen, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix as well as most of her stomach lining and navel . 'It was too dangerous to remove it all so they left as little as they could which needed conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.' Ms Pope spent the best part of the following year in hospital recovering and undergoing more chemotherapy. Chemotherapy baths, officially called Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, involve filling the abdominal cavity with warm chemo liquid, normally for 90 minutes. The patient remains under anaesthetic. Bathing the inside of the stomach with heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed. Heat at 42°C kills cancer cells without affecting normal, healthy cells. If the drug was given in general circulation, as with normal chemotherapy, the temperature would heat the body up and the heart would stop. But the abdominal organs act as a barrier, absorbing the drug. It can therefore reach a high concentration in the area where the tumours are, without reaching the blood stream and damaging tissues in the rest of the body. The treatment was approved by the government's health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), in February 2010. The biggest hurdle was adjusting to the loss of so many organs. At one stage she looked unlikely to pull through and was advised 'enjoy the time you have left'. Determined not to give up, the 65-year-old contacted cancer professor Justin Stebbing at the London Clinic of Oncology. She said: 'I had read about his work and my surgeon agreed to refer me. 'He was a leading voice on cancers like mine and probably about the only person who wouldn't turn me away.' Professor Stebbing found a regime Ms Pope's body could cope with. A scan earlier this year revealed no signs of any cancer, but hydration is still an issue and Ms Pope relies on a drip every night, which she uses at home. She struggles with tiredness and remains frail, though her health has improved enough for her to return to work part time. 'I love my job so that was a major achievement for me,' she said. Fortnightly chemotherapy will, she hopes, keep the cancer at bay. 'This has been a fight but I need to tell my story to make people aware of this very sneaky cancer,' she added. 'I was told this disease would likely kill me but I'm still here thanks to the 'mother of all surgeries, which has lifted a death sentence.'","Pam Pope complained of symptoms for 15 months before doctors diagnosed her as suffering irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

"What does Rosetta’s comet really look like? While it was known to be a particular shade of grey, what exactly it would look to the human eye has been a bit of a mystery. But now the first colour image of the comet has revealed its true nature - and it turns out it's a slightly different, but somewhat similar, shade of grey to previous images. The Max Planck Institute in Germany has revealed the true colour of 67P (shown). The image reveals what the comet would look like to the human eye. It was taken by combining different filters from Rosetta's main camera. Superposing the red, blue and green wavelengths together revealed the colour of the comet . The image was released by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany. It was created using the Osiris camera on Rosetta, which is the primary camera on the spacecraft. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. The scientists combined the instrument’s red, green and blue filters to create an image as it would appear to the human eye. One of the most interesting findings from the image is that there is no sign of surface ice at all. If it were present, it would be recognisable as a bluish feature on the surface - but as it is not, it must mean the comet’s ice is hidden beneath the surface. ‘We like to refer to Osiris as the eyes of Rosetta,’ said the instrument’s Principal Investigator Dr Holger Sierks from MPS. ‘However, these eyes are quite unlike our own.’ The camera has several colour filters that allow light of only certain wavelengths to pass through. But usually, for scientific purposes, only one of the filters is used for images as by themselves the separate images are better than those with all wavelengths. Thus creating a ‘true colour’ image is something that, while interesting, is not entirely useful for the mission as a whole. The method to create the true colour image was similar to the way colours are combined in computer and TV monitors. Previous images of the comet, such as this one from 17 November 2014, had been taken using only one of the filters on the camera, so they had edited to appear in just black and white. The latest image, though, shows that the actual shade of the comet is not too different from these earlier photos . Previous speculation had suggested the comet might actually be red (shown), but as it turns out this was just one image taken by one of the three filters on Rosetta. Interestingly, though, the comet does actually reflect more red light than any other wavelength - like many other small bodies in the solar system . The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit (illustrated) in August 2014. Each of the images also needs to be carefully superposed with the others, as Osiris takes the images one after the other. This means that they each get a slightly different view of the comet, as Rosetta is travelling through space and the comet is rotating. According to Emily Baldwin on Esa's Rosetta blog, this is the reason it had taken so long to get the first colour image of the comet. 'Painstaking work is needed to superimpose the images accurately, which is one reason it has taken so long to come up with the first meaningful colour image of 67P/C-G,' she wrote. And the result? ‘As it turns out, 67P looks dark grey, in reality almost as black as coal,’ said Dr Sierks. It has also been found that, due to the size of surface grains on the comet, it reflects red light slightly more efficiently than other wavelengths. This is a phenomenon found on other small bodies in the solar system as well.","Max Planck Institute in Germany has revealed the true colour of 67P .

"A former judge has been found guilty of planting crystal meth on a woman who accused him of sexually harassing her inside his chambers. Bryant Cochran, who was the magistrate of Murray County, Georgia, was convicted of six federal crimes relating to a number of court employees. The charges included illegally searching through another woman's phone, framing a woman for arrest and asking a childhood friend to lie to investigators on his behalf. Guilty: Bryant Cochran, who was the magistrate of Murray County, Georgia, was convicted of six federal crimes relating to a number of court employees including Angela Garmely (right) who had the drugs planted on her when she accused him of harassment . According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press he shook his head as the guilty were read out and will return for sentencing on February 20. Virginia Rector, Cochran’s former clerk, told the jury that she feared working for the former magistrate and claimed he sexually harassed her years. But she didn’t report the crime until after he resigned. During a hearing on December 3, she said: 'He had a lot of friends in the county. I would get fired and nobody would know. … It’s not right. It’s not fair.' Sonya Petty, his secretary, said he would go through women's cell phones when they were out of the office. Angela Garmley visited him in his office in 2012. She asked Cochran to take out warrants against three people she said had beaten her. She told the court that Cochran said needed a mistress and asked whether she liked oral sex. They spoke and text messaged each other for about a week. Mugshot: Garmley was initially arrested when officers found crystal meth in her car, but the charges were later dropped. Cochran is facing 20 years in federal prison . Months later, Garmley said, Cochran told her husband she had flirted with him. Joe Garmley reported the relationship to the Judicial Qualifications Commission and local media outlets in July 2012. A month later, the Murray County Sheriff’s Office arrested Garmley on charges of possessing methamphetamine after Cochran gave officers a tip that the drug would be found in her car. The charges against Garmley were later dropped. Cochran now faces up to 20 years in a federal prison with each charge carrying a range of sentences.","Bryant Cochran was found guilty of six federal crimes in north Georgia .

"Next time you're in a fast-food joint steer clear of the chicken options, be wary of ice machines and use ketchup bottles with caution, restaurant workers have warned in a candid online discussion. Social news website Reddit asked fast food employees for ‘the one menu option at your employment that you would recommend people never eat?' Within 24 hours, the conversation generated more than 6,000 comments revealing the alleged dodgy practices in fast-food chains, including some branches of Wendy’s, McDonalds and Subway. Warned: Fast food workers have drawn attention to mouldy ice machines and suspect cooking practices in various chains, including McDonalds, Wendy's and Subway . The thread also offers some useful tips for customers to be aware of including, mouldy ice machines and how condiment containers can be endlessly refilled without being cleaned. Chicken nuggets and grilled chicken were repeat offenders throughout the thread with workers confessing to using lots of grease to keep chicken from sticking. Unsurprisingly, chicken nuggets, often in the headlines for suspect ingredients, came under fire again. One former McDonald’s employee warned against the chicken nuggets recalling: ‘I accidentally left a whole bag of about 100 chicken nuggets out on a counter for way too long. They melted. Into a pool of liquid. I never understood why. But they were completely indiscernible as being the nuggets I once knew.' Repeat offender: One ex McDonalds worker recalled a bag of chicken nuggets bizarrely melting into mush . However, beware ordering a grilled chicken sandwich as a 'healthy option' instead. One McDonald’s employee detailed the amount of margarine used to keep the chicken from sticking to the grill. ‘We use three squirts of liquid margarine on the bottom of it. To keep it juicy, once we've lain the frozen blocks of chicken, three more squirts of liquid margarine are applied to the tops.’ Meanwhile at one Subway branch the . defrosting process used for grilled chicken involves leaving the frozen . meat in hot water for hours before wringing them of liquid at the end of . the day, one worker testified. When it came to hygiene matters ice machines were highlighted as a hazard with Reddit pointing to the apparent . difficulty in keeping them clean and free of mould. Similarly, comments suggested that communal condiment bottles were re-filled without being cleaned first. An . ex-Subway employee noted that the state of particular branches ‘can . often tell you how well that particular place is kept in terms of food . safety.’ That employee looked out for . food on the floor and the colour of the tuna mix as indicators to . gauge the overall cleanliness of a branch. Wendy's beef chili recipe caused controversy with an ex-Wendy's worker warning of the chain's chili recipe, which he alleged is made from left-over beef patties. 'The . meat comes from hamburger patties that sat on the grill too long to . serve to customers. They take them and put them in a bin and then throw . them in the fridge. When the chili is made they take it out, boil it, . chop it up and dump them in the chili.' Greasy: One McDonalds worker detailed the six squirts of margarine he used to stop grilled chicken from sticking to the grill or being too dry (file photo) Veggie options were also mentioned and non-meat eaters will be appalled by the anecdotes of using the same cooking equipment for vegetarian and meat items. Wendy's Chili: A former Wendy's employee said the Chili recipe involved boiling burgers that has sat on the grill too long to be sold to customers . Not just what you choose off the menu but when you go to the restaurants was also mentioned. The insider experts suggest that visiting a restaurant towards closing . time was ill-advised, especially in pizza places which sell by the . slice. Sitting under heaters all day the pizzas have developed a 'cardboard-like' texture by closing time, a worker wrote. A . Five Guys employee painted the burger chain in a good light claiming . that nothing was frozen and most things were made from fresh. However, the worker advised customers to order regular sized fries. ‘Ordering . a large fry is always a bad idea. The difference between a large fry . and a regular fry is surprisingly small (especially when it's busy).' At the end of June a McDonald’s worker lifted the lid on what it is really like to work at the fast food giant. Burgers . and chicken are left to stew for ‘hours on end’ whilst staff moan about . having to make Happy Meals as they are time-consuming, he said. He . also claimed that some staff at his branch deal marijuana from the . parking lot and that if somebody comes in high they will ‘practically . give you free food’. Heather Oldani, a spokeswoman for McDonalds, said that much of the Reddit conversation regarding the restaurant was 'inaccurate.' 'Customers can trust McDonald's to provide them with food that is real and made with high quality ingredients from the most trusted suppliers.  In fact, we use some of the same trusted brands our customers serve at home and can buy in their local grocery store. 'Our Chicken McNuggets in particular are made with white meat. Tales of Chicken McNuggets ""melting"" fall in the realm of urban legend and other misinformation about Chicken McNuggets,' a statement read.","A McDonalds worker detailed the huge amounts of margarine put on the 'healthy' grilled chicken sandwich .

"Among Lucia Terui's first diving experiences was an encounter with Nomura's jellyfish, the graceful giants of the sea that grow up to 6ft 6in in diameter. Perhaps understandably the sighting inspired an obsession for Terui, 40, to one day photograph the creatures, which are 100 times the size of an average jellyfish and are most commonly found in the waters between China and Japan. And when the Brazilian photographer achieved her goal on a diving trip into the waters of Echizen, Fukui province, Japan, she said she felt 'pure joy'. Scroll down for video . A giant Nomura's jellyfish dwarfs a diver in this image captured by Brazilian photographer Lucia Terui in the waters off Echizen, Japan . Nomura's jellyfish can grow up to 6ft 6in in diameter and are found most commonly in the sea between China and Japan . After seeing the giant jellyfish, Lucia says she 'became obsessed with them and getting the perfect shot, and years later I got my moment' Photographer Lucia Terui encountered the creatures on her diving trip . 'On one of my first ever diving trips I had the privilege to dive with this particular jellyfish,' says Lucia, now of Hamamatsu, Japan. 'I was delighted and it was an incredible experience, but on that particular occasion I didn't have the underwater photography equipment to capture the images in the way I wanted. 'From then on I became obsessed with them and getting the perfect shot, and years later I got my moment.' Lucia was able to photograph the enormous five-foot jellyfish in all its glory. She spent three days diving with her husband, Alexandre Shimoishi, 40, on the lookout for the incredible creature. Lucia says: 'I had to dive deep into the open sea to be able to find one, but it was worth it in the end and I felt pure joy when I did. 'It was a dream of mine achieved, the jellyfish are so beautiful and inoffensive, and because of that I wasn't afraid at all. 'A lot of patience was needed, as there were lot of jellyfish in the sea but most of them were hurt or almost dead, I wanted one that was healthy and a beauty to shoot.' The Nomura's jellyfish is classified in the same category as the lion's mane jellyfish, the largest cnidarian in the world. The diameter when fully grown is slightly greater than the height of an average man, with the ability to grow up to 6ft 6in. Although their stings are generally very painful, they are not known for causing any major damage to humans. Despite their formidable size, Lucia loves photographing nature's gentle giants. She says: 'It's funny because most of the time my friends call me crazy, but they like and admire my photographs and so that really makes me happy. 'It's important that we respect and protect nature that is all around us, I believe this is our duty to life and the future of our planet.'","Photographer Lucia Terui became obsessed with snapping Nomura's jellyfish after seeing them when diving .

She even came runner up South Yorkshire Juniors Crown Green Bowls Tournament the day after her diagnosis. She is pictured here with her trophy . Miss Brown vowed to raise £50,000 for the Parents' Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT) and managed to raise £46,000 before she passed away . Now she has lost her battle with cancer, her family plan to continue fundraising over and above her £50,000 target. Her mother Velvyn Brown, 50, from Hatfield, South Yorkshire, said: 'We are just a normal family and we never expected something like this to happen to us. 'Hannah was not like a typical teenage girl, she was perfect. 'I am so proud of how she handled everything, I am more than proud.' 'She wasn't just my daughter she was my best friend. I can't believe she's not going to walk through the door any more.' Mrs Brown, who works in the prison service, says her daughter was initially diagnosed with the tumour when she began to notice problems with her hearing. She said: 'When Hannah was six she had difficulty breathing so we took her to the doctor. She had her tonsils out and grommets fitted. 'They told us to watch out for hearing problems as she got older. When I came from work every day I noticed the TV was getting louder and louder without Hannah realising. 'They gave her a nasal spray but when that didn't improve things they did an MRI scan where they found the brain tumour.' Despite the devastating diagnosis, the teenager stayed positive, even when she was told  her cancer was terminal in February this year. Her family and friends said she repeated the mantra 'I'm a warrior not a worrier' and never complained. Her family and friends described Miss Brown (pictured left and right) as a 'warrior' as she remained positive and determined despite being ill. She managed to pass two GCSEs from her hospital bed . Before she died, Miss Brown was an avid sportswoman, playing bowls for Doncaster Belles under 16s and Pilkingtons Recreational Bowling Club . She even passed two GCSEs from her hospital bed and vowed to raise £50,000 for the charity Parents' Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT). PACT was formed in 1977 as a support group for families whose children had cancer and now provides equipment to families and provides money for research into a cure for cancer . Mrs Brown said: 'She wanted people her own age to know it can happen to them and that cancer does affect teenagers. 'The community came together and gave us ideas for fundraising. We couldn't believe the level of support. 'She's touched so many hearts. We still go to awards ceremonies for her achievements now. 'Her school have been fantastic. They do a yearly award and they are changing it to Hannah's Award.' Her family members say they will continue fundraising in her honour. Miss Brown is pictured here with them before her school Prom, where she was crowned Prom Queen . Miss Brown continued fundraising until she died despite being too ill to carry out any of the tasks on her bucket list, such as skydving or visiting Harry Potter world.

Miss Brown was an avid sportswoman, playing bowls for Doncaster Belles under 16s and Pilkingtons Recreational Bowling Club. She even came runner up South Yorkshire Juniors Crown Green Bowls Tournament the day after her diagnosis. Her father, David Brown, said: 'She was such an inspiration and we can't believe the way she seemed to touch everyone's life without even trying. 'Her work has inspired so many people, some of whom never knew Hannah, and we are so proud of her. 'We are continuing to raise money for the charity - it's what Hannah would have wanted.' Miss Brown had made a bucket list of things she wanted to do before she passed away, but  was too poorly to complete anything on the list. She wanted to do a sky dive, ride in a hot air balloon, go to Harry Potter World and go to a Manchester United match. Mrs Velvyn said: 'Every time we set a date for something she would get poorly again. 'Her brother Matthew is going to do the sky dive in her memory. 'Hannah never lived to see the £50k target but we are determined to make it happen. 'We will be carrying on her fundraising legacy for as long as possible.' To donate visit her Just Giving page.

"As he drops new hints about his 2016 intentions, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is appearing in South Carolina just weeks before a self-imposed deadline to decide whether he will run for president. Bush is scheduled to give Monday's commencement address at the University of South Carolina. It marks the Republican leader's second visit in three months to the state that will host the 2016 presidential primary season's first contest in the South. In a television interview aired on the eve of the South Carolina appearance, Bush expressed confidence that he 'would be a good president,' adding that he was in the process of writing an e-book about his time as governor that would come out in the spring. 'One of the things I am going to do as I go through this process is release all my emails [from my time in office] and write an e-book,' he told WPLG, which he said was an effort to promote transparency and to 'let people make up their mind.' Scroll down for video . Will he run? Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  has promised to decide whether to run for president 'in short order,' and the reading of tea leaves is reaching a frantic pace as the holidays approach (file photo) Bush also said that going through the material has reminded him that 'if you run with big ideas, and then you're true to those ideas, and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction, you can move the needle. And that's what we need right now in America.' 'Sometime early next year I'll release the 250,000 emails,' Bush said in the televised interview. 'I was digital before digital was cool, I guess. Now it's like commonplace.' He also told WPLG of the emails 'There's some funny ones. There's some sad ones. There's some serious ones.' Asked about a potential presidential run, Bush said 'This is a really serious, life-changing decision, and I'm going to take my time, but I realize that at some point end of this year, early next year, I'll make a decision to really pursue this or to stand down.' Aides report that Bush does not plan to meet with political operatives while in South Carolina. And Monday's speech is not expected to touch on any overtly political themes. But his mere presence in a state high on the presidential primary calendar will stoke new speculation that he is moving toward a White House bid. As the son of one president and brother of another, Bush has the power to transform the 2016 contest like no other Republican. He can tap into his family's vast political network, and his campaign would attract strong support from major donors and widespread media attention. Public release: Bush said he also will publish 250,000 from when he served as the governor of Florida . Family: As the son of former president George H.W. Bush, center, and the brother of former president George W. Bush, left, Jeb Bush has the power to transform the 2016 contest like no other Republican (1999 photo) But his supporters are struggling to understand what Bush's actions mean and whether they can predict his political intentions. He spent much of the recent midterm campaign out of the public eye. The South Carolina address, however, will be his fourth high-profile speech in recent weeks. That includes an appearance before corporate executives in Washington, where he called for his party to embrace an immigration overhaul and to focus on governing. He also said he would make the call on running for president 'not that far out in the future.' At the same time Bush has been expanding his private equity business, and advisers insist he's not courting a political staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, even as other would-be candidates assemble their 2016 campaign teams in the early voting states. About all anyone can say for certain is that, as Bush himself has said, he's still thinking about it and plans to make a decision by the end of the month. 'He's begun the journey. How long it will take him, I don't know,' said Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush friend and former chairman of the American Conservative Union. 'People are interpreting activity to conclude that he's closer to running. I'm not of that school. 'I hope he runs, but I believe the activity is based on getting serious.'","Bush expressed confidence that he 'would be a good president,' in a television interview that aired Sunday .

"A secret phone recording released on Monday shows an NFL exec promising Adrian Peterson he would be suspended for just two games, rather than indefinitely, the player's lawyers claim. The audio, obtained by ABC News, apparently backs up the Minnesota Vikings star's claims that the league promised he would return to the field shortly after pleading no contest to assaulting his four-year-old son. Instead, six days later, he was suspended without pay until at least April 15, 2015. The audio emerged on Monday as the NFL Players Association filed a federal lawsuit in Minnesota on behalf of Peterson, asking the court to dismiss the decision to uphold his punishment. In the conversation, which was recorded on November 12, he is speaking on the phone with Troy Vincent, the NFL executive vice president of football operations. Anger: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, pictured last month after pleading no contest for assaulting his son, has said a league exec promised him he could return to the field after just two games . At one point, Peterson says: 'I get two games.' 'Yeah,' Vincent responds. The football star continues: 'It will be two additional games, not time served.' On tape: Troy Vincent, executive vice president of football operations, denied making any promises . 'No, no, it won't,' Vincent replies. 'The one this weekend. So really, it's just next week and you - you're rolling. You're back.' Again, Peterson asks: 'Two games?' 'Yeah that is if you - you cannot - you gotta just go through the process,' Vincent says. 'I gave my word the other day. I think we looked at each other and in my heart I'm praying that we can just get your family restored and just get you back on the field so you can continue to be the ball player, the citizen, the father, the husband that God's called you to be. 'You've done a lot, paid the price, and I think everybody understands that.' Before Peterson's suspension was upheld on Friday, the promise was at the crux of the NFL Players Association argument that he should be reinstated. The union claimed Vincent told Peterson he would receive the shorter ban if he attended a hearing on with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on November 14. But Peterson, 29, declined to meet that day with Goodell, citing uncertainty about the NFL's intent to question him. Goodell then announced the suspension on November 18. The union gave the recording to the case's arbitrator, Harold Henderson, who oversaw a hearing on December 2. Vincent was questioned, but Henderson concluded Peterson was not retaliated against for not going to meet with Goodell. Not backing off: The decision by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, pictured announcing new measures for the NFL's personal conduct policy last week, to suspend Peterson indefinitely was upheld on Friday . 'Mr. Vincent testified that he never promised a two-game suspension or that the old policy would control, but rather encouraged Mr. Peterson to ""go through the process and all things will be considered"",' Henderson wrote. 'He said, ""I didn't promise Adrian anything. Never promised. Adrian needed to show up. Talk"".' Peterson has been suspended from the league until at least April 15, 2015 for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son. The boy was left with lacerations across his body. The football player, who has six children, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in Texas on November 4 for probation time, community service and a small fine. He acknowledged physically disciplining the boy as he had been as a youth, but he said he meant no harm and was sorry for the trouble he caused. 'I love my son more than any of you can imagine,' he said outside the courthouse that day. Although avoided jail time and a felony conviction, he has been fined more than $4.1 million as part of the punishment from the NFL - the cost of the six-game suspension. On Friday, the suspension was upheld as arbitrator Harold Henderson called it arguably one of the most egregious cases of domestic violence' in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's nine-year tenure. In response, the NFL Players Association said it expected the outcome 'given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL'. Hurt: Peterson was charged with misdemeanor reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son, leaving him with lacerations (pictured). Peterson has apologized . Determined: Peterson, who was named as MVP in 2012, has missed six games for the Vikings this season, meaning he has missed out of $4 million in pay. He said he is considering retiring from the NFL . 'The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement,' it continued. 'This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.' Henderson's announcement was a decisive victory for Goodell, whose authority was overruled last month by the arbitrator in the case of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice. Rice was reinstated, but he had no team to return to because the Ravens released him a week into the season. The union's grievance for Peterson was similar, arguing essentially that Goodell was making up protocol for discipline as he went along. But Henderson forcefully wrote that he saw no bounds being overstepped by the league boss. The Vikings declined to comment. Peterson has told ESPN.com that he might walk away from the game, possibly even trying to run in the 2016 Olympics. 'I've considered retiring from the NFL,' Peterson said. 'I still made $8 million this year. ... I've thought about going after the Olympics. You only live once. It might be time for me to pursue that.'","Adrian Peterson claims the recording shows NFL exec Troy Vincent promised him he would return to the field within two games .

"Hoverboards have become an obsession for amateur designers ever since Marty McFly jumped on one in Back to the Future II. Now, one Texan claims he has finally been able to create his own version for just £160 ($250) using garden leaf blowers that float on a pocket of air. Ryan Craven, 27, built the device using four leaf blowers, a 4ft by 4ft (1.2 by 1.2 metre) piece of plywood, a skateboard deck, shower liner, coffee can lids and gaffer tape. Scroll down for video . He claims that anyone can build their own in eight steps using simple tools that include a tape measure, sand paper, staple gun and a hole saw. The waiter said he came up with the idea after seeing another hoverboard project on Kickstarter, which inspired him to design one which anyone can build. 'I'm a huge Back to the Future fan and always wanted to build one,' he said. 'I saw the HUVR Kickstarter campaign with Tony Hawk and thought it was the perfect time to try building one.' Back to the future: Ryan Craven, 27, built the device using four leaf blowers, a 4ft by 4ft (1.2 by 1.2 metre) piece of plywood, a skateboard deck, shower liner, coffee can lids and gaffer tape . Floating on air: 'I'm a huge Back to the Future fan and always wanted to build one,' said Mr Craven (pictured) 'I saw the HUVR Kickstarter campaign with Tony Hawk and thought it was the perfect time to try building one' 'It can move quite a bit once it's going, and despite the steering issue, which really isn't quite there, you can go quite far and move a little bit. Mr Craven explained that the device is essentially a miniature version of a hovercraft. He has also released instructions for anyone who would like to make their own. A skirt fills with air that is released below from strategically placed holes that create a small pocket between the device, dubbed 'Mr Hoverboard', and the ground. The Hendo hoverboard uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other . In October, Californian architect Greg Henderson made a similar hoverboard that floats in mid-air. Dubbed the Hendo Hoverboard, the technology uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes. As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster. That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air. In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground. Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field. 'The Back to the Future hoverboard has always been the impossible dream, but I wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use, and not too expensive,' added Mr Craven. 'There are so many variations of skateboard and this one could easily end up being just another variation. 'But I would love for people to take my idea and develop it to the point where it becomes universal.' The design becomes even more staggering as Mr Craven is not a designer or inventor – and he says his first prototypes were far from perfect. Blown away: 'The Back to the Future hoverboard (right) has always been the impossible dream, but I wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use, and not too expensive,' added Mr Craven. Left is an early prototype created using a hairdryer . 'I'm not an engineer,' he said. 'I work in a restaurant, so it's pretty naive of me to buy four leaf blowers. 'I'm pretty much broke all the time usually and if people want to donate then that would be wonderful. Mr Craven has been working on the design since March and the early prototypes had wheels and were much smaller at first. 'One was even powered by a disassembled hairdryer, until I finally hit on the idea of the leaf blowers,' he said. 'They were crude. Frankensteinish. 'The process is very chaotic and it's so much easier to fail than to succeed.' Mr Craven is now working on the next version which he hopes will be quieter, with improved air flow and less vibration.

"Spelman College in Atlanta has suspended a prestigious endowed professorship in Bill Cosby's name following a string of sexual assault allegations against him, it today emerged. The historically black women's college created the William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship after receiving a $20million gift from the 77-year-old comedian in 1988. But now, it has indefinitely suspended the star's chair, saying that it can no longer 'meet its objectives' to enhance the 133-year-old school's intellectual, cultural and creative life. Scroll down for video . Accused comedian: Spelman College in Atlanta has suspended a prestigious endowed professorship in Bill Cosby's (pictured) name following a string of sexual assault allegations against him, it today emerged . Famed: The historically black women's college (pictured) created the William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship after receiving a $20million gift from the 77-year-old comedian and his wife in 1988 . Decision: But now, it has indefinitely suspended the star's chair, saying it can no longer 'meet its objectives' to enhance the school's intellectual, cultural and creative life. Above, a statement on the school's website . In a statement on its website on Sunday, Spelman said: 'The William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship was established to bring positive attention and accomplished visiting scholars to Spelman College in order to enhance our intellectual, cultural and creative life. 'The current context prevents us from continuing to meet these objectives fully. Consequently, we will suspend the program until such time that the original goals can again be met.' The statement did not address whether the college will change the name of the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby, Ed.D. Academic Center, which houses the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art. It comes as an increasing number of women are stepping forward to claim Cosby drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. The entertainer has denied the allegations via his lawyers. Cosby, who gave the commencement address at Spelman in 2006, made history with his $20million gift to the school, which was the single largest donation ever given to a historically black institution. In addition to funding the endowed chair, the comedian and his wife, Camille, helped build the Cosby Center on campus - and their daughter, Evin, even attended the college for two years. Close ties: Cosby (pictured speaking to Spelman College President Dr Beverly Tatum) made history with his $20million gift to the school, which was the single largest donation ever given to a historically black institution . On-screen daughter: Spelman is  the alma mater of Keshia Knight Pulliam (pictured, left, as a child and, right, last year), who played Cosby's - Cliff Huxtable's - youngest daughter, Rudy Huxtable, on 'The Cosby Show' Spelman, founded in 1881 in Georgia's capital, is also the alma mater of Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Cosby's - Cliff Huxtable's - youngest daughter, Rudy Huxtable, on 'The Cosby Show'. On Sunday, Spelman graduate, Pearl Cleage, an award-winning novelist and playwright and former Cosby Chair, said she believed the school made the right move in suspending the professorship. Speaking to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she said: 'In light of the current accusations against Mr. Cosby, it’s appropriate to suspend the chair while the college reevaluates the relationship with Mr. Cosby, moving forward.' The Chair has also held by acclaimed author, Tanarive Due. The decision follows online protests by many Spelman students, who have criticized Cosby's links with the college by using the Twitter hashtag #NotMyFather, referring to the star's TV persona. It also follows Cosby's resignation from the board of trustees of his beloved Temple University, an act which he says was made in the 'best interests of the university and its students'. The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, also recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign. And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name. Dozens of women have come forward to claim that they were sexually assaulted by the comedian, who has been with his wife  for the last 51 years. Many  have a similar story of being slipped a pill. Couple: It comes as an increasing number of women are stepping forward to claim Cosby (pictured with his wife, Camille, in November) drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. Coming forward: Last week, super model Beverly Johnson (pictured), claimed that Cosby drugged her in the 1980s during an audition for 'The Cosby Show'. She said she managed to get away without being raped . On Sunday, Cosby, who has never been charged over the mounting rape claims, said he expected only the 'black media' to stay 'neutral' and give him a fair hearing over the allegations. Speaking to the New York Post's Page Six, the star said that African-American media should be impartial in reporting the allegations that he is a serial rapist. 'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' he said. Alleged victim: Cosby's legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson (pictured), who repeatedly called him a rapist in a CNN interview . He also praised his wife's 'love and strength'. When asked by the reporter how she was coping he said: 'Love and the strength of womanhood.' He then repeated the phrase twice more. Cosby's legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who repeatedly called him a rapist in a televised interview with CNN. Dickinson also used the appearance to address Cosby's wife - whom she said she pitied for having a rapist husband. She said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her. 'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me. 'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me. 'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children.' Last week, super model Beverly Johnson, stepped forward to claim Cosby drugged her in the 1980s during an audition for 'The Cosby Show'. She said she managed to get away without being raped.

"With production credits that include Hollywood blockbusters such as Gladiator and Gangs of New York, to much-loved British TV series such as Coronation Street, a small Gloucestershire business has celebrated another year as the world's most sought-after expert in fake snow. Darcey Crownshaw's company Snow Business, which he founded 31 years ago, specialises in delivering more than 300 varieties of snow - both real and artificial - for the world's biggest film and TV productions. His innovations in snow that is suitable for massive film crews and fictional situations has made his company Hollywood's first port of call for winter creations when the on screen temperature drops and they can't wait on the weather. A frosty looking scene in Pirates of the Caribbean, created with the help of Gloucestershire company Snow Business . A still picture taken from the production of The Chronicles of Narnia, in which Mr Crownshaw's company was used to make the animals and creatures appear frozen . The company also created the breezy snowflakes which feature in the opening battle scene of Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott . A scene from the TV series Band of Brothers Snow Business helped create - showing soldiers walking through a frozen town during the Second World War . The Day After Tomorrow movie (pictured) was particularly challenging because of the sheer scale of snow required for the production. The film depicts earth during an apocalyptic climate event . Mr Crownshaw started out 31 years ago supplying old newspapers for the film Pompeii. He said: 'In our first year of trading we turned over £958 which wasn't a lot and we're now in 25 countries, including places like Iceland, Canada and Russia, but also places like Korea.' He states the service is 'all down to continuity'. A week spent in fake artificial snow was not going to make cast and crew sick, nor turn to slush due to hundreds of people tramping over it days on end. The company also provides snow very specific to what is needed. 'Things like the Day After Tomorrow - that was quite a challenge - just the scale of the snow. Then you get things like Maleficent, when they wanted really amazing ice shapes and special features, so again that's a challenge. When we did the Muppets movies, we'd never worked with actors six inches high before. 'Everything we do is a challenge.' The artificial snow is created from ingredients such as paper, wood pulp, starch, polymer and biodegradable plastic, while real snow can be customised to appear, for example, as light snowflakes, or a thick and heavy downfall. The Harry Potter series of films also utilised Snow Business. Pictured in a scene from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . A picture taken from the production of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which the company's snow was used to cover a frosty ship . Scenes in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, such as the one pictured, were also filmed using snow supplied by the Gloucestershire company . The James Bond film Die Another Day, starring Pierce Brosnan, also hired Snow Business for the car chase scene pictured . A scene from the movie The Holiday, which hired Snow Business to recreate a picturesque and chilly afternoon landscape . 'We've got over 300 different types of artificial snow. Or you can make real snow, that's kind of a little bit bigger and whiter. Even when we make real snow - even now, it's just one kind of snow but we can make it in different varieties. 'Some machines mix nitrogen with water that atomizes with compressed air and that we'll shoot out like what you see on the ski slopes. 'Normally on a movie set we'll be using seven different types of snow to achieve what the director wants. Some will be very white in the background while snows in the foreground will be much better looking close up and will be durable so the actors leave footprints when they walk. 'Other snows might sparkle when the camera goes close to it. Other snows might be really white so it goes slushy on the paths when cars drive through. Others bulk up so you have three feet (deep) snow a man can fight his way through.' He has even used snow that has a tinge of yellow - so it didn't make a white fridge being advertised appear off-coloured. However the 31 years spent perfecting the different types of snow were not always easy. 'There were mistakes, there was trial and error and there were alleyways. We've had the whole gambit. We've invested lots and lots of money on things that have come to absolutely nothing then we've invested in something that came to be the best thing ever. 'We have to understand what the customer expects and then you have to deliver. When a director says ""I want snow"", you have to start a conversation and say: ""Well, what snow do you need?""'

"She's famous for her conservative sense of style but that didn't stop Spain's Queen Letizia from flashing a glimpse of thigh during a reception at the Zarzuela Palace today. The 42-year-old opted for an unusually short cream shift dress for the event, which was held to honour members of the Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas - the Spanish cinema association. Letizia's daring new look represented a departure from her usual midi length, although she did take some precautions, teaming the dress with neat courts and a pair of opaque black tights. Scroll down for video . Showing some leg: Queen Letizia (centre right) flashes her thighs during a reception in Madrid . With her at the event was 46-year-old King Felipe who was dapper in a black suit and who, at one point, put his arm around his wife as he helped her into position. The Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas is one of the biggest champions of Spanish cinema and is responsible for the annual Goya awards - Spain's equivalent of the BAFTAS. The current president, film producer Enrique González Macho, was among the guests to greet the Spanish royals at the Zarzuela Palace this morning, while his predecessors include Álex de la Iglesia, a pioneering director who mentored Pedro Almodóvar. This is not the first time the Spanish royals, who are currently in mourning for the late Queen Fabiola of Belgium, have shown their support for the arts in recent months. Letizia in particular is known to be a fan and travelled to Vienna at the beginning of October to open an exhibition dedicated to Spanish court painter, Diego Velázquez. Daring: The ultra-high hemline represents a departure from her usual conservative sense of style . Stylish: The dress was worn at a reception for the Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas . Stop! King Felipe stepped in to help his wife at one point, when she appeared to be going the wrong way . Later the same week, she and King Felipe were both on hand for the launch of a new Spanish dictionary and have consistently championed the arts since ascending to the throne in June. The two have also overseen a sea-change in the way the Spanish royal family does business, with Felipe banning private employment and accepting lavish gifts last week. The new rules, which also apply to former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia, come into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'. Felipe's move comes after his father's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an €18m (£14m) yacht. Fortuna, which Juan-Carlos was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity, became a regular plaything of the Spanish royals, who used it during summer holidays in Mallorca. Felipe's new-look Spanish monarchy is closer in style to the Scandinavian system, which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles. All smiles: Both halves of the royal couple appeared to be on good form as they met filmmakers . Changes: King Felipe is in the midst of an overhaul of the Spanish royal family's public image . Glamorous: Letizia, who will also be affected by the changes, looked fresh-faced and happy . As part of his drive to modernise the institution, the 46-year-old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.' Despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their British and Spanish counterparts, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish monarchs and their families do accept gifts, although like the British royals, most have to be declared. In the case of the UK royal family, gifts either become part of the Royal Collection and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution. Although the Queen is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like Juan-Carlos, she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits, including a collection of shells, a set of lacrosse sticks, sunglasses, a pair of sandals, pineapples, eggs, a box of snail shells, a grove of maple trees, a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns. The Queen has also been given a number of horses, among them her Trooping the Colour mount, Burmese, and a series of exotic animals, including a canary, jaguars, sloths and an elephant called Jumbo - all of which were given to London Zoo.","Letizia opted for a thigh-scraping mini - a departure from her usual style .

"Sterilization, or tube-tying, is on its way to overtake the birth control pill as the most popular form of female contraception. According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 62per cent of U.S. women between 15 and 44 use some form of birth control. Among those, 16per cent were on the Pill between 2011 and 2013, and following close behind was the 15.5per cent of women who chose female sterilization. On the rise: According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, female sterilization or tube-tying may soon overtake the Pill as women's preferred form of birth control . Sterilization involves surgically or non-surgically blocking or cutting a woman's Fallopian tubes, making her permanently unable to get pregnant. When a woman undergoes tubal ligation, her tubes are either cut and tied or sealed with an electrical current, clamps or rings. Another option is to put tiny inserts into the tubes, causing tissue to grow around them and block the tubes. The brand name for this type of sterilization is Essure. Since it has a nearly 100per cent success rate, it's an especially popular option among middle-aged women who have already had as many children as they want. Dr Vanessa Cullins, vice president of external medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, talked to Time about the findings. 'Consider the fact that the majority of women in this country have had the number of children they want to have by [their] mid-20s to 30, or so,' she said. 'And they still have the capacity to get pregnant until they are 50 years old.' Unlike methods of birth control that require maintenance, like condoms or the Pill, sterilization is seen as the more reliable way to ensure that women do not fall pregnant ever again. Women are also aware that the health risks of pregnancy increase after the age of 30, causing them to seek out a permanent solution. The study found the male condoms are the third most popular form of contraceptive, with 9.4per cent of couples using them during sex. In last place were long-acting reversible contraceptives such as Intrauterine devices, or IUDs, with 7.2per cent. IUDs were most popular among women between the ages of 25 and 34, with 11.1per cent choosing an IUD as their preferred method of birth control. Only 5per cent of females aged 15 to 24 used IUDs, and 5.3per cent of those between 35 and 44 said the same.","While 16% of U.S. women between 15 and 44 were on the Pill between 2011 and 2013, 15.5% chose female sterilization ."
"Creed front man Scott Stapp has repeatedly called 911 in recent weeks claiming that his family’s safety is at risk from unspecified forces who are out to kill him . Creed front man Scott Stapp has repeatedly called 911 in recent weeks claiming that his family’s safety is at risk from unspecified forces who are out to kill him. The singer has suffered a series of very public meltdowns that started last month when he posted a video on Facebook claiming that the IRS had taken all his money and he was broke and living in a Holiday Inn. Stapp’s wife Jaclyn has asked a judge in Palm Beach County, Florida, to have her husband admitted to a substance abuse facility at the same time as she filed for divorce from the 41-year-old singer. She claims Stapp has been using drugs including amphetamines, cocaine and Ketamine and that he has threatened to kill himself and harm his family. The latest 911 recordings, released by TMZ, feature several calls made by Stapp from the side of a Florida highway in which he can be heard telling the dispatcher that ‘someone is trying to kill me’. In the first recording, the With Arms Wide Open singer complains that he has called 911 eight times and no one has showed up. The singer then explains that he has been on the run for six or seven weeks to try to keep ‘them’ away from his family. When asked who he is running from, Stapp simply says: ‘I don’t know’. The singer made the call on foot after abandoning his vehicle. When he reaches the first responders he repeatedly asks them to take him to the hospital because he has chest pains. Scroll down to listen to audio clips . Stapp, pictured in May 2010 with wife Jaclyn, son Jagger and daughter Milan. The singer has lost custody of his three children and his wife is currently divorcing him . He also says he wants a blood test so no one can accuse him of doing drugs. In a second recording Stapp, who fronted one of the most successful rock acts of the 1990s, tells the same dispatcher that 15 vehicles are following him and he's been on the run for 36 hours straight. He again asks to be taken to the hospital and complains of feeling dizzy, dehydrated and malnourished. The other audios clips include Stapp leaving a message last month for the dean of his son’s school last month. As previously reported, Stapp warns that ISIS are set to attack Florida which he knows because the terrorists are members of his family. In the fourth clip Stapp claims his wife Jaclyn has stolen his truck and he also says that she has threatened to  blackmail him. Clip 1 : Stapp calls 911 after abandoning his car . Clip 2: Part 2 of Stapp's call with 911 after abandoning his car . Clip 3: Stapp calls his son's school to warn of ISIS attack on Florida . Clip 4: Stapp calls 911 claiming that his wife has stolen his vehicle . Stapp's increasingly erratic behavior has lead a Florida judge has granted his estranged wife sole physical and legal custody of their three children: Jagger, 16, Milan, 7, and Daniel, 4. The judge also ruled that Stapp cannot return to the family home, and that the residence is solely for his estranged spouse and their children. In a separate 911 recording which emerged last week, Stapp's wife told a 911 dispatcher that he husband believes he is an undercover CIA agent charged with assassinating President Obama. The call was placed last month not long after the singer had been released from a 72-hour psychiatric hold in Florida. Stapp had taken off on a bicycle and disappeared - causing his panicked wife and sister-in-law to phone the police to try and get them to commit him again. 'He thinks he's part of the CIA,' Jaclyn Strapp told the dispatcher. 'He thinks they're trying to kill him, and he has a bunch of paperwork in his backpack that he's a CIA agent and he is supposed to assassinate Obama', said her sister. Troubled: Creed frontman Scott Stapp has reportedly threatened to kill President Obama and fled his home on a bike - worrying his wife Jaclyn (right) who phoned 911 . They implored the dispatcher to get an officer after Stapp, who was cycling shirtless around his Florida neighborhood, carrying a backpack of tools and 600 pages of CIA documents he printed from the internet. 'He's off the drugs, and he's going crazy,' said Jaclyn Strapp's sister to the 911 dispatcher. But, when police found him they decided he was in control of his faculties and declined to commit him. In November, Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video post. 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of god, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck,' the 41-year-old rocker admitted on camera. 'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted in November . 'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.' The Grammy winner - whose net worth was once $10M - sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday. 'All hell broke loose' around two months ago when the IRS audited Scott's record company and personal finances. 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless,' Stapp stated. 'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, ""Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months."" I don't understand how that's fair America.' Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook last Friday saying it was his 'last statement' The singer also claimed 'someone' used his passwords to transfer all the money out of his bank accounts. 'A lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me, or royalties not paid,' Scott continued. 'There are people that have taken advantage and stolen money from me and they're trying to spread vicious lies and discredit me.' And at the end of the month, Jaclyn Stapp had her estranged husband admitted to a substance abuse facility. The former Miss New York USA beauty queen claimed her husband has been using several drugs and threatened to kill himself and harm his family. Jaclyn said he left their home in early October. 'It is a very painful and personal matter for the family,' said Jason Brodie, Jaclyn Stapp's attorney. 'Jaclyn loves Scott very much. It is now apparent the seriousness of Scott's health. Jaclyn has taken all the necessary steps to help him,' Brodie said. 'She previously arranged for the appropriate treatment and will continue to try and help him. Her primary concern remains the best interest of their children. Jaclyn asks for privacy for her and her children during this difficult time,' the attorney added. The couple married eight years ago and have three children.","Stapp has repeatedly called 911 in recent weeks to claim that his family's safety is at risk .

"The ex-husband of a missing Tennessee teacher is now facing an attempted murder charge involving his new girlfriend. Tyler Mook, 34, is accused of trying to kill Robin Donech in October by pushing her off a boat in Florida and trying to drown her. His ex-wife, Shelley Mook, disappeared in February 2011 - her burnt out car was found the day she went missing near Murfreesboro, reports The Tennessean. Tyler Mook, 34, (left)  is accused trying to kill his girlfriend by pushing her off a boat and trying to drown her in Florida. His ex-wife, Shelley Mook, (right) disappeared in February 2011 . She was last at Tyler Mook's home where she had taken their six-year-old daughter. Tyler Mook now lives in Palm City, Florida, and had been dating Robin Donech for two years when he attacked her, according to witnesses in a police report. Mook and Donech were on a boat with his brother, Andrew Mook, and his brother's girlfriend, Nicole Gvajardo, when the incident occurred. Donech had asked him to slow down in a manatee zone, which saw him fly into a rage, and triggered the attack, according to the report. Tyler Mook tried to rip off the top of Donech's bathing suit and then threw her into the water where he tried to keep her submerged, according to the report. She managed to get free, but he immediately pushed her under again. Andrew Mook told investigators that when he saw Tyler attempt to hold Donech underwater, that he grabbed a water 'noodle' and jumped in after her. The burned car of the Shelbyville middle school teacher (pictured) was found the day she went missing near Murfreesboro . He placed his brother in a choke hold, forcing him to release Donech. Tyler Mook then swam back to the boat, where Gvajardo reported he told her: 'No one disrespects me in front of my family. I will kill her.' Andrew Mook stayed in the water with Donech until others in a passing boat picked her up and took her to safety. Donech, flagged down a police officer at Sandsprit Park on October 4 and stated her boyfriend tried to kill her. Donech told police she believed he was trying to drown her and would have succeeded if his brother had not intervened. Mook was originally arrested on domestic battery charges, but those charges are now upgraded to attempted first degree murder. The Mooks' daughter is in the custody of Shelley Mooks' mother, Debra Sikora. Sikora told a judge in a visitation hearing that Tyler Mook used the little girl to threaten her, reports WSMV. In regards to Tyler Mook's attempted first-degree murder charge, Sikora released this statement: . 'I want the hurt to stop for those that have and are still affected by the acts of one person. Strength be to those who will stand and have their voices heard. It is by those voices that justice will come. 'By those voices, healing can begin, closure can be sought and faith in others can be restored.' Tyler Mook is now in the Martin County jail on a $100,000 bond.","Tyler Mook, 34, is accused of attempted murder after allegedly attacking and trying to drown his girlfriend Robin Donech .

"Three years after 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds mysteriously vanished in the middle of the night, Maine police are still looking for her and have made no arrests in the case. The toddler was reported missing from her father's home in Waterville, Maine on December 17, 2011, sparking one of the state's largest ever searches. A body has never been found. Investigators do not believe she wandered off or that she was abducted in the middle of the night. Instead, they believe her father, his girlfriend and sister know more than they are saying. Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, his girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, and his sister, Elisha DiPietro were all in the house when the little girl vanished. Her blood was later found in the home. Questions: Ayla Reynolds was 20 months old when she vanished from her father's home in Waterville, Maine in December 2011. Three years on, no arrests have been made in the case . 'We've said for a long time now that we're looking for answers to the questions we've asked and we just don't feel like we've gotten those answers yet,' Maine State Police Sergeant Jeff Love told the Morning Sentinel. As the three-year anniversary of her disappearance approaches and police still have no answers, Love, the case's lead investigator, has vowed never to give up. Speaking to the Sentinel, he recalled how family members had claimed they had last seen the little girl in bed the previous night. She had been dressed in pajamas and had her arm in a cast. With temperatures dropping, the call launched massive searches on the ground and in the air by local departments, state police, the FBI and residents, but she was nowhere to be found. After 10 days, the case became a criminal investigation. In February 2012, police confirmed had found traces of the girl's blood in multiple places inside the house, and cars belonging to DiPietro and his girlfriend were seized by police. Scene: She was at home (pictured) with her father, his girlfriend and his sister on the night she went missing but the lead investigator said they have not yet answered all of his questions . Clues? Police confirmed in February 2012 that they had found the girl's blood inside the house . Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, previously claimed that police told her they found blood droplets on DiPietro's sneakers, on his mattress and sheets, on Ayla's slippers and across the face of her doll. She also alleged that police showed her pictures of blood splashes on the floor and walls. Reynolds has called on police to press charges against the three adults, but authorities say while they believe a crime was committed, they do not have enough evidence to bring charges. DiPietro, who had custody of the girl, has previously said that he believes someone abducted his daughter after she was put to bed. He has not commented on who he thinks is responsible but has maintained his innocence. In a separate case in July 2013, DiPietro was charged with assaulting an ex-girlfriend in Portland. Accusations: The girl's mother, Trista Reynolds (right), has said she believes her ex, Justin DiPietro (left), and the two others inside the house should be charged. DiPietro was later arrested in a separate assault case . Rally: Reynolds is pictured rallying for answers in her daughter's case on what would have been the girl's second birthday in April 2012. Police said they still do not have enough evidence to bring charges . Prosecutors dropped the assault charges, saying the ex was uncooperative, but he was sentenced to four days in jail for violating conditions of his release following the charges. The violation stemmed from him having alcohol in his car despite his bail conditions stating that he was not to possess any. Authorities told the Morning Sentinel that it's possible charges could be brought in Ayla's case in the future if there is enough evidence - and authorities are not giving up. 'Our work will not stop until we find Ayla,' Love said. 'I can't imagine what the family has gone through, and that's part of that determination, day in and day out, to do everything we can to try and bring closure to the family.'","Ayla Reynolds was reported missing from her father's home in Waterville, Maine on December 17, 2011, sparking a massive search .
