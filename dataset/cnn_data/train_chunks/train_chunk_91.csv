"(CNN) -- Celebrated and enigmatic American modern artist Cy Twombly died in Rome Tuesday. He was 83. The Gagosian Gallery, which represented Twombly and his works in the U.S. and abroad, announced his death. The cause of death was not immediately known. ""We will not soon see a talent of such amazing scope and intensity,"" said Larry Gagosian, art dealer and owner of the Gagosian Gallery. ""The art world has lost a true genius and a completely original talent."" Twombly's family also issued a brief statement saying they were saddened by the artist's passing. ""The world has lost a brilliant artist and our family has lost a legendary figure ... I had spoken to him just recently; he was a dear cousin and friend,"" said Twombly's first cousin, Marcia Twombly Gray. Throughout his career, Twombly was lauded for blurring the lines between drawing and painting, and challenging the ideals of modern art with his scribbles. But beneath the child-like appearance of his artwork, art enthusiasts say Twombly revealed a unique and ingrained appreciation for ancient poetry and culture. His works often alluded to battles described in both Greek and Roman poetry. The paintings that comprise the ""Leaving Paphos Ringed With Waves"" (2009) collection and the ""Coronation of Sesostris"" (2000) collection were inspired by quotes from 7th century B.C. Greek poet Alkman. Born April 25, 1928, Twombly as an adult divided his time between his time between his hometown in Lexington, Virginia, and Rome. After studying art in the United States at various institutes, Twombly moved in 1957 to Italy, where he began to extensively develop his career. Though he is best known for his large-scale paintings, Twombly also sculpted, using objects he found and later making casts in bronze. In 2010, Twombly unveiled a 3,750 square-foot ceiling painting for the Salle des Bronzes in the Louvre. He is the third contemporary artist to be invited to install a permanent work in the museum, according to the museum's website. The Menil Collection in Houston also has a permanent installment featuring Twombly's works that opened in 1995. The Cy Twombly Gallery is organized chronologically to walk visitors through the evolution of the artist's style. It has suites that feature a number of paintings and sculptures, according to the Menil site. The gallery is unique in the world and until recently, it was the only museum building featuring a permanent installment of Twombly's work, said Vance Muse, communications director for the Menil. The building's design was based on a sketch by Twombly and built by architect Renzo Piano, the site said. Twombly is often listed alongside other celebrated American artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, but Muse said Twombly stands out because of the way he melded epic poetry with art. ""He was a voracious reader and he put a lot of writing into his paintings .. there are influences from Homer and epic poetry in his works that ground them in literary tradition,"" Muse said. ""He really persevered in his own work and was so independent ... it's amazing how true to his vision he kept and in the end he was widely, widely respected,"" he said. Art enthusiasts took to twitter Tuesday to comment on Twombly's death. Actor Steve Martin, who is a noted art collector, tweeted, ""One of the great 20th century artists has died, Cy Twombly. A real master.""","American modern artist Cy Twombly was best known for his bold, abstract works .

"(CNN) -- The four Georgia teens accused in the beating death of a fifth teen at a house party appeared in court on murder charges Monday morning. Horace Damon Coleman, 19, Emanuel Benjamin Boykins, 18, Quantez Devonta Mallory, 18, and Tracen Franklin, 19, face one felony murder count each, according to Lt. Bruce Ferguson with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. They are accused of killing Bobby Maurice Tillman, 18, at a house party in metro Atlanta early Sunday. Officials said the party got out of control. A judge at their initial hearing ordered no bail for the suspects until they can speak with an attorney. All but Franklin asked for court-appointed counsel. His mother told the judge she had already hired an attorney for her son. Before the attack, one of the teens reportedly told his friends he was going to hit the next person he saw, Ferguson said. Sheriff Phil Miller told CNN affiliate WSB the assault on Tillman was unprovoked. He was a ""little guy, 18 years old, 5-foot-6, weighed 125 pounds,"" Miller said about the victim. ""And they beat him up and stomped him and killed him,"" he added. Police arrived on scene early Sunday. They were called by the mother of the girl who had hosted the party, Ferguson said. Police took 57 witnesses in for questioning. Ed Stephens, who lives near where the party took place, watched the brutal attack from his bedroom window, WSB reported. ""I just thought he was hurt. I never thought that his life was ending,"" Stephens said. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","They are accused of killing an 18-year-old at a house party in Atlanta early Sunday .

"(Sunset) -- Whether you're into lazy-day floating or rip-roaring rapids, there's a river out there for you. Compare these two trips to get a better idea of your taste. The MILD trip: The Rogue River, Oregon . Day 1 . The launch: At the tiny, woods-ensconced Galice Resort, the damp air smells like a sharpened pencil. It makes me think of Cabernet Franc. For some people, that first whiff of the uncorrupted outdoors might trigger a set of survival instincts. But I have none of those. What I have are ephemeral associations with lesser-known Bordeaux wine varietals. And so here I am, on a Wine on the River tour with a winemaker, a pair of chefs, a nimble river crew and a handful of fellow fortunate souls. We get the necessary primer before putting in: Drink lots of water, they tell us. Always, but especially on this trip, what with the three cases of wine being loaded onto the rafts. ""Lunchtime"": That's the answer I get when I inquire about the time. Days here are measured in meals. We've lounged away the morning on a people-free, rapids-free stretch of river in a thickly forested gorge, under a cover of damp fog -- like drifiting through a rain cloud. Even with limited visibility, we've seen a great blue heron, a kingfisher, Canada geese, an osprey, a quick glimpse of an otter and a bald eagle. The river is calm, and we don't have to paddle if we don't want to. Yet, somehow, a stretch and a bite to eat are in order. The chefs have managed to pack all our food, gear and elegantly rustic table settings on the rafts, leaving the rest of us to kick back while they set up and break down each feast. Sunset.com: Mild and wild defined, plus more rafting trips . Wine-thirty: After several miles of floating, we pull off at the Tyee Campground, a woodsy gravel bar. For the first time in my life, I must assemble a tent alone. But the payoff is grand: I sit down to cumin-grilled Tawanda Farms lamb chops with apricot-jalapeno chutney, assorted Oregon cheeses, fruit, eggplant puree, green olive tapenade, cucumber salad and red pepper relish with wontons and flatbread; followed by pan-seared king salmon with Oregon wasabi-thyme aioli, lemongrass cous-cous and ginger-citrus slaw; and finally topped off with Dagoba chocolate s'mores with homemade marshmallows -- each course paired with wine. It'll go on like this for two more nights. I will persevere. Sunset.com: The West's best dude ranches . Day 2 . Splashing around: I try out one of the inflatable kayaks we've been towing. Nobody, including me, seems to care that I can barely steer. It could just be hypothermia from playing in the 58º water, but I'm feeling close to the river. Group bonding: This evening's icebreaker involves a spree of mutual toenail painting. Oh, and wine. Lots of wine. Personalities have emerged. Maybe it's the Sewell Rhône Blend talking, but I like these people. After dark, the stars go so many layers deep that a few of us decide to sleep directly under them, and our tents become mere storage units. Day 3 . Campsite gourmet: At the grassy, rolling hillside of the Tacoma Campground, we dine under an old oak tree: smoked steelhead with cream cheese, capers and onions; roasted beets with sheep's-milk feta; greens with candied hazelnuts; grilled American Kobe-style flatiron steak with caramelized onions and housemade Worcestershire. The brussels sprouts sauteed with andouille win multiple approvals, including several from people who thought they didn't like brussels sprouts. Day 4 . The last toast: One last bracing swim and one final meal, when we compare favorite flavors: the Cinsault Rosé, the Malbec, the Fiano, which worked so well with that asparagus; the crawfish cakes with remoulade, the seared duck breast, the lemon sponge cake with huckleberry compote, the everything else. It's safe to say that the uncorrupted outdoors has heightened my sense of deliciousness. Sunset.com:The West's best food towns . The WILD trip: Chilko River, British Columbia . Day 1 . Entry: My first glimpse of the Chilko is from 15,000 feet up in a tiny 10-seater plane, looking down the longest raftable stretch of continuous Class IV whitewater on the continent. Did I mention this is my first-ever rafting trip? Beer talk: Our guide Mark has a shaggy river-rat beard and a Canadian lilt, and he's as skinny and spritelike as he is ruggedly reassuring. He instructs the eight of us -- a motley crew of three businessmen, a doctor, a lawyer, and a ranching couple -- on what to do if we run into a bear, how to tell a grizzly from a black, and how to prevent Mace mishaps. We're introduced to the Groover (a portable toilet). Sunset.com: Top wow spots of the Hawaii volcanoes . Day 2 . Calm water: After a paddling 101, our three rafts head out through the riffled water that the guides -- Mark, Brian and Jorge -- refer to as ""calm."" Which makes me and Ginny, the other whitewater rookie, mighty nervous about the hardcore rapids to come. We ride 22 miles, dipping our water bottles into the 50º glacier water on the way. The landscape looks surprisingly like New Mexico, with pine-covered mountains and mesas -- plus moose! We spot a chocolate-hued mother with calf and two bald eagles. Day 3 . Rapids!: Here they come. Deep breaths. We don our helmets, wetsuits and life jackets, and practice paddle maneuvers. Back paddle. Hard forward! We vanish into the rapids, as the raft bends and catapults and the waves pound through us on the famous great White Mile: 12 miles of rapids in 55 minutes -- yes, that longest stretch of continuous Class IV on the continent. Mark slides our 18-foot-2-inch raft through an 18-foot-4-inch gorge. We officially become whitewater junkies. At camp: Tents are pitched while the guides set up and find a scenic spot for the Groover. Dinner is grilled chicken, fresh veggies with ginger butter, tiramisu, and five bottles of well-deserved wine. Sunset.com: Best national parks -- avoid the crowds . Day 4 . An ""easy"" day: Our raft gets hung up on a protuding log inside a rapid. Ever been inside a washing machine? On the ""very cold"" cycle? Jorge deftly extricates us, and we lay out clothes to dry on the rocks. We've entered hoodoo country. Day 5 . Class III cakewalk: Class III? No sweat. We talk politics as we run them. Camp goes up at Big Creek, with 200-year-old pines and grassy meadows. Mark reads stories about spectacular Groover mishaps (picture it overturning while you're in the way). Sunset.com: The top 26 wilderness experiences . Day 6 . The gaping jaws of death: Hang on! Hard forward!! Time for the 8-foot waves of the daunting Farewell Canyon, and I'm paddling too intently to see past the waves. We just clear the foam when Brian yells, ""Bear!"" and a young black bear runs up the cliff. After lunch, we take the two final, gargantuan rapids called Gaping Jaws of Death and Brains Smashed In. I'm drenched. We high-five with our paddles, and pull up to the raft carrying the beer cooler for a toast. Later, there'll be Champagne and reminiscing on a sandy beach under a red sky at our last campsite. And more Groover stories. To read more rafting adventures, visit Sunset.com.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova powered her way to a first Wimbledon final in seven years after she brushed aside Sabine Lisicki to set up a meeting with Petra Kvitova. The Russian claimed her first ever Grand Slam title as a 17-year-old back in 2004 and recovered from an early wobble against German wildcard Lisicki to triumph 6-4 6-3. Standing in between Sharapova and the fourth major championship of her career will be Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, after she beat Belarusian fourth seed Victoria Azarenka 6-1 3-6 6-2. Sharapova told reporters after her match: ""It's amazing to be back in the final at Wimbledon, it's been a while. ""I'm really happy even though I didn't play my best tennis today. To be in the final is a great achievement for me but I still feel like I've got more to do."" The final looked a long way off when the fifth seed slumped to 3-0 down in the opening set, after a series of untimely double faults handed Lisicki the advantage. But when the German squandered a chance to go into a 4-0 lead Sharapova burst into life and took six of the next seven games to secure the first set. She then raced into a 5-1 lead in the second before Lisicki secured a break of service to give her a lifeline, but it was quickly snuffed out as the Russian broke back immediately to secure her place in Saturday's showpiece final. Kvitova, who lost in the semifinal stage last year to Serena Williams, is the first left-handed player to reach the final since compatriot Martina Navratilova in 1990, and the 18-time major champion was watching on from the royal box. The eighth seed took a mere 27 minutes to secure the opening set, breaking her opponent's serve twice and registering six aces on her way to a 6-1 success. But Azarenka -- the highest seed left in the final four -- recovered her composure and roared back into contention in the second set, securing two breaks to take it 6-3. That setback only inspired Kvitova to greater heights as she grabbed the initiative with a 3-1 lead in the decider and watched as Azarenka served a double fault to hand her victory. She told reporters: ""I saw Martina (Navratilova) in the locker room and she wished me good luck. I'm so happy but I don't really believe I am in the final. This is the best day of my life."" ""I started really well, all match it was about serve so I was happy mine went well in the third set. In the beginning it was close but after I broke her, I played well and she was a little bit down I think. ""She played very well in the second set and it was tough after that but I tried to play it as if it was a normal game and not the Wimbledon semifinal."" Azarenka acknowledged she was beaten by the better player and said Kvitova is well capable of securing an upset against the favorite Sharapova. ""I probably could have played better but when I had chances she really came up with the good stuff,"" she said. ""I think she can beat anybody any day, because right now she has a really good game. She's really going for it. If she's going to play like this, like she played today, I'm sure she has all the chances to win the next match.""","Maria Sharapova will play Petra Kvitova in the ladies final at Wimbledon .

"(RealSimple.com) -- Why shoes are called ""pumps"" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love. So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure . Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry . What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as ""double cuffs."" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed ""drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- The state and defense rested their cases in the penalty phase of convicted polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs' trial Monday. The defense did not call any witnesses and it was not immediately clear when closing statements and deliberations would begin. Jurors weighing punishment for Jeffs heard audio recordings earlier in the day that prosecutors say show he had sex with underage girls and encouraged group sex. At times difficult to hear, one of the tapes recorded sounds of two people apparently engaging in intercourse. Other recordings captured Jeffs instructing what prosecutors say were underage girls in how to please him. Girls could be heard giggling in the background. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Jeffs knew he was wanted by federal authorities and was aware that if people outside his community knew about his behavior, they would be extremely upset. FBI Special Agent John Broadway testified that Jeffs ordered the destruction of various discs and transcripts three days after an arrest warrant was issued for him on June 10, 2005. The polygamist sect leader established ""houses of hiding,"" allegedly with young girls for him to marry, Broadway said. The FBI agent also read from a priesthood record, in which Jeffs allegedly wrote: ""Things are happening so quickly. There is an even younger girl that the Lord wants me to take. She is 13. For some reason the Lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with."" Jeffs also wrote: ""If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,"" according to evidence presented in court. Jeffs was convicted last week on two counts of sexual assault on a child. Jeffs' nephew and niece had testified Saturday about the alleged abuse they suffered at his hands. Brent Jeffs, 28, told jurors that his uncle raped him when he was 5 years old. ""He began to tell me that we were going to do God's will,"" he said Jeffs told him. ""This is between me, you and God."" Three jurors wiped tears from their eyes as Brent Jeffs spoke, his voice breaking with emotion. Several also cried during the niece's testimony, in which she described an incident that allegedly occurred between her and Jeffs when she was 8 years old. ""He made me sit on his lap,"" she testified, and did ""inappropriate things to me."" She was crying so hard at one point that the prosecutor stopped questioning. Neither side pressed her for details. CNN is withholding the niece's name because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault. Brent Jeffs has published a book about his life and has previously been public about the allegations against his uncle. Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his ""spiritual wives."" He could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he could face a sentence of two to 20 years. The charges were filed after a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas. During the first day of the sentencing hearing Friday, Jeffs said he objected to the introduction of items seized in the raid and documents that should get ""religious protection."" He requested to be excused from the sentencing phase to avoid hearing his religion degraded. ""I am God. Cease. Do not present my holy ways as a thing of naught,"" the self-proclaimed prophet said before he left court Friday. ""Hear my warning as a full awakening.  Let my holy way be of freedom."" Deric Walpole, one of the defense attorneys Jeffs had fired earlier in trial, is representing him during the penalty phase. Jeffs represented himself during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. He was silent during most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday, mumbling at one point, ""I am at peace."" Monday was not the first time jurors heard audio recordings. Texas prosecutors rested their case last week after playing a key piece of evidence: A 20-minute audiotape that began and ended with a man saying a prayer. Prosecutors alleged that the recording was of Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives."" The girl had grown up at Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, authorities said. Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs, and a marriage certificate that listed the girl's age as 12 at the time. Jurors also heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor. Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' ""spiritual wife"" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine. In Session's Beth Karas and Grace Wong contributed to this report.","NEW: The state and defense rest their cases in the penalty phase of Jeffs' trial .

"(CNN) -- David Haye claims that Wladimir Klitschko will ""freeze like an iceberg"" when the heavyweight boxing champions finally meet in Hamburg on July 2, after the date and venue was confirmed on Wednesday. The British fighter will put his WBA belt on the line against the Ukrainian's IBF/WBO and IBO crowns in a long-awaited unification fight at the 57,000-capacity Imtech Arena. The German city is the adopted home of the 35-year-old Klitschko and his elder brother Vitali, who Haye also hopes to fight before his planned retirement in October. ""It's great to finally find out the date and venue,"" Haye said on his website. ""I've been training for this fight since the end of 2010 and it's nice to now have a concrete date to work towards. ""Hamburg is an accessible city for a lot of British fans, so I'm expecting a huge turnout for what is undoubtedly the biggest boxing event of the year. We're going to have an army of Brits invading Germany on July 2nd and I can't wait to sample the atmosphere."" Haye mocks 'fat' Solis after farcical Klitschko defeat . The Klitschko camp confirmed that the details had been finalized with a statement on their Facebook page: ""Let's get ready to rumble!!! The highly anticipated fight is on."" The showdown between two of boxing's biggest names has been on the cards since Haye stepped up from the cruiserweight division where he was also a champion, but he pulled out of a planned fight with Wladimir in 2009 due to a back injury. Both camps have engaged in a war of words since, with tensions heightened when Wladimir agreed to fight Haye's lower-ranked compatriot Dereck Chisora in December.

""I've got no doubt Wladimir will freeze like an iceberg when I hit him on the chin in Hamburg.

"(CNN) -- Shannen Doherty is perhaps best known for portraying Brenda Walsh on ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" as well as her former reputation as a Hollywood bad girl. The actress, 39, has written her first book, ""Badass: A Hard-Earned Guide to Living Life with Style and (the Right) Attitude."" ""Badass"" is a self-help tome of sorts with tips on style and a memoir weaved in, but certainly not the tell-all kind. Doherty owns up to her past mistakes and admits that her ""bad girl"" reputation was deserved, but she also insists she's evolved into a badass -- a woman of integrity who is strong, confident, self-aware and compassionate. Doherty spoke to CNN about the book, the importance of maintaining one's own integrity and, of course, ""90210."" CNN: In the book, you talk about how a lot of women act like victims. In what ways do women act like victims when they may not even realize it? Shannen Doherty: Constantly complaining about it being a man's world is a really good example. If you want to complain about it being a man's world, then don't rely on a man to take care of you. If you're a full-time mom, then that is your job. And that's a big, big, big job. It's difficult, and kudos to those who do it because all I can say is 'Wow!' I have a lot of friends who are full-time moms, and they all work a hell of a lot harder than I do. But it's the women who are supposedly working out there who complain that it is a man's world. They get married for a couple of years, then they get divorced, and all of a sudden they're suing their husbands for a ton of money. Its like, are you kidding? Support yourself. Women talk about being victims for all sorts of reasons, and we're only victims of ourselves. Stop being overbearing. That was a lesson I had to learn. I thought that being a woman and being young, in order to be heard I had to be very strong and overbearing and loud and get my point across, and if somebody didn't agree with me, it just meant I had to get harder with it. Now I do the opposite. I erase the fact that I'm a woman, and I'm not a victim anymore because I'm happy being a woman, and I think it's actually going to get me further. If I can turn on some Southern charm [Doherty is a Tennessee native] in corporate America -- where, granted, there are a lot of men -- that's fantastic! I'm going to stand out from the 50 other men that work in the office because I'm different. CNN: In light of all the news stories about bullying out there, do you have any advice for maintaining our integrity in the face of bullies and so-called mean girls, be it in the schoolyard, workplace or social situations? Shannen Doherty: Mean girls usually grow up being not so great. ... What they're doing has nothing to do with you, and it has everything to do with them. They're insecure. Maybe they're insecure because you're breaking new ground, because you're taking risks in your life and you don't care what people say, or at least that's what comes across. It frightens that person, and sometimes, when people are frightened, they react in angry, hostile ways. In order to keep your integrity, you must stay true to yourself and not let bullies get you down. CNN: You're a big proponent of deciding what you stand for and sticking with it. Is that harder than it sounds? Doherty: Not at all. You should know what you believe in and what your convictions are. It's why I was in training for so long. I was never really wishy-washy, but I'm very firm in who I am now and firm with being able to be flexible, but my beliefs are my beliefs and there's definitely nothing wishy-washy about it. CNN: You say that being an authentic badass means being a work in progress. How are you a work in progress? Doherty: I'm still a work in progress because I'm still making mistakes. Badasses will always make mistakes. It's just not repeating those mistakes, and hopefully they're not as horrifying and shameful as some of the earlier mistakes of my youth. To be a true badass, you're going to make mistakes because you're constantly evolving, constantly growing and constantly learning new things.

Jennie [Garth, who played Kelly Taylor,] and I worked together on the new ""90210,"" and we really connected as women now that we're older. We've both grown up, and we realized that we like each other. We found a great new relationship within each other.

Doherty: Playing Laverne [season one, episode 15, ""Fame is Where You Find it""] was so much fun with that heavy, heavy accent that I used -- and the singing! That was pretty exciting. The breast cancer scare [season one, episode 157, ""It's Only a Test""] was really meaningful. I loved doing heavy drama, and I still do. It's my forte, and I love it. CNN: Is there anything else you'd like to say about ""Badass"" that we haven't covered? Doherty: I think it's important to get across that the book has a lot of poignant, honest moments.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League Arsenal signed teenage winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Monday as they bid to strengthen their squad ahead of the new campaign which starts at the weekend. Arsenal have been relatively quiet in the transfer window but it has taken a reported £15 million ($24.5 million) to land the signature of a 17-year-old rated one of the most promising prospects in English football. ""We are delighted that Alex has decided to join us,"" Wenger told Arsenal's official website. ""He is an exciting young player who will provide us with creativity and offensive quality. ""He can play as an attacking center midfielder, or wide left and right, "" added the Frenchman. According to Southampton's web site, the deal easily breaks their previous club transfer record for a player who was contracted to them until 2013. Oxlade-Chamberlain, the son of former England international winger Mark Chamberlain, made 34 appearances for Southampton last season, scoring nine goals and helping them to promotion from the third flight of English football. His form attracted the apparent interest of a number of top clubs, including Liverpool and Manchester United, but he opted for the Emirates Stadium. ""Arsenal have a great manager in Arsene Wenger, top-quality players and an attractive style of play,"" said Oxlade-Chamberlain. ""These were all important factors in me choosing to sign for Arsenal."" His move mirrors that of England international Theo Walcott, who also joined Arsenal from Southampton as a teenager and has gone on to become a first team regular. But one player set to leave Arsenal is Danish international striker Nicklas Bendtner, who has been troubled by injury for the past year. Bendtner told gathered reporters his intentions as he trained with the Denmark squad ahead of Wednesday's friendly international against Scotland at Hampden Park. ""I have done my part as well as I can and it's up to Arsenal now to sort it out, I can't do anything more. ""I would like to play at a place where you are happy and play every week, that is the most important thing for any football player and hopefully that will happen soon."" Bendtner has been linked with a move to fellow EPL side Stoke City. But Wenger is expected to move to add to his defensive cover by the end of the dealing period, with Bolton's Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka of Everton and Blackburn's Christopher Samba all linked with the north London giants. Meanwhile, England international goalkeeper Joe Hart has signed a new five-year contract at Manchester City, tying him contractually at Eastlands until 2016. Hart's Argentina international teammate Carlos Tevez trained with the squad Monday for the first time after being given extended leave following the Copa America. Tevez said earlier this summer he wanted to leave Roberto Mancini's team but a move to Brazilian club Corinthians fell through.","Arsenal sign teenage winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Southampton .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Thousands of people filled Hong Kong's Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. The candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the Chinese government to quash would-be demonstrators from holding anti-government protests. About 26 people were arrested between February and March, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights group, when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti-government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East. In response to the campaign, authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares, especially in Wangfujing, a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests. The government also tightened rules on foreign reporters, explicitly warning them that they risk detention, suspension of press cards and expulsion if they show up at planned demonstrations. 20 years on: Tiananmen remembered . Saturday's protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-democracy group. Hong Kong police called it a ""peaceful gathering."" Images of the demonstration showed a sea of flickering candles covering the length of the park. A little more than 22 years ago, students gathered in Tiananmen Square to memorialize the recently deceased Hu Yaobang. He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xiaoping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward ""bourgeois-liberal ideas"" and tolerating student protests. The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement, and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause. On June 4, 1989, Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square. The soldiers, on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators, had forced their way through the city's main thoroughfare. Along the way, they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets, so they fired at them. When the firing stopped, hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead. Relatives of victims renew their hopes every year that Beijing's leaders will reverse the verdict that the protests were a counter-revolutionary rebellion that had to be put down. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Protesters converge on Hong Kong's Victoria Park for a candlelight vigil .

"Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN) -- The cheers were deafening in Pyeongchang, South Korea, early Thursday when the city was named to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Thousands of South Koreans gathered at the foot of a ski jump well past midnight in a passionate display of excitement that included fireworks, singing, dancing, picnicking and kimchi -- the traditional Korean side dish. ""This is the victory of the South Korean people,"" said President Lee Myung Bak in Durban, South Africa,Wednesday, where the decision was announced. ""I thank you all,"" he added. Pyeongchang beat out two other bid cities: Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France. Their slogan for the Winter Olympics is ""New Horizons."" Pyeongchang narrowly failed in its bids for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Games, losing by three votes to Vancouver, Canada, for last year's event and by four votes to Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 games. The sheer number of locals who came to watch the pre-announcement show at the ski jump showed their confidence in this year's decision. ""I cannot even tell you how happy I am,"" said one resident. ""Everyone came together and prayed that we would win."" South Korea has never hosted the Winter Games, though the capital city of Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. Winter games gold for Korean economy . France has hosted three editions of the Winter Olympics, most recently in 1992 in Albertville. Annecy met with many difficulties in its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, including a small budget and change in leadership on the bid committee. Had it won, Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The city attracted the Summer Games in 1972. Representatives from the three cities made their cases to committee members in Durban, South Africa Wednesday.","NEW: Pyeongchang, South Korea is chosen for the 2018 Winter Olympics .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese man who admitted to raping and strangling a British teacher has been found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Tatsuya Ichihashi was convicted Thursday of rape, murder and discarding a body after a month-long trial that riveted Japan in much the same way the Casey Anthony trial did the United States. The victim Lindsay Hawker's battered, naked body was found in a bathtub in Ichihashi's apartment in March 2007 -- buried in sand. Ichihashi then went on the run, altering his face through cosmetic surgery several times to elude arrest. After he was arrested two and half years later, Ichihashi acknowledged killing Hawker. But the question at the center of the trial was whether he intended to. Hawker's parents who were in Chiba District Court, east of Tokyo, for the verdict had asked prosecutors to hand down the harshest sentence: death. The case began in March 2007 when surveillance video showed Ichihashi meeting up with Hawker at a coffee shop in the town of Ichikawa in Chiba Prefecture for an English lesson. Later, he told Hawker to follow him to his apartment so he could pay her, prosecutors said. After the killing when police arrived to interview Ichihashi, he fled. He snipped his own lips with a pair of scissors, cut off two moles and -- as he flitted from one construction job to another across the country -- he would drop in at clinics to undergo more cosmetic surgery, prosecutors said. Authorities offered a 10 million yen reward ($127,000) reward for information leading to Ichihashi's capture. They finally caught up with him at a ferry terminal in the western Japanese city of Osaka in November 2009. Ichihashi went on trial in July, amid wall-to-wall coverage in local media. Just as in the case of Casey Anthony -- the Florida mother who was accused and later acquitted of killing her 2-year-old daugther -- television stations offered play-by-play accounts of every development. Before the verdict was read Thursday, hundreds of people lined up outside court to take part in a lottery that would allow 57 of them seats inside.","Ichihashi has admitted to raping and strangling Hawker .

"(EW.com) -- For a comedy like ""The Change-Up"" -- which is to say, a comedy with a message about as deep as a bowl of beer nuts -- familiarity with Shakespeare's disguise plays and Aesop's Fables isn't a prerequisite for getting the picture. On the other hand, familiarity with both body-switch comedies and Judd Apatow laffers is indispensable for understanding just where this raunchy Apatow imitation with a heart of Lipitor goes wrong. The anatomy swappers here are Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), a swingin', irresponsible single guy, and Dave (Jason Bateman), a driven lawyer/husband/dad. The switcheroo goes down because the two buddies-since-childhood do something stupid during a Guys' Night Out in their hometown of Atlanta: They pee in a fountain. Specifically, they pee in a fountain presided over by a stony statue of the Greek goddess Metis while drunkenly declaring to each other, ''I wish I had your life!'' (For the record, Metis is the goddess of counsel, advice, planning, and cunning.) Dave thinks he envies Mitch's life of free sex and fiscal irresponsibility. Mitch, a wannabe actor, thinks he envies Dave's successful career, his loving home life, and his cute wife (Leslie Mann). Crash, lightning, temporary power outage, ""Freaky Friday!"" The deal is done. The next day each guy wakes up in the body of the other. Discovery of genital distinctions follows. Here's ""The Change-Up's"" first mistake: As set up by director David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"") and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore(""The Hangover""), the game is rigged. Dave may be burned-out, so much so that he has stopped appreciating his squeaky Leslie Mann of a wife. He may even feel a pang or two of extramarital lust at the sight of his beautiful law associate Sabrina -- as played by Olivia Wilde, who wouldn't? But no one would envy Mitch's directionless, idiotic Peter Pan life -- even if Peter entertains the ladies in a playpen of an apartment. The early Mitch is so excessively unsocialized and unlikable (I blame the script and direction rather than Reynolds' game performance) that there's no contest: Dave may need a little kick in the khakis to realize that he's got it pretty good at home, but he's clearly the movie's winner. In fact, early Mitch is so obnoxious that in the end, when the two friends regain their own bodies, having learned lessons in gratitude (oops, did I give something away?), Dave is more or less Dave again. But Mitch 2.0 bears little resemblance to early Mitch. He's still Ryan Reynolds-y, but he's now someone a lot more like Dave -- reformed by the traditional values ""The Change-Up"" endorses -- than like a guy who previously kept a weekly sex date with a lady he described as a tigress. I won't give away more about the tigress in question; let's just say she bounces and veers from ""Hangover"" turf into Farrelly brothers territory. And she also personifies ""The Change-Up's"" second mistake: The movie's scenes of id-fueled transgression are alternately desperate, trite, and an off-putting color of ugly -- as if the filmmakers were given the ingredients but not the cooking instructions for a successful crude-but-cuddly frittata. Gross-outs involving poop -- kids of all ages usually love 'em! -- are more humiliating than hilarious. (Really, the old toxic-baby-diaper gag?) Freakish-looking women are easy receptacles for disgust. And when jokes give way to the ''I love you, bro!'' finale, the tone oozes past charming happiness all the way to cloying self-satisfaction. Anyway! There's one consolation, and that's in watching the stars play opposite what is often their type of guy. Bateman, in particular, is enjoyably nimble and unbuttoned when he sheds his usual persona of responsible-and-exasperated guy and lets some devil out. Quick-witted and a pro at physical shifts, he finds more subtleties in his Dave Gone Wild than actually appear in his dialogue. And that resourcefulness rubs off on Reynolds, a pleasant if less complex performer. Acting here as if he were a vaguely disgruntled but resigned grown-up, Reynolds gets to escape the tonal confines of his boyish smile. Too bad ""The Change-Up"" has little use for such interestingness. Soon enough it's back to stale jokes about spousal date nights, the sight of moldy fast-food leftovers in a bachelor's refrigerator, and the timeless male joys of sharing a whiz in an outdoor fountain after a night of drinking and bulls---.

"(CNN) -- British rider Mark Cavendish won the fifth stage of this year's Tour de France after a mass sprint saw him narrowly beat Belgium's Philippe Gilbert and Spain's Jose Joaquin Rojas. Cavendish, 26, a sprint specialist who has now won 16 stages of the Tour de France since 2008, edged what had been an eventful, crash-filled race. Both Janez Brajkovic and defending champion Alberto Contador fell during the 164.5 kilometer stretch from Carhaix to Cap Frehel, the former being taken to hospital with head injuries. The Slovenian later retired from the race altogether. Norwegian Thor Hushovd retained the leader's yellow jersey after finishing tenth. ""I think what the organizers have done this year is to make it harder to have a proper bunch sprint. That's because we have been dominating in the last years,"" Cavendish, widely regarded as the best sprint cyclist in the sport, told the Tour de France's official website shortly after the race. ""The reason why we dominate the sprint at the Tour de France is, well, for me personally I have put every other race on the back foot to be good at the Tour de France."" This year will be the 98th edition of the race, the most famous in cycling and one of the world's best known sporting events. Cavendish, who was disqualified from an intermediate sprint in the third stage for illegally butting Hushovd -- who was also censured -- will find the next stage much harder: the sixth, 226.5 kilometer stage between Dinan and Lisieux is Le Tour's longest. ""That was a proper hard finish,"" Cavendish admitted. ""Those last couple of hundred meters my legs were going...I'm really happy with that.""","Mark Cavendish wins fifth stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- An Illinois woman died Monday after participating in New York City's Nautica Triathlon on Sunday, the second athlete to do so. Amy Martich died at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City -- a day after a man died after participating in the swim portion of the triathlon, according to hospital spokeswomen Elizabeth Dowling and Terry Cavanaugh. New York Police Department spokesman Lieutenant John Grimpel identified the deceased athletes as Martich, 40, and Mike Kudryk, 64. Bill Burke, director for the triathlon, told CNN he was ""deeply saddened"" by the participants' deaths. Martich, of Elmhurst, Illinois, was rescued halfway through the swim portion of the triathlon and transported to 79th Street's Dock A, where she was treated by on-site emergency medical staff, Burke said. Kudryk was two-thirds of the way through the swim portion of the triathlon when a CNN employee, also competing, noticed a man floating on his back with his head beneath the water. ""It didn't look like he was breathing, his lips were blue,"" remembered Jeff Kepnes, supervising producer for CNN Special Events. Shortly after, Kepnes says he struggled to help lift Kudryk's body onto a rescue sled along with another rescuer. ""We tried to maneuver him,"" Kepnes said. ""He was heavy, he wasn't moving. We were being weighed down."" This is the third triathlon for Kepnes, who said the water was the choppiest he's ever seen it on Sunday. ""I did notice that there were more people going into safety stroke. There were more conversations with rescue in the kayaks and Jet Skis,"" Kepnes said. Kudryk was driven to one of four New York City Fire Department boats stationed in the river, where he was treated by paramedics on board before being taken to the emergency medical station on Dock A, Burke said. Both Martich and Kudryk were transferred to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center just after 8 a.m. on Sunday, Burke said. Kudryk died shortly after arriving at the emergency room, Cavanaugh said. The Nautical New York City Triathlon is an Olympic distance race, consisting of a 1,500-meter swim, a 40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-kilometer run, according to the event's website. Burke said the swim portion of the triathlon, which took place in the Hudson River Sunday, was staffed with ""32 lifeguards, 53 kayakers patrolling the water, three launch boats, two Jet Skis with sleds"" and three NYPD boats equipped with divers and paramedics. Burke said he initially delayed the race by several minutes due to inclement weather. ""I was watching a line of thunderstorms come toward the course, I was waiting to see if it was going to materialize and if we would have a lightning problem,"" he said. In addition, Burke said an accident on the Hudson Parkway, which caused a downhill portion of the bike path to be slicked by oil and gasoline, pushed the race's starting time back by about 40 minutes. Burke said he got a phone call from NYPD that the bike path was cleared by 6:19 a.m., and the race began by 6:30 a.m. Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer sent a letter to Burke Monday requesting a ""top to bottom review of the safety protocol for the triathlon,"" he told CNN. ""New Yorkers signed up for a triathlon -- not a game of Russian Roulette,"" Stringer said in a press release Monday. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","Woman had been rescued halfway through swim portion of race .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British man who has just claimed the world land sailing speed record is now planning to better his speed -- on ice. Greenbird, driven by Briton Richard Jenkins has claimed the land sailing speed record . Using just wind power, Richard Jenkins drove his vehicle, the Greenbird, to 202 km/hour (126 miles/hour) in late March on the dry Lake Ivanpah near the border of California and Nevada in the western United States. Greenbird is a carbon fibre composite craft -- described by the makers on their Web site as ""part airplane, part sailboat and part Formula One car"" -- that uses solid sails to harness the power of the wind. It weighs 600 kg and is able to travel up to four or five times greater than the speed of the wind -- at which point the downward force of the wings increases the craft's weight to nearly a ton. The only metal in the structure is in the wing bearings and the wheel. Jenkins told CNN the record came after the team, which is sponsored by UK-based green electricity company Ecotricity, made gains in all aspects of the vehicle's design. ""It's a real mixture of everything -- all of the margins are so tight you have to make a little gain in every place."" The technologically advanced Greenbird works by using the flow of air over its vertical sail to push it forward. It transfers the side force of wind into downward energy to keep it from taking off -- a similar concept to that used in Formula One race cars. Greenbird's record speed defeated the previous record set by American Bob Schumacher in 1999. Schumacher, in what he described as a ""boat"" called the ""Iron Duck,"" managed 116 miles per hour. View a photo gallery of the successful speed record attempt » . Jenkins told CNN he had been working towards the record for about 10 years and was ecstatic to have managed the feat. ""We had been working on this for a long time. It started when I was at university...so it was great to finally achieve the record."" The 32-year-old said bad weather and attracting sponsorship had been the main challenges in preparing to set the record. ""You have to be very lucky for the weather to be right at the right time. For years I thought we were going to be unlucky."" With the land sailing record under his belt, Jenkins now plans to return to work on his Greenbird ice sailing craft -- which he feels has the potential to be even quicker than the Greenbird land racer. ""Theoretically it should be a lot faster, but currently ice yachts are not as quick as land yachts. We are not completely sure why."" Jenkins said his next ice sailing attempt would likely take place in December this year on Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana, where the ice is large and secure enough for the vehicle. It is also important to make attempts before snow falls on the ice, creating more drag, Jenkins added. Ice sailing is significantly more risky than land sailing, he told CNN. ""Depending on when you go, the ice can be a lot more unstable. There is the risk that you could go through a water-hole into the ice. We try not to think about it,"" Jenkins said.

"(CNN) -- Teenage sensation Matteo Manassero and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros joined world number two Luke Donald at the top of the leaderboard after the second day of the BMW PGA Championship. Donald, from England, was out in front after a sparkling 64 on the opening day but he struggled in calmer conditions on Friday, carding a one-over-par 72 to sit on six-under. Manassero, from Italy, followed his 66 on Thursday with a one-under round while Quiros fired a four-under round of 67 to make it a three-way tie at the top on a day when players, spectators and officials all wore blue in honor of the late Seve Ballesteros. Spaniard Jose Manuel Lara, Thomas Aiken, from South Africa, and England's David Horsey all sit two shots off the lead on four-under. Donald, who can claim golf's number one ranking from compatriot Lee Westwood with a win at Wentworth, told the European Tour's official web site that Manassero's maturity had made an impact on him . ""I'm impressed with him in general,"" he said. ""I think to have done as well as he has done at such a young age is very impressive. I suppose he has a somewhat similar game to me -- he doesn't overpower courses."" No-one on the course bettered Quiros' round of 67 and the Spaniard said his putting was a big factor in his impressive display. ""I've been playing very, very safe, so I think it's a good thing, having in consideration the bad weather and the greens, how hard are the greens, they are tough and quick. ""It's a good strategy, probably is giving me bonuses without hitting the ball great."" Manassero couldn't match the standards he set on Thursday, but said he had been inspired by the crowd of over 25,000 that helped to pay tribute to Ballesteros -- one of the sport's biggest characters. ""I'm happy about 70 today -- it wasn't easy,"" he said. ""The flags I think were trickier and it was a more difficult course. Even if it wasn't as windy as yesterday, it wasn't easy to score, and not many low scoring today. ""It was a very big crowd today. It was a great day, it's big fun. It happens just one time on the European Tour, and it's in Wentworth -- that's why I think it's so special.""

"(CNN) -- Williams will revert to using Renault engines in the 2012 and 2013 Formula One seasons, restoring a partnership that led to the most successful era in the team's history. The Britain-based outfit won four drivers' titles and five constructors' championships with cars powered by the French manufacturer between 1989 to 1997, triumphing in 63 races. Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve all finished on top at season's end. However, Williams has not won a grand prix since 2004 and languishes in ninth place in the teams' standings this season with four points from eight rounds. The new deal will end a two-year association with Cosworth. ""This reunites the F1 team with a leading car manufacturer and complements our new relationship with Jaguar,"" team principal Frank Williams told the Williams F1 website on Monday. Hamilton predicts 'best British GP ever' ""At the same time, we are grateful to Cosworth: they have been a fair and reliable partner both on and off the track for the past two years and we look forward to working with them across our business in the future. ""Our previous relationship with Renault was one of the most successful in Williams' history but we will not allow ourselves to dwell too much on the past. We must look to the future and continue to re-build our on-track reputation, which I am hopeful that today's announcement will help us to do."" The partnership will include other marketing and business liaisons, and is expected to continue when the new turbo-charged energy-efficient V6 engines are introduced to F1 from 2014. ""Together we produced racing cars that are recognized for their technical innovation, and it is still Renault's most successful period in F1 to date,"" Renault Sport F1 president Bernard Rey said. It means Renault will supply four of the sport's 12 teams from next year, along with world champions Red Bull, Team Lotus and the outfit it used to own, the renamed Lotus Renault.. ""It puts us ahead of other engine manufacturers in terms of market share, but off track it will also enable us to further use Formula One as a marketing platform for our parent company, Renault, to try to bring a bit of this association to our fans and our customers worldwide,"" Rey said. ""Williams has recently taken several important steps, both commercially and technically, to update its operations and we feel that this partnership is another important step in its rigorous plan."" Meanwhile, Marussia Virgin Racing announced a new deal with McLaren on Monday that is intended to boost the struggling team's performance. The Britain-based Russian outfit, which is yet to earn a point in 2011, will have access to McLaren's Applied Technologies arm -- including facilities such as the team's wind tunnel, driver simulators and race strategy tools. Chief executive Andy Webb said the team had also bought out the F1 business of its former technical partner WRT, which was owned by ex-director Nick Wirth. ""When we undertook our detailed review of the team in the first half of 2011, it was clear that our bold ambitions for the future would need to be matched with some equally bold steps towards achieving them,"" Webb told the Marussia Virgin website. ""I am delighted that in a relatively short space of time we are now in the fantastic position of being able to make these two very important announcements, which will enable us to make some dramatic strides forward with immediate effect. ""McLaren is one of the most prestigious and successful marques in Grand Prix racing history, with an enviable record of success over many years. We can benefit enormously from McLaren's far-reaching techniques and capabilities and I have no doubt that this partnership will see us take the technical steps necessary to make a significant leap forwards.""","Williams to restore successful partnership with French engine manufacturer .

"(CNN) -- Human remains discovered in the Utah desert belong to a young male and are not a missing 28-year-old mother, authorities said, a grim discovery that fuels the mystery and opens a new case. The fate of Susan Powell, who disappeared in 2009, is still unknown. The remains discovered in Tooele County over the weekend belonged to a young man, Sheriff's Detective Lt. Travis Scharmann said. Scharmann said the state medical examiner is working to determine the cause, time and other circumstances of his death. In addition to Powell, authorities must now determine what happened to the man whose remains were found in the same region on Sunday. They were ''badly decomposed and scattered throughout a wide area, possibly by wild animals,'' according to a news release from the sheriff's office. An attorney found the bones in the area where his family owns ranch property. Investigators will likely dig for more body parts, Bill Manion, a medical examiner for Burlington County, New Jersey, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Monday. ""The most important bones that they can find are the jaw and mandible, part of the skull, because if we have the teeth, we can be very, very accurate in identification,'' Manion said. Meanwhile, the search for the missing woman continues. Josh Powell says he last saw his wife on a cold December night in 2009 as he and his two young sons left to go camping in the Tooele County desert area. Powell's sister reported her as missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved to the state of Washington. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- The Muscular Dystrophy Association announced Wednesday that comedian Jerry Lewis is no longer serving as the organization's national chairman. Lewis, 85, and MDA had announced in May that he was retiring as host of the MDA Labor Day Telethon in September. But he said then in a statement that he was planning to continue to serve as the organization's national chairman. ""As a labor of love, I've hosted the annual telethon since 1966,"" Lewis said in the news release issued in May by the association. ""And I'll be making my final appearance on the show this year, by performing my signature song, 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'"" Jim Brown, vice president of public relations for the MDA, told CNN in a telephone interview that Lewis will not be replaced in his role as national chairman. He also said that Lewis will not host this year's telethon, which is scheduled for September 4. Instead, it will be hosted by Nigel Lythgoe, Nancy O'Dell, Allison Sweeney and Jan Carl, Brown said. No explanation was offered for the change of plans -- either about his position as national chairman or about the plan to replace him in next month's telethon. For 45 years, Jerry Lewis and the organization's annual Labor Day fundraiser have been synonymous, so much so that it became known as the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. Lewis hit it big at age 20 in 1946, teaming up with Dean Martin to become one of the most popular comedy partnerships in history. Together, they headlined thousands of sold-out performances, 16 hit movies and two dozen top-rated television shows. After the break-up of the Martin and Lewis team, Lewis made a successful solo career. In 1959, he signed a seven-year, $10 million contract with Paramount -- at the time, the largest contract ever between a studio and performer. His solo film career included classics such as ""The Nutty Professor,"" ""The Bellboy"" and ""The Geisha Boy."" Still, for several generations since, Lewis has been known as much as a philanthropist as a movie star. That's because of his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a nonprofit dedicated to curing that disease, ALS and related ailments as well as providing support, education and other services. Lewis joined the cause in the early 1950s, and he gave it star power in 1966 when he became the host of what would be the charity's first of many telethons over Labor Day weekends. In between occasional songs, comic bits and passionate pitches for people to donate, his biggest challenge was keeping the variety show lively and engaging for as long as 21.5 consecutive hours. Scores of television stations across the country picked up the program, while volunteers stood by to take calls from people pledging donations. The 2010 edition raised $58,919,838 after performances by the likes of acrobatic dancers from Cirque du Soleil, ""American Idol's"" David Archuleta, and a host of comedic performers. Still, throughout the acts, the one constant over 900 hours of programming has remained Lewis. This year's event will be shorter than many of years past at six hours.

"Washington (CNN) -- Calling the situation ""untenable,"" a senior State Department official gave details Thursday of a proposed ""humanitarian"" solution to the standoff over Iraq's Camp Ashraf, a settlement of Iranian dissidents who say they will be killed if they are returned to Iran. Under the U.S. plan, the approximately 3,400 residents of Ashraf would be temporarily relocated within Iraq, farther from the border with Iran, the official said. The camp houses followers and members of the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK). The United States considers it to be a terrorist organization. The MEK has opposed the Iranian government for decades, and the group was sheltered in that camp and other locations in Iraq during the era of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The group was used by Hussein as part of his security forces and has a tense relationship with many Iraqis, especially Shias and Kurds. The relocation would be temporary, the official said, with final settlement of the inhabitants in other countries. That would not include the United States, the official said, since U.S. law bars anyone associated with a terrorist organization from settling there. The new location would be ""chosen and maintained and operated"" by Iraq and appropriate humanitarian conditions would have to be maintained in this camp, the official said. ""We will work with the government of Iraq, Ashraf residents and international partners to guarantee the safety of Ashraf residents if they agree to this move,"" the official said, ""if all sides agree to this plan."" Iraq has ordered the camp be closed by the end of the year and wants the residents to leave the country. The residents are refusing to budge, and do not recognize Iraqi sovereignty over their camp. The U.S. plan has been presented to the Iraqi government, the official said, and it is ""reviewing its position."" ""We hope the Ashraf leaders will react positively to this plan, as we hope the government of Iraq will react positively to this plan, largely because we see no other solution for a group that has no status,"" the State Department official said. The United States has discussed its proposal with the international community, this official said. In April, 34 people were killed and more than 300 others were wounded in a confrontation between Iraqi security forces and people in Camp Ashraf. The exiles said Iraqi security forces invaded their camp, but security forces said their members were attacked by the group. The violence, the official said, highlights the vulnerability of the camp's residents, who lack any legal status in Iraq but have refused to request refugee status. ""Given the history of mutual provocation we are deeply concerned about the possibility of future violence,"" the official said. The U.S. would work to guarantee the safety of all sides, the official said, but this would not involve American troops. ""There's no easy solution to this matter,"" the official said. ""We believe this is the best way forward ... our bottom line is that both sides need to step back from violence and the violence that has characterized the relationship, and we want to avoid another tragedy at Ashraf."" Iraq under Saddam and Iran fought a bloody war in the 1980s. Since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, relations between Iran and Iraq have improved. A majority of Iraq's new government is composed of Shiite Muslims, the majority religion in Iraq, and official attitudes toward the MEK changed. The camp has been the subject of debate in Iraq since American forces relinquished control of it in 2009. Iran has long urged Iraq to get rid of Camp Ashraf and the opposition group there, and Iraq's failure to do so is a point of tension between the two countries. Tehran considers the MEK to be a terrorist outfit. The European Union does not. Another State Department official said the department is reviewing the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation of the MEK, with a final decision to be made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on whether to maintain or rescind it. The MEK is providing information for the review, the official told CNN. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Iraq wants to close camp of Iranian dissidents .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former ""American Idol"" contestant Pia Toscano has signed a record deal with Interscope Records and will release her debut single next week, the label said Wednesday. Within hours after she was voted off the 10th season of the talent show in April, reports surfaced that Toscano had been signed by Interscope head -- and ""Idol"" mentor Jimmy Iovine. But at the time, Toscano told CNN it was not a done deal. On Wednesday, the label said Toscano's debut single, ""This Time,"" will arrive July 12. The album comes out later in the year. ""Jimmy Iovine was an amazing mentor during my time on Idol and I'm looking forward to working with him and everyone at Interscope Records and 19 Recordings,"" Toscano said.

"(CNN) -- The top prosecutors in Mexico and Guatemala set their sights on the Zetas drug cartel Wednesday, pledging to pool information and resources as their countries battle the notoriously violent criminal group. Attorneys general from the neighboring nations agreed ""to create concrete mechanisms for quickly exchanging timely information for the fight against the Zetas organization and others,"" Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement. The top prosecutors met a day after Guatemalan authorities announced a monthlong extension of the ""state of siege"" in the northern border province of Peten -- a move aimed at continuing a crackdown on organized crime in the area. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared the emergency measure in May after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in Peten. According to a report from Guatemala's interior ministry, the suspected attackers were searching for the farm's owner. ""I will find you and I will leave you like this,"" a message written in blood on a white wall said. It was signed ""Z 200,"" the name of a Zetas cell in Guatemala, the report says. The state of siege curtails citizen liberties and allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant. Authorities extended the measure because they need more time to improve security and strengthen institutions in the province, Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Menocal said in a statement Tuesday. Security forces have arrested dozens of people in connection with the slayings, Guatemalan Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz said in a visit to Peten last week. The Zetas originated in Mexico as the armed branch of the Gulf Cartel, and have split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization with an international reach. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration describes the Zetas as ""a group of Mexican military deserters ... who have kidnapped, tortured and murdered -- including beheadings of law enforcement officials, innocent citizens, informants and rival drug gangs."" In an interview with CNN en Español last year, Menocal noted that clashes between authorities and the Zetas had significantly increased. He said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels that are increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. Guatemala is scheduled to host a conference on Central American security next week. So far this year, Guatemalan authorities have seized 344 million quetzales (about $44 million) worth of cocaine, 566 vehicles, eight airplanes and about 200 weapons from suspected members of criminal organizations, Colom said Tuesday, according to the state-run Guatemalan News Agency. ""All of the region is making important security efforts, but there are other countries that are not doing their part,"" he said at forum of regional leaders in Guatemala City Tuesday. ""We cannot keep paying with deaths.""","Attorneys general from Mexico and Guatemala agree to share more information .

"Washington (CNN) -- The government of Saudi Arabia expressed concerns about American security regulations that included Saudis in a list of nationalities that warranted additional screening at airports. Transportation Security Administration regulations included the kingdom in a ""limited group of countries for additional airport screening"" adopted in the aftermath of the attempted airline bombing December 25, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks. Deputy Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Torki Al-Saud Al-Kabir raised the issue in a meeting with Jeffrey D. Feltman, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, according to a January State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. According to TSA regulations passed January 3 in the aftermath of the failed terrorist attack, citizens and travelers from 14 countries would get enhanced screening when they fly to the United States, possibly including full-body pat-downs, carry-on bag searches, full-body scans and explosive detection swabs. The countries on the list include those officially designated as supporters of terrorism -- Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria -- as well as other countries of interest, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. Torki told Feltman that the issue had caused ""a lot of difficulties and embarrassment for Saudi Arabia,"" to the point that Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal would raise the issue himself with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a meeting in London, England, the next day. According to the cable, Torki said that the issue was not the regulation itself but the kingdom's ""inclusion on the list with the likes of Cuba, which causes Saudi Arabia's friends and enemies to question how strong its bilateral relationship with the United States really is."" He also noted the difficulty of explaining this policy to Saudis, considering that the flights would not have originated in the kingdom while other countries with recent terrorist incidents on airplanes -- he identifies the United Kingdom, Egypt and Turkey, according to the document -- are not included in this group. Torki noted that although the provisions were only temporary, Saudi Arabia wanted to know how and when they would be amended. The cable also points out that he implied ""the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the [United States government], the more it was likely to prompt the Saudi Government to re-evaluate areas of cooperation, including counter-terrorism cooperation."" Feltman promised to ""convey the spirit and strength of the message"" and welcomed ""any specific Saudi suggestions to address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives exploited in the December 25 incident."" The TSA updated its guidance in April, noting that travelers coming into the United States from abroad might notice enhanced screening and security measures, regardless of country of origin. This new guidance would apply to all countries and ""supersede"" the list of 14 countries that offended the Saudis, which the TSA described as ""an emergency measure."" On the WikiLeaks documents' release, Osama Nogali, the spokesman for the Saudi foreign minister, said that ""these documents do not concern the kingdom of Saudi Arabia nor the kingdom has any role in producing them, nor is it aware of its authenticity. Therefore Saudi Arabia cannot comment on them, however, the policies and positions of the kingdom have always been clear.""

"(CNN) -- A 10-month-old Indiana boy born with a fatal genetic disorder died Sunday at a North Carolina hospital where he had gone in hope of receiving a potentially life-saving organ transplant, his parents said in a Facebook post. Seth Petreikis, after having open heart surgery when he was about 2 1/2 weeks old, was diagnosed with complete DiGeorge syndrome, a rare disease that left him with no immune system. However, it was not Seth's heart or the complete DiGeorge syndrome that ultimately caused his death, his mother said in the same Facebook post. Baby Seth died from complications resulting from a problem with his airway. Seth went to Duke University Hospital to receive a thymus transplant. The procedure was pioneered by Duke's Dr. M. Louise Markert, the only doctor at the only hospital in the United States that performs the surgery. Seth's condition resulted from the absence of a thymus gland, which produces T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from infection, Markert told HLN in a television interview in December. Without T cells, Seth had no way to fight infections, Markert explained. Sixty infants with complete DiGeorge syndrome have received transplants and 43, or 72%, survived, according to Duke University Hospital. But Seth's family hit a roadblock when coverage for the transplant was denied by MDwise, an Indiana Medicaid administrator that was their insurer, because the surgery was considered experimental. The cost of the surgery was an estimated $500,000, which Seth's parents told CNN they could not afford. Seth's plight became the focus of many media reports. MDwise eventually reversed its decision and agreed to cover the transplant. ""Based on Seth's unique and compelling story, we believe making a compassionate allowance in this case is appropriate,"" said Caroline Carney Doebbeling, MDwise chief medical officer, in a press release issued after the reversal of its decision. But last week, doctors determined Seth had a severe tracheomalacia, meaning his airway was so floppy it could not sustain itself. Seth would have needed to be on ventilation for years, and he would not have been eligible for the thymus transplant during that time because of the ventilation. It would have been impossible for Seth to stay free of infections and viruses for those years, Seth's mother, Becky Petreikis, explained on the Facebook page. ""Pray for Seth Petreikis."" ""He was such a little fighter. It was an honor to be his mom for 10 months,"" she wrote. Seth's funeral will be Saturday morning in Crown Point, Indiana.","Baby Seth went to a North Carolina hospital in hope of an organ transplant .

"New York (CNN) -- The head of the International Monetary Fund, jailed on charges of sexual assault of a chambermaid in his New York City hotel suite, should consider stepping down for the good of the institution, Austria's finance minister said Tuesday. ""Given the circumstances that his bail was not granted, he should think about whether he is damaging the institution,"" Maria Fekter told reporters in Brussels, Belgium, during a meeting of European finance ministers. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 62, was denied bail by a Manhattan Criminal Court judge and remanded Monday to an 11-by-13-foot cell at New York's Rikers Island jail complex. There, the man whom many refer to as DSK was placed on suicide watch -- a common procedure in high-profile cases, two sources with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. The case has shaken the IMF, an organization of 187 countries working to improve world economies by providing loans and guidance. It has also shaken the political world in France, where the Socialist Party politician was considered a front-runner to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy. But until his next court appearance Friday, Strauss-Kahn will neither be working to save world economies nor to endear himself to French voters. Instead, he will be largely left alone -- denied contact with other inmates because of his high-profile status, said a New York Department of Correction spokesman who declined to be named. Ahead of Tuesday's meeting to address the Greek debt burden, Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said the alleged crimes of the IMF chief were ""very serious"" and suggested letting ""justice take its course."" In Ireland, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore called the incident a ""disruption."" ""There's no doubt that an event like that does cause a disruption in the functioning of a body like the IMF when its senior figure is arrested,"" Gilmore said. ""We have to wait and see how that works out, and we have to respect the legal process which is under way in New York."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was with Gilmore in Dublin, told reporters he hopes the incident does not affect the ""many important decisions ... before the IMF."" ""At the moment it is important that it functions well,"" Hague said. ""So we look to all concerned to make sure that it does."" Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he was confident the scandal would not affect the organization's broader mission. ""Ireland as a country deals with the IMF as an institution,"" Kenny said. ""We don't get involved in any individual situations."" In Washington, U.S. Sen. John Kerry told reporters the situation involving the IMF chief was ""very troubling, if not damning."" ""You've got to give it a few days to let that develop. But if the evidence is what it appears to be, I think it would be very difficult for him to manage."" On Tuesday, IMF spokesman William Murray said in a written statement that the IMF had had no contact with its leader since his arrest. In Strauss-Kahn's absence, First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky has been named acting managing director, ""and the fund continues its normal work,"" Murray said. Murray also said Strauss-Kahn's diplomatic immunity does not apply in the sexual assault case. ""The MD's (managing director) immunities are limited and are not applicable to this case,"" he said. He added, however, that any IMF-related documents Strauss-Kahn may have had with him or left in the hotel room would be governed by diplomatic immunity and should be returned to the Washington-based organization. A former French finance minister, national legislator and economics professor in Paris, Strauss-Kahn became the IMF's 10th managing director in November 2007. He is also chairman of the IMF executive board. The alleged victim is a 32-year-old single mother living in the New York borough of the Bronx who moved to the United States from the West African country of Guinea. She had been working at the hotel for at least two years, according to her attorney, Jeffrey Shapiro. ""Her world has been turned upside down,"" he said. ""She is very scared about her future."" Shapiro said his client is cooperating with police and prosecutors, and would be willing to testify against Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn's accuser picked the IMF chief out of a lineup Sunday at a New York police station, saying he was the man who had sexually assaulted her, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. ""She's recovering -- slowly,"" said Blake Diallo, the general manager of a Harlem restaurant she frequents, who described himself to reporters as her friend. The alleged attack began Saturday around noon, when the housekeeper entered Strauss-Kahn's $525 suite on the 28th floor of the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown to clean. New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said the economist emerged naked from a room, ran down a hallway after the woman, and attacked her. He shut the door, preventing the woman from leaving, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors. ""He grabbed the victim's chest without consent, attempted to remove her pantyhose"" and forcibly grabbed her between her legs, the complaint said. He also forced her to perform oral sex on him, Assistant District Attorney John McConnell said at Monday's arraignment. The criminal complaint alleges that Strauss-Kahn forced the woman to engage ""in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct"" and tried to force her to engage in sexual intercourse. He faces charges that include two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, one count of first-degree attempted rape, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse. The most serious charge, criminal sexual act in the first degree, carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Afterward, the employee went to the front desk, and staffers alerted police, Browne said. By the time officers arrived, Strauss-Kahn had left in the hotel limousine, according to the law enforcement source. He called the hotel around the same time police got to the hotel to say he had left his phone behind and asked if it could be delivered to him at the airport. Investigators told the hotel staff member to agree to do so and police went to the airport. Two plain-clothes Port Authority police detectives led him off the plane, the source said. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys pointed to their client's lack of a criminal record and the fact that his daughter lives in New York as evidence that he was not a flight risk. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman called the case ""very defensible."" But Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sided with the prosecution in characterizing Strauss-Kahn as a flight risk and denying him bail. The impact of his arrest has perhaps been strongest in France, where Strauss-Kahn, where the Socialist Party leader had been considered a strong challenger to Sarkozy. But some observers said Tuesday that his political future appears bleak. ""If the accusations are true, Strauss-Kahn will not be able to run for president,"" said Jacques Attali, a political analyst and a former top aide to late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ivan Watson, Richard Roth, Saskya Vandoorne, Caroline Paterson, David Ariosto, Raelyn Johnson and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","NEW: ""She's recovering -- slowly,"" says friend of the alleged victim .

"(CNN) -- He has been called ""a great seducer"" -- a politician whose relationships with women have landed him in trouble. He's also known for his brilliant grasp of global economics and European politics. But for Dominique Gaston Andre Strauss-Kahn -- head of the powerful International Monetary Fund and, until this weekend, presumptive front-runner for the presidency of France -- the most relevant issue today may be whether he can stay out of prison. Strauss-Kahn, 62, is charged with chasing a hotel employee down the hall of his posh New York hotel suite on Saturday and sexually assaulting her. Read the criminal complaint (contains graphic language) (pdf) Police allege he attacked the 32-year-old woman at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel. Later in the day, authorities pulled him from his first-class seat on a Paris-bound flight minutes before its scheduled departure. Now, instead of preparing to lead France's Socialist Party against Nicolas Sarkozy next year, he is preparing to defend himself against charges of attempted rape, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching, and sexual abuse. The arrest of Strauss-Kahn triggered intense political chatter across the Atlantic. In France, it delivered what the Paris newspaper Le Figaro called a ""thunderclap"" to the presidential race. And some at the headquarters of Strauss-Kahn's Socialist party were in tears Monday after the news. Arrest rocks French presidential race . The incident has also disrupted the rhythm of the IMF, which assists countries suffering economic difficulties by providing loans. Founded after World War II, the IMF is composed of 187 countries. Politically, ""it's over. He's done,"" said Simon Serfaty, a senior European analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Strauss-Kahn ""cannot recover,"" Serfaty told CNN. It is, by any standard, a stunning fall for the man many presumed would be the next occupant of the Elysee Palace. It's also a cautionary tale for those who might forget how quickly sexual allegations can bring down even the most influential leaders. Long before he ended up on the front pages of the tabloids, Strauss-Kahn was well-known to followers of global financial news. The University of Paris-educated economist has headed the IMF for the duration of the current global financial crisis. In doing so, he has played a lead role in bailing out the economies of Greece and Ireland, as well as propping up Europe's currency, the euro. ""He was a strong and effective leader,"" said Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy research analyst at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. ""He made the IMF not only effective, but credible."" Strauss-Kahn has been a force in French politics for a quarter century, first winning election to that country's National Assembly -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986. He was President Francois Mitterrand's trade minister from 1991 to 1993, and went on to serve as finance minister in the late 1990s. During that period, Paris joined the euro and ditched the franc. Strauss-Kahn lost a fight with Segolene Royal for the Socialist Party's presidential nomination in 2006. One year later, he was named managing director of the IMF. Married to his third wife and father of four children, he has also taught economics at Stanford University in California and at the prestigious Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, known as Sciences Po. ""He is a very serious political figure as well as a senior economic and financial figure,"" noted Heather Conley, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Europe program. He ""understands what needs to be done in terms of economics and what can be done in terms of politics,"" Serfaty said. A dominant figure in the French left, Strauss-Kahn gained a reputation over the years as someone who enjoys a lavish lifestyle. It was well-known that he is ""not alien or indifferent to money,"" Serfaty said. He has ""been interested in his earnings."" In 1999, after an allegation of unethical financial doings involving his consulting business, Strauss-Kahn resigned his ministerial post. He was acquitted of the charges. As head of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn pulled in an annual tax-free salary of more than $420,000, according to a 2007 statement from the organization. He also received more than $75,000 for ""a scale of living appropriate"" to his position. To the extent that there was a perceived conflict between his socialist political ideals and wealthy lifestyle, it wasn't an issue for most French voters, Serfaty asserted. It is Strauss-Kahn's sexual reputation that is more relevant today. Long before he found himself in legal trouble in the United States, there was ""no question"" that he ""had a marked interest in the other sex,"" Serfaty said. Strauss-Kahn's history of misconduct charges . Political analysts routinely note that allegations of infidelity are generally much less likely to derail a political career in France than in America. There is simply a ""different cultural context in France"" to most sexual issues, Conley noted. Strauss-Kahn became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the IMF. He acknowledged reports that he'd had an improper physical relationship with a female employee. The relationship was consensual, an independent inquiry found. The IMF's executive board concluded in October 2008 that ""there was no harassment, favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director."" Nevertheless, the board found ""that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment,"" the IMF said in a written statement. Strauss-Kahn issued a statement after the investigation, noting that he had ""apologized for it to the (board of directors), to the staff of the IMF and to my family,"" as well as to the employee. Strauss-Kahn's departure from the IMF would not leave a huge void, said Reginald Dale, a senior fellow in the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and Intelligence Services, a Washington-based think thank. ""If you fire the manager of a sports team, it still goes on playing while waiting for a new manager,"" he said. ""Strauss-Kahn is not indispensable at the IMF."" Dale said Strauss-Kahn liked to be known by his initials -- as DSK. ""Ever since JFK, which is the airport, ironically, at which he was arrested, French politicians and even intellectuals have loved to try to establish themselves with a three-initial moniker because it has that sort of ring of prestige."" He cited the philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, or BHL, as an example. What is surprising to many observers is the new assertion that Strauss-Kahn -- a man with no criminal record -- physically forced himself on a woman. ""Like all Frenchmen, I was stupefied,"" said Michel Taubmann, who has written a biography of Strauss-Khan. ""I was incredulous."" Taubmann, who recounted Strauss-Khan's amorous adventures in his book, described the economist as ""a French lover ... a great seducer."" But the man he studied ""could not be a rapist,"" Taubmann said. ""Imagine that that man, who is an extremely intelligent man, who is a great economist, who is a very nice man in his personal comportment, who is a father of a family, who is a grandfather,"" Taubmann told CNN. ""I can't believe that he could be sexually aggressive against a young woman as he is accused of doing in New York."" Yet, other charges against Strauss-Kahn are now surfacing in the wake of his arrest. Anne Mansouret, a Socialist member of the French parliament, said Monday that Strauss-Kahn attacked her daughter in 2002. French politician: Strauss-Kahn attacked my daughter . Mansouret said she cautioned her daughter, Tristane Banon, not to file a police report at the time, saying it might adversely impact her career. At the time, Banon was an aspiring journalist.

However, in light of the charges filed against Strauss-Kahn in the wake of the alleged incident in New York, Banon's attorney in France, David Koubbi, has said he and the young woman are considering whether to file a complaint.

Europe, a huge U.S. export market, currently holds nearly $3 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds, Conley said. American banks hold $1.4 trillion in European debt.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic fought like a true champion to extend his winning run to 36 matches this year as he reached the final of the Rome Masters at the expense of Andy Murray on Saturday. The Serbian triumphed 6-1 3-6 7-6 (7-2) in a three-hour semifinal epic to set up another showdown with world No. 1 Rafael Nadal, a player he has beaten in three Masters Series title matches this season. Second-ranked Djokovic ended the Spaniard's two-year unbeaten run on clay in the Madrid final, but it remains to be seen whether he has enough energy in reserve to repeat that on Sunday. Nadal had a much easier passage as he defeated French 16th seed Richard Gasquet 7-5 6-1 in 93 minutes, ending the run of a player who had earlier beaten his longtime rival Roger Federer and seventh seed Tomas Berdych. Djokovic's dream year shows no sign of slowing . Djokovic had to dig deep as Murray showed tremendous resolve after capitulating in the first set -- a showing that raised the prospect of a repeat of his Australian Open final defeat against the same player in January. But the fourth seed -- who turns 24 on Sunday -- battled back to level, inflicting Djokovic's first dropped set of the tournament, and then fought back again after going down 3-1 in the decider. Murray, seeking to become the first British player to reach a top-level clay final since 1982, broke Djokovic's serve twice in a row -- the second time to love - as he went 4-3 ahead. But Djokovic, who could have gone top in the rankings if Nadal had not reached the last four, broke back immediately. Both players then dropped serve again -- Murray after a morale-sapping double fault -- but then held to take the match to a tie-break. Djokovic had appeared to be on his last legs at several stages, but appeared rejuvenated as he raced to a 5-1 lead before reaching the final of an event he won in 2008. He then roared with relief at an appreciative crowd as he showed just how much the victory meant to him ahead of his own 24th birthday on May 22. Nadal beat Djokovic in the 2009 Rome final, and has won the event for five of the past six years. But his status as ""King of Clay"" is under serious threat this year ahead of the French Open starting next month, where he is defending champion and seeking a sixth title since 2005. ""I am playing better every day and a little bit higher, so I think that in general I am happy for everything,"" Nadal, who was hampered by illness earlier this week, told the ATP Tour website. ""I'm in another final, six in a row, and it is unbelievable. I had a tough week, so I am very happy for everything.""","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic to play top-ranked Rafael Nadal in Rome final .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will use a major speech this week on the Middle East to reaffirm basic U.S. principles and policies regarding the region while also toughening his administration's stance against Syria's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, administration officials said Monday. The speech Thursday at the State Department also will address the ongoing fight against al Qaeda following the May 2 killing of its leader, Osama bin Laden, as well as the current status of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said the officials, who spoke on condition of not being identified. Last week, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama's address will be a ""fairly sweeping and comprehensive"" take on the events that have upended governments in Tunisia and Egypt and pushed other countries to take steps toward reform. The speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, that called for ""a new beginning"" between the United States and the Muslim world. This time, the Arab Spring that has launched demonstrations throughout North Africa and the Middle East provides the backdrop as Obama continues to enjoy a domestic political uplift from the successful U.S. mission to eliminate bin Laden at his compound in Pakistan. What's next for the Arab Spring . According to the administration officials, major themes of the speech will focus on how change in the Middle East region came from the people who live there and provided them with an opportunity to gain a say in their future governance, and that the United States cannot impose change but will uphold principles such as freedom of assembly, the right to self-determination and respect for human rights. Obama also will address situations in specific countries, and is expected to come out strong against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's violent response to protesters in his country, the officials said. They expect additional U.S. sanctions on Syria to be announced before the speech and said the new measures could target Assad by name. Report: Iran sending banned weapons to Syria . Other countries likely to be mentioned by name include Bahrain and Yemen, but not with the same level of criticism as directed at Syria, the administration officials said. Obama also will talk about how the Middle East protesters are demonstrating for freedom and democracy, rather than the bin Laden-al Qaeda ideology. On Sunday, former National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair said that the speech will give Obama a chance to restate American backing for the outpouring of support for the Arab Spring. ""I think it brings us the opportunity to get on the right side of history, the things we believe in,"" Blair said. ""The Arab Spring is not just about Israel, it is about freedom and democracy. And I think that sentiment is very powerful, plays to our strengths and we should be strongly in favor of that."" The Obama administration helped prod former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office in February after the country's military establishment refused to crush a popular uprising against his nearly 30-year rule. U.S. forces took part in the NATO air campaign against Libya, where the allies have called for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to yield to an armed rebellion and leave power after nearly 42 years. Arrest warrants sought for Gadhafi . Washington slapped sanctions on top Syrian officials after a violent crackdown on pro-reform protests there. But the clampdown on demonstrators and activists in Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf, has drawn only verbal protests from American officials. ""They are bottling up forces which will eventually push them out,"" Blair said. ""So I think that what the United States does is to encourage that in general, and then we support specifically where we can."" While Obama's Cairo speech of 2009 was well-received, a feeling persists in the region that U.S. policy in reaction to the Arab Spring has been inconsistent. Expectations therefore are high for Obama to this time lay out a clear and strong statement of intent and action rather than general platitudes and half-measures that fail to materialize. Blair served as director of national intelligence until May 2010, when he resigned after finding himself at odds with the White House and others in the intelligence community during his 16-month tenure. His predecessor, John Negroponte, said Sunday that other players, including the Arab League and the international community, will have to ""step up"" to support reform if it is going to succeed. ""The Libya case, I think, is instructive in that regard because you will recall that President Obama stipulated that there needed to be more unilateral and European engagement in that situation,"" said Negroponte, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Iraq under the Bush administration. ""And I think ditto with respect to Syria."" Princeton University analyst Anne-Marie Slaughter told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" Sunday that Obama realizes the United States is ""politically indispensable"" to creating a broad coalition. ""But once we've done that, his idea is we shouldn't be the global policeman,"" said Slaughter, a former top State Department official. ""Other countries have a really strong stake in these outcomes, and we should be willing to share responsibility with them."" Meanwhile, Negroponte said an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal is needed for Israel, a key U.S. ally, ""to be viable over the long term."" Though those efforts are currently stalled, ""We can never take it completely off the table,"" he said. Deadly clashes mark Israel's founding . The administration's Mideast special envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, resigned last week after two years leading efforts to resolve the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ongoing Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority's efforts to reconcile the feud between the Hamas and Fatah factions that rule different Palestinian territories and Palestinian steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart during that period. Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat and ambassador to Washington, told ""GPS"" that other countries will be watching the Americans closely because of the global reach of the United States. ""They'll always look at both American rhetoric and American deeds,"" Mahbubani said. ""American power is present everywhere.""

"(CNN)  -- Double-amputee athlete Oscar Pistorius was selected Monday in the South African team for the world championships in Daegu later this month. Pistorius will run in the individual 400m and is part of the 4x400m relay for the biennial competition in South Korea from August 27-September 4. Pistorius, nicknamed 'The Blade Runner' , will be competing in a global championships, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. ""I have dreamt for such a long time of competing in a major championship and this is a very proud moment in my life,"" he said in a statement. The 24-year-old Pistorius was cleared to compete against able-bodied athletes three years ago, but in the past has failed to reach the qualifying times for the Olympics and major championships. But all that changed with a 45.07 second clocking for 400m in Italy last month. ""The IAAF is a world-class governing body for our sport and I am grateful to have the chance to run in their events. It will be a great day for me when I set out on the track in Daegu and hope to do my country proud,"" he added. The four-time Paralympic gold medallist had both legs amputated below the knee for medical reasons when he was 11 months old, but it has not prevented him competing in a number of sports, including athletics. Reigning world 800m champion Caster Semenya will get the chance to defend her title after also being named in the South African squad.

"(CNN) -- Cradling your heap of plastic, you approach the bins, hastily inspecting each item for the number molded on the bottom. Plastic water bottles go in the bin for ones and twos, along with the milk jug. That was easy enough, but what about the water bottle caps? Trash. Chinese take-out container? Bin number six. Packing peanuts? Trash. Canola oil container is labeled number three. No number threes accepted. Annoyed and confused yet? You're not alone. The EPA reports only 7% of plastic waste generated in 2009 was recovered for recycling. But, a discovery by University of Warwick engineers could make recycling easier for you. A group of scientists at this U.K. university has discovered a way to recycle 100% of plastic. Using pyrolysis, a technique in which heat is applied in the absence of oxygen to decompose materials, the university says it was able to break plastic down into its basic elements. The results could mean a significant reduction in pollution while scientists try to find a safer alternative to using plastic. ""It will reduce the amount of plastic from being sent to landfills and/or incinerators, beautify our environments and create sustainable plastic products,"" said environmental engineer Naji Khoury of Temple University College of Engineering. Warwick Ventures business development manager Kevin Marks says the next step is to commercialize their findings. They will build their first plant in the near future. ""There are currently no commercial recycling plants that can deal with domestic mixed plastic waste, so the system we are developing will be the first of its kind in the world,"" Marks said. Why could this be such a big deal? The EPA spent more than $220 million on recycling and waste management in 2008 due to sorting, landfill management and other costly actions. The ability to recycle 100% of plastic could remove the need to sort through materials and reduce the need to produce fresh plastic. ""Waste can be a valuable resource,"" said Craig Criddle, an environmental engineer at Stanford University. ""We hear a lot of about 'waste-to-energy' but little about 'waste-to-chemicals.' Creating chemicals from waste could be more profitable than making energy."" Since plastic is not biodegradable, it cannot be broken down by microorganisms and remains in a landfill forever. Polly Sattler, executive director of GreenPlate, a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to reducing the use of plastics in society, says what people need to know is that many of the materials collected have a lot of potential value and are sold. By using the University of Warwick's process to turn plastics into energy, she believes people will see the need to increase their recycling efforts. While temporary measures can be taken to reduce our plastic use, Criddle said widespread use of this technology would decrease our dependence on fossil carbon and stimulate local economies. Robert Waymouth, a chemist at Stanford University, offers a simple example to explain what he believes is the most important conclusion of the study: ""Consider the jug of liquid laundry detergent. ... this jug could be reused for 10 years, but we typically throw it away after the laundry detergent is gone. ... It's the economy of convenience that leads to our current 'throw-away' society; this is ultimately not a sustainable way to utilize our resources or sustain our environment."" Chemist Marc Hillmyer of the University of Minnesota says actions come with consequences: ""Advances in science led to the generation of wonderfully useful, versatile, lightweight and strong plastics that have myriad applications that bring benefit to society. Now, we have to use the same ingenuity to appropriately deal with the plastic waste that is a consequence of the broad utility of these materials.""","British scientists say they've found way to recycle 100% of plastics .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware pediatrician facing 529 felony counts of rape and other sexual offenses involving his young patients waived his right to a jury trial Monday, a court official said. Dr. Earl Bradley told Superior Court Judge William Carpenter Jr. on Monday morning that he did not want his fate decided by a jury of his peers, said Colleen Redmond, a Delaware courts official. He made the announcement at a pretrial hearing at a New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington. His trial, nonetheless, is set to begin June 1, according to Delaware Justice Department spokesman Jason P. Miller. Carpenter will be the presiding judge. The pediatrician, who had a practice in Lewes, Delaware, was arrested in December 2009 on charges that include rape, sexual exploitation of a child, endangering child welfare and assault. In March 2010, Bradley, 56, pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts after he was accused of victimizing 103 children: 102 girls and one boy. The next month, the Delaware doctor was indicted on 58 additional counts of rape and other sexual offenses. These related to 24 girls he had as patients between 1999 and 2009. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden has said the charges are based on ""video and digital evidence"" seized from Bradley's home and medical practice around the time of his arrest. In addition to Delaware, Bradley has medical licenses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. Delaware authorities have said they have contacted officials in those states. In a February 2010 interview with CNN, Bradley's attorney said that his client's defense would largely center on his mental condition at the time the crimes are alleged to have occurred. ""Most of the evidence in this case comes from videotapes. It's kind of hard to argue with videotapes,"" Eugene Maurer Jr. said. ""The issue, in this case, is going to come down to his mental health at the time.""

"(CNN)  -- Doug Skinner held up the pants in the tiny dressing room and shook his head. There's no way, he thought. No way I'm at a size 48. This was 2004. Skinner was fresh out of college, recently married and just starting his career as a technology coordinator for a local school district. I refuse to go any bigger than 46, he thought vehemently. ""Unfortunately, that day I did have to buy those [pants],"" Skinner remembers. ""But I didn't go any higher than that."" Skinner always had an excuse for his obesity as a young adult. The self-described ""stocky"" man was just big-boned, he told himself. In reality, he weighed close to 300 pounds. ""It wasn't like we were stopping on the way home at McDonald's every night -- it was just portion sizes,"" Skinner says. ""The easiest thing in the world [for me] is to eat. I'm a food guy. I love food. I love dessert."" But that day in a badly-lit discount clothing store in New Jersey, something clicked. He walked back over to his wife, Denise, who looked unhappy with her clothing selections as well. They decided right then to make a change. ""We said, 'Look, this is it. Let's not kid around anymore."" Got your own weight loss story to share? Visit iReport . The couple went home and borrowed a few Weight Watchers books from a relative and began to eat less. ""The first month, I was starving,"" Skinner says. ""After the first month it was easier. It's still not easy today, but it's easier."" Doug and Denise also started walking laps around a park near their house. It wasn't exactly fun, but he didn't know what else to do to get active. After a few weeks he jogged one lap. Then two. As he lost weight it got easier to jog and a couple of laps turned into a couple of miles. He didn't slow down until he reached 200 pounds. Now Skinner runs five days a week -- on Mondays it's a long run of six to eight miles; the rest of the days he does about four. On May 1 he completed the 10-mile Broadstreet Run in Philadelphia in a time of 1 hour and 22 minutes. He doesn't count calories but eats small meals for breakfast and lunch: cereal and a banana in the morning; yogurt and an orange around noon. Dinner he plans ahead of time -- splurging on Friday night when he takes time off from running to share pizza and cookies with his wife. He weighed in last week at 174 pounds. Like in any weight loss attempt, there were setbacks. In 2007 Skinner had reached 220 pounds. A ""Biggest Loser""-type contest at school helped him drop down to 170. When he posted his story on iReport in March, he weighed 193.5 pounds. ""I'm not ashamed to say my weight goes up and down... It's a constant fight,"" Skinner said in a phone interview last month. ""I'm looking at a bowl of cookies that are right across from me and I kind of want one. Fortunately, the phone cord doesn't reach that far."" ""There's no way I'm going to sit at a Thanksgiving table and not eat anything ... I consider myself a foodie and for as long as I live I will never have that type of [fear] relationship with food -- I enjoy it too much. I will not deprive myself because of a pound or two."" He hopes his daughter Gwen grows up to appreciate food like he does, without ever having to worry about battling the scale. So he's setting a good example early. ""I'm trying to avoid putting all the pressure on the food aspect. Every step counts. I say that tongue-in-cheek, but it's important. The thing that's worked best for me is getting off my butt.""

"(Oprah.com)  -- Every biologist, botanist, and zoologist will tell you the same thing: Nature loves variety. People may fear it, and some religious or political groups may hate it -- but Nature loves it. The desert grassland whiptail (Aspidoscelis uniparens) forms female pairs. And these female couples reproduce ... successfully. The anglerfish female is spiny, ugly, and so much bigger than the male that most humans don't even see him: the tiny little glob attached to the lady anglerfish by his teeth. She feeds him and after a while, he loses his eyeballs and she takes his sperm. Normal, among anglerfish. And don't get me started on the saddleback tamarins, monkeys whose families are composed of mother, father, offspring, and an ""extra father"" serving as mother's lover and nursemaid for the baby tamarin. (It's called cooperative polyandry, and if you're rushing to get to work while trying to feed the baby applesauce and keep it off your sweater, the life of a tamarin doesn't sound too bad.) It may be that people are finally getting the idea. After years of pretending that Ozzie and Harriet's ""nuclear family"" (what an expression!) was the norm, we seem to have noticed that it was only ever really widespread among the upper middle class or in parts of the country so isolated and wild that not even mothers-in-law came to call. That vision had its brief and waxily shining moment, for a small portion of the population, for a very little while (by 1980, more women worked outside the home than didn't).

I stood under the chuppah with my stepson's mother, at his wedding. Always elegant, always mischievous, she leaned toward me and whispered, ""Oooh, they're all thinking, look how those two get along."" And even if people didn't think that (I'm pretty sure they were admiring the handsome groom and beautiful bride and not the two nutty ladies chuckling in the corner), it was gratifying that in addition to this payoff for decency, there was even the glint of genuine affection.

I don't mean just that you have the opportunity to love them, I mean that you'd better love them, even if your history with them is not so happy, even if they piss you off, even if they're practically strangers. My love for my children means that I have to love their father, too. I don't have to wish we were still married to each other, I don't have to be his wingman when he's single or his best man when he's marrying, but I do have to find a way to love him, because he is a good man, and a loving father, and he is still part of my family... and now so is his partner. My mother's love for me meant that even as she was mourning the end of my long relationship with someone she loved, at a time in her life when she was frail and tired and wanted nothing more than routine and comfort, she welcomed my future husband as if she'd been waiting for him and she welcomed his mother, too, happy for there to be more.

Two mommies not only rely on the usual cadre of pals and relatives that all lucky people do, they are wise to attach a couple of necessary and loving male figures. The two dads often do the same, and every single parent I know has managed, through love and bribery and persistence, to create a network (and a safety net) for their small basic unit. This seems like a good thing, for all of us. For those of us in the more conventional units, these others who go out and forage for family are excellent role models, and sooner or later we would be wise to imitate them. Instead of lonely widows in condos, wouldn't a lot of us be happier four to a house, taking our chances on Susan's coq au vin and Thursday night poker? Mightn't the single mothers and four children be better off sharing a place, chipping in from two salaries for an au pair? It sounds practical, which it is, but it is also about love. Our capacity to love is not limited; time is a constraint and so is energy, but love that makes your life better gives you more of what you need.

"(CNN)  -- Jose Angel Baez, the workhorse lawyer who won acquittals for Casey Anthony at the most-watched murder trial in years, may be either the best criminal defense attorney in America -- or the luckiest. It took him eight years to convince the Florida Supreme Court to let him practice law, and he'd been trying cases for just three years when the Anthony case came along. Many observers of the seven-week murder trial said he was in over his head and predicted doom. The judge scolded him so often he became the bad boy of Courtroom 23. Bloggers and trial watchers took to calling him ""Bozo."" In the end, none of the digs mattered because Baez got results. Convicted and pilloried in the court of public opinion, Anthony was cleared of all murder-related charges in a court of law. Whether by luck or by skill, Baez suddenly is looking less like a clown and more like the Hispanic version of late legal legend Johnnie Cochran. They're calling him ""Juani Cochran."" In a lengthy interview with ""In Session"" in April, the 42-year-old Baez recalled being in law school and ducking out of class to watch O.J. Simpson's televised murder trial. Cochran became one of his heroes. ""I could win this case and I could win several more, and I still couldn't accomplish what Johnnie did in his time practicing law,"" Baez said. ""I don't like the comparison, because I don't deserve it."" Baez entered the Anthony case as an unknown, but his status skyrocketed overnight after her acquittal. Now, he has an agent to field calls from Barbara Walters and invitations to sail on Geraldo Rivera's yacht. The new darling of the cable chat circuit is remarkably ordinary, the type of low-budget, constantly hustling defense attorney found in courthouses everywhere -- working the calendar calls, the jails, the bail bondsmen in a constant search for clients. That's how he came to meet Casey Anthony. ""Apparently there were a couple of people in the jail that gave her my name, referred me to her,"" he said. ""I've built up a hard reputation of fighting for my clients. 100% of my business comes from referrals. I don't advertise, I don't have television ads or billboards or anything like that and I never have."" Anthony recalled her decision during a recorded jailhouse visit with her parents. The recording was played at the trial: . ""It kind of happened at random in booking,"" she said. ""I heard a couple of people talking about attorneys. His name came up and I said, 'If he's good, can you do me a favor and pass my name along?'"" Baez had to listen in court as the parents expressed their doubts about him in another recorded visit. ""I just hope that the compassion that he says he has is genuine,"" said George Anthony, an ex-cop. ""I hope he's not building a reputation for himself."" Here's how Baez bills himself on his law firm's web site: . ""Aggressive, Experienced, Trusted Criminal Defense."" But the site doesn't let visitors read his biography or the cases it highlights: ""High profile murder trial;"" ""Taking on the mayor;"" ""Mother accused of kidnapping;"" and ""State trooper cleared."" Click on any of them, and you are returned to the top of the home page. ""I relate to people,"" he said in the ""In Session"" interview, conducted before the trial began. ""People make mistakes. We all have erasers on our pencils. We've all done some stupid things in life that should not define us."" Like his clients, Baez has acquired a few scuffs and dings. He was born in Puerto Rico in 1969 and raised by a single mother in Miami and the Bronx. He dropped out of Miami's Homestead High School his freshman year and married at 17 when he learned he would be a father. ""When I found out I was going to be a father, I decided I had to man up and accept responsibility and take care of my child. So at 17, I joined the Navy,"" he said. ""It's amazing what a child does to you."" He earned his GED and later attended Miami-Dade Community College and Florida State University. Law school was almost an afterthought. Asked why he decided to go law school at St. Thomas University, he responded, ""a girl."" He had to wait eight years for admission to The Florida Bar, according to public records. A Florida Supreme Court ruling in 2000 highlights the Bar's concerns about ""JAB's"" character and finances, citing his failure to pay child support and other debts and expenditures such as signing up for a gym membership he couldn't afford. (All Bar matters refer to the candidates by their initials, and Baez's struggle with The Florida Bar has been widely reported. He declined to discuss the incident in detail with ""In Session."") While he waited for admission to the bar, he worked as an intern for the Miami-Dade Public Defender's Office, taught lawyers to conduct research and launched four companies, including two that sold bathing suits; Brazilian Bikinis and Bon Bon Bikinis. ""There's no better place for a young lawyer to learn how to be a lawyer than the Miami-Dade Public Defender's Office,"" he said. ""I was surrounded by great lawyers ... There is a culture there of really learning how to fight for your client and if you're not a fighter, then you don't belong there."" He finally was admitted to the bar in 2005, and began to practice in Orlando and nearby Kissimmee, where he lives in a gated community overlooking a golf course and a lake. Before the Anthony case, Baez said, he tried more than 45 cases, including four alleging murder. None of his clients had been convicted of first-degree murder, he boasted. He is most confident about his ability to outwork the opposition. ""If I can do that, then I stand a chance and that is my goal,"" he said during the ""In Session"" interview. Though he has been criticized for the celebratory nature of the defense team's gathering after the verdict -- cameras caught members dancing and drinking champagne -- Baez has mostly avoided the white light of fame. When he first took on the Anthony case and camera crews began staking out his office, he made them park across the street. He said he doesn't watch news reports about his cases anymore. ""You're one day practicing law and you're occasionally on the 11 o'clock news. The next day you're in the middle of this blood sport,"" he said . ""And you become a story."" A lot of times, he added, that story is exaggerated or simply not true. ""I had a stomachache once,"" he recalled. ""I went to the hospital, and it was on the national news the next day that I was freaking out or something along those lines. I think (the reports said) I was caving under pressure and I might be quitting and things like that, and it really was just bad Mexican food."" It is not clear how much he has been paid to represent Anthony, although he could be in line for a percentage of any book or movie deals stemming from the case. Suffice it to say that given the time he has put into the case, his hourly rate dips well below the minimum wage. But he can't put a price on the satisfaction he felt after Casey Anthony was acquitted of murdering her daughter. ""When I get home tonight and my daughter asked what I did today, I can say I saved a life,"" Baez told reporters after the verdict. ""My driving force the last three years has been to make sure there has been justice for Caylee and Casey, because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple.""","Jose Baez wasn't taken seriously until he won acquittals at Casey Anthony's murder trial .

"(CNN) -- Airline industry profits will fall worldwide in 2011, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), thanks to rising fuel prices, political unrest and natural disasters. ""Natural disasters in Japan, unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, plus the sharp rise in oil prices have slashed industry profit expectations to $4 billion this year,"" the association's Director General and CEO Giovanni Bisignani said in a statement released Monday. ""That we are making any money at all in a year with this combination of unprecedented shocks is a result of a very fragile balance."" The main cause of reduced profitability is the high cost of fuel. Airlines pay an additional $1.6 billion in costs for ever dollar increase in the average yearly price of oil, the association said. The industry's fuel bill is expected to rise to $176 billion in 2011, an estimated 30% of airline costs. High fuel costs have also hurt growth rates in both the cargo and passenger markets. The association has revised downward projections for both categories. The group expects the cargo market to expand by only .6% and the passenger market to expand by only 1.2% in 2011. The Japanese earthquake and tsunami will have an impact on carriers in both the Asia-Pacific and North American regions, the association said. However, Asia-Pacific airlines are expected to be the most profitable in 2011. They're forecast to bring in $2.1 billion in profits for the year. That's still a dramatic drop from the $10 billion the region achieved in 2010, according to the association. Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa is hurting profitability in both regions. Profits from Middle East carriers will drop from $900 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011, the group said. And African carriers are expected to post a loss of $100 million in 2011. Unrest in Egypt and Tunisia has had a particular impact because of the large tourism industries in both countries. The debt crisis in Europe has affected carriers there, the association said. Airlines are still expected to post a profit of $500 million this year, down from $1.9 billion in 2010. Profits fell in Latin America as well, from $900 million to $100 million, but the region is the only one in the world that can boast of profitability three years in a row. The association has already downgraded its profit forecast once. In March of this year, the group forecast an $8.6 billion profit forecast. Monday's revision denotes a plunge in profit expectations of 54%. And the modified forecast represents a staggering 78% drop when compared with an $18 billion net profit recorded in 2010, according to the association.","Oil prices, political unrest and natural disasters are to blame for revised numbers .

"Washington (CNN) -- A $413 million judgment against Syria, resulting from a terror group's gruesome murder of two Americans, was upheld Friday by a U.S. federal appeals court. The unanimous ruling was a legal victory for the families of the men, which had sought to hold the Middle Eastern nation accountable for what a district judge concluded was the nation's ""material support"" of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The judges noted the case arose from ""gruesome and memorable facts."" Olin ""Jack"" Armstrong and Jack Hensley were working as military contractors in Iraq when they were abducted in 2004. The group al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility. The group's leader Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi later decapitated the men, a scene captured on videotape and circulated widely on the Internet. Al-Zarqawi was later killed in 2006 by a U.S. airstrike. The separate estates of the two Americans then brought a lawsuit against Syria, which included the country's president and head of military intelligence. The families claimed Syrian officials facilitated the torture and beheadings by providing material support, which federal law says can consist of not only money, weapons and shelter, but also ""advice or assistance."" The issues for the Washington-based appeals court were whether the judges had jurisdiction to hear the dispute, and whether Syria was properly served with the lawsuit. The three-judge panel concluded they indeed had jurisdiction and that ""the families adequately effected service of process against Syria when they first filed suit."" Steven Perles, attorney for the families of Armstrong and Hensley, said in a statement, ""It is our hope that if we can collect on some of this, Syria will realize they must repudiate their support for terrorists and rejoin the civilized world."" Syria has been on the U.S. list of ""state sponsors of terrorism"" since the list's inception in 1979. The State Department's official website says after the 9/11 terror attacks on American soil, Syria ""began limited cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts."" U.S.-based attorneys for Syria had argued ""several procedural, constitutional, and jurisdictional defects"" in the the trial judge's original ruling upholding a default judgment. There was no immediate comment on Friday from Syrian officials or their attorneys. A federal law known at the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act normally protects countries from lawsuits in federal courts. However, exceptions are made, among other things, for state-sponsored torture, hostage-taking charges, extra-judicial killings and aircraft sabotage. The case is Gates v. Syrian Arab Republic (08-7118).","The case stemmed from a terror group's murder of two Americans .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona on Thursday was a swift race through old town for hundreds of runners trying to stay a step ahead of the raging bulls, but just four runners went to the hospital with injuries, officials said. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. A Red Cross official at the scene initially said just one runner went to the hospital, but the Navarra regional government issued a medical report later showing that four male runners were taken to hospitals. The most seriously injured was a 40-year-old Spanish man who suffered broken ribs and a fractured shoulder blade and remained hospitalized later Thursday. The other three were released from the hospital hours after arriving. They included two Spaniards, one with bruised ribs and the other with an eye injury, and a Panamanian man, 35, with a nose injury. Television images showed numerous runners falling hard to the pavement and the bulls trying to step over them. Most of the runners were men, mainly dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but there was also a small number of women. The six bulls were from the Torrestrella breeding ranch and weigh between 470 kgs to 635 kgs (about 1,034 pounds to 1,397 pounds). Accompanied by a pack of tame steers, they exited the corral just 10 seconds after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. They moved quickly along the 825-meter (902 yard) course, and it took two minutes and 30 seconds until the bulls reached the corrals of the bull ring. The bulls face certain death against matadors in a bullfight later in the day. Pamplona's new mayor, Enrique Maya, told TVE  just before the race that he had never run. He said he watched it from one of the numerous balconies along the course, which are filled with local residents or visitors, the latter typically paying top dollar for a safe vantage point. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the nonstop fiesta.","NEW: Four runners go to the hospital with injuries .

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook is doing its very best not to make you terribly sad. You see, it used to constantly show you photos of your ex, which might have reminded you just how great things were before he or she dumped you, but it has stopped that now. Exes no longer show up in the ""Photo Memories"" box. Photo Memories appear in the top right corner of some Facebook pages, including the Friends and Photos sections. They show your friends tagged in photos long-forgotten, but the friends shown are picked using Facebook's algorithm for figuring out whose updates you're most interested in. The exact nature of the algorithm is unclear, but check it out and you'll notice one pattern: It tends to show romantic interests a lot. Is it because you've clicked through their photos before? Because you exchange wall messages? Who knows, but it happens -- and that's all well and good until you break up. Once it's over, though, it can be painful to see all those pictures. Users created a group to protest Photo Memories for that very reason. It caught the attention of not only the media, but of Facebook Photos Project Manager Sam Odio. Yesterday he commented on a post about the issue over at All Facebook, saying, ""I'd like to let you know that we're listening to your feedback. The photo memories product no longer shows tagged photos of your friends if you were previously in a relationship with them."" It's a welcome change, but it doesn't completely solve the problem. What if you never declared a relationship on Facebook? Or what if it's showing you your current squeeze (and it will -- only about 1 in 10 photos the box shows me now are of anyone other than my girlfriend) with one of his or her exes? That's no fun either. We'd love to see a way to tweak exactly who can or can't be seen in this box, but we'll admit most people wouldn't use it. Most people just don't manage their Facebook data that carefully. © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Your exes will no longer show up in your ""Photo Memories"" Facebook box .

"(CNN) -- Germany recorded their first win over Brazil in 18 years in stunning fashion by defeating the five-time world champions 3-2 in Stuttgart. Following a goalless first half, the match burst into life during the second period when Germany took the lead through a 61st minute Bastian Schweinsteiger  penalty, dubiously awarded after Brazilian defender Lucio clipped midfielder Toni Kroos in the box.   Germany soon added a second through 19-year-old prodigy Mario Goetze. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder added to his growing reputation -- German legend Franz Beckenbauer recently described him as the new Lionel Messi -- by scoring an individual effort seven minutes later. Robinho pulled one back from the penalty spot before Schweinsteiger set up Schuerrle for Germany's third. Real Madrid target Neymar hit a late consolation but Germany's young starlets held out for a famous win. Current world champions Spain suffered a shock loss against Italy in Bari. That the result would be considered a shock is perhaps indicative of both team's international trajectories in recent years. Yet roared on by a large, partisan home crowd Italy took an early lead through a deft Riccardo Montolivo chip. The opening exchanges were marred by the early substitution of Fernando Torres, suffering from suspected concussion. A Xabi Alonso penalty before half time brought the scores level. In the second second half Spain looked the more likely to score before fate intervened when Alberto Aquilani's poor shot was fortuitously deflected in. Elsewhere Chile held France to a 1-1 draw in Montpellier. Marseille striker Loic Remy gave Les Bleus the lead before Nicolas Cordova snatched a late draw. The result extended France's unbeaten run under coach Laurent Blanc to ten matches. In Switzerland Ivory Coast overcame a late Israeli fight back to win 4-3, Chelsea's Didier Drogba scoring the fourth goal.   In the night's only competitive fixture Northern Ireland beat the Faroe Islands 4-0 to boost their hopes of qualifying for Euro 2012. Fulham defender Aaron Hughes scored his first international goal before Steve Davis added a second and Paddy McCourt netted twice, lifting Northern Ireland to third in Group C a point behind Slovenia with a game in hand.","Germany beat Brazil 3-2 in Stuttgart .

"(CookingLight.com) -- That bling-worthy lunch tote may pull in the compliments, but sometimes it's hard to feel the love about what's inside, particularly if it's last night's leftovers. Feeling the urge to dine out instead? We've canvassed nutrition numbers at top-selling restaurant chains to zero in on the healthiest options. Our guidelines for good: 600 calories or less; not more than 6 grams saturated fat (the American Heart Association suggests a daily limit of 17g) and about 900 mg sodium or less. 1. Pizza . From its new ""Lighter Options"" line, choose 2 slices of Domino's medium hand tossed Philly Steak Pizza to deliver some skinny pizza numbers: 400 calories, 14 grams fat (6g sat), 840mg sodium. Compare this to individual-sized meat-topped pizzas that ring up double the calories, over 40 grams of fat, a day's worth of saturated fat, and over 2000mg of sodium. Cooking Light: Hot Trend: Restaurant Snack Menus . 2. Asian . Skip the Asian buffets featuring fatty, salty entrees and dine on P.F. Chang's Asian Grilled Salmon Lunch Bowl. This salmon fillet with brown rice sports 320 calories, a skinny five grams of fat (1g sat) and only 570 milligrams of sodium per serving. Round out the meal with a side of garlic snap peas: 64 calories, 2g fat, 107mg sodium. (Note: One dish is two servings). 3. Burger . Here are some scary stats, one burger at a popular restaurant chain has over 3600mg sodium, 100 grams of fat (43g sat), and 1400 calories. That doesn't even include fries! Instead, go for a McDonald's Hamburger at 250 calories, 9 grams of fat (3.5g sat) and 520 milligrams of sodium. At such low numbers, this burger leaves room for a 20-calorie side salad (add a serving of Newman's Own Low Fat Balsamic Vinaigrette for only 40 calories if you prefer) and small fry (230 calories, 11 grams fat (1.5g sat) and 160mg sodium). 4. Salad . Don't assume that a salad is an innocent as it sounds. We found a chicken and spinach salad from a popular chain that has over 1600 calories, 110 grams of fat and a days worth of sodium. Our top salad pick is Atlanta Bread Company's Salsa Fresca Salmon Salad. This corn and black bean salad adds fiber (6 grams) to this 560 calorie main dish salad with an appetite quenching 38 grams of protein, just 4.5 grams of saturated fat and 590 milligrams of sodium. Cooking Light: The Best and Worse Restaurant Salads . 5. Chicken . While their menu sports a lot of grilled items, Wendy's Grilled Chicken Go Wrap is one of the few that's not as high in sodium. Calories are a mere 260 with 10 grams of fat (3.5 g sat) and 750mg sodium. Add a garden side salad (25 calories, 30mg sodium) and a Mandarin Orange Cup (90 calories, 10 grams of sodium). Stay away from the competitors' chicken wraps that sport fried chicken and fatty dressings. 6. Sandwich . Ask for 9-grain wheat bread, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and green peppers and your tab for a Subway 6-inch Oven Roasted Chicken Sandwich is just 320 calories, 4.5 grams fat (1g sat) and 750mg sodium. Added plus: you're getting 5 grams of fiber. When choosing a sandwich, don't be fooled by the ""fresh"" moniker at various restaurants, this may be nothing more than an oversized deli sandwich with more fat and calories than a double bacon cheeseburger. 7. Seafood . Cooked with a lemongrass garlic sauce, one serving of P.F. Chang's Mahi Mahi comes with a side of cilantro rice racking up 420 calories, 17 grams of fat (8g sat) and 605mg sodium, plenty of room to squeeze in a side of vegetables. Watch out for restaurants that offer grilled fish with the intention of being healthy but then pair it with bacon, fatty dressing, and chips. (Note: One dish is two servings). Cooking Light: Healthy Fast Food Drinks . Dining Out Tips . Lunching out with an eye toward eating healthy is tricky business. A chain that delivers a lighter lunch is just as likely to dish up unhealthy fare. And salty items are the norm with most sodium tabs hovering close to 2000 milligrams or more. The best strategy: review nutrition charts, either from onsite brochures or online, before you make a choice. Favorite lunch spot not on our list? Sorry, we had to narrow down our checklist to the top 15 best selling chains.

"(CNN) -- The end of the line for three fugitive siblings came Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado interstate. With guns scattered around their wrecked white Subaru, the suspects made their play. One brother stayed in the car. Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses, only to be picked up after a citizen spotted him, authorities told CNN. The sister, who wrote on her Flickr profile that she liked ""causing mayhem with my siblings,"" tried to reload her automatic pistol, officials said. A police officer shot her in the leg. In custody Wednesday evening, the ""Dougherty family"" survived a dramatic final scene that seemed foreshadowed. ""It was going to happen somewhere,"" Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said. Last week, Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, texted, ""There's a time for all of us to die"" after he was sentenced in Florida on a criminal charge, according to a Florida sheriff's office. With that, authorities said, Ryan Dougherty, sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. According to Taylor, the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. The Colorado Springs Gazette quoted a store employee as saying the three apparently purchased a tent at a recreation supply retailer in the city on Tuesday. Their run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg, authorities said. A deputy spotted the suspect vehicle at a gas station after it left the campground, officials said. It was now bearing Texas tags, Taylor said. Officers were preparing to apprehend the occupants when the car pulled away. A 20-mile high-speed chase ensued. Reaching speeds of more than 100 miles per hour, the fugitives shot at officers, who did not return fire, authorities said. Colorado state troopers deployed a tire-deflation device, and that was the beginning of the end. A MAC-11 machine pistol, a handgun and two AK-47 rifles came flying out when the vehicle flipped and landed on a guard rail, Taylor said. All three of the Doughertys suffered injuries. They were treated and put in custody. They were being held Wednesday evening in Pueblo County as state, federal and local officials discuss when the trio may be returned to Georgia or Florida. The Colorado State Patrol sent a Twitter message indicating each was being charged with four counts of first-degree assault on a police officer. The suspects are wanted for a bank robbery in Valdosta, Georgia, and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. ""I am proud to say today we won,"" said Sheriff Chris Nocco of Pasco County, Florida, where one incident occurred earlier this month. ""The three Doughertys were speeding,"" Nocco told reporters. ""It's ironic they didn't learn their lesson. The Colorado State Patrol attempted to pull them over. In that attempt to pull them over, the Doughertys went back to their MO and started shooting at law enforcement."" On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate issued warrants for the siblings' arrest in connection with the August 2 bank robbery, where an AK-47-type assault rifle and a machine pistol were used. They are also suspects in the attempted murder of a Zephyrhills, Florida, police officer that took place the same day -- but five hours earlier and 200 miles away. The officer wasn't injured, though occupants in the getaway vehicle fired numerous rounds during a chase that reached up to 100 miles per hour, according to the Pasco County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. One round struck a tire, disabling the police vehicle, the sheriff's office said. Since then, the siblings had been the subject of an interstate manhunt, with their faces plastered on hundreds of digital billboards from Florida to Kentucky to Texas. According to a timeline of events that officials provided, Ryan Dougherty was sentenced August 1 in Volusia County, Florida, to 10 years' probation and two years of community control monitoring for convictions on two counts of sending harmful information to a minor. After the sentencing, he sent his mother a text message: ""There's a time for all of us to die,"" according to the sheriff's office. At 6:30 a.m. August 2, a witness saw all three siblings leave in a white four-door vehicle from their Lacoochee home. At 6:59 a.m., Ryan Dougherty cut off his GPS monitoring ankle bracelet near Zephyrhills, the sheriff's office said. At 7:12 a.m. August 2, the shooting with the Florida police officer occurred, after which 20 high-caliber casings were found at the scene, the sheriff's office said. The five-mile pursuit began after the officer tried to pull the vehicle over for speeding on State Road 54 in Zephyrhills, 30 miles northeast of Tampa, authorities said. Then came the armed bank robbery at a CertusBank in Valdosta, at 12:24 p.m. the same day, the FBI said. During that robbery, three people dressed in black with masks entered the bank's front entrance, the FBI said. Shots were fired at the ceiling, and everyone was told to get down, the bureau said. At least two of the robbers were armed, and the third obtained an undisclosed amount of cash, the FBI said. The two brothers have been living in the same rented residence the past three years in Lacoochee, which is located in Pasco County, the sheriff's office said. Their sister, who had been living with her boyfriend in Orlando, just began staying with her brothers, the sheriff's office said. With the most extensive record of the three, Ryan Edward Dougherty has had 14 felony arrests since 2007, including for alleged burglary, destroying evidence and probation violation, according to the sheriff's office. Lee Grace Dougherty's criminal background includes five felony charges. Three of them are pending, all of them hit-and-run offenses in Cocoa Beach, Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's office said. Her record also contains six misdemeanor charges, the sheriff's office said. Dylan Dougherty Stanley's criminal record shows a possession of marijuana charge, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office didn't have information on the disposition of the past charges against the brothers and sister. It released photos of Lee Grace Dougherty, with a description of tattoos. Public information officer Douglas Tobin confirmed the photos were taken from the suspect's Flickr page, which was established in September 2010. Photos, many from March 2011, show Dougherty in various poses. ""I have a huge crazy family. I'm 28 but act like I'm 17 most of the time,"" the profile reads. ""I love to farm and shoot guys and wreck cars. I'm a redneck and proud of it. I like milk and German engineering and causing mayhem with my siblings.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A potential hit list suggesting individuals in U.S. government, industry and the media was posted on jihadi Web forums, according to an FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN. The FBI document was dated June 8 and says ""while the information posted was detailed, it appears aspirational in nature and it is unknown whether the threat will progress beyond discussion"" on the Internet. The bulletin says forum members posted the names of more than 40 people and included photographs for 26 of the suggested targets. The FBI noted there has been an uptick in postings on jihadi sites since Osama bin Laden's death during a U.S. military raid but said this list has ""the most target specific threat postings"" since his demise. The FBI said the list was spurred by a June 3 video featuring American-born al Qaeda propagandist Adam Gadahn ""in which he encourages acts of individual jihad."" The first Web post made note of Gadahn's call for assassinations. That led other forum members to start suggesting possible targets. The man now at the helm of al Qaeda | Video . The web posts include the suggestion to collect photographs as well as home and work addresses for the people on the possible target list. The bulletin says the the list includes target suggestions ranging from U.S.-based think tanks to military contractors. Al Qaeda has used the English-speaking Gadahn in numerous videos. The FBI document notes that in one from March 2010 Gadahn ""called for small attacks in the United States, but failed to have any observable resonance within the online extremist community."" But the bulletin warns bin Laden's death may cause those who share his ideology to be more receptive. A law enforcement official told CNN there is no indication a specific plot exists. The official did not know if all the individuals on the list of possible targets had been briefed by law enforcement or whether they had been given any recommendations to protect their safety. The FBI bulletins are intended for use by law enforcement and homeland security officials.

"(CNN) -- The government shutdown in Minnesota could drag on for days as a spokeswoman for Gov. Mark Dayton said talks probably won't happen until after the July 4 holiday. ""I do not expect formal meetings to resume before Tuesday,"" Katharine Tinucci said in an e-mail Saturday night. The Minnesota government was forced to shut down Friday for the second time in six years after lawmakers failed to reach a budget agreement before a midnight Thursday deadline. That left thousands of people without jobs to go. State parks, the Minnesota Zoo and more than 80 rest stops are among the places shut down. Gov. Mark Dayton held a news conference to announce an impasse in budget talks two hours before the deadline, saying the night was a one of ""deep sorrow for me."" The governor, a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1.9% of Minnesotans, as well as cut spending. Republicans accused the governor of giving up too soon. Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch said in a statement issued by her office Friday that Republicans had ""100 matched"" some of Dayton's funding requests. She called the governor's decision a ""major disappointment."" ""We met several times in order to bridge the gap between our differences over more complicated areas of the budget and left thinking that a budget agreement was imminent,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, Gov. Dayton has chosen to prioritize his rigid, tax-and-spend ideology, rather than prioritize the best interests of Minnesotans."" Republicans had proposed passing a temporary funding bill while they worked out their remaining differences with Dayton. ""This is very disappointing, very disheartening,"" House Speaker Kurt Zellers said after Dayton's news conference. Zellers told reporters that budget talks were much closer than Dayton previously said. The state Democratic-Farmer-Labor party blamed Republicans for the shutdown, accusing them of stubbornly favoring millionaires over other Minnesota residents. ""Minnesotans deserve more than what the GOP has forced upon them with this government shutdown,"" party chair Ken Martin said in a statement. ""Our state's residents deserve much more than the devastating cuts to education, health care, public safety, and other vital services that the Republicans are digging in their heels to enact."" The last government shutdown was in 2005, when Tim Pawlenty was governor. The shutdown means the closure of 46 state boards and agencies, with minimal staffing at 29 others, according to CNN affiliate WCCO. Emergency and disaster agencies, Minnesota State Patrol, the state court system and the prison system are a few of the agencies that will remain open.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea Football Club have agreed a deal with the Belgian club Anderlecht to sign the 18-year-old striker Romelu Lukaku. In a statement, published Saturday, on the West London's club official web site, the move will go ahead ""subject to the player passing a medical and agreeing personal terms."" The four-time champions of England have been linked with the highly-rated striker throughout the summer, but until now the two club's have failed to reach agreement on the player's value. A fee has not yet been disclosed.

"(Oprah.com) -- On a legal pad next to my father's armchair, I see my name in his handwriting. It's between ""Atlanta tickets"" and ""taxes,"" on a list that also includes such excellent questions as ""Sicily?"" and ""wine?"" -- and it's crossed off. And sitting in the half dark, with my own two children asleep in the next room, it occurs to me that the details of parental devotion are nothing you can quite put into words. I mean, you could stand all day in an aisle of Hallmark cards, reading four-line stanzas about paternal strength and character, and plenty would be true enough. ""I was an ungrateful louse, but you still sent me to college -- thanks,"" they assert in various rhyming couplets, with maybe something about ice fishing and neckties. ""You taught me to throw a football; you gave me away at the altar; you left our house with a briefcase every day and we never knew where you were actually going."" Sure. But where's the part about the flush of care you feel when you see your own grown-up self on your dad's to-do list? You worry, you call me, you cross me out. Because as a father there's none more devout . than you, Dad. I would buy that card. Or the one about perching your little-girl self on the closed lid of the toilet to watch your handsome father shave -- his lips pressed together in the mirror while foam disappeared in wide stripes like a mown lawn. Although I would want the card to skip the part about how, years later, your future husband would also use Old Spice, and the clovey smoothness of his cheek against your neck would fan the flames of passion into something more like a bonfire of heebie-jeebies. Oprah.com: The best Father's Day gifts . The same way you felt when you realized that Fleetwood Mac's ""Oh Daddy"" was actually about somebody's lover -- not their dad, like you'd always imagined. Not really about somebody's father. And yet I was exactly the kind of kid who imagined that you grew up and married your own actual dad. (Did he still walk you down the aisle? What did your mom wear? I hadn't worked out the details.) I wandered the house to be wherever he was: on the carpet at his feet while he rattled ice in a glass and shared pretzel Goldfish with me; on a kitchen stool while he soft-boiled eggs; flung across the bed with my chin in my palms while he emptied the pockets of his suit -- subway tokens, handfuls of change, a clacking box of mints. He seemed like a cross between a magician and a billionaire philanthropist. (""Would you like a Tic Tac?"" ""Would I!"") Plus, there was the omniscience. Oprah.com: Are you turning into your father? Even now, if we're heading downtown, he cheerfully shakes open the subway map to show us the L train, to remind us to get off the N before it zooms into Queens. I watch his finger point here and there along the colored veins of the city, and I feel like we'll never be lost; I feel like if we were ever lost he'd come out to Far Rockaway and get us; I'm knocking on 40's door and I have two children of my own and what I feel like is somebody's kid. ""There's a great sushi place near there,"" he might recommend, or ""I would take the Major Deegan,"" and his confidence fills me with something like relief crossed with something that can only be described as a kind of preemptive grief. I want to always feel like somebody's kid. Explain the IRT . To me . Again, Dad. If he was in the shower when we left for school, he drew a circle and a dot on the fogged-up glass of the door for ""goodbye."" If we flew somewhere without him, he met us at the airport, always wearing the same red-and-blue-checked cotton shirt that jellied my knees with the gladness of seeing him again. ""Who do you love most?"" I asked, ""Robert or me?"" And he said, ""Don't be silly -- your mother, of course."" He was not exactly kidding, and we screamed with indignation and glee: Our beautiful mother! We felt the same way! Years later, though, our father would fall unpredictably and somewhat dottily in love with a brown Standard poodle. What a relief to raise a dog after the worry and complexity of children! Or so I imagine. Oprah.com: Books men want . Opinions did not need to be proffered about the dog's tone of voice, length of shorts, or sulky posture at her grandmother's dinner table -- or about how close to her eyeball the dog penciled in a smudge of black liner. The dog needed to be on a leash, sure, but not to keep her from growing up too quickly. And the dog was able to spend her whole life just wagging around our father in her needy way -- ""Look at me! Look at me! I'm your dog! Aren't I great?"" -- without even pretending to mature and make adult conversation. You didn't want me to grow up too quickly . Only now I'm not sure I can at all. Uh-oh, Dad! Oprah.com: Men Who Behave Dadly: The life of the full-time father . These days I watch my own young children with their father. Our daughter rubs her cheek on his and complains dotingly about its roughness; our son curls up in his lap, big-kid legs folded up like a giraffe's.

Years later, maybe they'll roll their eyes when he counts the holes in their earlobes or frets over their berserk finances; maybe they'll rage and rebel and grow more independent than I ever have.

"(CNN) -- U.S. and Mexican search teams scoured the Sea of Cortez for seven Americans still missing after a tourist boat capsized Sunday off the east coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula and killed one American tourist. Visibility was clear and the water was warm in the sea, also called the Gulf of California, but rescuers had not found any survivors since Monday, Coast Guard Lt. Bill Burwell told CNN. However, he remained optimistic. ""If someone is out there, there is a good chance that they are still surviving, and we will keep looking for them,"" he said. The boat was carrying more than 40 people when it capsized. Harry Edwards, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday that so far 19 American passengers have been rescued. But the search continues for seven more American passengers, he said. U.S. authorities identified the killed American as Leslie Yee. Her city of residence was not immediately available, authorities said. ""The State Department expresses its condolences to the victim's family and remains in contact with the survivors and families of the missing,"" the agency said in a statement. There were conflicting numbers on how many people were on the boat when it sank. Mexican authorities counted 43 passengers and crew, while the Coast Guard put the number at 44. One of the surviving tourists is Charles Gibson, the chief of police services at Contra Costa Community College District in California. Gibson is an avid fisherman and has participated in the same deep sea fishing trip several times, said Contra Costa Community College spokesman Tim Leong. Gibson's family has been in contact with him but Leong declined further comment about the circumstances of the incident pending Gibson's return from Mexico. According to the Contra Costa Community College website, Gibson served in the U.S. Navy where he was assigned to the USS Ranger. He served two terms in Vietnam and received the Vietnam Service Medal. Burwell said the Americans had a C-130 aircraft on scene helping with the search, and were plotting the drift from the site of the incident. Mexican authorities also had assets aiding in the search, he said. The C-130 is equipped with survival gear, rafts and electronic sonar that can detect beacons and people in water, said Ron Clark, U.S. Auxiliary Flotilla Commander.  The plane, which will cover a broad swath of the sea in the area, arrived after Coast Guard crews on Monday flew an H-60 Jayhawk helicopter over more than 42 miles of water. The C-130 can fly as low as 1,000 feet and is expected to search for five hours, Clark said. The C-130 and the Mexican navy reported no sightings of the seven missing Americans as of Tuesday afternoon, said Petty Officer 2nd class Levi Read of the Coast Guard. The C-130 has been searching waters around the accident since 2 p.m. ET as Mexican authorities continued their search by helicopter, plane, boats and on-shore vehicles, said Read. All 16 crew members of the Erik survived; another who had been on the list of crew members apparently failed to embark, a Mexican official said, citing passengers' accounts. The Erik sank in the Sea of Cortez, near Isla San Luis, Mexico, east of Baja, at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, the Coast Guard said. ""They ran into some bad weather, capsized, the boat sank,"" said Petty Officer 2nd Class Henry Dunphy, a spokesman for the Coast Guard in San Diego. Several people swam to shore, walked to the nearest town and alerted the Mexican navy to what had happened, he added. But the Mexican navy said it was alerted by the cook of the boat, who was rescued by fishermen along with two passengers. He told officials that 27 tourists had been aboard the Erik when it sank approximately 60 nautical miles south of San Felipe, the navy said in a news release. All the rescued people were in good health and were taken to their hotels, with the exception of one person with diabetes who remained under observation, the navy said. ""We have been working with Mexican navy authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard in the search and rescue,"" Baja Sportfishing Inc. said in an e-mail. ""Right now our main concern is making sure that everyone is accounted for."" The Erik was a 115-foot fishing boat with a 24-foot beam, according to the company's website. ""Built in Holland, she was equipped with stabilizers to handle the turbulent North Sea,"" it said. Later Monday, the website added, ""Due to events occurring at this moment, all further trips are canceled."" Mike Flynn, an advertising representative who had booked the Erik for an excursion in October, said the boat specializes in fishing trips. The boat serves as a ""mother ship"" that carries its passengers out to sea, where they then use smaller boats to fish for the day before returning, Flynn said. The Erik offered three meals a day, showers and other amenities for its guests, he said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Helena DeMoura, Leslie Tripp, Stan Wilson, Sandra Endo and Michael Martinez contributed to this story.","NEW: American victim is identified as Leslie Yee .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to accommodation, Berlin is still the cheapest of the major European capital cities. The Flying Bed room makes for a unique stay at the Propeller Island City Lodge. Although you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise if you stayed at the Ritz-Carlton (Potsdamer Platz 3). With its sumptuous interior and unrestrained opulence it's rivaled only by the glamorous Hotel de Rome (Behrenstrasse 37) when it comes to combining elegance with location. For the aesthete on a budget the Motel One in Alexanderplatz is a stylish option. While lacking some of the amenities you'd find at more expensive hotels, it doesn't compromise on design and the rooms and lobby are discretely minimalist, enlivened with clever splashes of color. The more adventurous traveler may wish to sample the surreal surroundings of the Propeller Island City Lodge (Albrecht-Achilles-Strasse 58). As much a work of art as a hotel, each room has a unique theme, including a room with a flying bed, a room decorated like a prison cell and even a room with coffins for beds. A cheaper, although no less eccentric, option is the Ostel 'design hostel' (Wriezener Karree 5).

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israel Chamber Orchestra performed works of Adolf Hitler's favorite composer Richard Wagner in Germany on Tuesday in the composer's home town of Bayreuth. Israeli orchestras have held back from performing Wagner's music in the past because of its use in Nazi propaganda during World War II . The 19th century composer was known for his anti Semitic views and performances of his music in Israel are considered insensitive to survivors of the Holocaust and many other Israelis. Conductor of the orchestra Roberto Paternostro said on Israeli TV it was time to separate Wagner's world view from his music. ""He was a great composer and the aim in the year 2011 is to divide the man from his art,"" he said. This was the first time an Israeli orchestra played Wagner in Germany. Uri Hanok head of the Holocaust Survivors Union to Prevent the Playing of Wagner, told CNN, ""When I heard that an Israeli orchestra was to play Wagner in Germany I could not sleep. Wagner despised Jews, it was evident in all his writings. While there are still survivors alive, his music should not be played in Israel and certainly not by an Israeli orchestra."" Paternostro said at a news conference, ""There wasn't a moment when I had any doubts about this project it was my greatest conviction to bring these two sides Israel and Wagner together."" Paternostros mother and other relatives were Holocaust survivors. ""I know that in Israel this is not accepted, but many people have told me its time we confront Wagner especially those in the younger generation"" the conductor said. Israel's state owned TV and radio still keep Wagner off the air. In 2001 the world renowned conductor Daniel Barenboim angered many Israelis when he played Wagner's music in Israel.","Conductor says it is time to separate Wagner's world view from his music .

"Washington (CNN) -- Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Oscar-winning movie ""The Hurt Locker"" on the Iraq war, is in the preliminary stages of making a movie about the killing of Osama bin Laden and has gotten access to top White House, Pentagon and CIA officials about the raid. That has Rep. Peter King, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, demanding investigations by the Defense Department and CIA inspectors general into what, if any, classified information about special operations tactics, techniques and procedures were leaked to filmmakers. On Wednesday, the White House called King's claims ""ridiculous."" ""When people, including you in this room, are working on articles, books, documentaries or movies that involve the president ask to speak to administration officials, we do our best to accommodate them to make sure the facts are correct,"" Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. ""We do not discuss classified information, and I would hope as we face a continued threat from terrorism, the House Committee on Homeland Security would have more important topics to discuss than a movie."" Carney said the filmmakers have met with White House officials and that ""the information that this White House has provided about that mission has been focused on the president's role."" ""There is no difference in the information that we have given to anybody that is working on this topic from what we gave to those of you in this room who worked on it in the days and weeks after the raid itself,"" Carney said. ""Someone wrote out a statement for Jay Carney and he has no idea what he talking about,"" King told CNN in an interview. Philip Strub, the Pentagon's director of entertainment media, said he had had one meeting with Bigelow and her team about her movie since bin Laden was killed. That was a preliminary discussion involving Strub, the filmmakers and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, that mostly involved the decision-making process in the Pentagon regarding the raid. ""We go to great lengths not to reveal classified information,"" said Strub, whose main duty is as a liaison with Hollywood. Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Bigelow's team did have other meetings at the Defense Department that did not involve Strub, but they were ordinary script research meetings that the Pentagon provides to established filmmakers on a regular basis. One of the issues that King, R-New York, expressed concern about is that the movie would be released in October 2012, just before President Barack Obama, who gave the order to raid bin Laden's compound, will stand for re-election. The timing of the release three weeks before the election ""puts a cloud over the whole project"" and is ""a breach of faith"" with the military and intelligence community, King said. In a statement issued Wednesday, filmmakers Bigelow and Mark Boal denied any political motivation in a project that began years ago. ""Our upcoming film project about the decade-long pursuit of bin Laden has been in the works for many years and integrates the collective efforts of three administrations, including those of Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama, as well as the cooperative strategies and implementation by the Department of Defense and the CIA,"" the filmmakers said. ""Indeed, the dangerous work of finding the world's most wanted man was carried out by individuals in the military and intelligence communities who put their lives at risk for the greater good without regard for political affiliation. This was an American triumph, both heroic and nonpartisan, and there is no basis to suggest that our film will represent this enormous victory otherwise,"" the statement said. The CIA issued a statement about its role in helping moviemakers, saying such public outreach has gone on for years. ""Our goal is an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, their vital mission and the commitment to public service that defines them,"" the CIA statement said. There was a CIA ceremony on June 29 in recognition of all those who assisted in the bin Laden raid, but the CIA would not say if any of the filmmakers were among the nearly 1,300 people in attendance.","NEW: GOP Rep.

"(CNN) -- Aruban authorities said Wednesday they will analyze a rental car, electronic devices and the answers of a man termed the prime suspect in the disappearance of an American woman. Robyn Gardner, 35, of Maryland, was last seen August 2 near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island, said Ann Angela, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office. Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein said no witnesses have come forward to say they saw Gardner and Gary Giordano snorkeling off Baby Beach. Witnesses have said they saw the couple on the beach. Authorities have impounded a rental car and electronic devices in Giordano's possession, Stein said. Angela said her office could only identify the suspect publicly by his initials: GVG. ""He is suspected of involvement in the disappearance of Miss Gardner,"" Angela said, adding that the man is a 50-year-old U.S. citizen. The prosecutor's office released a statement later Tuesday that provided some detail. The suspect told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner behind Nanki Country Club when he signaled to her to swim back, the statement read. When the man reached the beach, the woman was nowhere to be found, he allegedly told them. ""The statements made by the traveling companion led to such questions that on Friday, August 5, 2011, it was decided to detain him for further questioning on the possible drowning of the woman,"" the prosecutor's office said in the statement. Michael Lopez, Giordano's attorney, said Tuesday his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. Lopez told reporters that his client has been cooperating with police. Lopez said that on his client's last scheduled day in Aruba, he asked authorities if he needed to stay. ""They didn't answer it, and on his way to the airport, they detained him as a suspect for murder,"" Lopez said. Angela would not say what evidence led authorities to suspect his involvement in Gardner's disappearance. After finding no trace of Gardner, authorities stopped their active search for her on Saturday and are now searching ""passively,"" Angela said. Police helicopters and search and rescue officials are keeping their eyes out for any clues to her disappearance, ""but it's not an active search anymore,"" she said. Richard Forester, also of Maryland, told CNN he and Gardner have been dating for the past seven or eight months. He told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday evening that Gardner wasn't the type to go into deep water, and would more likely stay by the pool. ""It's just not her to go out and snorkel,"" Forester said. Forester said Tuesday that before Gardner's trip, the two argued over ""the circumstances of her travel"" to Aruba. He last heard from her on August 2 in a Facebook message, in which she said they would ""work it out"" when she got back. Earlier that day, Forester said, Gardner posted on her Facebook wall ""this sucks,"" with no further explanation. She was scheduled to return to the United States on August 4, Forester said. The Natalee Holloway Resource Center -- named after a young American woman whose disappearance in Aruba made international news -- said Forester brought their attention to the case Monday. ""Gardner is described as 5 feet 5 inches and 120 pounds, with blond hair and brown eyes,"" the center said in a news release. ""She has tattoos on her left arm (back of her shoulder to her elbow), her rib cage, and her right bicep. Friends and family members are pleading with the public to help bring her home.""

"(CNN) -- Clashes in Syria's streets have led to the deaths of 11 civilians since Friday, according to Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a dissident group. The organization said the deaths came during the violent government crackdown on protests that have sprung up in various cities including Aleppo, Deir Azzor, Daeel and Douma. CNN cannot independently verify the claim, and a government response was not immediately available. Government officials blamed the some of the violence on ""terrorists,"" according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). SANA reported Tuesday that the ""terrorists"" killed three security officials and two civilians. The dissident group said there have been mass arrests by the government in an attempt to quell protests. But protests have continued, according to videos posted on YouTube, which purports to show large crowds of women gathering in various cities Monday night calling for the release of detained family members. Another video shows a funeral Tuesday of a person allegedly killed by security forces. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of those videos. The unrest in Syria began in mid-March after teens were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in the southern city of Daraa, according to Amnesty International. As the clashes intensified, demonstrators changed their demands, from calls for freedom and an end to abuses by the security forces to calls for the regime's overthrow. The United States released a strongly worded statement Monday condemning the ongoing violence in Syria and accusing the government of targeting civilians. ""The behavior of Syria's security forces, including other such barbaric shootings, wide-scale arrests of young men and boys, brutal torture, and other abuses of basic human rights, is reprehensible,"" the U.S. State Department statement said.

"(CNN) -- Wladimir Klitschko dominated his world heavyweight title unification match against Britain's David Haye to clinch a unanimous points decision in their bout Saturday night in Hamburg, Germany. The giant Ukrainian retained his IBF and WBO versions of the title and claimed Haye's WBA crown after a polished display over 12 rounds in the Imtech Arena of Bundesliga side SV Hamburg. Klitschko got the verdict of the three ringside judges by large margins of 117-109, 118-108 and 116-110. It was the second defeat of 31-year-old Haye's 27-fight career, most of it at cruiserweight before stepping up a division for his last five fights. The wily, 35-year-old Klitschko, who took his record to 56-3, used his extra weight and reach advantage to good effect as his jab kept his opponent at bay. He managed to avoid Haye's desperate attempts to bring the fight to a swifter conclusion and scored the only knockdown of the fight in the 11th round, although the Briton was swiftly to his feet after what appeared to be a push. The bout was held in heavy rain, the fighters largely protected by the design of the arena, but it would have doused the spirits of the large British contingent in the 45,000 crowd who had traveled to the northern German port city to cheer on their hero. The victory leaves all the recognized versions of the world heavyweight boxing title with the Klitschko brothers, with Vitali holding the prestigious WBC version. The pre-fight proceedings had been marked by animosity between both men, who had been due to fight two years ago until Haye pulled out with a back injury. After the fight he revealed he had broken his right toe in training, but had decided to go ahead with the bout, which ultimately ended with a disappointing defeat.","Wladimir Klitschko beats David Haye in the world heavyweight title unification bout .

Stephano Khalil Mohamed Atteya, or Nikko as he is called by his family, went to Egypt with his mother and her sister to visit his father, who lives there, according to a missing person report from the Pennsylvania State Police in Harrisburg. The boy was last seen August 1 with his father, the boy's family said. The father sped off with the boy in a car after forcing the boy's mother and aunt from the car, the family said. ""They heard (Nikko) screaming from the window, calling for his mom,"" said Nikko's aunt, Olga Panagos, who lives in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. ""That's the last time they saw him."" Nikko's father, an Egyptian citizen, requested that his son come to Egypt to meet his grandmother and attend his father's sister's wedding, American relatives said. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is working with Nikko's mother, who is still in Cairo, and with local authorities to help locate the boy, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Colton. The boy's parents were married in 1999 and divorced in 2005; Nikko was their only child together and was born in the United States, according to Panagos. ""The family is very stressed. We have no idea where Nikko is,"" Panagos said. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, also is working with the family to provide any appropriate assistance, according to Casey spokeswoman April Melody. CNN's Leigh Remizowski, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","An embassy official in Egypt says U.S. authorities are working with the boy's mother .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony responded sarcastically when her mother brought up media accounts then circulating about the possibility that 2-year-old Caylee Anthony had drowned in the family pool, according to a recording of a jailhouse conversation shown to jurors on Friday. ""Surprise, surprise,"" Anthony said of the rumor, which is now the primary defense theory in her capital murder trial in Orlando, Florida. In recordings of visits played Friday for the jury, Anthony frequently accused the media of failing to accurately report on the case. Prosecutors say Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape on her nose and mouth to suffocate her. The Orlando woman's attorneys say Caylee drowned in the family pool on June 16, 2008. They say Anthony and her father panicked and covered up the death. George Anthony denied the claim during his testimony last week. The videotaped exchange, during which Anthony became agitated with her parents as they pressed her for details of Caylee's whereabouts, was one in a series shown to jurors the past two days. ""We need to have something to go on,"" Cindy Anthony pleaded during the visit. ""Mom, I'm sorry. I don't have anything,"" Casey Anthony angrily replied. 'I've been here a month. Do you understand how I feel?"" In the videos shown to jurors on Friday, Anthony repeatedly expresses frustration at being jailed and her inability to offer additional help in the search for her daughter. ""I'm not in control over any of this 'cause I don't know what's going on,"" she said in one exchange. ""My entire life has been taken from me. You don't understand. I don't have any answers because I don't know what's going on. I can't even say anything to you guys. I want Caylee and that's not even getting put on the air, which it should be."" Then Cindy Anthony asks her daughter if searchers should be looking for anything in Lake County, Florida. That prompts Casey Anthony to threaten to hang up the phone. ""This is the first time I've truly been angry the entire time,"" she said. ""I'm frustrated beyond belief."" She also complains about her isolation. ""You guys still have each other to lean on,"" Anthony told her parents. ""I don't have anybody."" In another video that opened the day's evidence, Anthony praised her parents and said she just wanted to be home with them and her daughter. ""I know we're going to see Caylee. I know she's coming home. I can feel it,"" Anthony said during the tearful visit recorded in 2008. Caylee was reported missing on July 15, a month after she was last seen by her family. Her skeletal remains were found in December of 2008 not far from the Anthony home. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty and denied harming her daughter or having anything to do with the little girl's disappearance. In testimony offered Friday, an Orange County sheriff's detective and a missing persons investigator spoke about collecting evidence from the Anthony home and an impound lot where Anthony's Pontiac Sunfire had been towed, and two crime scene investigators discussed mostly technical aspects of collecting evidence. But crime scene investigator Gerardo Bloise also said that when he opened the car's door to begin documenting the evidence contained inside, ""I immediately smelled the odor of decomposition."" Anthony's father, mother and brother, as well as a tow-yard manager previously testified smelling that type of odor coming from the car. Bloise later said the odor was, in his opinion, likely the smell of human decomposition, though during questioning from the defense he admitted it could also have been caused by an animal. According to evidence in the case, Anthony once claimed the car had part of an animal lodged in the undercarriage. Bloise said he found no animal carcasses on the underside of the car. ""I know that smell from a decomposed body because that smell is unique. Once you smell it, you will never forget,"" Bloise said. He also testified he found a human hair in the trunk. Authorities have previously disclosed that a hair sample collected from the trunk showed evidence of decomposition. On Thursday, jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits during which Anthony gave visitors information about the nanny she claimed kidnapped the girl. ""If you can speak to the media directly, my concern for me is Caylee,"" a tearful Anthony tells her brother, Lee Anthony, on July 25, 2008, from an Orange County jail. They also heard a recording of a police interview in which she admitted misleading investigators while still maintaining her daughter had been kidnapped. In the interview, investigators pleaded with Anthony to tell the truth about what happened to Caylee. ""None of us are sitting here believing what you're saying because everything that's coming out of your mouth is a lie,"" Detective Yuri Melich told Anthony during the interview. Another investigator accused her of not telling the truth. ""If the main thing you want to do is find your daughter, and you don't think lying to us is going to help find her, why would you do that?"" investigator Sgt. John Allen asked on the tape. ""Because I'm scared and I -- I know I'm running out of options,"" Anthony said. ""It's been a month. ... I'm scared of not seeing my daughter ever again."" Prosecutors allege Anthony was not looking for her daughter during the month she was missing. Instead, she was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with numerous friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, including participating in a ""hot body"" contest, according to evidence in the case. Her former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor. Anthony's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following Caylee's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had taught to conceal her pain. George Anthony has denied abusing his daughter. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- Top seed Gael Monfils saved a match point before edging past American John Isner to reach the final of the Legg Mason Classic in Washington on Saturday. The 24-year-old Frenchman, who has won three career ATP Tour titles but only one outside his native country, now has an opportunity to double that statistic after winning 6-4 3-6 7-6 in a match that finished at 01:15am local time following two rain delays. ""It was really tough to deal with -- to go on court then come back again. The weather was just like Wimbledon,"" Monfils told the official ATP Tour website. The greatest match in tennis history . He added: ""I have had a tough year. I had an injury and a new coach, so to come up strong again feels good."" Monfils will face Czech Radek Stepanek, the oldest player in the world's top 100, in the final. The 32-year-old Stepanek, world-ranked 54, sealed his place with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 success over American Donald Young. ""It has been a year and a half since I was in a final, so definitely I'm very pleased about that,"" said Stepanek, who has won four career titles but has not reached a final since losing to Andy Roddick in Brisbane last year. Meanwhile, top seed Vera Zvonareva will face third seed Agnieszka Radwanska in the final of the WTA Carlsbad event in San Diego, California, but both players had to come back from dropping their opening sets to progress. Russian Zvonareva was pushed all the way by former world number one Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, taking two-and-a-half hours to claim a 5-7 6-4 6-4 success. Meanwhile, Pole Radwanska looked to be heading out against second seed Andrea Petkovic. However, the German was then hampered by a stomach virus, and Radwanska fought back to progress 4-6 6-0 6-4. ""I ate something wrong for lunch. I originally thought it was just a lack of energy, so I had a banana and thought it was going to get better, but actually it felt much worse,"" Petkovic told the official WTA Tour website. Radwanska, who has been suffering from a shoulder injury, last reached a final when losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova here last year. Meanwhile, Petkovic will move into the world's top 10 for the first time in her career on Monday, replacing Australian Samantha Stosur, despite her defeat.","Gael Monfils saves a match point before reaching Legg Mason Classic final .

"(CNN) -- A top judge has issued a special plea to the four suspects named in the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri killing to come before the court. Judge Antonio Cassese, the president of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, said in an open letter to the four men accused in the 2005 attack that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or even participate in the trial proceedings without being present. Cassese issued the statement after Lebanese authorities told him they have been unable so far to serve warrants on and arrest the accused. ""We will conduct trials based on a firm presumption of innocence of the accused. The Tribunal shall never convict anybody unless guilt is established beyond any reasonable doubt,"" he said. Arrest warrants were issued for Salim Jamil Ayyash, Mustafa Amine Badreddine, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, and Assad Hassan Sabra. A highly placed source in the Lebanese army, who had correctly given CNN the names of the suspects previously, has said that all four belong to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group. Hariri, a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician, died when his motorcade was hit by a bomb in Beirut on February 14, 2005. Supporters say he was killed because of his opposition to Syrian influence in Lebanon. His death prompted mass protests that led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, who had been in the country for nearly 30 years. Cassese defended the tribunal, saying its personnel ""are doing their job with full independence and impartiality."" ""We are only acting in the interest of Lebanon; our only motivation is the pursuit of justice. Our exclusive aim is to find the truth about the assassination of 14 February 2005 and other possibly connected criminal cases, while upholding the highest international standards of criminal law."" The judge said that if the accused don't wish to come before the tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands, they can participate by video link. Cassese said the tribunal ""will appoint the best professionals to represent them in court"" in their absence. But he urged them to appoint legal counsel and pass along instructions to them, even if they choose not to appear before the court. ""If you believe this Tribunal is illegal or illegitimate, argue this point through legal counsel chosen by you -- you will thus have your voice heard on this issue. Use your counsel to make your case and zealously protect your rights."" If they can't afford lawyers, tribunal funds are available for hiring legal counsel. ""The march to justice is inexorable, and one way or another we will end up with a trial. I therefore strongly appeal to the accused to take advantage of the broad legal possibilities offered by our Rules of Procedure and Evidence, thereby contributing to the establishment of truth and the conduct of fair proceedings,"" he said. As for Lebanese authorities, the judge said he's hopeful they will ""persist in their search for the accused.""","The four suspects are said to be members of Hezbollah .

"(CNN) -- A brutal mauling by a friend's pet chimpanzee left Charla Nash without a nose, eyelids, lips or hands. Police initially couldn't determine her gender. Doctors weren't sure if she would survive. Now, more than two years later, physicians at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston have released the first post-surgery pictures of Nash since she received a full face transplant in May. ""These professionals first saved my life, then healed my wounds and strengthened me to face an uncertain future,"" Nash said in a statement Thursday. ""I will now be able to do things I once took for granted ... I will have lips and will speak clearly once again. I will be able to kiss and hug loved ones. I am tremendously grateful to the donor and her family."" Doctors who performed the surgery called Nash courageous. ""She inspired the team to do everything possible, using our collective expertise, to restore her quality of life,"" said Plastic Surgery Transplantation Director Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, after the surgery. In February 2009, Nash was helping a friend coax her 14-year-old pet chimp, Travis, back into the house. When Nash arrived, the chimp, who had been featured in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her. Police later shot Travis to stop the attack and he died of gunshot wounds. The unprovoked attack sparked outrage from both animal rights activists and Congress which swiftly passed a bill prohibiting the purchase and transportation of primates across state lines. Nash remained in critical condition for months and was moved to Brigham and Women's Hospital in June 2010, where she became the third person to receive a full face transplant at the hospital. Doctors also successfully attached two new hands, but a few days later Nash became sick and the hands were removed. Nash called the loss a ""bump"" in the road to her recovery. ""I was given the chance to restore most of what I lost by coming to Brigham and Women's Hospital,"" she said. ""Here, I received a new face ... that will allow me to be independent again and able to be a part of society."" Her new face, she said, has brought her back to life.","Charla Nash is the third person to receive a full face transplant .

"(CNN) -- Former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann made his first public appearance as coach of the U.S. men's soccer team, and immediately vowed to bring some style to the job. Klinsmann, who won the 1990 World Cup as a player and took the German national team to the semi-finals of the 2006 tournament, was announced as Bob Bradley's replacement on Friday, 24-hours after the American was sacked. Monday saw the former striker, who enjoyed successful spells as a player at Tottenham Hotspur, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan, face the press for the first time as he set out his agenda for the national team. ""This is exciting,"" he told reporters. ""One of my challenges will be to find a way to define how the U.S. represents its country and its style of play."" As well as defining a new style for the U.S. national team, Klinsmann promised to look far and wide to uncover new talent, delving into America's soccer-crazy immigrant communities to unearth an American Lionel Messi. ""We need to dig into where to find more talent,"" he said. ""Maybe we can find somebody kicking the ball around the street and develop him, but this will come with time. I hope we find a way to find a Lionel Messi in the United States. That would be awesome."" Klinsmann is no stranger to the country. The 47-year-old, who lives in California and has an American wife, was linked to the post on two previous occasions and has seen U.S. soccer grow up fast in recent years. ""You build on what was built before. Soccer in the USA has come a long way,"" he said. ""The awareness is getting bigger and bigger. It's growing. You can't stop soccer any more in the country...It's amazing to talk to foreign coaches about what's happened in the USA. They admire how far soccer has come."" The new coach won't have long to get settled in to the job. His first match in charge will be a friendly against rivals Mexico on August 10. The two last faced each other at the CONCACAF Gold Cup final in June. Despite going into a 2-0 lead, the U.S. lost 4-2. It was Bradley's last match as coach.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Barefoot Bandit"" Colton Harris-Moore has sold the movie rights to his life story to 20th Century Fox, a studio spokesman said Thursday. The Fox spokesman, however, said reports the studio paid $1.3 million for the right were ""highly exaggerated."" Harris-Moore, 20, was a teenager when he took a two-year joy ride running from the cops, which ended last year with his arrest in the Bahamas. As part of a plea deal, Harris-Moore agreed to give up any profits that may come from book or movie deals on his story. His attorney, John Henry Browne, has said his client wants any such money to go to the victims. Harris-Moore is estimated to owe more than $1.4 million in restitution. Harris-Moore led law enforcement on a wild ride across nine states and three countries. He stole, flew and crashed five airplanes. His final journey took him across eight states, leaving behind a trail of home and business break-ins and stolen cars. Surveillance video shows him taking off in a stolen plane from Bloomington, Indiana, heading to the Bahamas. Harris-Moore lasted a few more days before police stopped him by shooting up a stolen boat while Harris-Moore was stuck on a sand bar. Harris-Moore's plea deal is expected to result in a 10-year prison term when he is sentenced in late October. He also faces an assortment of state charges. CNN's Ted Rowlands and Matthew Carey contributed to this report.","20th Century Fox disputes reports it paid $1.3 million for movie rights .

"(CNN) -- Qantas has reached a settlement with engine-maker Rolls Royce over a 2010 incident that grounded its entire Airbus A380 fleet. Rolls-Royce agreed to compensate the airline in a deal worth US $100 million, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said at a news conference. The deal was signed Wednesday morning and the terms will be kept confidential, according to Joyce. The settlement brings to an end the legal action between the two parties, Qantas said. The failure of a Rolls-Royce engine in early November resulted in an emergency landing of a Qantas passenger plane at Singapore's Changi Airport. The flight, carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew, was Australia-bound from Singapore when a fire on the plane's No. 2 engine not only caused half of the engine casing to fall off in flight, but it also damaged the aircraft's electrical wiring. Investigators blamed the fire on a potential manufacturing defect in the type of engine that caught fire -- a Trent 900 engine manufactured by Rolls-Royce. The incident caused the airline to ground its six A380s for more than three weeks. At Wednesday's news conference, Joyce also updated the company's financial outlook, forecasting annual profit before tax of between US $530 million to $580 million, despite a major impact from weather events and natural disasters. The airline has lost an estimated $219 million due to the Japan earthquake and tsunami, Queensland floods, Cyclones Yasi and Carlos, and the Christchurch earthquake. The Rolls-Royce settlement was included in the profit outlook. Joyce addressed the struggle of Australia's flagship carrier to turnaround its international business which hasn't kept pace with competitors, alluding that major changes will be made later this year. ""The task must be to transition a great airline into a great business,"" he said. A major announcement on the future of the international business will be made on August 24.","Rolls-Royce agrees to compensate Qantas $100 million .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military has launched a fresh offensive against militants in its tribal region, the country's top military spokesman said Monday. The offensive is targeting militants in Kurram, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said. He gave no further details. Pakistani security forces have conducted operations in Kurram as far back as 2009, but this appears to be the largest. A Pakistani military official said air force fighter jets were ""softening"" targets on the ground to open the way for ground troops. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media on the record. Thousands of troops are taking part in the operation, according to two officials who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The offensive coincides with several others taking place in Pakistan's tribal region and is likely to please U.S. officials who are pressing Pakistan to do more in the fight against militancy. The military has launched more than 10 offensives against violent extremists in northwest Pakistan in recent years, but for the United States, what matters most is North Waziristan, which U.S. officials call an epicenter of terrorism and a haven for the Haqqani network and other al Qaeda-linked militants killing American troops across the border in Afghanistan. Washington has pressured Pakistan to launch a major offensive in North Waziristan, but the Pakistani military has refused. Some U.S. officials fear that the army here has held off because Pakistan's spy agencies have links with militant groups in North Waziristan. Kurram is just north of North Waziristan and is believed to be a destination for many militants escaping other offensives in the region. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: The offensive is targeting militants in Kurram, a military spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal made a safe transition to grass by reaching the third round at Queen's just three days after his sixth French Open triumph. The Spaniard beat Roger Federer at Roland Garros on Sunday to seal his tenth Grand Slam title and negotiated his way to a 6-4 6-4 victory over Australian qualifier Matthew Ebden in London. Nadal, who is preparing to defend the Wimbledon title he won last year by beating Tomas Berdych, showed signs of fatigue in his straight sets victory as he booked a clash with Radek Stepanek.

"(CNN) -- Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal has announced he is retiring from basketball after a 19-year career in the sport. The 39-year-old posted a link to a video on his Twitter account that confirmed he is to hang up his boots. In a brief message he said: ""We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon."" O'Neal has been dogged by injuries in the latter stages of his career and played only 37 games for the Boston Celtics this season after struggling with an Achilles tendon problem. He returned for two playoff games against the Miami Heat but managed just 12 minutes, and he told an ESPN reporter that he didn't want to let Celtics fans down. He was quoted by AFP as saying: ""I really thought about coming back but this Achilles is very damaged and if I had it done the recovery would be so long we'd have the same outcome as this last year -- everyone sitting around and waiting for me. ""I didn't want to let people down two years in a row. I didn't want to hold Boston hostage again. ""I'm letting everybody know now so the organization can try to get younger talent. I would love to come back, but they say once the Achilles is damaged it's never the same. I don't want to take that chance.""

"(Mental Floss.com) -- With the season of backyard barbecues upon us, we thought you could use a history lesson on everyone's favorite lawn ornament. From the plastic bird's birth to its modern perch atop the pyramid of campy Americana, here's the quick-and-dirty on the hot pink queen of kitsch. Birth of a national icon . Perhaps not shockingly, the pink flamingo lawn ornament was invented in the same decade that polyester pants, pink washing machines, vinyl wallpaper and Naugahyde lounge chairs were cool. Flamingo fans worldwide owe their thanks to a man named Don Featherstone a one-time employee of a plastics company called Union Products, who designed the first pink flamingo lawn ornament in 1957. When they first hit stores, the blushing birds cost $2.76 a pair and were an immediate hit in working-class subdivisions from the Redwood Forest to the Gulfstream waters. This bird was made for you and me. A (brief) fall from grace . The 1960s were a decade of backlash against conformity, false experience, and all things Parental -- including, evidently, Mom and Dad's lawn décor. Hippies rallied against the plastics industry, cultural critics chastised all things ""un-natural,"" and home and garden magazines pleaded with people to abandon the gnomes, lawn jockeys and flamingos of yesteryear in favor of classier, more natural yard décor. By 1970, even Sears had stopped selling the pink flamingo, replacing the gaping hole in their garden department with natural-looking fountains and rocks, according to the historian Jennifer Price. Her book, ""Flight Maps"" (Basic Books, 1999), has a chapter on the plastic flamingo. It's a must-read for flamingo aficionados. Mental Floss.com: Itsy-bitsy bikini trivia . And she's back! Happily for flamingo fans, the '70s were a carnival of schlock, and by the early part of the decade, the pink flamingo had become so un-cool, it was cool again -- this time as a self-conscious symbol of rebellion, outrageousness and all things Bad Taste. By the time John Waters' movie, Pink Flamingos, hit theaters in 1972, the bird had fully transitioned to the realm of ironic kitsch. Gay bars used them as mascots, transvestites sported them on earrings and platform pumps, and in 1979, students from the University of Wisconsin-Madison planted 1,008 of the two-legged creatures in the grass in front of the dean's office, earning them -- and the bird -- a place in Wisconsin's State Historical Society. Mental Floss.com: Netflix envelope art . Pink is the new art . By the 1980s, the pink flamingo had made the ultimate giant leap for mankind: it had, like Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup cans, become art. In 1987, the governor of Massachusetts proclaimed the plastic bird ""an essential contribution to American folk art,"" Price wrote, and new clubs like the Flamingo Fanciers of America and the International Society for the Preservation of Pink Lawn Flamingos sprang into existence in time to celebrate the bird's thirtieth birthday. In 1998, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles began to sell plastic pink flamingos in its bookstore for $19 a set. Long live the Queen of Camp . In 2009, in honor of the students' 1979 prank, the Madison, Wisconsin, city council named the plastic pink flamingo the official bird of the city. And the esteemed lawn ornament lives on in Americana infamy, lending its name to bars, restaurants, casinos and hotels from sea to shining sea.

"New York (CNN) -- French financier Dominique Strauss-Kahn will not accept any plea bargain and ""won't plead guilty to anything"" in the sex crimes case against him, one of his attorneys told CNN on Thursday. Attorney William Taylor made the remarks a day after Strauss-Kahn's legal team met with prosecutors in the case for nearly two hours. It's not known if any plea deal was offered. The meeting came about a week after Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. acknowledged that there are questions about the credibility of Strauss-Kahn's accuser. The 62-year-old former chief of the International Monetary Fund is charged with sexual abuse and attempted rape of a hotel maid in May. While Wednesday's meeting with prosecutors was ""constructive,"" Strauss-Kahn's attorneys said, prosecutors maintained that they are not ready to drop the charges. ""The investigative process is continuing, and no decisions have been made,"" said Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Erin Duggan. The accuser's civil attorney has called on Vance to recuse himself from prosecuting the case and appoint a special prosecutor. ""We make this request in order to protect the integrity of the prosecution of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, to ensure the victim's rights are not further prejudiced by deliberate acts seeking to undermine her credibility, to insulate your office from the appearance of conflict of interest, and to ensure that future victims of sex crimes, regardless of their backgrounds, are not dissuaded from coming forward,"" attorney Kenneth P. Thompson wrote in a four-page letter to Vance. But Duggan said Vance will not recuse himself. ""Any suggestion that this office should be recused is wholly without merit,"" she said in a statement. Thompson told CNN his client has admitted mistakes, but says that has nothing to do with what happened in Strauss-Kahn's hotel suite. ""Despite everything,"" he told CNN Tuesday, ""she wants to get on the witness stand. That's all she asks for."" Last week, Vance indicated that the 32-year-old accuser had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack May 14 at the Sofitel hotel. Thompson said Wednesday that Vance's office ""apparently has been responsible"" for leaks to the news media ""that were intended to discredit the victim's character and, perhaps most importantly, undermine her charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn."" He cited a telephone call he received June 30 from Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel R. Alonso, informing him of the prosecutor's decision to turn over to the defense ""certain false statements"" that the victim had made to investigators. During the call, he said Alonso told him about an audio recording obtained by the prosecution in which the alleged victim told a boyfriend jailed in Arizona a day after the alleged attack ""about the possible benefits"" of pursuing charges against Strauss-Kahn. ""When I asked Mr. Alonso specifically about what the victim had allegedly said during that conversation, he stated that the victim said 'words to the effect' that 'this guy has a lot of money. I know what I'm doing.'"" Thompson said that Alonso then agreed to turn over a copy of the recording or allow him and the alleged victim to listen to it but, more than six days later, had failed to do so. ""I am told by Mr. Alonso that the victim must now wait for the prosecutor's interpreter to prepare a complete transcript of it,"" Thompson wrote. He went on to complain that, within a few hours of that call, The New York Times reported on the ""alleged conversation with the incarcerated individual,"" in an article that cited ""'two well-placed law enforcement officials.'"" Thompson said he believes those officials work for Vance. The alleged victim, meanwhile, has filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute, according to court filings. The Post said it stands by its reporting. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that so far, ""no evidence has been found that she is a prostitute."" The developments in New York come as Strauss-Kahn faces separate accusations of attempted rape in France, which were filed in a complaint by French writer Tristane Banon. A Strauss-Kahn lawyer in France said he has filed a counterclaim against Banon for ""false declarations."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn won't plead guilty to anything, his attorney said .

"Washington (CNN) -- The initial review of the materials confiscated from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan has found mostly ""aspirational"" planning but has yielded ""real intelligence,"" according to a U.S. official. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said it is still very early in the review, and there are still a lot of data to sort through to determine whether there are any concrete plots. The special task force set up to examine the data has two initial goals, according to the official: check to see whether there are any imminent threats against the U.S. and find leads to other terrorists or plots. The reviewing team is running around the clock, according to the official. The task force assigned to scour the seized material is run by the CIA, with dozens of representatives from throughout the intelligence community working 24/7, searching for clues. Most of the team is poring over the digital, audio and video files as well as printed and handwritten materials from an undisclosed location in the Washington area, but some of the members are participating virtually. The effort to decipher the data is time-consuming because much of it has to be translated, some is handwritten, and large digital files have to be transferred. A senior U.S. intelligence official said Saturday that the materials seen so far appeared to show that bin Laden had a ""continuing interest in transportation and infrastructure targets."" But there is no indication of any specific plot to attack those targets. The senior official said the U.S. believes that the bin Laden compound was in effect a command and control center for al Qaeda because the confiscated materials ""clearly show that bin Laden remained an active leader in al Qaeda, providing strategic, operational and tactical instructions to the group. Though separated from many al Qaeda members who are located in more remote areas of the region, he was far from a figurehead."" According to the first U.S. official, there is ""real intelligence coming out of this."" The official said the intelligence community expects to gain insights into how al Qaeda operated. ""We expect to learn more how bin Laden communicated, who he communicated with and how often he did it, what guidance did he pass on, what questions were passed on, how he operated, how he ran al Qaeda and what did other people expect from bin Laden,"" said the official. At some point, the U.S. expects to share some of what it is learning with other relevant nations and parties who might be able to exploit it further, but until they know more about what they have, the official said it's too early for an exchange of information.","Initial review of materials taken from compound has found mostly ""aspirational"" planning .

"(CNN) -- Texas authorities are urging residents not to cross into the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo during the Fourth of July weekend because of intelligence that a Mexican drug cartel plans to target U.S. citizens. The violent Zetas drug cartel, which operates in Nuevo Laredo, will be targeting crimes at Americans who cross the border into the city this weekend, the Texas Department of Public Safety and Webb County Sheriff's Office said Saturday. ""According to the information we have received, the Zetas are planning a possible surge in criminal activity, such as robberies, extortions, car-jackings and vehicle theft, specifically against U.S. citizens,"" DPS Director Steven McCraw said in a statement. ""We urge U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Nuevo Laredo this weekend if it can be avoided."" Nuevo Laredo is across the border from Laredo, Texas, a city which bills itself as the ""Gateway to Mexico."" Four international bridges link Texas and Mexico at Laredo. An average of 11,000 trucks cross the border daily on those bridges. Besides, commerce, the bridges between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo also connect families who have relatives on both sides of the border. Nuevo Laredo, like most Mexican border cities, offers rows of bars, inexpensive dentists, restaurants and cultural events to draw tourists. But tourism has sharply declined in the past six years as drug cartel violence has spiraled in Mexico. Because of the various bridges into the United States and access to a major highway, Nuevo Laredo has been a turf contested by rival drug cartels. The Zetas are known for having expanded their activities in the area from drug trafficking to exortion, kidnapping and human smuggling. While the officials put out a warning for travel to Nuevo Laredo, they said there is no indication that this cartel criminal spree will crossover into the United States. Officials in Nuevo Laredo said they were not familiar with the Texas warning. ""We are on alert as usual, because that is how we must be in Nuevo Laredo, but there is no special alert here with regards to what the U.S. authorities in Texas are saying,"" said Michelle Jones-Salazar, spokeswoman for the state's public prosecutor's office in Nuevo Laredo. ""This week, there has not been a single gun battle that we have had to respond to or a single dead body. The city continues as usual and we remain vigilant.""

The 20-year-old signed a three-year contract after moving from K-League club Chunnam Dragons, who are based in the South Korean city of Gwangyang. Ji starred for his country at January's Asian Cup in Qatar, grabbing four goals to take his tally to six in 11 appearances. He follows in the footsteps of compatriot Park Ji-Sung, who has won four Premier League titles and Europe's most prestigious club competition, the Champions League, since he joined Manchester United in 2005. ""I am so satisfied to be able to come to a good club, a nice club in the world's number one league,"" Ji told Sunderland's official web site. ""I am happy because I have a chance to challenge the biggest players, and that gives me motivation. ""As a striker, I like to overwhelm defenders. My aim is to help the team get as many points as possible. That is what will give me satisfaction."" Sunderland coach Steve Bruce said: ""The boy has been in fantastic form for both club and country and he was one of South Korea's stand-out performers at the Asian Cup, so we are delighted to bring him to Sunderland. ""The Premier League is very different to the K-League, so there is hard work ahead, but you just have to look at players like Park Ji-Sung and (Bolton winger) Lee Chung-Yong to see how well Korean players are adapting to its pace and physicality."" Sunderland also announced the signing of Craig Gardner from Birmingham City, who were relegated from the Premier League last season. Meanwhile, former Germany international Torsten Frings has left German club Werder Bremen to join Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. Frings claimed he was persuaded to sign for Toronto by former Germany legend Jurgen Klinsmann, who acts as an advisor for the club. ""Jurgen Klinsmann telephoned me and asked me if I could imagine joining Toronto. He made me very curious,"" he said on his personal web site. ""It's Toronto's overall appeal which swayed me -- it's a city with a great quality of life in a super country, with A full stadium, a professional environment and a vision at the club to which I can contribute in a central role.""

"(CNN) -- The presence of a decomposing human body is the only plausible explanation for the odor in Casey Anthony's trunk and the results found in forensic testing, a scientist testified Monday in her capital murder trial. Testing was conducted on carpet samples from the trunk of the Pontiac Sunfire, along with a spare tire cover, scrapings from the wheel well, air samples and paper towels found in a trash bag that had been in the trunk, Arpad Vass, a senior research scientist at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified in the Orlando, Florida, courtroom. Vass, who spent all day Monday on the stand, said he and his partners have, as part of their general research, identified some 30 compounds as significant in the human decomposition process. Seven of those were confirmed in Anthony's trunk, he said. Of those, Vass testified under cross-examination by defense attorney Jose Baez, only five were considered because the other two were at trace levels. ""We were very, very conservative,"" Vass said. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton asked Vass if, given the test results and his own observations regarding the odor, he believed a dead body had been in the trunk. ""I can find no other plausible explanation, other than that, to explain all the results we found,"" Vass said. Casey Anthony, 25, faces seven counts in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Caylee was last reported seen by her family on June 16, 2008, but no one alerted police until July 15, when the girl's grandmother, Casey Anthony's mother, tracked Anthony down and demanded answers. Prosecutors allege Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl's mouth and nose. They allege Anthony put her daughter's body in her car trunk before disposing of it. Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 2008, less than a mile from the home of Anthony's parents. Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter's death. Baez has said that when all the facts are known, it will become clear his client is innocent. The Orlando woman's attorneys argue Caylee drowned in the family pool on June 16, 2008. They say Anthony and her father panicked and covered up the death. George Anthony denied the claim during his testimony. Earlier Monday, Vass testified the presence of chloroform on a carpet sample from the trunk was at a ""shockingly high"" level -- far beyond what normally would be seen in environmental samples and higher than any he has seen in his nearly two decades of forensic study. ""The chloroform was shockingly high, unusually high,"" Vass said. The same testing done on a ""control sample"" of carpet from another Pontiac Sunfire, found in a junkyard, also showed chloroform, but the level was much lower -- ""trace amounts,"" he testified. Laser-based testing of the carpet, and testing of the other items also showed the presence of elements and substances associated with decomposition, he said. Found in the wheel well scrapings was acetic acid, a byproduct both of decomposition and of the manufacture of chloroform, according to Vass. His testimony for the state was punctuated with objections from Anthony's defense attorneys. Vass said as a control sample, scientists were able to find a blanket that a 3-year-old's body was wrapped in and put into a car trunk for three months. ""The point of that was to confirm that compounds such as we saw in the Florida trunk, that were consistent with human decomposition, could be formed in that type of environment,"" Bass said. In that test, four of the five compounds were present, he said. The only one not found was chloroform. On cross-examination, Baez tried to suggest Vass had a financial interest in the case, which he denied, and also tried to cast doubt on the testing methods, protocols and quality control. He tried to get Vass to say the fatty acids found on the paper towels could have been from meat, but Vass said it would have had to be raw meat with a high fat percentage and with bacteria normally found in human bodies. Vass also told Baez he was aware the media had been reporting his findings before they were finalized, and was unhappy about that. Baez did get Vass to acknowledge he is not currently a member of any professional organizations. Monday morning, Vass gave jurors in the trial a crash course in the stages of human decomposition and explained his nearly 20 years of study, some of which was done at ""The Body Farm,"" the anthropological research facility located near the University of Tennessee campus. Vass said he was contacted by Orange County Sheriff's Detective Yuri Melich and asked to examine evidence in the Anthony case. He then requested air samples from various points in Casey Anthony's car. A crime scene investigator, the operator of a towing company and members of Anthony's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from Anthony's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on June 27, 2008, and then towed four days later. The prosecution maintains the odor in the car was that of human decomposition, and says cadaver dogs also alerted to it. Vass testified the odor in the air samples he received was ""overwhelmingly strong. I was surprised that little can had so much odor associated with it."" He said he identified the odor as that of human decomposition. On Saturday, FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe testified that a single hair found in the trunk of Anthony's car was similar to that of Caylee and showed evidence of decomposition. The scientific testimony, which began Friday, marked a departure from the dramatic testimony and evidence offered in the first nine days of the trial, in which friends and acquaintances contradicted Anthony's claims that she was frantically searching for her daughter during the month she was missing and before authorities were notified. Instead, Anthony was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with numerous friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, including participating in a ""hot body"" contest, according to testimony in the case. Her former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor. Lowe testified Saturday how a 9-inch piece of hair found in Anthony's car and sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from a brush belonging to Caylee. But she said hair analysis is not as precise as DNA analysis, so she could not say with absolute certainty that the hair belonged to Caylee. She said she could not say how the hair got there. The hair had a dark band that Lowe testified has only been seen in hairs remaining in the scalp of a decomposing body. She also testified under questioning from Baez that while the hair is clearly not Casey Anthony's, it could belong to any other light-haired relative on her mother's side of the family. The kind of DNA testing authorities were able to perform on the sample reveals DNA passed down only through maternal lines. The hair in question was recovered after Anthony's car was picked up from her family's home, after it had been abandoned in a parking lot, towed to an impound lot and then driven back to the family home two weeks later by Anthony's father. According to testimony, Anthony asked her boyfriend to pick her up from the parking lot on June 27, saying the car had run out of gas. She also told a friend that she believed an animal carcass was lodged in her car's frame. The car was towed to an impound lot on June 30, 2008, where a manager said he smelled the odor of decomposition. Testing of samples from the car's interior and a bag of garbage that had been in the trunk, showed some relevant compounds, Vass testified Monday, but the majority were found ""in high abundance"" in the carpet sample. ""We confirmed the carpet was the point source of the odor,"" he said. Before prosecutors began presenting scientific evidence in the case on Friday, jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits between Anthony and her parents. In one conversation played Friday, Anthony scoffed at a media report her mother brought up speculating that Caylee had drowned in the family swimming pool. ""Surprise, surprise,"" Anthony said of the rumor, which is now the primary defense theory. Anthony's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following Caylee's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had been taught to conceal her pain. George Anthony has denied abusing his daughter. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"(CNN) -- Just before she and her two brothers were captured after a manhunt lasting more than a week, Lee Grace Dougherty pointed her machine pistol at a Colorado police chief, but the chief fired his .40-caliber handgun first, wounding her in the right upper thigh, according to an investigator's affidavits released Thursday. ""I pointed the gun at the cop,"" Dougherty told the FBI and Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent Christian L. Mohr. ""I deserved to get shot,"" Dougherty, 29, told authorities, according to Mohr's affidavit. ""The cop said drop the gun."" Southeast's Daugherty siblings caught in Colorado . When she was shot, ""instantly, I let go of the gun,"" Dougherty told the FBI. ""The pain was all through my body."" The cop who wounded her was Walsenburg, Colorado, Police Chief James Chamberlain, according to the documents. Thursday's release of the investigator's affidavits -- filed in support of the siblings' arrests -- provided new details about the moments leading up to authorities' capture of the three Dougherty siblings Wednesday. The FBI and other law agencies conducted a multistate dragnet for the trio for more than a week. The three siblings, arrested Wednesday after a high-speed chase by police resulted in the crash of the Doughertys' vehicle on a rural Colorado highway, had their first court hearing Thursday in Pueblo, but the three waived their right to appear, according to CNN affiliates KGTV and KUSA. A public defender represented them in their absence, according to the CNN affiliates. Lee Grace Dougherty, brother Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, face numerous charges. The three were wanted in an armed bank robbery in Georgia and were suspects in the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. Both incidents occurred August 2. Bond was set Thursday at $1.25 million for each of them, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. Their next court hearing is August 15, in Pueblo. During a high-speed chase before their car crashed, Ryan Dougherty was behind the wheel, and Dylan Dougherty Stanley was firing an AK-47 at pursuing officers and their vehicles, Lee Grace Dougherty told authorities, according to a second affidavit filed by Mohr. ""We weren't trying to hurt anyone; we just wanted them to get back,"" Lee Grace Dougherty told investigators after her arrest. ""They were way back, and we could barely see them. We were getting shot at, then we wrecked."" Mohr inserted a note in his affidavit saying that police never fired upon the Doughertys: ""No shots were fired at the vehicle and she may have mistaken the sounds of the tire deflation device they ran over."" She told investigators that she ""didn't shoot at any cop in the state of Colorado,"" according to Mohr's affidavit. In the Florida incident, the Doughertys successfully eluded police after the officer's car tire was shot out from one of the many rounds fired from the Dougherty's stolen car, authorities said. But the Doughertys couldn't elude authorities in Colorado. Their car crashed into a highway guardrail during a chase that reached up to 120 miles per hour, the affidavits said. One brother stayed in the car. Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses, only to be picked up by law enforcement officers after a citizen spotted him, authorities told CNN. Authorities recovered two assault rifles, a submachine gun and a handgun at the crash scene, the affidavits said. Colorado authorities said the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest, about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. Their fugitive run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg, authorities said. CNN's Deanna Proeller contributed to this report.","Affidavits detail a high-speed chase shoot-out with the Dougherty siblings .

"(CNN) -- Todd Sollar used to think a college education was a waste of time and money. ""I thought I could bypass college after high school and get a good paying job with General Motors and avoid the high cost of an education,"" he said. The 34-year-old from Centerville, Ohio, was groomed as a young adult to work with his hands and to pursue production jobs in his hometown area near Dayton. After high school, he worked for two years at Airborne Express (now DHL) in Wilmington, Ohio, then moved to the General Motors' Moraine plant where he worked on the body shop assembly line for 11 years churning out Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and even Saab SUVs. ""The money and benefits at GM were good and I was very comfortable,"" he said. The good life didn't last as long as Sollar wanted. In 2008, GM closed his plant, leaving him and thousands of others without jobs. ""It felt like the end of the world and I was scared when they let us go,"" he said. ""It was a struggle, because I thought we'd stay open."" GM was the only way of life for many former employees and the plant closure was a major blow to their psyches. Employment options for a high school graduate in the Dayton, Ohio, area were bleak when Sollar lost his job in 2008. The economy was in a downturn and the possibility of finding a job that paid well was slim. He and his former colleagues struggled to find work. Two of his friends committed suicide after they were let go from GM. Sollar vowed to find a positive path toward his new future, despite the dismal economic climate. ""My only hope for a decent job at that time required me to seek out a higher education,"" he said. In the Fall quarter of 2008, Sollar enrolled in Sinclair Community College in Dayton and pursued an associate degree in applied science in automation and control technology with robotics. Sinclair is one of nearly 1,200 public and community colleges across the U.S. This year, Sinclair's summer session had the highest enrollment in the school's nearly 125-year history, with 13,041 students enrolled, a 3% increase over last year. The school's president, Dr. Steven Johnson, said community colleges across the country are experiencing increases in enrollments, as well. Johnson said a downturn in the economy is among the biggest reasons why more Americans are enrolling in community colleges, these days. The Dayton area has been hit especially hard with job losses in the automotive industry. Students are seeking new marketable job skills and community colleges offer a viable means to that end. ""Community colleges are a great value for the money and are less expensive than a four-year institution,"" he said. ""For some students, a two-year degree makes more sense than a four-year college experience."" For Sollar, scholarships and grants covered his full-time tuition, which averages between $2,259 to $3,598 a year at Sinclair. A severance package deal from GM covered his living expenses while he attended school. He had to take additional classes beyond the core curriculum to make up for the lack of college prep classes he missed taking in high school. Despite the extra workload, he graduated with honors in June of 2011. Looking back, Sollar wished he would have attended community college earlier in his life, instead of waiting until his 30s to attend school. ""Nothing is permanent in this world, especially jobs,"" he said. ""You can't take for granted that a job is going to support you for your entire life."" Sollar said an education was the key to expanding his horizons and opening new employment possibilities. Before graduation, he landed a job with Gosiger Automation in Dayton, where he now works full-time as an electronic mechanical technician. He's not making as much money as he once did with GM, but hopes that will change one day as he advances through his newly developed career. He said he couldn't have landed this position without attending Sinclair. ""When I was in high school, I was told that I was not 'college material,'"" he said. ""Yet, I discovered later in life, that wasn't true."" Sollar's wife, who is due with their first child in October, plans to encourage his future child to receive a higher education, too. ""My child will have no choice,"" he chuckled. ""I will make that kid attend college.""","Todd Sollar believed college was a waste of time and money, until he lost his factory job .

"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to embattled Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi launched a new attack on the rebel-held city of Misrata on Wednesday, with anti-government forces reporting intense shelling from three sides of the city. Thousands of government troops attacked around 6 a.m. (11 p.m. Tuesday ET), with 13 rebels reported dead by evening. Mohamed Mokhtar, a rebel fighter wounded in Wednesday's fighting, accused government troops of infiltrating rebel lines in cars bearing rebel flags. Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha, a spokesman for Misrata's Hekma hospital, said it was the bloodiest day in a week in the besieged city. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since the fighting began there in February, including 686 registered residents of the city, he said. Rebel fighters returning from the front lines reported that their defenses were holding up under the onslaught, however. The assault followed a day of intense bombardment of Libya's capital by the NATO alliance, which intervened in the conflict in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him. Libya's government said 60 missiles struck the capital city, killing at least 31 people, including a number of civilians, and wounding dozens more. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reiterated Wednesday that the alliance is doing all it can to avoid civilian casualties. But he told reporters from allied headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that NATO could continue the airstrikes ""for as long as it takes to bring this crisis to an early conclusion."" Rasmussen said NATO bombing has saved lives in Libya, and that the alliance has the resources to extend its military mission for another 90 days past the end of June. It is time to start planning for what to do after Gadhafi's departure ""because Gadhafi's reign of terror is coming to an end,"" he said. Pressed by reporters on why airstrikes would be able to dislodge Gadhafi when ""the history of the last 30 years"" shows that air attacks alone do not win wars, Rasmussen offered no clear answer, saying only, ""We have no intentions to put troops on the ground."" For his part, even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his Tripoli compound, Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that ""we will not surrender."" ""I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me,"" Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television. ""But my soul is in God's hand. We will not think about death or life. We will think about the call of duty."" The Gadhafi compound was under ""intensive continuous bombardment,"" according to state TV, which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. But government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the allied campaign ""is failing miserably."" ""No one has the right to shape Libya's future except for Libyans,"" he said. Ibrahim said Tuesday's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and the revolution compound, which are military barracks near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. The spokesman said attacks Tuesday and Wednesday hit state television buildings, killing two people and wounding 16. NATO disputed the account. ""We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities. What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli,"" the alliance said. ""The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster's building is bogus.""

"(CNN) -- A teenage student is facing a first-degree murder charge, with police saying that he followed through on a plan to kill the principal of his small private school in Memphis, Tennessee. Eduardo Marmolejo was charged in the death Wednesday of 49-year-old Suzette York, the Memphis Police Department said in a statement Thursday. A detention hearing was held on Thursday, during which Magistrate Judge Sheldon McCall ordered the suspect held without bail and also ordered a mental evaluation, said Chief Probation Officer Barry Mitchell of the Memphis and Shelby County Juvenile Court. Court-appointed defense attorney Autumn Chastain told reporters Thursday that ""it's difficult for everybody right now."" ""It's just a very serious allegation,"" Chastain said. ""We need to know everything that's going on in the case."" Police said the suspect is 17 years old, while Mitchell said he is 16. CNN normally does not identify juveniles charged with crimes unless the juveniles are charged as adults. However in this case police have released his name under a Tennessee law that allows them to publicly identify juveniles charged with first-degree murder. Once the police publicly identified the suspect, CNN and other national and local media have reported his name. York was found Wednesday lying in a pool of blood at Memphis Junior Academy, according to the city fire department. Police, who responded to a call at 11:15 a.m., added that she was pronounced dead at the scene, after succumbing to ""multiple stab wounds."" Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong told CNN on Thursday that the suspect ""has been carrying a grudge all summer long"" because the previous school year he'd been switched out of a class that he liked. ""Basically, he conspired all summer as to how he was going to get revenge,"" Armstrong said. According to Memphis police, Marmolejo told investigators ""that he did not like (York) and that she had made him angry."" Then he allegedly acted on his plans Wednesday, during the first week of school. ""He found himself alone in a classroom, ... and he attacked Ms. York, stabbing her multiple times resulting in her death,"" said Armstrong. The city's police chief said authorities have no indication Marmolejo conspired with anyone, either in the planning or in the execution of the alleged crime. He added, ""From what we've been told, ... there were no red flags"" to suggest the suspect posed a danger to others or to himself. York, who had been the principal of the school since 2008, has a family in Memphis, said Marvin Lowman, communications director for the Seventh-day Adventist Conference in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. The school is affiliated with that church, said officials. ""It's tragic all the way around,"" Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said outside the school. Former student Kristen Bridges described York as an exemplary biology and math teacher. ""Past the teaching, she loved God,"" Bridges told CNN affiliate WREG. ""And she showed that in everything she did."" Marmolejo's next hearing, also in juvenile court, is scheduled for August 24, according to Mitchell. CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Memphis' police chief says the suspect carried ""a grudge all summer""

"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- Over and over Thursday, President Barack Obama told workers at a renewable energy company that he is like them. He remembers pumping gas when high oil prices ate a hole in his budget, he said. He knows he wouldn't have made it through college without scholarships and loans. And now as president, he promised that he won't let the current debate on deficit reduction deny others the chance for the American dream he has lived. ""We can't ignore future deficits, but just as ignoring deficits would mortgage our future, failing to invest in our kids and our infrastructure and our basic research and clean energy, that would be mortgaging our future, as well,"" he said to applause. ""And I'm not willing to do it."" It was the third town hall-style meeting in three days for Obama, after an event Tuesday at Northern Virginia Community College and a gathering Wednesday at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California. His trip also has included a series of fundraising events just over two weeks after he announced he will seek re-election in 2012. Speaking Thursday at ElectraTherm Inc., a 45-employee company that produces electric power without using fuel or emitting carbon dioxide, Obama advocated federal spending on education, research and infrastructure development such as road and bridge repairs, high-speed rail lines and broadband wireless networks. He appeared to be trying out campaign themes for the 2012 race, repeatedly framing the debate in Washington as a choice between helping working-class families and society's most vulnerable elements or favoring moneyed interests he labeled as big oil and big banks. Repeating past calls for ending subsidies for oil companies and restoring higher tax rates for the highest-income Americans, Obama defended what he called his balanced approach to deficit reduction and depicted the Republican stance as favoring the well-to-do. ""I'm rooting for everybody to get rich,"" he said. ""But I believe that we can't ask everybody to sacrifice and then tell the wealthiest among us, well, you can just relax and go count your money, and don't worry about it. We're not going to ask anything of you."" Obama went on to say that he had been ""incredibly blessed by this country,"" noting he was raised by a single mother and needed scholarships to get through school. ""We want to make sure this is a country where, if you're willing to try hard, you can make it, where everybody has a chance at prosperity,"" he said. ""That's my focus. That's my guiding light."" Obama's blitz comes as Congress faces two major fiscal issues in coming months: passing a budget for fiscal year 2012, which begins October 1, and raising the federal debt ceiling so the government can continue meeting its obligations. While the issues are not necessarily linked, congressional Republicans are demanding significant fiscal reforms, such as a balanced budget amendment and mandatory spending caps, in exchange for their necessary support to raise the debt limit. Republicans will not move forward on a measure to raise the country's debt ceiling unless ""it is accompanied by serious reforms that immediately reduce federal spending and end the culture of debt in Washington,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said this week. Obama and Democrats want to separate the debt ceiling and fiscal reform issues to avoid spooking markets and trade partners, arguing that such a vital issue should be free of any possible political drag. While opposing a direct linkage between raising the debt ceiling and fiscal reforms, the White House concedes that simultaneous steps are needed to reduce mounting deficits and the national debt. The U.S. debt is expected to hit the country's $14.3 trillion ceiling next month, though congressional leaders say the Treasury can take steps to put off the deadline until early July. On the broader fiscal reform issues, Obama noted Thursday that both his proposal and the House Republican plan acknowledge the problem posed by expanding deficits and the growing national debt, and that both call for $4 trillion in deficit reduction in the next decade or so. The House plan would overhaul Medicare and Medicaid, cut non-military discretionary spending and reform the tax code to lower rates and eliminate loopholes. The goal is leaner government without the unsustainable cost increases currently plaguing Medicare and Medicaid, along with lower tax rates to stimulate economic growth. Obama's vision, unveiled last week, includes ending the tax cuts for the wealthy, further reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, and cutting military spending. The House Republican plan would leave military spending untouched. Vice President Joe Biden's office announced Monday that his first meeting with legislators to try to work out a fiscal reform deal will take place May 5. Obama proposed the talks when he outlined his policy last week, and Republican leaders announced Tuesday that Cantor and Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona will represent them. At the same time, a bipartisan group of senators known as the ""Gang of Six"" is nearing consensus on its own comprehensive reform plan based on the report issued last December by a deficit reduction commission appointed by Obama. No details have been made public, but the Bowles-Simpson commission's report in December included reforms of entitlements including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid while also calling for revenue increases through tax reform and spending cuts, including in the military budget. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","President Obama holds his third town hall-style event in three days .

"Gaborone, Botswana (CNN) -- Public servants across Botswana are in the fourth day Thursday of a strike that is expected to last until April 29. The strike began after the mediator between the five unions representing civil servants and the Directorate of Public Service Management gave the unions the go-ahead to strike. The workers are seeking a 16% salary hike. The government of President Ian Khama has not increased civil servants' salaries for the past three years. It is estimated 90,000 government workers out of a total of some 103,000 have been staying off the job. It has been reported that 50 doctors at Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, the southern African nation's capital, have also joined the strike. This is in addition of hundreds of health workers, including nurses, across Botswana who have been off the job. There are reports that some schools in the country have closed because of the absence of teachers and cooks. But despite the five unions' threat to paralyze border posts, it has been business as usual at Ramokgwebana border post throughout this week. Members of the Botswana Defence Force were deployed there to render service that is usually offered by immigration officers. The soldiers were apparently inducted on Sunday to man the border for the duration of the strike. They manned the offices in full military uniforms, allowing travelers in and out of the country. This action, seen as disregard of strike rules agreed upon by the Directorate of Public Service Management, has incensed the unions. ""This is a clear contravention of strike rules, especially Section 37 of the Trade Dispute Act, which says an employer cannot replace (people) on strike before 14 days elapses. The government does not respect the rule of law,"" charged Ketlhalefile Motshegwa, secretary general of the Botswana Land Boards Local Authorities and Health Workers Union, who was making the rounds to assess the situation in the northeast. Meanwhile, Khama and his Cabinet went on leave Monday after the adjournment of Parliament last Friday. Some union members have complained this shows the president is not taking their plight seriously.","Nearly 90% of government workers are on strike in Botswana .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's second-largest train manufacturer will recall 54 bullet trains running on the new Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway after a series of malfunctions, a company official said Friday. The state-owned CNR Corporation earlier this week suspended deliveries of the same model for safety reasons. ""All decisions are based on safety and we are trying to be responsible,"" said Tan Xiaofeng, a company spokesman. The news came on the heels of a Chinese government announcement to slow down bullet trains nationwide and halt approval for new construction, amid increasing public scrutiny on the country's railway safety following a crash last month that killed at least 40 people. Premier Wen Jiabao this week also ordered railway authorities, who had planned to invest over $400 billion into new projects in the next five years, to conduct thorough safety inspections on all high-speed rail lines both in operation and under construction, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""Right now we are checking and eliminating all potential safety vulnerabilities,"" railway minister Sheng Guangzu said in Thursday's edition of the People's Rail newspaper. ""Down the road we want to strengthen our management to ensure rail operations be safe, sustainable and stable."" Sheng said bullet trains would run 40 to 50 kilometers below their top design speed, which currently stands at 350 kilometers per hour (217 mph) for the fastest model, and ticket prices would be reduced accordingly. The actions were prompted by the government after a stalled bullet train was struck from behind by another train on July 23 near Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, causing one of China's deadliest rail accidents in recent years. Railway officials later blamed design flaws in the rail signal equipment as the culprit. Many in the public remain skeptical of the finding, still fuming over reports that the railway ministry ended its search-and-rescue effort less than six hours after the collision, and moved to crush and bury one of the six derailed cars when the investigation had barely started. Although railway authorities have denied such allegations, a panel consisted of high-ranking government officials -- none from the railway ministry -- and academic experts has taken over the investigation and is expected to produce its report in September. Reactions were mixed to the government decision to decelerate the country's trains. ""This is a rational policy to correct the 'great leap forward' strategy of our high-speed railway development,"" Professor Zhao Jian, a transportation expert with Beijing Jiaotong University, told CNN. ""It should have been done earlier -- but this is a good start."" Zhao, a long-time critic of China's high-speed rail plans, said slower trains would improve safety and cut operational cost, benefiting both operators and passengers. But others compare the new measure to ""stopping eating after choking on food."" ""The problem is obviously with management, but they simply decided to reduce the speed,"" a user named ""usinner"" wrote on Shanghai Metrofans, a popular railway internet forum. ""If they don't address the real problem, trains are still going to crash even when running below 100 kilometers per hour."" Now the world's second-largest economy, and flush with cash, China has built the world's longest high-speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers (5,100 miles) of routes -- in a few short years. Officials have portrayed the development of high-speed rail as a symbol of the country's growing prowess and also want to export Chinese technologies to markets that include the United States. The massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines' safety and commercial viability. The skeptics' voices became louder after the former railway minister -- a champion of high-speed rail -- was sacked for corruption early this year. Even the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail -- the ministry's newest and proudest project -- has broken down several times since its much-touted launch less than two months ago. ""It's not the faster, the better,"" Sun Zhang, a railway professor at Tongji University in Shanghai -- and now a member of the investigative panel on the deadly crash -- told CNN in June. ""We have to take safety, economics and environmental impact into consideration."" Eager to reassure skeptics home and abroad, Chinese leaders have said the government would learn its lessons from the fatal bullet train collision -- even it means to swallow national pride for now. ""If safety is compromised, there is no credibility to speak of,"" Premier Wen said during a visit to the crash site on July 28. ""It is important that we integrate our effort in pursuing speed, quality, efficiency and safety with the understanding that safety always comes first.""","The recall involves 54 bullet trains made by the state-owned CNR Corporation .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- U.S. safety officials have cited Alabama's Browns Ferry nuclear power plant for a failed valve that could have hindered efforts to cool one of the reactors during an emergency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced Tuesday. The problem in the No. 1 reactor unit has resulted in a top-level ""red finding"" by the NRC, bringing increased federal oversight of the three-unit plant for some time. ""The public was never endangered because no actual event occurred,"" the NRC said in announcing the citation. ""However, the system is counted on for core cooling during certain accident scenarios and the valve failure left it inoperable, which potentially could have led to core damage had an accident involving a series of unlikely events occurred."" Browns Ferry is located outside Athens, Alabama, about 80 miles north of Birmingham. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the plant, had argued against the finding and may appeal the decision, TVA spokesman Ray Golden told CNN. ""We think we have a safe plant,"" he said. ""We have a number of higher safety measures in place. That said, we can do more and are planning to do more."" The bad valve was part of a residual heat removal system that cools the reactors after they shut down. The problem was discovered when the unit was being refueled in October, said Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the NRC regional office in Atlanta. ""This violation will result in additional regional and headquarters inspectors in the plant doing various other additional inspections,"" Ledford said. The plant's ""safety culture"" will be under scrutiny along with its technical systems as a result of the ruling, he said. The citation is the fifth red finding issued by the NRC under a system that went into effect in 2001, Ledford said. It is the first issued to Browns Ferry or to any of TVA's three nuclear plants, Golden said. The 3,200-megawatt Browns Ferry plant remains idled following April 27 tornadoes that knocked out external power to the plant. Unit 1 was the scene of a 1975 fire that damaged the control room's electrical systems, an accident that led to new safety procedures at U.S. nuclear plants. The problem found in October could have led to an increased threat of fire under some conditions, Golden said. ""We acknowledge that we have more work to do in fire protection and are committed to doing that,"" he said. The faulty valve had been in place since Browns Ferry was built in the late 1960s, and its failure was the result of a manufacturing defect, he said. But the utility argued that the reactor had multiple backup systems that operated despite the failed valve, and the faulty device eventually responded properly during laboratory tests. ""It became stuck, but we were able to demonstrate in these labs that if you allowed enough time to go by, it would unstick itself,"" Golden said. The valve was replaced shortly after the problem was found, and was working at the time of the April tornadoes, said Roger Hannah, an NRC spokesman in Washington. The agency cited TVA for failing to identify the problem during earlier inspections, he said. ""We felt they should have identified this valve as a problem before it was discovered,"" Hannah said. CNN's Devon Sayers and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: The plant's owner may challenge the NRC citation .

"(CNN) -- The man being detained in the case of a missing American woman in Aruba is no longer cooperating with authorities, an official in the Caribbean nation said Thursday. Taco Stein, Aruba's solicitor general, said that Gary Giordano is claiming that it is within his rights not to talk. This approach prompted Aruban authorities to change their tactics, including releasing the suspect's photo in an attempt to generate tips and requesting assistance from the FBI, said Stein. Richard Wolf, an FBI spokesman in Baltimore, Maryland, confirmed Thursday that Aruban authorities have requested the U.S. agency's help. The assistance includes conducting interviews in the state, where 35-year-old Robyn Gardner lives. Gardner was last seen August 2 near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island, said Ann Angela, a spokeswoman for the Aruban prosecutor's office. In a press release Thursday, the prosecutor's office continued to identify the 50-year-old American man ""who was arrested as a suspect on August 5"" by his initials, GVG. They also released a photo of the man, who appears to be Giordano. Giordano's attorney Michael Lopez has not responded to calls from CNN. The lawyer has told reporters that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on July 31 from the United States. Gardner's friend, Christina Jones, told HLN's Nancy Grace that the woman had known Giordano for ""over a year"" and flew to Aruba with him. Jones said that she had some concerns about the trip, but Gardner ""calmed me and said it was OK -- that the trip to Aruba was what she needed."" Giordano had told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner behind Nanki Country Club when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, the woman was nowhere to be found, the man allegedly said. But no witnesses have come forward to say they saw Gardner and Giordano snorkeling off Baby Beach, Stein previously has said. Witnesses have said they saw the couple on the beach. ""The statements made by the traveling companion led to such questions that on Friday, August 5, 2011, it was decided to detain him for further questioning on the possible drowning of the woman,"" the prosecutor's office said. Lopez, Giordano's attorney, said Tuesday his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. Lopez earlier told reporters that his client had been cooperating with police. Lopez said that on his client's last scheduled day in Aruba, he asked authorities if he needed to stay. ""They didn't answer it, and on his way to the airport, they detained him as a suspect for murder,"" Lopez said. Angela would not say what evidence led authorities to suspect his involvement in Gardner's disappearance. After finding no trace of Gardner, authorities stopped their active search for her on Saturday and are now searching ""passively,"" Angela said. Police helicopters and search and rescue officials are keeping their eyes out for any clues to her disappearance, ""but it's not an active search anymore,"" she said. The Aruban solicitor general's office said Thursday that ""on short notice"" it will formally request assistance from the U.S. Justice Department.Stein had said earlier that Aruban officials have had informal conversations with the FBI to verify information and would request help, including seeking telephone records and conducting background checks on both Gardner and Giordano. Investigators in Aruba will analyze a rental car and electronic devices that were in Giordano's possession, Aruban officials said Wednesday. Richard Forester, also of Maryland, told CNN he and Gardner have been dating for the past seven or eight months. He told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday evening that Gardner wasn't the type to go into deep water, and would more likely stay by the pool. ""It's just not her to go out and snorkel,"" Forester said. Forester said Tuesday that before Gardner's trip, the two argued over ""the circumstances of her travel"" to Aruba. He last heard from her on August 2 in a Facebook message, in which she said they would ""work it out"" when she got back. Earlier that day, Forester said, Gardner posted on her Facebook wall ""this sucks,"" with no further explanation. She was scheduled to return to the United States on August 4, Forester said. In an interview with HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Thursday -- the same day he was interviewed by authorities -- Forester described Gardner as a woman who ""loved life."" ""She loved to be happy, loved to have fun, loved to be active,"" he said. ""She had a very loving, warm heart."" The Natalee Holloway Resource Center -- named after a young American woman whose disappearance in Aruba made international news -- said Forester brought their attention to the case Monday. The Aruban public prosecutor's office, as well as Forester, urged people in the Caribbean, the United States and elsewhere to come forward with information about Giordano, Gardner and the case. ""It's very hard not knowing,"" Forester told HLN's Grace on Thursday. ""I would ask everybody who knows anything about (Giordano) to come forward.""

"(CNN) -- A suspect in the disappearance of a 3-year-old Missouri girl last seen riding her bicycle was in custody Saturday, authorities announced. Authorities were searching for Breeann Rodriguez's body and bicycle in an undisclosed area in Dunklin County, the Senath Police Department and Dunklin County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The unnamed suspect is from the area and is not related to the family, according to the statement. He was being held at the Dunklin County Justice Center, pending formal charges. ""There have been hundreds of tips from the public but it was a thorough investigation that led to the suspect,"" officials said. They would not comment further Saturday morning, saying the Dunklin County Prosecutor's Office will release more information after the suspect is formally charged. Police said Thursday that they'd found two training wheels similar to those on a pink bike ridden by Breeann before she went missing. Senath police Chief Omar Karnes described the training wheels as ""items of interest."" The girl was last seen riding August 6 with her brother in front of their home in Senath. The city, which has about 1,800 residents according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is in southeast Missouri's ""bootheel"" about 40 miles northeast of Jonesboro, Arkansas, and 90 miles north of Memphis, Tennessee. A $45,000 reward -- $25,000 from the FBI and $20,000 from the Senath Marshal's office -- was offered for information leading to Breeann's recovery and the prosecution of those responsible. Authorities said they were no longer interested in tracking down a white cargo van that had been seen in the area days ahead of Breeann's disappearance. Digital billboards with the girl's picture have been displayed in Jonesboro and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, about 100 miles north of where she went missing.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida judge ruled Friday that Casey Anthony must serve one year of supervised probation for a check-fraud conviction, saying that failing to carry through on a ""lawfully imposed sentence"" would be a ""mockery of justice."" Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. said that Anthony has to report to a state Department of Corrections facility in Orlando no later than noon on August 26, though she can report earlier. Perry also ruled the Department of Corrections can keep Anthony's address confidential to safeguard her well-being. Citing reports indicating Anthony is highly disliked by the public, the judge acknowledged that there ""is a high probability that there are many that would like to ... physical(ly) harm"" the defendant. The probation order states that Anthony cannot leave ""the county of (her) residence"" -- which has been Orange County -- without her probation officer's approval. Jo Ellyn Rackleff, spokeswoman for the corrections department, said Friday that her agency is reviewing the order. ""We will then determine what is the best way to implement it,"" said Rackleff. ""Miss Anthony has not received permission to move to another state."" Anthony was cleared last month of murder charges related to the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. The same Florida jury did convict her on four lesser charges, related to misleading law enforcement authorities. Her probation stems, though, from an earlier conviction -- in January 2010 -- on felony check fraud charges after she admitted stealing a checkbook from her friend Amy Huizenga and writing five checks totaling $644.25. The probation order specifies that Anthony have ""no personal contact with the victim, Amy Huzienga."" In the judgment released Friday, Judge Stan Strickland -- as quoted in a court transcript from January 2010 -- ordered Anthony to serve ""a year of supervised probation, once released."" But the order signed by  Strickland at the time indicated it would run while she was in  state custody awaiting trial on murder charges related to her  daughter's death. Randy Means, spokesman for the Orange  County State Attorney's Office, said the court clerk had misunderstood Strickland and written the court order based on the misunderstanding. The documents were amended August 1 to add the words ""upon release"" to  Anthony's sentencing documents, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Anthony's defense team responded with a motion saying she cannot serve probation again when she has already served it behind  bars, claiming that would violate the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth  Amendment. The motion, filed  by attorney J. Cheney Mason, calls the amended documents ""a fraudulently  filed product of a previously disqualified judge."" Strickland  had been presiding over Anthony's murder case until April 2010, when he  recused himself after the defense accused him of being a  ""self-aggrandizing media hound"" who was biased against her. Perry took  over and stayed in that position throughout the trial. In the  motion, Mason notes that Strickland, in an appearance on  HLN's ""Nancy Grace,"" expressed ""shock"" about Anthony's acquittal, and  criticized the jury's verdicts in an appearance on CNN affiliate WESH. ""Such unbridled prejudice by a sitting judge calls into question the validity of any rulings made after recusal,"" Mason wrote. Strickland recused himself from the probation matter the next day, transferring it to Perry. In his ruling, Perry wrote, ""It is clear the court stated the defendant's probation was to start once she was released from jail"" -- even if that wasn't reflected in documents due to a ""clerical error."" The judge cited precedent to correct such documents, saying ""an order is rendered, valid and binding when orally given."" The judge added instituting the probation doesn't violate rules against double jeopardy, since the check fraud crimes that Anthony was convicted of and those she was acquitted of are distinct. He also said Anthony couldn't have complied with the probation terms while in jail. ""To bar the court from correcting a clerical mistake and to permit the defendant to serve probation in jail while awaiting trial on a totally unrelated charge without any possibility of complying with the terms of the probation order would clearly thwart society's interest in extracting a full, fair and just punishment for a crime,"" said Perry. Under  the terms of her probation, Anthony must check in with the probation  office -- which is in Orange County, the same Florida county where she's lived and the crime occurred -- once a month and answer all questions. She cannot  change her job or her residence unless such a move is approved by her probation officer. In addition to an order that she cannot violate ""any law,"" Anthony is barred from drinking  alcoholic beverages to the extent they impair her ""normal faculties.""  She must undergo regular breath, urine and blood tests to assess how much alcohol and controlled  substances are in her body. There  are also prohibitions on her visiting places where drugs, alcohol and  ""other dangerous substances"" are unlawfully sold or used. InSession's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- I had hopes that with the talent of the two leads and the good buzz on director Ruben Fleischer's previous film, ""Zombieland,"" ""30 Minutes or Less"" would be more than it eventually ended up being, which is an occasionally funny, more often stupid, diversion. It's a decent way to spend 90 minutes if you have nothing else to do, but it doesn't exactly scream ""See me in the theater!"" The story is simple enough. Jesse Eisenberg's Nick delivers pizzas for a living, committing every moving violation in the book to get the pies to their destination on time, even when the location is clearly miles away. If he doesn't, it comes out of his pay, and one has to imagine that his pay isn't very high. Nick is a prototypical movie version of the genial slacker. He's got a dead-end job, not much in the brains department and seemingly no ambition (and even less of a moral compass), yet he manages to be charming enough to have slept with his best friend's gorgeous twin sister (a potential for gags that's barely touched) who is actually going somewhere. Meanwhile, his far-more responsible (but equally feckless) best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari, reduced here to a shrieking parody of a human) is a teacher at the local school and has just about as limited a future as Nick, not to mention an equally poor decision-making capacity. At the same time, two complete morons (Danny McBride as Dwayne and Nick Swardson as Travis) hatch a complicated (and thoroughly inane) plan to kill Dwayne's Marine Corps vet father, The Major (Fred Ward) to inherit what's left of a $10 million lottery win. This ""plan"" involves committing several smaller crimes, including strapping a bomb to Nick's chest to force him to rob a bank so Tweedledumb and Tweedledumber can get enough money to pay a hit man. See where this is going? McBride, often hysterical in HBO's ""Eastbound and Down,"" has become typecast and desperately needs to break out of this character. His variations on a theme of a crude, not-so-bright bull in a China shop is getting stale -- the effect of which in this film is the constant urge to reach through the screen and punch him in the mouth. It didn't occur to me to do the math, but there may have been more crimes committed per minute in this film than in any since 1980's ""The Blues Brothers,"" and some of them are indeed funny. I'm not sure if that's a good thing, but go with it. Mostly, however, they're just stupid, not to mention poorly paced and frantically acted. What it boils down to is, ""30 Minutes or Less"" is loaded with stupid characters, crude jokes (some funny, some not so much), one pretty good car chase, some very good actors in wasted, underwritten roles and a massive requirement of its audience to suspend disbelief. Don't get me wrong. I love stupid humor, if it's stupid like a fox (get it?). I also don't have anything against mindless comedies, as long as they're funny. The thing is, if they're really funny, they're not really mindless. Basically, ""30 Minutes or Less"" isn't truly bad enough to be bad, but it's not really very good, either.","Jesse Eisenberg's Nick delivers pizzas for a living in ""30 Minutes or Less""

"Seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams has pulled out of the forthcoming Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto with a viral illness. The American was due to face Serb Ana Ivanovic in a first round clash on Tuesday, but will now be replaced in the draw by Chinese qualifier Zhang Shuai. The extra berth created by the 31-year-old Williams' withdrawal has been given to Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino. ""I was really excited to play Toronto,"" world number 34 Williams told the tournament's official web site. ""I came here ready to go and was practicing. I wasn't feeling very well and had to see the doctor today. I was diagnosed with a viral illness and unfortunately am unable to play. I am extremely disappointed. I'm very sorry to the fans and tournament."" Williams has struggled with injury in recent years and has not played competitively since Wimbledon in June and July. Her last WTA Tour title came at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February 2010. Despite Williams pulling out of the event, the Rexall Centre tournament still boasts a top-level field including world number one Caroline Wozniacki, the number two ranked Kim Clijsters and Venus' sister Serena. Elsewhere, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska upset the odds to beat top seed Vera Zvonareva in the final of the WTA tournament in Carlsbad, California. Radwanska, a beaten finalist at the same event in 2010, scored a 6-3 6-4 win to defeat world number three Zvonareva for the first time in her career and land her fifth WTA Tour title.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentine farmers are planning their next move after the country's president announced plans to fund a public works program with revenues from a controversial agrarian export tax. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax. Eduardo Buzzi, president of the Argentine Agrarian Federation, said the organization's directory board will meet Friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's announcement. ""We call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert,"" the organization said on its Web site Tuesday. The 44 percent export tax, which applies to soybeans, wheat, corn and sunflower seeds, has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers. Argentina is the world's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter. On Monday, farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country, though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads Tuesday. Kirchner has argued that the tax, which was implemented March 11, pays for increases in seniors' pensions and financial assistance for the poor. She has rejected the farmers' demands for a repeal of the export tax as ""extortion."" Monday marked the first time Kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax, which has generated about U.S. $1.5 billion, to lift people out of poverty. ""It is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits,"" she said in a televised address. Kirchner said the Social Redistribution Program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers, as well as investments in the country's rural roads and in housing. In an apparent criticism of the farmers, she lamented ""the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution"" to ""those who have least."" She apologized, however, at the close of her speech for offending anyone. Analysts suggested that the tax was a ""strong attack"" on on the farmers and their arguments against it. Claudio Loser, a visiting senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue policy analysis center, said it could result in Argentine society being ""less sympathetic to the farmers,"" noting that it was ""surprising"" that the government didn't come up with the plan until the tax was three months old. Loser, who is from Argentina, also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing. Externally, the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on Argentina, he said. ""The conflict has resulted in a loss of market for Argentina,"" he said, as other countries have gone elsewhere for products. Loser also said foreign investors may be more reluctant to invest in Argentina now.

"(CNN)  -- Michael Schumacher has apologized by text message to fellow Formula One veteran Rubens Barrichello after their near high-speed crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Seven-time world champion Schumacher faced a barrage of criticism after appearing to force Barrichello into the wall at the Hungaroring, as the Brazilian overtook him. The Mercedes man used his personal website to offer an original apology and, now heading into this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, has backed it up. Barrichello is set for a landmark 300th career Grand Prix at Spa this weekend and Schumacher told gathered reporters at his official press conference Thursday about his double gesture. ""There were two reasons I sent the text. One of the main reasons is that it is his 300th Grand Prix and we have quite a lot of history together, so I thought it was appropriate to congratulate him,"" he said. ""Secondly, to clarify the point because he sort of felt that I wanted to push him against the wall and very clearly this was not my ambition. ""I wanted to race very tightly but without any contact. If he felt that this was the case, then I am sorry for that."" Barrichello earlier confirmed that his old German rival had messaged him. He told AFP, ""I received a message from him today, an SMS. ""Somebody said to him that I was under the impression he had pushed me on to the wall, and he said it wasn't the case and he apologized for that. ""I just said, 'thank you, no problem.' I accepted it, wished him a good weekend, life goes on."" Both men will be looking to improve their position in the title race as the championship resumes after the summer break.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India and Pakistan are set to open a new round of talks this week in the latest attempt by the Asian rivals to build mutual trust. No breakthroughs are expected in the bitter disputes that divide the nuclear neighbors, but some progress might come in the area of Kashmiri trade. On her arrival in India Tuesday, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar struck an optimistic note about the prospects of relations between the neighbors. ""(I) hope that these two countries will have learned lessons from history, but are not burdened by history and we can move forward, forge forward as good friendly neighbors, who have a stake in each others' future and who understand the responsibility that both the countries have to the region and within the region,"" she said, a day before her meeting with her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna. Top bureaucrats from the two sides were in discussions in the Indian capital, New Delhi, ahead of Wednesday's talks.  Indian and Pakistani officials have exchanged ideas on how to improve trade and travel across Kashmir -- the disputed region divided between the countries. The current three-year agreement involves 21 locally made items, but business groups have been demanding expansion in the list of products.  They'd also like to see an introduction of banking facilities, and improvements in communications and infrastructure. A senior Indian official, in a background briefing, said some announcements on boosting trade across Kashimir's military line of control were expected as a part of confidence-building measures between the two countries. The nuclear-capable neighbors have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947, two of them over Kashmir, which both nations claim. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which have been blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. Under U.S. pressure, Indian and Pakistani leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put the fragile peace process back on track, but no dramatic headway has been made in settling outstanding issues. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. Analysts, however, do not foresee immediate resolution of these thorny issues. ""Any immediate breakthrough is not possible. But it's good (that) talks continue,"" said strategic expert Afsir Karim.  ""I am more optimistic than before about the positive nature of dialogue."" Since 2004, successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. But talks were suspended two months later, in November 2008, after the terror raid on Mumbai that left more than 160 people dead. The current engagement comes in the wake of another terror attack on Mumbai. Three deadly bomb explosions rocked the city this month, but the Indian government has been careful not to finger Pakistani militants.","NEW: Pakistani foreign minister arrives in India .

"New York (CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Ja Rule turned himself to begin a two-year prison sentence Wednesday afternoon in New York. The rapper, whose real names is Jeffrey Atkins, pleaded guilty in December to attempted criminal possession of a weapon after police found a loaded semi-automatic firearm -- with the serial number scratched off -- hidden in the backseat of his luxury Maybach sedan, according to a statement from the Manhattan's district attorney. The incident occurred on New York's Upper West Side in July 2007, the statement said. He will be sent to New York's Rikers Island before being assigned to another facility in upstate New York, said his publicist, Courtney Barnes. In the months leading up to his surrender date, Atkins has been putting the finishing touches on a new album -- his first in six years -- that is scheduled to be released later this summer, Barnes said. Atkins has won MTV Video Music Awards, Source Awards, a BET Award, a GQ Man Of The Year Award, an NAACP Image Award, a World Music Award and a Teen Choice Award, according to the publicist's statement. He was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 2001. In an interview on the TV show ""Good Day New York"" this month, Atkins said growing up in Queens, he felt almost groomed for prison and knew ""a lot"" of friends who were locked up. In the interview, he said he regrets what his imprisonment will mean for his family. ""I've got three kids,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A wind-fed fire in southern Arizona grew dramatically Friday, racing down from canyons and gobbling parched grasslands and brush. Arizona and New Mexico were under red-flag alerts through the weekend as firefighters battled several blazes in Arizona. Conditions will be especially difficult Sunday at the Monument fire just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona, according to Glenn Lader of the National Weather Service office in Tucson. Relentless winds have spread the 18,580-acre fire that has torched at least 40 homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds Thursday. Evacuations of several areas continued Friday. The Monument fire has spread across the Huachuca Mountains near the Mexican border. The area is known as the ""Sky Islands"" region. ""These mountain 'islands,' forested ranges separated by vast expanses of desert and grassland plains, are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world,"" according to the Sky Island Alliance, a conservation group. Garry Foss, who operates Oaks of the Wild West nursery in Hereford, a community just east of the fire, said grasses 2 to 3 feet tall have not seen rain since December, making for a ready fire fuel source. Sierra Vista, home to the Army's Fort Huachuca, has had 0.13 inches of rain this year, according to Lader, compared with 2.5 to 3 inches in a normal year. There's no rain in the forecast. ""I'm trying to sit it out,"" Foss said, adding that he now has to drive east to Bisbee and northwest to reach Sierra Vista.  ""This grass is so dry."" Much of Highway 92 south of Sierra Vista was ordered closed. A brush fire was reported on Fort Huachuca . Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, meanwhile, issued emergency declarations for the Monument fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. High winds also could undo some of the progress made by crews battling the Wallow blaze, which has burned nearly a half-million acres in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. ""Yes, it is a threat. Anything could happen,"" said Terry Stemmler, a spokesman for the Southwest Incident Management Team. Crews are facing four straight days of red flag warnings that started Thursday with the return of strong winds to a dry region, Stemmler said. A red flag warning means weather conditions -- high winds and low humidity -- pose an extreme risk for fire. ""The hot, dry and windy weather coupled with the drought-stressed vegetation and heavy fuel loading in mixed conifer forests has the potential to create extreme fire behavior,"" officials with the Wallow fire team said. As of Friday morning, the Wallow fire had scorched 495,016 acres -- more than 770 square miles -- in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, the vast majority of it in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona, authorities said. The blaze, which is 33% contained, became the largest wildfire in Arizona history on Tuesday. CNN's Phil Gast, Samuel Gardner III and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The Monument fire in southern Arizona burns 18,580 acres .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Gregory Corbin was standing in San Francisco when Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called his cell phone. Yes, the mayor. Nutter was calling Corbin to congratulate him and his students for taking first place at the Brave New Voices poetry competition July 20-23 in San Francisco. Corbin, a social studies teacher and spoken-word poet, founded Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement to provide a positive outlet for teens in his hometown. Expressing loss, anger through 'slam' poetry . The four-day Brave New Voices festival and competition was created by Youth Speaks Inc. in 1998 after the inaugural Youth Speaks Teen Poetry Slam in San Francisco -- the first poetry competition (or slam) dedicated to youth in the nation's history. Since then, Brave New Voices has grown to include youth from across the United States and Europe, making it the largest ongoing spoken word event in the world. The Philadelphia team almost didn't make it past the first round. Dubbed the comeback kids by their mentors, they fought back from the bottom of each round, making it to the semifinals before sweeping the finals. ""That call was confirmation that what they did was bigger than them, it was a reflection on the city that needed something positive from its youth,"" said Corbin. ""The mayor has been very good to PYPM and has been very supportive."" The mayor did more than make a phone call. During the week leading up to the competition he invited the group to City Hall, where he had a surprise for them: $5,000 from the city, $5,000 from the Lomax Family Foundation and 20 round-trip airline tickets from Southwest. When young people step up to do the right thing, adults must step up to support them, Nutter said. ""These young people, expressing themselves creatively and positively, should be an inspiration to our entire city,"" he said. ""This sends a message to all young people in Philadelphia that if you work hard, if you are positive, and if you are supported then there is nothing that you cannot achieve."" Long hours of preparation . The close-knit group of Philadelphia teens spent weeks preparing for the competition, often practicing six days a week for sometimes up to six hours. ""It was their decision to put in this kind of work, it wasn't mandated by us,"" said Perry ""Vision"" Divirgilio, a performance coach and poetry movement mentor. ""We never had to push them because they didn't want to let anybody down."" Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement, ­ a 5-year-old nonprofit run entirely by volunteers, helps Philadelphia youth discover the power of their voices through spoken word and literary expression. The students spend their Saturdays throughout the year attending free writing workshops. There are monthly ""slams,"" regional performances and community service outings. The team returned to Philadelphia with very little fanfare, and the students went right back to attending Saturday writing workshops. Catching the attention of news outlets was the latest flash mob to plague the city in recent months. Flash mobs in the City of Brotherly Love aren't the singing and dancing kind uploaded to YouTube. Instead, flash mobs in Philadelphia are violent eruptions in which mobs of teens run through the streets attacking people and damaging property. Over the weekend, Philadelphia police arrested three juveniles and a 19-year-old on charges of assault, reckless endangerment and robbery after a rampaging mob struck the Center City area, causing minor injuries to two people, according to police. ""It's very frustrating. While that's going on we have kids who are waking up on Saturday to go to a writing workshop,"" Divirgilio said. ""It's hard to keep telling my kids to keep doing well when the ones causing problems get the attention."" A safe outlet . Kai Davis is still in disbelief that her team won. She joined the team in January after meeting up with a friend at one of the group's Saturday writing workshops. ""Winning wasn't on my mind, it was doing the best that we could,"" said Davis, an incoming high school senior who performed the poem ""Femininjas,"" a social critique on the harassment of women, at the finals alongside teammate Charmira Nelson. ""I have fallen in love with spoken word and don't want to stop writing."" The group provides a safe place for personal growth for youth who might otherwise have gone unnoticed, she said, adding that it is disappointing to have flash mobs be the face of Philadelphia youth. ""Most of the people in PYPM don't have a structured family, but it hasn't made them worse people,"" she said. ""They wouldn't be out shooting or getting in trouble, they'd be out there trying to survive."" Visiting San Francisco was the farthest Jamarr Hall has ever traveled from home. The group helped him find his voice, said Hall, a 19-year-old plumber's apprentice who graduated high school in June 2010. He joined the poetry group after hearing about it at an after-school poetry workshop hosted by his English class. ""It's a chance to show people what I can do on and off stage. I believe I have yet to reach my peak and I'm not stopping here,"" said Hall, whose mother died when he was 8.

"(CNN)  -- The mayor of Venezuela's capital on Tuesday was completing his fifth day of a hunger strike in protest of what he called harassment and interference from President Hugo Chavez. Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, shown in February, alleges many of his duties have been illegally usurped. Antonio Ledezma, mayor of Caracas, has been carrying out his protest inside the offices of the Organization of American States, where his demand was for the inter-American body to investigate allegations of illegal power-grabbing moves by the federal government. The secretary general of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, responded to the mayor in a phone conversation Tuesday, Ledezma adviser Milos Alcalay said in a news conference. Insulza agreed to meet with a group of mayors and governors of Venezuela who have made similar allegations against the Chavez government, Alcalay said. ""Respectfully, but categorically, [Ledezma] described a series of instances ... of increasing harassment in a systematic manner by the central power against the metropolitan mayor,"" Alcalay said. Politically, Caracas is split into five districts, each with its own mayor, and the city also has a metropolitan mayor who coordinates and oversees police, health and education. Chief among Ledezma's complaints was the creation in April of a ""head of government"" who, appointed by Chavez, took over many of the metropolitan mayor's duties in addition to offices and budget. As a result, Ledezma said his office does not have enough money left to pay all of his staff. Several workers from the mayor's office joined him in the hunger strike, according to the mayor's Web site. The president's supporters argue that the constitution gives the federal government the responsibility of administrating the capital. But in televised remarks last week, Ledezma held a copy of a law that dictates the duties that his office is supposed to hold. ""This law has been violated over and over again by the current government,"" Ledezma said. Ledezma is not the only opposition politician who has complained of being strong-armed by Chavez. Manuel Rosales, a former governor and presidential challenger to Chavez, fled the country in April after Chavez accused him of corruption. Rosales denied the charges. Earlier this year, former Venezuelan Defense Minister Raul Baduel, a Chavez ally-turned-critic, was arrested twice on charges that he stole $14 million from the armed forces. Baduel has denied the allegation and called the charges politically motivated.","Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma alleges his power was illegally diminished .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia police picked up 50 juveniles for violating the city's beefed-up curfew which took effect Friday night, authorities said Saturday. The City of Brotherly Love is cracking down after a rash of teen violence by roving mobs.  Late Friday, there were no signs of trouble, police spokesman Ray Evers told CNN. ""It definitely made a tremendous difference,"" he said, referring to the curfew. Police patrolled the two areas under curfew, including downtown areas popular with locals and tourists during the Friday night curfew.  The 50 teens are among the first charged with violating the newly strengthened city ordinance, which forbids anyone under 18 from being out on the street after 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays in two locations: Center City, in the downtown area, and University City, the west Philadelphia neighborhood where the University of Pennsylvania is located. An hour after the curfew took effect, police had taken 22 juveniles between the ages of 14 and 17 into custody, Evers said. All 50 minors were cited with a code violation for breaking the curfew, and were not allowed to leave the police precinct until they were picked up by a parent or guardian. All 50 were picked up by Saturday morning, Evers said. Mayor Michael Nutter announced the earlier curfew following a string of mob attacks by young people alerted to gatherings via email and social media. ""It's a growing problem in this country,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey said Friday. Nutter delivered tough remarks in a church sermon last weekend that has received international attention -- a blunt, no-excuses scolding that coincided with the start of the England riots. An African-American, Nutter noted that those involved in the Philadelphia attacks are predominantly black and said their behavior damaged themselves and their race. He upheld religious values, underscored the importance of parental discipline and lambasted absentee parents, particularly fathers, for neglecting and not keeping watch over their children. Nutter's measures target both young attackers and their parents or legal guardians. He signed an order temporarily moving the curfew up an hour on Fridays and Saturdays for everyone under the age of 18 in the two targeted enforcement districts. Throughout the rest of the city, the curfew will remain 10 p.m. for those under the age of 13 and midnight for minors between ages 13 and 18. ""Minors who are caught breaking curfew will be sent home, brought home or transported to a police station where their parents will be contacted. Minors may be issued a citation with a $100 to $300 fine for a first offense,"" the city said in a news  release. If parents don't come for their child ""within a reasonable time, police will contact the Department of Human Services to start an investigation."" Parents will receive a notice for first violations, and will be fined up to $500 for successive violations. They are also subject to imprisonment for up to 90 days for repeat curfew violation offenses, according to the city. In addition, parents ""whose child under the age of 18 is found liable or guilty by a court for injury, theft or other criminal acts"" will be liable to the person who suffered the injury or loss of property,"" the statement said.","NEW: Philadelphia police picked up 50 juveniles for violating a stricter curfew .

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic beat world number one Rafael Nadal to claim the Miami Masters 1000 title Sunday and maintain his winning start to 2011. Djokovic saw off Nadal 4-6 6-3 7-6 for his 24th straight victory since the start of the season, including the Australian Open title and two Masters crowns, both times at the expense of the Spaniard in close finals. After more than three hours of pulsating action, Nadal finally cracked in the third set tiebreaker at 2-2 when he served up a double fault. His Serbian opponent seized on the opening as he took five points in a row to hold four match points at 6-2. Nadal bravely saved two, but on the third a forehand winner gave Djokovic his second title at the prestigious hard court tournament. ""It was very close and it really could have gone either way,"" he said after lifting the trophy. ""It was one of the best finals I ever played in my life, and it's always a great pleasure and honor playing against Rafa, who is a good friend and a great champion."" Nadal, who will now turn to his favorite surface of clay as he defends his ranking against the fast rising number two Djokovic, conceded he had been second best. ""Today I had some good chances, but Novak was too good for me this afternoon,"" he said. A single break of service in each set saw the pair share the opening two sets, which were marked by punishing baseline rallies. The pattern continued in the third, with neither man able to break though on his opponent's service, setting the scene for the decisive tiebreaker. Both men had won their semifinal matches in straight sets, with Djokovic beating home hope Mardy Fish and Nadal dispatching former world number one Roger Federer.","Novak Djokovic beats Rafael Nadal to win Masters 1000 crown in Miami .

"(CNN) -- A knife-wielding man attacked a woman in a supermarket, eventually cutting off her head and running away with it, government officials in Spain's Tenerife Island said Friday. The man entered a shopping center in the town of Arona, in the Cristianos area of Tenerife, and stole a knife from the supermarket before attacking the apparent stranger, a central government spokeswoman said. Shopping center security guards were alerted and chased the man, subduing him until police arrived. The man, whom national police in Tenerife identified as a Bulgarian, was apparently known in the shopping area, the government spokeswoman said. The British Foreign and Commonwealth office confirmed Friday that a British national had died in Tenerife, part of the Canary Islands.

"Washington (CNN) -- Crowds filled the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington on Friday, as they regularly do during the summer months. This Friday, however, was different, as people lined up outside the building, waiting for the last launch in the shuttle program's 30-year history. Among them was Reagan Diesing, born in 2002, 21 years after the first shuttle launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The 9-year old Virginian, along with sister Ashlyn and mother Vicki, joined about 275 others who watched the last shuttle launch at the museum. ""It's sad,"" Reagan said. ""... I remember in school learning that everybody wanted to get to space and it was their dream and I am upset that they are just giving it up."" Standing outside the museum, C.C. Chapman of Boston also expressed regret. ""It is the end of an era.,"" he said. ""I remember the first shuttle and it is going away, unfortunately."" The crowd filled the Moving Beyond Earth room 30 minutes before the shuttle was scheduled to launch. Even nine minutes out, there was a buzz in the room as the countdown clock ticked closer to zero. Surrounded by models of the different shuttles and the International Space Station, people exchanged stories about shuttle launches, including some about seeing one at the Kennedy Space Center. ""I remember being a toddler and watching some of the first launches at home in my living room with my family,"" said Jamie Mitchell from Washington. ""And I finally did have a chance to go witness a launch in February of this year, saw the last launch of Discovery, and there is nothing like that."" With a reported 70 percent chance the shuttle would not launch on Friday, people were happy that the countdown passed the five-minute mark. Then the four, the three the two and the one. All was going according to plan when, at 31 seconds, the countdown stopped. Air was sucked from the room, people fretted that they might not witness the historic moment Friday. ""I was a little scared when the countdown stopped,"" Reagan said. But it wasn't long before the clock was running again. As the timer hit 10, people began to count along with the NASA announcer. Six, five, four. People began to cheer. Three, two, one. The room burst into applause, the engines kicked in and people began to celebrate. The museum curators looked in awe. Children's mouths gaped at the sight. Their parents smiled, perhaps reminiscing about the time they were young and as amazed by a shuttle launch. ""It was bittersweet,"" said Vicki Diesing, ""I was worried that it wouldn't go off because of the weather, but when they stopped the countdown at 30 seconds, you are kind of holding your breath to see if it would really go off.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Sectarian violence flared up Saturday in Londonderry as Protestants continued their annual marching season in this predominantly Catholic city in Northern Ireland. Violence erupted earlier in the day in the city -- also known as Derry to some residents -- when masked youths attacked police vehicles with petrol bombs and a pipe bomb, setting fire to and hijacking a number of vehicles. The clashes followed the annual Apprentice Boys' parade, when about 10,000 Protestants marched in remembrance of the 1689 anniversary of the siege of Derry by England's Catholic ruler James II. Police said protesters hurled several dozen petrol bombs early Saturday and a mail van was later hijacked and set on fire as the main parade started. The Police Service of Northern Ireland warned members of the public to avoid the area. Three people have been charged in connection with the disorder, with several more arrested, police said. The area was later reported quiet, with local sources describing the earlier violence as ""sustained rioting during a short period of time."" However, there was further sporadic violence later in the evening. Derry's hard-line Catholic, republican-nationalist groups opposed to the Irish peace process have reacted violently in previous years to these annual Protestant marches, seeing them as provocations. Protestant groups claim they have the right to follow their centuries-old tradition. There was  rioting earlier in the summer with some of the worst violence in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast following a parade by the main Protestant marching organisation, the Orange Order. The province suffered decades of violence known locally as the Troubles, in which more than 3,500 people were killed before a 1998 peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement. The Troubles pitted mostly Catholic republicans, who want the province to become part of the Republic of Ireland, against pro-British loyalists, who are mostly Protestant. This year has been one of the most violent since the Good Friday Agreement.","Protestants march in Londonderry, a predominantly Catholic city .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo's stunning extra-time header gave Jose Mourinho his first trophy as Real Madrid coach on Wednesday, winning the Spanish Cup final 1-0 against arch-rivals Barcelona. Real went to Valencia seeking a first Copa del Rey triumph since 1993, and the 42nd goal this season by the world's most expensive player handed the club an 18th success in the competition. The Portugal captain rose high at the far post to power in a 103rd-minute effort from a teasing cross by Angel Di Maria, who was sent off for a second booking at the end of the second spell of extra time. It was Ronaldo's second goal in two games against Barca, having netted a late equalizing penalty in Saturday's 1-1 draw that left the Catalans eight points clear in La Liga. Is Real Madrid's Mourinho the master of mind games? Mourinho employed the defensive midfield formation he used in that second ""El Clasico"" clash this season between the two teams, who will meet again in the semifinals of the European Champions League next Wednesday. The tactic paid off as Real had the better of the first half of regulation play, and converted midfielder Pepe came closest to breaking the deadlock with a thumping header that hit the post in the 44th minute. Barcelona battled back into the game in the second half, and had the ball in the net with 69 minutes gone but Pedro was ruled to have been marginally offside as he gathered a superb pass from Lionel Messi. Captain Iker Casillas then saved Real with superb efforts to deny Messi and Pedro in rapid succession, and the match went to extra time. Ten-man Madrid deny Barcelona in Clasico . Madrid waited for counter-attacking opportunities, and the first came in the 98th minute as Ronaldo raced clear before driving just wide of Jose Manuel Pinto's far post. But he made no mistake five minutes later as Di Maria combined well down the left with Marcelo and delivered the perfect cross. The Argentine departed the scene in time added on, but Barcelona did not make anything of the resulting free-kick and Pep Guardiola's team -- seeking an overall 26th triumph -- could not force a penalty shootout. It gave Mourinho his first victory over Barca since taking charge at Real, and went some way to avenging the 5-0 thrashing at the Nou Camp in the first half of the season. He has now won a trophy in every country in which he has coached -- his native Portugal, England, Italy and now Spain. Meanwhile, AC Milan had to come from behind to secure a 2-2 draw at home to Palermo in the first leg of their Coppa Italia semifinal on Wednesday. Zlatan Ibrahimovic put Milan ahead in the fourth minute on the day he failed to overturn a three-match Serie A ban for swearing in the direction of a linesman. The Swedish striker, who missed Saturday's 3-0 win over Sampdoria that put Milan six points clear in the league, volleyed home from close range at the far post from Massimo Oddo's deep cross. Argentine forward Javier Pastore leveled 10 minutes later after combining well with Maurizio Pinilla, and young Uruguayan strike partner Abel Hernandez followed up his weekend double from the win over Roma to make it 2-1 in the 53rd minute with a fierce shot that went in off the crossbar. However, Urby Emanuelson equalized with 14 minutes to play after Ibrahimovic ran into the box and the ball ran loose to the Dutchman. Pastore could have restored Palermo's lead ahead of the second leg in Sicily on May 10 but goalkeeper Marco Amelia made a fine save to deny him. Cup holders Inter Milan will take a 1-0 lead into the May 11 home leg of their semi against Roma after Dejan Stankovic scored the only goal at the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday in a repeat scoreline of last year's final.","Real Madrid win Copa del Rey for the 18th time, beating Barcelona 1-0 final .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in negotiations with the African Union, has agreed in principal to a deal that would end the conflict in the nation he's ruled for 42 years, South African President Jacob Zuma told reporters Sunday. Negotiations remained under way Sunday night between Gadhafi and the African Union delegation. Details of the agreement were not available, though it is believed to include an immediate ceasefire in the nearly two-month long war between Gadhafi's forces and those fighting to unseat him. In his comments, Zuma also discussed an end to NATO airstrikes aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and targeting Gadhafi's troops. After staying overnight in Tripoli, the African Union delegation will fly Monday to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with opposition leaders there. Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way. Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council. As such, opposition leaders have voiced skepticism that mediation would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals, which include Gadhafi's ouster. Tony Blair's take on Libya . The African Union's special committee on Libya is represented by Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Uganda as well as Zuma's South Africa. As Gadhafi left one meeting at his compound in Tripoli, he made a rare public appearance for international media before riding off in a car as he waved to supporters near his tent. The leader then entered a second meeting with the delegation. Earlier Sunday, Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz told journalists that the meetings ""will discuss the ways to resolve the crisis in Libya, and our main goal is to stop the military operations and find adequate solutions for the problem between our Libyan brothers,"" according to a Mauritanian news agency. Report tracks ""sweeping changes"" in Mideast . After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces, Libyan rebel fighters this weekend recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya after apparently holding off Gadhafi's better-equipped forces. In a hospital, witnesses told CNN on Saturday that three of Gadhafi's fighters who were killed were carrying identification cards from Syria, Algeria and Chad. Meanwhile, in Misrata, NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city overnight and Sunday, an eyewitness told CNN, who did not want to be named for security reasons. At least eight people were killed and 22 injured from Saturday's fighting between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels, according to medical sources in the city. On Sunday, two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-Gadhafi snipers near the city center, another eyewitness said. The rebels were able to recover the bodies of 15 such snipers shot earlier Sunday. The snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings, the eyewitness said. NATO airstrikes on Sunday hit various positions in and around the city, destroying 14 tanks, the eyewitness said. Sporadic fighting continued Sunday, but had decreased from recent days as the airstrikes kept pro-Gadhafi forces busy. Graffiti artist killed in Libya . Some youths, captured in recent days by rebels, said they were teenagers and secondary-school students who had been forced to leave their homes in nearby towns and villages and undergo mandatory weeklong military training before fighting in Misrata, according to the second eyewitness. Pro-Gadhafi forces continued shelling parts of the city Sunday morning, the eyewitness said. A steel mill near the port was targeted but the port is now under rebel control, eyewitnesses said. However, the port still holds about 4,000 foreign workers who are trying to leave the city. Civilians living in the western sections of Misrata have been forced to leave their homes and have gathered in schools and friends' and relatives' homes near the city center, eyewitnesses said. In a statement Saturday, NATO said its aircraft destroyed pro-Gadhafi ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities. The alliance also made attacks on armored vehicles near Misrata and Ajdabiya, NATO said. Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya. ""There were some 50 regime pickup trucks with machine guns and rocket launchers that attempted to enter Ajdabiya,"" Abdulmolah said. ""The helicopters destroyed several of the trucks, and the rest took off."" Abdulmolah did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in Saturday's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with NATO. NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack. The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters. Among the participants will be Catherine Ashton, the representative for foreign affairs and security for the European Union. While Gadhafi has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent days, state TV aired images Saturday of the leader visiting what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli. The anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked. But NATO said in its statement that Gadhafi's forces continue to use civilians as human shields. ""We have observed horrific examples of regime forces deliberately placing their weapons systems close to civilians, their homes and even their places of worship,"" said Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard, commander of NATO's Operation Unified Protector. ""Troops have also been observed hiding behind women and children. This type of behavior violates the principles of international law and will not be tolerated.""

"(CNN) -- The long-running saga of Cesc Fabregas' move from Arsenal to Barcelona is finally nearing a conclusion with the 24-year-old expected to join the European champions early next week. Rumors were rife in both the English and Spanish media that Fabregas was jetting over to Spain on Friday to complete a $57 million move to the Catalan giants. However, with Barcelona facing rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, it is now believed Fabregas will make the journey on Sunday in preparation for the move to be completed early next week. Big kick-off: Who will win Europe's top leagues? Fabregas joined Arsenal in 2003, after spending his youth career at Barca's famous La Masia academy, and helped the club beat Manchester United to win the FA Cup in 2005. He was also in the Arsenal side that lost to Barcelona in the Champions League final in Paris in 2006. However, he has never hidden his desire to return to his boyhood club at some stage of his career -- and that wish now seems on the verge of being realised. The Spanish World Cup midfielder will be Barca coach Pep Guardiola's second signing in the current transfer window, following the acquisition of Chile winger Alexis Sanchez from Italian Serie A side Udinese. Reports in the British press have suggested Fabregas might not be the last high-profile player to leave the Gunners this off-season, with France's Samir Nasri tipped to move to Manchester City. Fabregas plays alongside many of his potential new teammates for Vicente del Bosque's national side and was part of Spain's victorious squads in South Africa last year and at the European Championships in 2008. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has added three new faces to his squad, with Ivory Coast striker Gervinho arriving from Lille and teenagers Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson arriving from Southampton and Charlton respectively. And, on Friday, Arsenal confirmed on their official website they had agreed to sign 19-year-old Costa Rican striker Joel Campbell. In other transfer news, Liverpool have completed the signing of Newcastle's Spanish left-back Jose Enrique for a fee in the region of $10 million .","Cesc Fabregas is expected to complete his transfer to Barcelona next week .

"(CNN) -- Rescue teams continued scouring waters off Mexico's coast Thursday, searching for seven Americans on a fishing expedition missing since a boat capsized over the weekend. None of the missing had been spotted by Thursday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read told CNN. But he said officials believe they could have survived, helped by warm water temperatures and calm seas. ""Conditions are probably about as good as we can expect,"" he said. One American was killed when the boat with more than 40 people aboard sunk early Sunday in the Sea of Cortez, near Isla San Luis, Mexico, authorities said. Sixteen of 19 Americans that have been rescued returned to the United States Thursday, the government of Mexico's Baja California state said. Three rescued Americans remained in Mexico as the search continued, the government said. Relatives of the seven missing Americans are seeking donations to help continue rescue efforts after Mexican and U.S. teams end the official search. The search has been extended indefinitely, Mexican officials said Thursday. It had originally been scheduled to stop around 2 a.m. Thursday, 96 hours after the boat capsized. The situation has drawn attention from officials in California, the home state of many of the missing. On Wednesday a group of California lawmakers urged federal officials to encourage Mexican authorities to keep searching. ""With the warm weather conditions, we believe the missing family members may be able to survive for additional days at sea or on one of the many islands in the region,"" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert Papp. Family spokesman Frederick Han -- whose 52-year-old father-in-law, Donald Lee, is among the missing -- said he was holding out hope. ""If we know there are still people out there who are going to make the effort to search for them, then we maintain the hope that they're going to be found,"" he said Wednesday. Han said relatives have urged U.S. authorities to play a greater role, and have been getting the word out about the situation online at findourfathers.blogspot.com. Family members also launched a Facebook page ""Find Our Fathers"" and a PayPal account for donations to help with the search and rescue efforts. U.S. and Mexican teams are part of the search, as the boat was carrying citizens of both nations. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 Hercules aircraft searched a 300-square-mile area near Isla San Luis Thursday. The plane will search the area again Friday, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard said in a statement Thursday that it had searched 1,400 square miles of ocean and land since the Mexican Navy requested assistance in the operation. U.S. authorities identified the American tourist who died as Leslie Yee. In addition to Lee, the missing also include Albert Mein, Russell Bautista, Mark Dorland, Brian Wong, Gene J. Leong and Shawn Chaddock. U.S. and Mexican authorities said there were 43 people on the boat when it sank. The U.S. Coast Guard originally said 44 people were onboard, but changed their number after learning that one person listed on the manifest had never boarded the boat. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","A Coast Guard officer says none of the missing have been spotted .

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber said he ignored team orders not to attack Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel in the closing stages of Sunday's British Grand Prix. Webber, 34, was sat in third position and closing in on world championship leader Vettel in second when he was told over the team radio to ""maintain the gap"" between himself and his German colleague. The result meant Vettel, 24, extended his lead at the top of the drivers' standings to 80 points, despite Ferrari's Fernando Alonso taking the checkered flag to claim the Italian marque's first grand prix victory since October 2010. But Webber, who is second in the standings, told a post-race press conference he paid no attention to the messages from the team garage. Passing judgment: Hamilton must stay aggressive . ""I am not fine with it. No. That's the answer to that,"" the Australian said when asked if he understood the team's decision. ""If Fernando retires on the last lap we are battling for the victory so I was fine until the end. Of course I ignored the team as I want to try and get another place. Seb was doing his best and I was doing my best. ""I don't want to crash with anyone, but that was it. I tried to do my best with the amount of conversation I had. One-way conversation obviously as I wasn't talking too much back. ""There was a lot of traffic coming to me, but I was still trying to do my best to pass the guy in front."" Alonso wins for Ferrari at Silverstone . Webber took maximum points in last year's race at Silverstone and, in the wake of his triumph, suggested he was frustrated with a perceived number two driver status at the British-based Red Bull team. When asked if he still felt reigning world champion Vettel received preferential treatment in 2011, Webber responded: ""Not really. I just want to race to the end, so with four or five laps to the end, they started to chat to me about holding my position. ""Of course, they want the points, but I also need to try and get some more points as well."" Standings after the British Grand Prix . Vettel, who became the sport's youngest-ever champion when he clinched the 2010 crown, said he did not feel Webber had gifted him his second-place finish. ""I think we were racing,"" said Vettel. ""It was not a scheduled 'I move right, you move left, I move left, you move right, I brake here, you brake there.' ""As Mark said, he stayed flat out and tried to race me, as hard as he could, didn't find his way past. To me, at this stage, it's quite amusing.""

It's a partnership between a group called 21st Century Leaders and the staff of CNN and CNN Student News; and what it does is bring about 75 of Georgia's brightest high school students to the Georgia Tech campus, where they spend a week learning about everything from journalism to, of course, leadership skills. PRISSY STEWART, 21ST CENTURY LEADERS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: That's our goal, is to help them become more comfortable as leaders. You can tell as the week progresses they have come out of their shells, they have taken some risks and learned to work with people who are very different from them. AZUZ: I had the honor and privilege of kicking things off. I talked a little bit about how I got to where I am, what we do at CNN, and some students then talked to us about their first impressions as the week started. LEJOI LANE, SENIOR: I think that what stood out most to me was the fact that we got the chance to meet so many unique people and so many different genres of CNN. TYLER MEUSE, SENIOR: Being able to sit down and talk to professionals one-on-one and ask them the most important questions. BROOKE VAUGHAN, SENIOR: What stood out to me the most was Carl Azuz. His speech was great. I love how he asked questions and actually got the audience involved in us as students. He actually cared about our answers and cared to have a conversation with normal high school students. AZUZ: As things got rolling, students learned about many different facets of media. We talked to them about some of the new technologies available to us. We talked about how social networking gets used in newscasts. These were their impressions of that. EMILY CHO, SENIOR: I learned a lot about how you have to balance between the social media and what actual news is. It's a big question as to which one comes first: determining what your audience wants to hear and what they need to hear. GRACE LITTLE, SENIOR: This panel showed me just how much social media influences the way news gets around the world, especially in areas that don't allow CNN to have cameras on the ground. It's truly essential in making accurate news reporting. PHILIP MUSEY, SENIOR: I learned that CNN uses Twitter a lot. You hear a lot about younger generations using Facebook, but Twitter is pretty well known and well used at CNN. AZUZ: A big highlight of this conference happened right here at the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Students got to listen to a dinner panel of CNN talent and executives, and they heard a few things about work and life. OLA RICHARDSON, JUNIOR: Something I really learned is that the friends you get here are the friends that you will need in life. VICTORIA PARKS, JUNIOR: Definitely that just be yourself and you can be whoever you want to be, and you can do whatever you want to do. Just follow your dreams and pursue yourself. RED DENTY, JUNIOR: Keep working at it. If you want to work in video broadcasting, you have to start low and work your way up. CHANDLER BARRE, JUNIOR: You have to have your hook and the one thing that sets yourself apart from everybody else, and make yourself the one that is remembered. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who is credited with saying, ""Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other""? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Mahatma Gandhi, B) John F. Kennedy, C) Martin Luther King Jr. or D) Abraham Lincoln? You've got three seconds -- GO! That quote about leadership comes from former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Leadership Unplugged . AZUZ: Of course, the name of the program: Leadership Unplugged. A big focus is learning what it takes to be a leader. Here's what students said about that in their own words. GABRIELLE PUYAT, GRADUATED AS A JUNIOR: You have to be able to connect with all different kinds of people. And not everyone's going to like you; you're not going to like everyone. But if you have the ability to communicate and cooperate, then you can lead. FIRST BORN, JUNIOR: I think leadership is the ability to stand out above other people and give them a sense of belonging. As a leader, I don't think that you're able to have everyone like you. MACHMUD MAKHMUDOV, JUNIOR: If you want to be exceptional and create something and be really successful, you really need to persevere as a leader. And know that even though you might be going through tough times, in the end, true leaders do what it takes to be successful. AZUZ: This was the 6th year for Leadership Unplugged, but this was the first year that some of the students actually got to go on the air live on a CNN network. A few of the students were interviewed by Carlos Montero, an anchor with CNN en Espanol. CAMILA DONOSO, SENIOR: He just asked us about how we liked it and everyone was a little nervous. He said it was good. The captions were really funny because it said, you know, ""young leaders changing the world."" And we're like, ""Oh my God!"" But if you think about it, we are, because we're making a difference. Winners . AZUZ: These 75 students were divided into groups and they were given a project to work on throughout the week. That project was to pitch a story to a panel of CNN executives, so a little bit intimidating there. But they were scored on their pitch, and they were scored on things like the presentation itself, how creative the story was, how balanced the story was. And the winning pitch was a story about illegal immigration in the United States. Some members of that winning group talked to us about what it was like to win. JUSTIN WHITE, JUNIOR: I was actually afraid that we hadn't won, but when they called our name, I just knew we had it. ADEOLA ADENIRAN, SENIOR: Yeah, I was really excited. But I knew that, like, deep down, that we might have a chance because of our title. Our title was really powerful: ""Undocumented and Unafraid."" It gave me a little hope there. Goodbye . AZUZ: So, that was how the week wrapped up, and that is how we wrap up this special summer edition of CNN Student News. We hope to lead you back to CNNStudentNews.com, and that you'll plug in for more stories right here throughout the summer. Hope to see you soon. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","CNN Student News is producing special, web-only shows all summer long .

"London (CNN) -- A former New York and Los Angeles police chief will advise the British government on tackling the street gangs blamed for the violence that raged nationwide this week. Bill Bratton, who had private talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday, said there are lessons from the United States that were relevant to the situation in England. Large numbers of police will be on the streets over the weekend following widespread rioting and looting in London and other cities, including Birmingham and Manchester at the start of the week. Five deaths are believed to be linked to the unrest. Police have arrested more than 2,200 people around the country, many of whom have already appeared before magistrates. Hearings are being held round-the-clock in some courts to deal with the large numbers charged. The violence first broke out in north London's Tottenham neighborhood a week ago after a protest over the death of a local man, Mark Duggan. He was shot after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped a cab carrying the 29-year-old father of four. Riots and looting spread across London and other cities, at a huge cost to local businesses and communities. London's Metropolitan Police said Saturday they had charged a man with handling stolen goods after recovering electrical products worth £40,000 ($65,000) in Tottenham. Street gangs are ""at the heart of all the violence,"" Cameron told an emergency Parliament session Thursday, citing evidence of their ties to police attacks and looting. Cameron said he had asked senior government ministers to work ""on a cross-government program of action to deal with this gang culture"" to report back to Parliament in October. ""I also believe we should be looking beyond our shores to learn the lessons from others who have faced similar problems,"" he said. ""That is why I will be discussing how we can go further in getting to grips with gangs with people like Bill Bratton."" Cameron's Downing Street office said he had spoken to Bratton Friday after the former police chief agreed to take part in a series of meetings on tackling gangs in the fall. ""Bill Bratton, who has long-standing links with British policing, will be providing this advice in a personal capacity and on an unpaid basis,"" a Downing Street statement said. Bratton, who since 2009 has worked for private security consultancy Altegrity and its subsidiary Kroll, is seen as having taken bold steps to cut crime rates in New York and Los Angeles. ""I would certainly be in a position to discuss the contemporary American experience and my work in these areas -- in particular the successes that created real reductions in gang-related crime in Boston, New York and most recently in Los Angeles, where we also saw significant improvements in the relations between the police and the city's diverse communities,"" he said in a statement on Kroll's website Friday. ""There are many lessons from these experiences that I believe are relevant to the current situation in England."" Bratton said he believed the British government could overcome the problem, adding: ""I support their resolve to seize upon this difficult situation as an opportunity to address the issues of gangs and gang violence and the resulting fear and disorder head-on."" While there have been sporadic incidents of disorder, London has been calm since Tuesday morning and other cities since early Wednesday. About 16,000 officers -- many more than usual -- are expected to remain on London's streets through the weekend. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned against stirring up more trouble over the weekend, urging anyone planning to do so to ""think again."" In Birmingham, where three young men were killed in a hit-and-run this week thought to be connected to the unrest, community groups are planning a ""peace rally"" Sunday, West Midlands Police said. The uncle of two of the men killed, Abdullah Khan, told reporters in Birmingham on Saturday that the loss of Shazad Ali and Abdul Musavir had ""left our entire family in shock and devastation."" He went on: ""All they wanted to do was to protect their business and other businesses within the community. I remember talking to Shazad a few days before this tragic incident and he was excited and was looking forward to the birth of his first child in a few months' time. but that was not meant to be. ""A father will never hold his child, a child will never be held by his father, a wife without a husband, parents who have lost two sons. Words can never express what we are going through at this moment."" Khan said the family did not want anyone else to suffer in the same way and appealed for witnesses to come foward. ""All we want now is justice for our family. This was not... about race, this was not religion. This was about a pure criminal act."" Home Secretary Theresa May announced Friday that a march planned for Saturday by the English Defence League, a far-right group, had been banned. ""It is clear that a ban is needed to ensure communities and property are protected,"" she said Friday. Officers would be deployed to Telford, the venue of the march, she said. Meanwhile, Cameron has angered some senior police officers by saying he thought that initially there were ""simply far too few police deployed onto the streets"" in London, and that ""the tactics they were using weren't working."" ""Police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened,"" he said Thursday. ""Initially, the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue rather than essentially one of crime."" CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 2,200 people have been arrested since the disorder erupted a week ago .

"London, England (CNN) -- Three-time ATP World Tour Finals champion Boris Becker predicted on Monday that world number two Roger Federer will win the season-ending contest between the men's top eight players, which takes place at the 02 Arena in London this week.   After winning the Australian Open in January, the 16-time Grand Slam champion has had a disappointing season by his usual standards, failing to reach the final stage of the three other majors.   But former world number one Becker has picked the Swiss to finish the year in style with victory at the event, and be crowned year-end champion.   Federer has already had one win over seventh-ranked David Ferrer in the round-robin competition, and will face Great Britain's Andy Murray on Tuesday and Sweden's Robin Soderling on Thursday, before potentially progressing to the semifinal stage.   ""He is a proud man, he really wants to end the year on a high and wants to show [world number one Rafael] Nadal that he is still going to be around for next year -- so I actually pick him to win the tournament,"" the German, champion in1988, 1992 and 1995 told CNN's World Sport program.   ""But it is very different to a Grand Slam here -- any match you play in could be a potential Grand Slam final so there are no easy matches.""   The six-time major winner added that he did not expect Federer to dominate tennis in the way he has for the last few years, and could expect to be continually challenged by Spanish rival Nadal as well as the other top players.   ""Nobody dominates like that for five or six years; that was unusual. The fact that there is competition is good for tennis and for the audience -- you want to see tough rivalries.   ""Nadal has had one of the greatest years of tennis ever, winning three Grand Slams -- this man is amazing.""   Becker also said that he was impressed so far by the performance of Murray -- who beat Soderling in straight sets in his opening match -- despite the pressure on the Scot's shoulders to win on home soil.   ""I was surprised by the way he beat Soderling -- he played his best match in a while yesterday with the home crowd behind him. Andy played very well.   ""Its more pressure for Murray playing here but you have got be able to handle the pressure to win.""","Boris Becker picks Roger Federer to win the ATP World Tour Finals .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will on Friday begin enforcing an evacuation order on a 20-kilometer zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top government official said. The restriction --in place since the early days of the nuclear disaster -- has often been ignored. Many of the about 78,000 people who have homes in the evacuation zone have gone back in recent weeks to retrieve belongings, and check on farms and businesses. No one will be allowed within 3 kilometers of the crippled nuclear facility and entry within 20 kilometers of the plant will be highly regulated, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. People who temporarily return to their homes, businesses and farms must wear a protective suit and ride into the restricted zone on a designated bus. The time limit for such visits will be two hours and everyone who enters will be required to go through a decontamination process. The stricter enforcement within the zone is necessary ""to guarantee the health and safety of the people,"" Edano said previously, noting that Tokyo will work with local officials in closing the zone. Edano said the government plans to designate the area an ""alert zone"" under Japanese laws governing disaster response, a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area. Police are currently stationed at checkpoints leading into the area, but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer. A CNN crew entered the area for a short time Wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20-km (12.5-mile) boundary. He said his father was considering returning home -- but as a young, unmarried man, he was considering quitting the farm his family has worked for three generations. ""I'm concerned about the impact on my health,"" said the farmer, who declined to be named. ""I wish I could trust the government, but I can't."" The disaster, now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, occurred when the Fukushima Daiichi plant was struck by the March 11 tsunami that devastated northern Japan, knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., said Thursday that a meltdown could be taking place at the troubled facility, but also acknowledged that there's no way to know for sure. TEPCO told CNN that it cannot say that the nuclear fuel rods at the three reactors have never melted or that they are not melting right now, nor can the company say for certain that the rods have melted or are melting now. The Japanese government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20-km zone. But journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour. By comparison, a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year. One reporter who came within 2 kilometers of the power plant in early April recorded a dose of about a tenth of a millisievert per hour -- high enough to increase the long-term risk of cancer with prolonged exposure, but a tiny fraction of the dose that would induce radiation sickness.","Evacuation order covers zone within 20-kilometers of the nuclear plant .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A man causing a disturbance outside a movie theater near Universal Studios died Friday after being handcuffed and shocked with a Taser stun gun, Orlando police said. Two off-duty officers who were working security in the area tried to deal with a man who was acting ""irrational,"" early Friday morning, said Sgt. Barb Jones, an Orlando police spokeswoman. The suspect -- identified as Adam Spencer Johnson, 33, of Winter Haven, Florida -- began to ""violently"" resist after one of the officers tried to detain him, Jones said. An officer shocked the man with a Taser stun gun, then he was handcuffed, police said. While on the ground, Johnson became unresponsive. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officers involved were placed on routine administrative leave pending an investigation of the deaths, according to police. CNN's Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.","NEW: Dead man identified by police as 33-year-old Winter Haven, Florida, resident .

"Nicosia, Cyprus (CNN) -- Two top Cyprus officials resigned Monday after an explosion at a naval base killed at least 12 people in the island nation, state radio reported. Defense Minister Costas Papacostas and National Guard Chief Petros Tsalikides resigned, Cyprus state radio said. About 50 people were wounded in the blast at the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base at Zygi, the station said. Among the dead are five firefighters and two sailors. A grass fire spread to the base, setting dozens of crates of gunpowder on fire and causing the blast, the station said. Greece's defense ministry announced Monday that it was sending a C-27 aircraft and military experts to help authorities with their investigation of the blast. The explosion knocked out power at the neighboring Vasilikos Power Station, the nation's largest electricity plant, the power company said. State radio reported that 40% of the island was without power and government officials were making arrangements for generators to be shipped into the country. In the meantime, the nation's other two power stations were ""trying to meet the demand,"" said Costas Gavrielides, a spokesman for the country's electricity authority. Roads leading to the base have been blocked off, with no one allowed to enter or leave, the news agency said. ""Today is a black day for the Cypriot democracy and its people because of the loss of lives of our compatriots and injuries,"" said President Demetris Christofias. ""I offer my condolences to the families of those who died in the line of duty.""

"(CNN) -- Two rain-soaked practice sessions for Sunday's British Grand Prix have left Formula One teams guessing what effect recent rule changes will have on this year's world championship battle. Motorsport's ruling body, the FIA, has introduced rules banning the use of off-throttle blown diffusers, a technique used by drivers to increase downforce and therefore increase the speed of the car. But the impact of the law changes was hard to gauge on Friday as drivers wrestled with a wet Silverstone track. Red Bull's Mark Webber, who won the corresponding race in 2010, setting the fastest time of the day during the opening session. Ferrari's Felipe Massa was quickest in the afternoon, more than three seconds slower than the Australian's earlier best. Passing judgment: Hamilton must stay aggressive . Webber's teammate and the current leader of the drivers' standings, Sebastian Vettel, struggled to ascertain the impact of the new restrictions, with conditions frequently changing at the newly-renovated English circuit. ""The circuit was changing a lot today,"" world champion Vettel told Formula One's official web site after being 13th fastest and then 18th. ""So it was hard to find out too much and understand the effect of the changes introduced this weekend, but we will learn more tomorrow."" Sunday's race will represent a home grand prix for McLaren and their British driver Jenson Button, who is 77 points behind Vettel in the drivers' championship and has never finished higher than fourth at the Northamptonshire circuit. Vettel takes the quiet road to glory . The 2009 world champion was disappointed to miss out on a chance to assess his car's performance under the new regulations ahead of Saturday's qualifying sessions. ""Today was a bit of a frustrating day for me,"" said the 31-year-old, who was 15th in the morning and then fifth. ""We thought we'd get some good running under our belts this afternoon, but the rain meant that didn't happen, and we didn't really get a chance to evaluate everything. ""Hopefully, it's not going to rain for the rest of the weekend, so we should be able to get a better read on how the new interpretations of the regulations will affect us from tomorrow. ""We don't really know if our new rear wing is an improvement over the older version. It has a different downforce level, but I'm still not sure what we're going to run for the rest of the weekend."" F1 championship standings . Massa's teammate Fernando Alonso has triumphed once before at Silverstone, in 2006 while he was a two-time world champion at Renault, and was runner-up the year before and then again in 2007 in his only season at McLaren. ""It's always nice to come to Silverstone, an historic track for Formula One and for Ferrari, which took its first championship race win here 60 years ago,"" the Spaniard said. ""I like the new paddock, the only strange thing is the final part of the pit lane, which is lower than the track -- which means the spectators cannot see the pit stops from the grandstands. ""The rain definitely did not help on a day that was meant to allow us mainly to test the new aerodynamic components we have here. Only at the end of the first session did I risk trying a set of slicks to see if the conditions were acceptable, but the track was still too wet.""","F1 drivers unsure of likely effects of rule changes after wet weather hampers practice .

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic wasted little time in breezing through to the second round of the French Open with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Thiemo De Bakker in Paris Monday. The victory extends Djokovic's remarkable winning streak since the start of the year to 38, four short of the record held by John McEnroe from 1984. Djokovic's overall winning run, taking in the end of last season, extends to 40 and if he claims the French Open title he will tie Guillermo Villas for the all-time record of 46. The Serbian took just one hour 32 minutes to claim a 6-2 6-1 6-3 victory on the Philipe Chartrier court at Roland Garros, breaking his young opponent at will with another commanding display. Djokovic will face either French wild card Benoit Paire or Romania's Victor Hanescu for a place in the last 32. ""It's my favorite grand slam, even though I haven't won it yet,"" Djokovic told gathered reporters. ""I've been playing really well on clay. I've won three tournaments (on clay) in the last few weeks, so I'm trying to build on that confidence,"" he added. Djokovic won the opening grand slam of the season in Australia and has claimed six other titles, including four Masters events. Roger Federer joined Djokovic in the second round after he dispatched Spaniard Feliciano Lopez with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 victory in the next match on the main court. A single break of service in each of the first two sets put the Swiss maestro in command and he closed out the deciding tiebreaker 7-3 to progress. Federer and Djokovic are on collision course for a semifinal meeting, but the danger in their portion of the draw may well lie with Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro. The former U.S Open champion won a tight battle with Croat Ivo Karkovic to go through 6-7 6-3 7-5 6-4 after three and a half hours and he could meet Djokovic in the third round. But sixth seed Tomas Berdych was a first day casualty, crashing out to 31-year-old Frenchman Stephane Robert. Berdych was broken in the 15th game of the fifth and deciding set as Robert pulled off a stunning 3-6 3-6 6-2 6-2 9-7 victory. Rafael Nadal, under pressure from Djokovic for the No.1 ranking, opens his bid for a sixth French Open title Tuesday against big-serving American John Isner.","NEW: Roger Federer beats Feliciano Lopez in French Open first round .

"(WIRED)  -- The Verizon Wireless 4G network has been lauded as lightning-fast. Now, the company is launching a second phone that will work with its speeds. The Samsung-built Droid Charge launched on Verizon on Saturday, joining the Thunderbolt, HTC's flagship device. In our tests, the Thunderbolt delivered some of the highest data-transfer speeds we've seen. But Verizon's 4G network recently went down across the country, which raises the question: Is the company ready for another 4G phone? For a period of more than 30 hours from April 26 through 28, Verizon customers experienced nationwide downtime on the company's 4G LTE network. Those using Thunderbolt smartphones were the first to spot the problem, as they were only able to receive 3G or even 2G connections. Since 4G only handles data transfer, voice and text messaging services were not affected. The Droid Charge was originally slated for release the same weekend as the outage. Samsung's addition to the Droid brand is only the second phone to run on Verizon's 4G network, giving those that don't want to buy the Thunderbolt a bit of choice. Aside from the manufacturer, however, the phones differ little in hardware specs. Both have 4.3-inch displays, front- and back-facing cameras with the same resolutions (1.3 and 8 megapixels, respectively), and the ability to act as a 4G mobile hotspot. But as the 4G network was still down the morning of April 28, the phone's release was pushed back. Verizon acknowledged the downtime in a Twitter status update, claiming it was ""working with engineers"" to get 4G back up to speed. By the second day, Verizon restored 4G service in its areas of coverage. Verizon has continually refused to explain the network outages. When Wired.com asked for specific reasons for why the network went down last month, a Verizon spokesperson declined to answer. 4G data-transfer capability and coverage are a relatively new phenomenon. Sprint launched the first 4G phone on its Wi-Max network in June 2010 with HTC's Evo 4G. Verizon's 4G network debuted in December of last year. AT&T and T-Mobile both lay claim to the 4G moniker on their respective HSPA+ networks, though issues around what qualifies as ""4G"" still remain. As of early May, Verizon states 4G coverage is available in ""45 markets"" across the United States. ""Our philosophy has always been the same,"" said Verizon spokesperson Brenda Raney in an interview. ""When phones are ready to deliver customers an excellent experience, we'll launch them."" But it looks like the hardware has been ready to go for a while. Out of the 10 San Francisco Bay Area Verizon retailers Wired.com contacted, six said they already had Droid Charge handsets in stock for some time, but were not able to sell them until today. (Two stores did not answer, one hadn't received phones, and one received its first shipment yesterday.) One store claims it received its shipment ""about two weeks ago,"" approximately the same time as Verizon's 4G network outage. It's a similar case in other parts of the country as well. A store in the Boston suburban area also had phones in stock, but hasn't been able to sell them, according to a report from Computerworld. Two Verizon employees from separate Bay Area stores told Wired.com the delay had to do with ""4G network problems."" Speaking at a Sony Ericsson business forum in Palo Alto this week, executive director of LTE technologies Brian Higgins said the company had learned lessons from the experience, and that Verizon was going to ""make some adjustments."" Higgins wouldn't elaborate any further. Whatever adjustments the company has to make, we'll have to wait and see how Verizon's 4G network handles the influx of new device activations.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A bomb flattened a hotel Sunday in southwest Pakistan, killing at least 12 people, police said. The attack came hours after five rockets fired at a paramilitary training camp in the country's tribal region killed three people, a paramilitary spokesman said. The incidents took place as Pakistan celebrate its Independence Day. The bomb was planted inside a hotel in Dera Allah Yar, a town in Balochistan province, said police official Israr Umrani. Dozens of people were inside the hotel when the blast took place, Umrani said. In addition to those killed, another 14 were wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province but also its poorest and most sparsely populated. In recent years, the province has been plagued by sectarian violence and separatist Baluch militant groups who demand political autonomy and a greater share of profits from the province's natural resources. The earlier attack Sunday took place at the Tochi Scouts camp at Miranshah in North Waziristan. The rockets struck while the paramilitary group was preparing for an Independence Day parade, said Maj. Niaz Khan. In addition to those killed, 25 people were wounded, Khan said. The Tochi Scouts are a federally-controlled paramilitary force that has been primarily recruited from Pakistan's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan celebrates its independence every year on August 14, the day it was made an independent country based on borders created by the British as they ended their colonial rule in India.

"(CNN) -- A Seattle-area judge ordered Jack Daniel McCullough to be held Saturday pending a bail hearing after he was arrested by authorities in connection with the 1957 kidnapping and murder of an Illinois girl. McCullough, 71, was living under an assumed name at a retirement community in Washington. He did not appear in court Saturday, as was expected. The judge said he had been taken to an area medical center, but provided no other details about his condition. The judge scheduled a bail hearing for Monday. McCullough is expected to face extradition proceedings. Seattle authorities arrested McCullough, who also used the name John Tessier, on murder charges filed in DeKalb County, Illinois, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell said in a news release on Friday. Maria Ridulph, 7, disappeared while playing near her home in the town of Sycamore, west of Chicago. Her story captured national headlines and the attention of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, according to news accounts published at the time. Federal agents joined local and state law enforcement authorities as well as the community in the search for the girl, whose remains were found four months later by a couple walking in the woods, the news reports said. McCullough was a suspect at the time of the girl's disappearance, but the case ran cold after he changed his name and joined the military, Campbell said. The suspect's neighbors and a former colleague in Washington say they cannot reconcile the man charged with murder as the man they knew as John Tessier. After serving in the military, McCullough worked at the Lacey Police Department as an officer in the 1970s, said Ed Sorger, the chief of police at Evergreen State College. Sorger and McCullough, known to him as Tessier, worked together at the police department. ""I was very surprised upon hearing this. It simply didn't fit,"" Sorger told CNN affiliate KING-TV in Seattle. Sorger was surprised that a background check didn't turn up something on McCullough. ""We all went through that process,"" he said. At the time of his arrest, McCullough was living with his wife in a Seattle retirement community, a neighbor says. ""They were always with their grandchildren,"" Toni Glenn told the affiliate. McCullough is currently being held in the King County jail in Washington on a $3 million arrest warrant, Campbell said. ""This crime has haunted Sycamore for half a century,"" he said. ""We hope that the family of Maria Ridulph and this community can find some solace and closure with this arrest.""

"(CNN) -- Long-shot Ruler on Ice won the 143rd running of the Belmont Stakes in New York on Saturday, beating 24-1 odds. It was an astonishing win in a race billed earlier as a rematch between rival horses Shackleford and Animal Kingdom, both of which had been competing to win a second leg of the Triple Crown. Animal Kingdom nearly tossed his jockey at the start and fell behind early, while Shackleford came out of the gate strong and held the lead for much of the race. But he lost it at the end. Favorites fell by the wayside as Ruler on Ice was followed by Stay Thirsty and Brilliant Speed in second and third place. ""I'm a couple yards from the wire and I'm thinking, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I'm going to win the Belmont!' "" said Ruler on Ice jockey Jose Valdivia, his voice breaking with happy emotion. ""What can I tell you, it's just one of those things,"" he said. ""You get into your zone where everything stops ... unbelievable feeling."" Shackleford held off Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom in the Preakness Stakes in May. No horse has won the Triple Crown -- defined as the feat of sweeping the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes -- in 33 years. Twelve horses competed in Saturday evening's dash around the mile-and-a-half track, which was sloppy with rain. Shackleford, with 6-1 odds, finished fifth. Animal Kingdom, with 5-2 odds, came in sixth. ""We always had a lot of confidence in this colt and we can't be more thrilled with the outcome,"" said Ruler on Ice owner George Hall.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Philippines' Foreign Secretary Alberto del Rosario on Friday ended his visit to China aimed at seeking diplomatic ways for the two nations to resolve the South China Sea dispute. During his two-day visit, del Rosario met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi. The two sides ""agreed not to let the maritime disputes affect the broader picture of friendship and cooperation of the two countries,"" according to a joint statement issued at the end of the visit. ""The two sides reaffirmed their commitments to respect and abide by the Declaration of the Conduct of parties of the South China Sea signed by China and the ASEAN member countries in 2002."" The two sides agreed to have more high-level visits. They also plan to boost trade and investments, and to cooperate in science and technology, food safety, infrastructure and transportation. President Benigno Aquino III is expected to visit China in late August or early September, the Philippines' officials say. Del Rosario's trip helps pave the way for the president's visit, according to officials. Tension has grown in the resource-rich South China Sea. In June, the Philippines reported increased activities of Chinese vessels in the waters, saying China undermined the regional peace and stability, and infringed the Philippines' sovereignty. The Philippines renamed the South China Sea to the ""West Philippine Sea"" and removed some Chinese sea markers in disputed waters. China denied the accusation, saying the vessels' activities are ""regular activities of patrolling, scientific research"" and ""survey in the waters under the jurisdiction of China are completely justified and lawful."" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei urged the Philippines to ""stop unilateral actions that impair China's sovereignty as well as maritime rights."" Before his trip to China, del Rosario visited Washington and met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On June 28, the U.S. began an 11-day joint naval exercise with the Philippines in the South China Sea. China says it is not to blame. ""If you want to know why there is tension in South China Sea, I think you have to go and ask the country or countries that have made all the provocations,"" Cui Tiankai, China's vice minister of the Foreign Ministry, told CNN last month.

"(CNN) -- No longer is the promised land of Apple's App Store reserved for technical wizards. DJ Felli Fel's month-old iPhone app, powered by Mobile Roadie, has been downloaded a few thousand times. Just as everyone can publish their own blog on the Web, now developers are making it possible for everyone to make their own applications for iPhones. Both emerging start-ups and veteran developers for mobile platforms are making uploading and updating content on a mobile device accessible with dedicated content management systems (CMS) and service-based subscriptions. Mobile Roadie is one start-up solution that allows clients to stream music, link to iTunes and YouTube, post news and photos and integrate their other social profiles such MySpace, Twitter and Facebook into one handy interface. ""Mobile Roadie was created because we felt that the current solution of paying $20,000 for an iPhone app is only viable for the top 0.001 percent of all musicians, and yet an iPhone app is a great way to promote and sell music and shows and to give the band a greater connection with their fans,"" says Michael Schneider, CEO of Mobile Roadie developers and designers Fluidesign. The Mobile Roadie package includes creation of the application itself, submission to the App Store, a Web-based CMS, hosting of content, bandwidth and the first 1,000 downloads (subsequent downloads costs 1 cent each per month). If the client decides to charge for the app, Mobile Roadie takes 10 percent of the price, while Apple takes a standard 30 percent. And while there are several other players on the mobile market, the undisputed favorite among mobile operating systems -- for now, at least -- is indeed the much-touted Apple iPhone OS. ""The iPhone platform has proven to be a great opportunity for mobile developers, bringing a well-regulated market along with a solid development platform and, most importantly, very well-designed terminals,"" says Fiore Basile, CTO of iPhone developers 8080. Print on demand . The Italian company 8080 has been making mobile software since 2001 and focuses exclusively on creating iPhone-based apps and services for publishing, music and advertising. 8080's nostalgia for traditional fine print design is explicit in its existing iPhone apps: Frontpages simulates a newsstand displaying PDF files of newspaper front pages that link to their Web sites and/or RSS feeds; Lettera simulates an old-fashioned mechanical typewriter, complete with sound effects. So rather than create an application optimized for mobile devices with flowing text, 8080's PageStreamer encourages clients to upload pre-formatted PDF files to a CMS that converts their content into individual page sections, which can be magnified via the iPhone's touch screen. ""Our main goals are to preserve the richness of content and graphical style of the printed newspapers, still loved by readers worldwide, while taking advantage of Apple's platform for presenting and delivering the content in a pleasant way,"" says Basile. Perhaps more relevant to today's printed-press financial conundrum are the growing number of (mostly free) mobile news applications that run parallel to a news organization's Web site. The best of these optimize mobile browsing of headlines and thumbnails, reading articles, listening to audio, viewing photos and videos, while searching, saving and sharing content. The best of the best also cache the essentials for free off-line consumption and enjoyment, thus reviving the pleasure of reading, watching or listening to media on a traditionally unwired, portable support (like a book, magazine or newspaper). Kanchoo lets news organizations create their own iPhone applications to do just that, not only adapting content to the mobile screen but also downloading and updating when online in a single elegant sweep. ""We try to make the Kanchoo apps fully functional while you aren't connected and while updating,"" says one of the Kanchoo developers, William Taysom. ""Nearly half of the iPhone OS devices in the world are the iPod touch. These devices only have support for WiFi, and wireless is sometimes unavailable when you might want to read the news. It's very important to provide a good experience in these cases."" Kanchoo is based on the idea that information should flow seamlessly through a wide range of media, where mobile is emerging as a primary platform. For this reason, Kanchoo apps also support XML data, which allows content-providers to feed the same information into several different applications across platforms. Mobile challenges to Apple . But how long will the iPhone OS's crown remain unchallenged? While heavily branded devices such as the Amazon Kindle and Hearst e-readers reach out to the mobile news market with large flat screens and e-ink, other mobile brands are carefully strategizing their own shares. Kanchoo developer Aaron Farr believes that Google's open-source Android platform may take a few years to be delivered on enough handsets to go truly mainstream, but ""no other mobile platform is standing still."" ""There's much anticipation about Palm Pre. Blackberry is still extremely popular in certain markets. And Nokia will not allow Symbian to lose market share without a fight. I think we're at the beginning of trends which will reshape the mobile market significantly in the next couple of years,"" he says. On the television and video end of the media content spectrum, Mobiclip has developed technology that allows clients to use a CMS to upload and stream live TV and radio, as well as on-demand videos, directly to a number of mobile platforms. ""Mobiclip is already available for Symbian, Windows Mobile, Linux and Nintendo consoles. Android is being developed,"" assures Mobiclip's vice-president of marketing Denis Pagnac. Two of Mobiclip's current apps stream uninterrupted, high-quality live FRANCE 24 television programming or Deutsche Welle radio direct to an iPhone or iPod touch, effectively bridging the last remaining gaps between traditional and emerging media platforms. And if one of the biggest challenges to news organizations is devising a viable business model for online content, all of the above-mentioned iPhone-app solutions also offer optional advertising services, as well as statistical usage reports, to further capitalize on their mobile presence. ""We are developing a new ecosystem, where people are consuming more mobile content on bigger screens, in good quality and with a predictable business model,"" says Pagnac.","Companies provide tools for non-developers to manage their own iPhone apps .
Start-ups offer comprehensive package for one set-up fee plus monthly charge .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United fought back from two-goals down to defeat rivals Manchester City 3-2 in a thrilling Community Shield at Wembley, the traditional opener to the English Premier League. Champions United and FA Cup winners City are expected to be challenging for the title come next May -- and both teams showed exceptional quality in an end-to-end encounter that thrilled the  77,000 crowd. City had beaten their neighbors 1-0 when they last faced each other at Wembley, in April's FA Cup semifinal, and Roberto Mancini's big-spenders looked to be heading towards a similar result with two goals in the space of seven first-half minutes. The opener came in the 38th minute when David Silva curled in a delightful free-kick from the right and defender Joleon Lescott rose above the United defence to head past debutant goalkeeper David De Gea. And, on the stroke of half-time, City extended their advantage when Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko picked up the ball just inside the United half and was allowed to run unchallenged before firing a low 25-year shot that swerved away from De Gea. But United manager Alex Ferguson made five changes for the second half and the result was that his team dominated the second 45 minutes. Defender Chris Smalling reduced the deficit in the 52nd minute when side-footing home an Ashley Young free-kick. And United drew level six minutes later with a stunning one-touch move that involved Wayne Rooney and Tom Cleverley that resulted in Nani flicking the ball over England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Then, with the match heading towards a penalty shoot-out, United snatched victory with virtually the final kick. A City attack, which ended with Dzeko missing a close-range header, resulted in United clearing the ball out of defence. But, with seemingly no danger, City defenders Gael Clichy and Vincent Kompany displayed indecision, allowing Nani to rob the ball from Kompany's feet. The Portuguese winger then ran unchallenged towards City's goal, before rounding Hart and sliding the ball into an empty net to secure United a dramatic last- gasp victory. The result will give United a major boost ahead of next weekend's opening round of fixtures -- will the last four Community Shield winners all going on to lift the Premier League title.","Manchester United beat Manchester City 3-2 in Community Shield at Wembley .

"Boston (CNN) -- What scientists say is the largest concentration of endangered right whales ever spotted in one location is giving researchers an unusually rich opportunity to study the animals and their feeding habits. But the gathering, an annual affair in the chilly spring waters off Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts, also raises the threat of boats striking the 70-ton mammals, according to the state Division of Marine Fisheries. The agency has posted an advisory to boaters urging them to be on the lookout for the whales and steer clear. Scientists believe that there are only 450 right whales in the world but say the numbers have been slowly recovering since commercial whaling of the species was banned more than 70 years ago. The more than 100 whales counted in the bay this month is the largest number recorded in one place, according to the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts. ""We're looking at an exceedingly rare animal in unusual numbers in one of their last critical habitats,"" Charles Mayo, a scientist at the center who studies right whales, said Friday. Why so many in one place? In a word, food, said Mayo. One way or another, the whales caught wind of a unusually rich repast of plankton available in the waters of the bay and arrived to take advantage of the easy dining, Mayo said. The plankton bloom often occurs, but it's been particularly rich and long-lasting this year for unknown reasons, he said. There have been no boat strikes on the many whales contained in the bay's waters, said Dan McKiernan, deputy director of the state Marine Fisheries Division. In fact, the last known fatal strike on a whale in the area happened in 1999, he said. State and federal law makes it a crime to close within 500 yards of a right whale, according to the state Marine Fisheries Division. Seeing so many right whales in the same place is encouraging for researchers, even though they are well aware that the species is on the road to recovery after dipping in the early 1900s to as few as a handful of breeding females and male suitors. It's also a spectacle for the public, Mayo said. The whales feed on the surface and can be seen from shore, he said. ""Anytime you see a whale from the beach that's actually alive, it's pretty exciting,"" he said. The whales should begin trickling out of the bay sometime in the next few days heading for deeper waters offshore, Mayo said.","Scientists count record number of right whales in Cape Cod Bay .

"(CNN) -- Survivors of a deadly earthquake-triggered tsunami which hit the Samoan islands Tuesday have described how they watched the inrushing sea swallow up coastal towns and villages leaving devastation in its wake. iReporter Alden Tagarino captured this image of the damage caused by the tsunami in Pago Pago. At least 111 people are confirmed killed in Samoa, neighboring American Samoa and Tonga. But officials in the Polynesia region have expressed fears the toll will rise as rescue workers struggle to reach outlying villages submerged and flattened by the wave. American Samoa resident Frances Faumatu told CNN she had fled to Aoloau, the highest village on the island, as the earthquake shook her house. ""All of a sudden we heard on the radio everybody had to run for safety,"" she said. ""Right after the quake, the tsunami came."" Faumatu and others stayed on the mountain for two or three hours until the warning was lifted, watching as the sea swallowed Pago Pago, the island's capital, and then receded. At least 22 people are confirmed dead in the U.S. island territory. Cars, debris, and parts of buildings were randomly strewn over the landscape where the powerful waters dropped them.  See iReporter images of the aftermath » . But in some cases, the sea left nothing behind. ""Other villages were taken to the ocean,"" Faumatu said. ""I can't even compare the image. It's one thing to see a photo or footage, but just to be there in person is pretty dramatic,"" Maneafaiga T. Lagafuaina told CNN Wednesday. ""American Samoa itself is experiencing a great loss."" The 8.0-magnitude quake hit the small cluster of Samoan islands in the South Pacific early Tuesday. In Samoa, the death toll stands at 82, according to government minister Maulolo Tavita. But he said he feared the number of causalities would continue to rise. Around 220,000 people live on the two main islands which make up the nation of Samoa. The population of American Samoa is about 66,000.  See a map of the affected region » . Salamo Laumoli, director of health services at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center in Pago Pago, said he feared more fatalities would turn up as rescue workers strived to access parts of the island severed by damaged infrastructure. ""I thought it was the end of the world,"" said Laumoli. ""I have never felt an earthquake like that before."" Patients at the hospital were briefly moved to higher ground, but they were soon brought back and the hospital is operating, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The airport in the capital of Pago Pago was also operational and being used for emergency flights, FEMA said. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane was scheduled to land Wednesday around noon Eastern time, which coincides with sunrise in the Pacific U.S. protectorate, said Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator. A second C-130 was scheduled to land around 5 p.m. ET. ""The wave came onshore and washed out people's homes,"" said Cinta Brown, an American Samoa homeland security official working at the island's emergency operations center. The same happened on the hard-hit east and west sides of American Samoa, said Brown, who was standing in a parking lot when her sport utility vehicle began rocking left and right. She said she could hear the rattling of metal of a large chain-link fence around the lot. ""It shakes you because you know something else is coming,"" she said. The British Foreign Office said one of the dead in American Samoa was a British national, but no other details were provided. In Tonga, Lord Tuita, the acting prime minister, said at least seven people had been confirmed dead on the northern island of Niuatoputapu. Three others were missing and four people were being treated for serious injuries, he said. ""The hospital on the island is reported to have suffered major damage; telephone communications has been cut as a result of damage to equipment and facilities on the island; homes and government buildings have been destroyed; the airport runway has been severely damaged making it impossible for any fixed wing aircraft to land,"" a statement from the Tongan prime minister's office said.

Togiola Tulafono, speaking from Hawaii, said Tuesday's quake ranked ""right up there with some of the worst"" disasters on the island.

Tulafono was on his way back home from Hawaii on Tuesday night on one of two U.S. Coast Guard transport planes delivering aid. He told reporters Tuesday it had been hard being away from home as the disaster unfolded. It was a time, he said, for families to be together.  Watch American Samoa governor discuss tsunami » . President Obama declared American Samoa a major disaster area, ordering federal aid to supplement local efforts. ""We keep the many people who have been touched by this tragedy in our thoughts and in our prayers,"" he said. A U.S. Defense Department official said 75 members of the Hawaii National Guard were ordered to American Samoa to begin assisting with medical relief, search and rescue and providing communications capabilities on the island. The unit will bring enough supplies to sustain themselves for 96 hours and its expected more aid from the military could begin flowing in, the official said. The Coast Guard is transporting more than 20 officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to American Samoa, said John Hamill, external affairs officer for FEMA in Oakland, California. The FEMA team will include a variety of debris experts, housing experts, members of the Corps of Engineers, and other disaster relief specialists, Hamill said. The quake generated three separate tsunami waves, the largest measuring 5.1 feet from sea level height, said Vindell Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Preliminary data had originally reported a larger tsunami.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's top economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, is leaving the administration to return to the University of Chicago, the White House announced Monday night. Goolsbee has been an outspoken defender of Obama's policies as the U.S. economy struggles to find its footing following the steep recession of 2007-09. In a statement announcing Goolsbee's departure, Obama called him ""a close friend"" and ""one of America's great economic thinkers."" ""Over the past several years, he has helped steer our country out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,"" Obama said. ""And although there is still much work ahead, his insights and counsel have helped lead us toward an economy that is growing and creating millions of jobs."" The announcement came after a series of reports that showed the U.S. economy struggling to maintain headway after the housing bust, banking crisis and recession. Sunday, Goolsbee told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that despite disappointing employment, manufacturing and housing price figures, the long-term trends remain positive. Goolsbee taught at the University of Chicago for 14 years before joining the administration and will return to the school in time for the fall semester, the White House said. Before being named chairman of the advisory council in September, he served as a senior adviser to Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and as staff economist for the Economic Recovery Advisory Board. ""There's no question as you come out of the worst downturn in most of our lifetimes, that it is going to be fragile,"" Goolsbee said. But he said the economy was ""a million miles"" from its condition when Obama took office, ""when the economy's losing 780,000 jobs a month and people are actively talking about will there be an end to the financial system in the United States.""","Longtime economic adviser Austan Goolsbee headed back to Chicago .

"(CNN) -- ""I forgot to vote"" won't be a valid excuse for most Americans surfing the Web on Tuesday. That's because internet and social networking companies have created various tools to remind and guide U.S. citizens to voting booths. Google has created Election Center, which most notably has a map that pinpoints the polling place nearest to any address. The search giant has added to its meticulously uncluttered Google.com homepage a note about Tuesday's election and a link to the map. Facebook also employs Google's polling-place widget on its website. The social networking site is where Americans spend most of their time online, according to research firm comScore. U.S. adults who use Facebook will see an alert on their main pages reminding them to vote, a Facebook spokesman said. ""Facebook is committed to encouraging people who use our service to participate in the democratic process,"" the statement read. The Palo Alto, California, company also worked with politicians in Washington to provide best practices for campaigning using Facebook's network. Several of those documents are available publicly. For the 2008 election, Facebook's site was dominated by a virtual rally organized through an application called Causes. (The company behind the app was co-founded by Sean Parker, a Facebook co-founder who was portrayed in the ""Social Network"" film by Justin Timberlake.) Causes asked Facebook users to ""donate their status"" to promote a candidate or to remind friends to vote. In less than five days, 1.7 million people sent 4.9 million political messages using the app. For this election, Facebook, with help from a couple of organizations, has built a Politics page, which is visible to web surfers whether or not they have a Facebook account. The alert on people's News Feeds will link to this page, where the Google widget resides, along with other voter resources. Facebook users will be able to click an ""I Voted"" button to trumpet their civic engagement, the spokesman said. Similarly, users of the location-based social network Foursquare will be able to earn an ""I Voted"" badge. Including the text ""#ivoted"" in a status update when checking in to a polling location on Foursquare on Tuesday will unlock the virtual trophy -- a sort of coolness currency on the site. Foursquare plans to track mobile check-ins and arrange them on a page called I Voted. The New York company says, with this project, it has developed ""a replicatable system for the 2012 presidential election."" Twitter is also encouraging its users to join in on the ""#ivoted"" campaign by including that string in their tweets -- a practice called ""hashtags."" When enough people include the same tag or phrase in their messages, it can become more visible on the Trending Topics list. The Washington Post bought an ad slot on that list associated with the election, Twitter spokeswoman Jodi Olson told CNN in an e-mail. In a company blog post Twitter highlighted a dozen or so organizations and news outlets, including CNN, which will be analyzing and disseminating messages on the service. ""But remember,"" Olson wrote, ""none of this matters if you don't vote.""","Google created a widget to help people find a polling place near their houses .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- In New Delhi's upscale diplomatic district, Ram Dhan lives in a parallel world. For years, his home has been a rickety shanty that he shares with his ailing wife, a young son, a daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Now 62, Dhan has lived through India's journey as an independent nation. He finds little reason to rejoice as the country celebrates Monday, the 64th anniversary of freedom from British rule. ""The poor have hardly benefited,"" he says. Sitting on a cot in his shack huddled in a squalid slum in one of the richest neighborhoods of the Indian capital, he bitterly recalls how flooding in his native village ravaged his ancestral land way back in 1978 and forced him to move to the city in search of work. But today, Dhan says, the family of six can barely manage $130 a month. ""This is no development ... or growth. I think we have moved backwards,"" he says. Dhan typifies the hand-to-mouth existence millions of Indians still live despite the nation's rise as Asia's third-largest economy. In a speech on the eve of his country's independence in 1947, India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, made an impassioned call to fight and end ""poverty and ignorance and disease."" Sixty-four years later, his successors accept that that fight is far from over. ""We have to banish poverty and illiteracy from our country. We have to provide the common man with access to improved health services,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in his annual Independence Day address Monday. According to the World Bank, India is home to one-third of the world's poor. Corruption, policymakers have agreed over the years, is a major culprit. ""Corruption manifests itself in many forms,"" Singh said in what has been a refrain by Indian planners on the chronic scourge. ""In some instances, funds meant for schemes for the welfare of the common man end up in the pocket of government officials. In some other instances, government discretion is used to favor a select few. There are also cases where government contracts are wrongfully awarded to the wrong people. We cannot let such activities continue unchecked."" Singh's remarks came ahead of a hunger strike anti-corruption activists have planned to press for an anti-graft law stronger than the legislation introduced in Parliament this month to create a citizen ombudsman. Indian leaders concede no single measure will work to combat corruption, which is believed to be deeply entrenched in the system. ""I believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts,"" Singh said. He disapproved of hunger strikes as a means to push demands. As India's finance minister, Singh unleashed economic reforms in the 1990s that dismantled stiffening regulations and opened the nation to foreign capital. This year, India also marked another milestone event: the 20th anniversary of liberalization. But the occasion has been clouded by massive corruption scandals in Singh's administration and a rigid inflation crushing impoverished groups and the country's growing middle-class alike. Criticism is mounting against the nation's political establishment. ""The twin monsters India faces today are inflation and corruption, both of which could derail the India growth story. To keep that story going, today's dysfunctional political class will need to radically re-invent itself,"" wrote the Times of India in an editorial headlined ""Batting at 64.""

"(CNN) -- Frenchman Thomas Voeckler has taken the yellow jersey from Norway's Thor Hushovd after a dramatic ninth stage of the Tour de France which was marred by a series of crashes which led to two of the race favorites pulling out. Voeckler, who led the race for 10 days in 2004, finished second to Spain's Luis-Leon Sanchez at the end of the hilly 208km run from Issoire to Saint-Flour, which saw the riders tackle seven climbs in the Massif Central region. Both Voeckler and Sanchez were members of a six-man breakaway group which formed at the 50km mark after a succession of attacks. Rui Costa holds on for Tour de France win . However, as the peloton began closing the gap on the six leaders, a huge pile-up on a descent at 102km saw a number of riders hit the ground at speed. Among them were Astana team leader Alexander Vinokourov, a previous Tour of Spain winner, and Omega Pharma-Lotto leader Juergen Van Den Broeck, who finished fifth in last year's Tour. The 37-year-old Vinokourov, who had already announced his decision to retire at the end of the season, suffered a broken leg after tumbling a few meters down a ravine, while Van Den Broeck sustained a fractured shoulder blade. Key Garmin domestique Dave Zabriskie was also forced to retire, to add to the list of riders that have crashed out of this year's race, which include Bradley Wiggins, Tom Boonen and Janez Brajkovic. More drama was to follow when Team Sky's Juan Antonio Flecha, one of the breakaway riders, was clipped by an accompanying French TV car, sending him and Johnny Hoogerland flying, with Dutchman Hoogerland spectacularly going head-over-heels onto some barbed wire that surrounded a field on the side of the road. Although both riders continued the race, eventually finishing well adrift of the peloton, their bloodied bodies indicated that they may not be on the start line for Tuesday's 10th stage following Monday's rest day. Voeckler, who began the day in 19th place, now holds the race lead after finishing five seconds behind Sanchez, but nearly four minutes ahead of the peloton. The Team Europcar rider lies 1:49 ahead of Rabobank rider Sanchez, who is 37 seconds clear of Cadel Evans in third place. ""When you only have two minutes on a rider like Cadel Evans in the overall, you have to be realistic,"" Voeckler told the official Tour de France website. ""I'm not a dreamer, I will just fight and give all that I can. I know it's impossible for me to keep the lead for 10 days like in 2004 but one thing is sure -- tomorrow I can keep the jersey because it's a rest day!"" he added, . Hushovd's brave hold on the yellow jersey ended when he trailed home in 82nd place, 6:47 behind Sanchez, and he now lies 24th in the overall standings. Defending champion Alberto Contador came home 12th, in the same group as the overall contenders, and continues to creep up the standings to 16th position overall. However, the three-time winner was another to crash on Sunday and told reporters he was suffering from some pain in his knee, although he will have time to rest it on Monday's rest day.","Thomas Voeckler in the yellow jersey after ninth stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic survived his first big test of Wimbledon 2011 as he overcame crowd favorite Marcos Baghdatis to reach the last 16 of the grass-court grand slam in London on Saturday. The Serbian appeared on course for an easy victory after winning the first set, but the 24-year-old completely lost his cool as his 30th-ranked opponent fought back in the second. Djokovic was given a warning after smashing his racket into the ground three times, a petulant outburst that ensured the Centre Court crowd was firmly behind Baghdatis -- a 2006 semifinalist here after losing in the final of that year's Australian Open. Djokovic, seeking his first Wimbledon title after his 43-match unbeaten run ended at the French Open semifinals, recovered his poise to triumph 6-4 4-6 6-3 6-4 and set up a fourth-round clash with France's Michael Llodra. Baghdatis will not feature when the second week of the tournament begins on Monday, but the 26-year-old won plenty of fans with his big-hearted performance as he tested Australian Open champion Djokovic right until the end -- even winning an 18-shot rally despite his tiring legs. ""To pull a win out of this game was great. Today wasn't my day totally but when I needed to I played some good shots,"" Djokovic said. He joined world No. 1 Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in winning through, meaning the top four players are still in the draw following Andy Murray's victory on Friday. Defending champion Nadal will next play former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro in the tie of the fourth round, with the Spaniard completing a straight-sets win over Luxembourg's Gilles Muller. Resuming the rain-delayed match after winning the opening set 7-6 (8-6), Nadal won the next 7-5 in another tie-and then whitewashed his 92nd-ranked fellow left-hander 6-0 in the third. Del Potro, now ranked 21st as he continues his comeback from long-term wrist problems, defeated French 15th seed Gilles Simon 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-5) 7-5. The Argentine had never gone past round two before, but has a great chance of reaching the semis if he can beat Nadal. ""I'm not lucky to play against Del Potro in the round of 16,"" Nadal said, adding that the knee problem he suffered on Friday was not serious. ""He's a very, very tough opponent, one of the best players of the world. When he's healthy, he's top-five level normally, so it will be a very tough opponent for me. I have to be playing my best tennis to try to win."" The winner of their match will face either last year's runner-up Tomas Berdych or 10th seed Mardy Fish in the quarterfinals. Czech seventh seed Berdych beat Alex Bogomolov Jr. 6-2 6-4 6-3 to leave Fish as the only American left in the men's draw following Dutchman Robin Haase's injury retirement at 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 1-1 down in their encounter. Federer, seeking to equal Pete Sampras with a seventh Open Era title at Wimbledon, showed he will again be a contender by defeating sometime nemesis David Nalbandian in straight sets. The 16-time grand slam winner has lost eight times to the Argentine, but the Swiss third seed was in control as he triumphed 6-4 6-2 6-4 to set up a clash with Russia's Mikhail Youzhny. Youzhny, seeded 18th, has now reached the fourth round six times since 2001 following his 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 win over Spain's No. 16 Nicolas Almagro, but has yet to go further. Fifth seed Robin Soderling reached the quarterfinals last year, but the Swede's participation ended on Saturday with a shock defeat by Australian teenager Bernard Tomic. The 18-year-old, who lost in the first round in his debut appearance in 2010, won 6-1 6-4 7-5 to earn a meeting with 2002 semifinalist Xavier Malisse. Ranked 158th in the world, he will become Australia's new No. 1 after the tournament ahead of 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt, who was beaten by Soderling in five sets in the previous round. Belgium's Malisse ended the hopes of Austrian 11th seed Jurgen Melzer, winning 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 6-0 to qualify for the last 16 for the first time since 2004. French ninth seed Gael Monfils also crashed out, losing 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-3 to Poland's Lukasz Kubot. The world No. 93, a doubles specialist who lost in the second round last year, will next take on Spain's Feliciano Lopez -- who eliminated three-time runner-up Andy Roddick on Friday. Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer moved into the last 16 for the second successive year as he beat Slovakia's Karol Beck 6-4 6-3 6-3. The Australian Open semifinalist will next face French 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who won 6-3 6-4 6-3 against Chile's Fernando Gonzalez. Llodra, seeded 19th, has already bettered his best performance by passing the second round and will take on Djokovic after his 6-3 6-3 6-1 win over Lu Yen-Hsun, who last year became the first Taiwanese player to reach the quarterfinals. The other fourth-round match sees Murray play French 15th seed Richard Gasquet, who he beat in a five-set thriller at Wimbledon three years ago to reach his first grand slam quarterfinal.","World's top four men's tennis players will feature in fourth round at Wimbledon next week .

"(CNN) -- A 50-year-old man accused of strapping a suspected explosive device around the neck of an 18-year-old woman near Sydney, Australia, earlier this month was arrested Monday more than 9,000 miles away, Australian law enforcement officials said. ""The offender in this matter has been identified, and it's been confirmed that he traveled to the United States,"" New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters. Police said that a man broke into the Mosman, Australia, home of the woman, later identified as Madeleine Pulver, on August 3 and attached what she then believed to be a bomb. The woman spent 10 hours attached to the device before having it removed by police bomb technicians. Authorities later determined it had been inert. The case subsequently drew intense media attention in Australia, and prompted police to launch an extensive investigation. That probe led to the arrest of the suspect around 3:30 p.m. EST (5:30 a.m. Tuesday in Sydney) in Louisville, Kentucky, by FBI agents working ""very, very closely"" with their Australian counterparts, said Scipione. ""The information that I have is that the suspect was surprised"" to be arrested, said Assistant Commissioner David Hudson. Australian police did not name the man arrested, noting that he hasn't been formally charged. But Hudson said that he is an Australian citizen who frequently traveled to the United States on business. He'd been in Sydney, which is his primary place of residence, for six weeks before flying to the United States on August 8, said Hudson. Hudson said that the man taken into custody was not yet a suspect when he went overseas. But ""a fairly detailed chain of circumstantial evidence"" -- including a description from the victim, even though the alleged assailant was ""heavily disguised"" -- ultimately led them to the United States and the arrest. There were ""some links between the suspect and the family, however no direct links,"" said the assistant commissioner, though he declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation. The suspect is expected to be arraigned Tuesday morning in a U.S. court, said Hudson. Australian authorities plan to seek his extradition back across the Pacific Ocean. The alleged crime occurred in Mosman, a wealthy suburb about eight kilometers (five miles) from Sydney where many well-connected people, sports stars and celebrities live, resident and Australian news reporter Dave Kirwan told CNN. When the alarm was first raised, he said, many residents locked themselves in their homes fearing they might also be in danger. ""This kind of thing doesn't really happen here,"" Kirwan said at the time. Speaking on what was Tuesday morning in Australia, Scipione thanked the Pulver family, as well as investigators in both Australia and the United States, for overcoming several challenges to find the person they believe was behind this ""hideous crime."" ""The motto for (the New South Wales police force) simply says, translated, 'Justice swiftly follows crime,' "" said Scipione. ""You've seen that today.""","NEW: The suspect ""was surprised"" to be arrested 9,000 miles away, an official says .

"Indianapolis, Indiana (CNN) -- The Indiana State Fair reopened Monday with a public memorial service for five people killed when a concert stage collapsed during a storm. The fairgrounds were closed Saturday night following the accident, which occurred shortly before the country music duo Sugarland was to take the stage before an audience of about 12,000. ""While we will never forget this horrific event and those who perished, may we Hoosiers find the courage to unify, rebuild and re-emerge with a stronger heart,"" said Indiana first lady Cheri Daniels, who attended Saturday's concert and was one of several speakers at Monday's ceremony. Audience members at the service honored victims with a moment of silence and later sang ""Amazing Grace."" Officials Monday were focusing on grieving with victims and beginning repairs to get the fair back underway, Gov. Mitch Daniels told CNN. ""Our first instinct in Indiana is not to go rushing around, looking for scapegoats. It's to take care of business, take care of those who've been hurt and then, of course ... study to see if something could have done better and learn any necessary lessons,"" he said. On Sunday he described the stage's collapse as a ""freakish accident."" ""I'm not saying that we're not going to find many things that could have been done differently,"" Daniels told CNN Monday. ""I'm only saying that I know the people who run this operation. They think safety all the time, and I know that their hearts are broken that, in this case, this event took place as it did."" Investigators on Sunday sifted through debris of the stage, trying to determine what caused the accident that also injured at least 40 people, authorities said. Metal scaffolding fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans, about four minutes after authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators Sunday. Forecasters had warned heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through Saturday. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way, sending a heavy bank of stage lights and metal onto fans closest to the outdoor stage. The Atlanta-based Sugarland group -- along with its opening act, Sara Bareilles -- canceled their scheduled performance Sunday at the Iowa State Fair. According to the fair's website, ""aside from coping with the magnitude of the accident, the ongoing investigation prevents the band from getting what may remain of their stage equipment."" Jennifer Nettles, one half of the Sugarland duo, posted a statement on the group's website Sunday, saying ""there are no words to process a moment of this magnitude and gravity."" ""There are only prayers for peace in the hearts of the bereft, and prayers of thanksgiving for those who were spared or safe. A piece of our heart is left in that grandstand,"" Nettles said. Bareilles, who had just finished her performance when the collapse occurred, tweeted Sunday she was ""still thinking of all those affected."" On her website, she wrote: ""The accident at the Indiana State Fair felt like a bad dream. The weather changed in a matter of minutes and the stage collapsed in a matter of seconds. "" She called the emergency response ""incredibly quick."" While most of the injured were treated and released from Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, nine patients were admitted and were still being treated Sunday afternoon, the hospital said. Three children remained at Riley Hospital for Children, the hospital said. ""We're all very much in mourning of the loss of the victims, and we are praying with their families,"" Cindy Hoye, the fair's executive director said. The Marion County, Indiana, coroner identified the three women and two men who died as: Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah, Indiana; Glenn Goodrich, 49, of Indianapolis; Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; and Nathan Byrd, 51, of Indianapolis. Vandam, Goodrich, Bigjohny and Santiago were dead at the scene, while Byrd died later at the hospital, the coroner said. Friends, colleagues and family gathered Sunday to remember Santiago at Chicago's Howard Brown Health Center, a health care organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, where she worked. ""We have lost a fierce warrior, an amazing activist,"" said Rosa Yadira Ortiz, board president for Amigas Latinos, a group for lesbian Hispanics in Chicago that Santiago was involved in. ""She really brought us all together."" The families of two of those hospitalized released brief statements Sunday, each asking for prayers and privacy. ""Jenny Haskell, a 22-year-old Ball State senior, is very critical at this time,"" her family said. A fifth-grader, identified only as Jade, is in critical condition, according to her family. Allison Hoehn, a concertgoer, said many attendees rushed to those trapped after the stage crumbled. ""We tried to get down to help, but no one was moving,"" Hoehn said. ""The storm came on so fast and the stage just snapped like a toothpick."" Spectators grabbed parts of their seats to assemble makeshift stretchers, she said. ""Everyone rushed to help, and we saw people searching and pulling people out,"" Hoehn said. Dust swirled just before a gust of wind rushed in and the stage crashed down, concertgoer Jenna Gioe told CNN Monday. ""It was absolute pandemonium"" as crowds rushed to get out of the grandstand, she said. Days after the stage collapse, Gioe said she was still struggling to understand the tragic turn of events. ""It's absolutely baffling ... What actually happened, it's beyond all of us,"" she said. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J. Carter, Leslie Tripp and David Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: Indiana first lady: ""We will never forget this horrific event and those who perished""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's nuclear safety agency will be placed under the control of the country's Environment Ministry, a top government official announced Monday in a move stemming from the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Japanese regulators have been accused of being too cozy with the nuclear industry in the years before the March disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, the worst nuclear accident in a quarter-century. Monday's decision will take the day-to-day regulation of nuclear plants out from under the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, which has promoted the use of nuclear energy, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. The plan is to merge the existing Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency with the Nuclear Safety Commission, a largely advisory body. The new agency should be up and running by April and ""will see to it that everything is done clearly,"" Edano said. The agency has been tentatively designated the Nuclear Safety Agency, but Edano said he and other Cabinet members hope to add the word ""regulatory"" to the name before long. ""This agency will be handling regulation, and that is why regulation should be included in the name,"" he said. Japan has launched a sweeping review of nuclear power since the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, which has displaced more than 100,000 nearby residents. Engineers are still working to restore normal cooling in the three reactors that melted down after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and to pump out and decontaminate an estimated 100,000 tons of water that has pooled in the basements and service tunnels of the plant during five months of emergency measures.","Day-to-day nuclear regulation will be placed under the Environment Ministry .

"(CNN) -- A 43-year-old Missouri man told police that he suffocated his 3-year-old neighbor with a plastic bag, then stuffed her body in the same bag and tossed her from a highway, according to a court document. Shawn Morgan of Senath has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Breeann Rodriguez. The girl was last seen on August 6, riding her pink bicycle with her brother outside their home in Senath. While authorities have found her bike, authorities continued to search Monday for her body, Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. Sokoloff added -- and the Dunklin County court clerk's office confirmed -- that Morgan does not yet have an attorney. His legal representation could be settled when he is arraigned in a Kennett, Missouri, court at 9 a.m. Tuesday, the prosecuting attorney said. According to a probable cause affidavit dated Saturday, police interviewed Morgan on Friday at the police department in Kennett, a larger community about 10 miles northeast of Senath. The suspect said that he spotted the girl standing on a ladder by the pool in his backyard, in Breeann's neighborhood. He told police that he grabbed the girl and carried her inside his house. There, according to the affidavit, the man ""suffocated the girl with a white plastic trash bag, by holding it over her face and mouth. ""Morgan states that he felt like it took an hour for the girl to die,"" the document adds. It says Morgan told police he put the girl's body into the same trash bag, and then drove to Missouri's Highway 164 and got rid of the body by throwing it over a railing into a floodway ditch. After returning home, Morgan said, he then dismantled the girl's bike and dumped it into another, related waterway, the document says. A bicycle was recovered there and identified by Edgar Rodriguez as belonging to Breeann, his daughter. Police said Thursday that they had found two training wheels similar to those on the girl's bike. In addition to murder, Sokoloff said in a statement Saturday that Morgan is charged with armed criminal action and tampering with physical evidence. The suspect, who Sokoloff said had three children of his own, is being held at the Dunklin County Justice Center. The FBI, which earlier had a major role in the case, has passed off control of the investigation to local authorities following Morgan's arrest, FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu said. Meanwhile, the approximately 1,800 residents of Senath -- a city in southeast Missouri's ""boot heel,"" about 90 miles north of Memphis, Tennessee -- are trying to come to grips with what happened. Sharon Haddock, who raised two children on the same street as both the victim and her alleged killer, said Monday that she knew Morgan as ""a little boy"" and knew some of his family members as ""very nice people."" ""It's just beyond belief that anybody ... could have done this, but now anybody on your street,"" she told HLN's Vinnie Politan. ""You think you know your neighbors, but you don't know them as well as you think you do. I would have never dreamed this in a million years."" Another neighbor, Estelle Floyd, said she had lived 89 of her 90 years always feeling safe. But that sense of security has been shaken -- and she's still trying to make sense of what happened. ""All these neighbors ... they'd do anything for anybody at any time,"" Floyd told HLN. ""This was such a shock ... It has touched the hearts of everybody in this town.""

"(CNN) -- Four current and former leaders of Madagascar have struck a power-sharing deal, ending months of political wrangling that has rocked the island nation off the east coast of Africa, the United Nations said. The Saturday agreement was made among ousted President Marc Ravalomanana, current President Andry Rajoelina, who took power in March, and former presidents Didier Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy. Under the deal, Rajoelina will serve as president along with two new co-presidents. Ravalomanana had pledged to reject any accord that allowed his successor to be the sole leader of the country. It was not immediately clear how power will be divided among the leaders. Rajoelina, 35, a former disc jockey, ousted Ravalomanana with the help of the military in March. The international community has not recognized him as president, and the United States condemned the toppling as a coup. U.S. officials deemed it ""unconstitutional and undemocratic."" The four leaders reached another separate power-sharing deal in August, but disagreed on the composition of a transitional government. In a statement Saturday, United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon urged the leaders to set up the unity government as soon as possible this time around, and pledged to support Madagascar through the transition.

"(CNN) -- Paraguay's cancer-stricken president is ""lucid, ""perfectly fine"" and will not require surgery at this point, his doctor said Sunday. President Fernando Lugo is currently undergoing treatment at the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in San Paolo, Brazil. His doctor, Alfredo Boccia, said the president had a blood clot, which is not an uncommon side effect of chemotherapy. ""The clot has broken up in an important way. This is extremely positive and takes the president out of the risky situation that he was in,"" Boccia said in a statement. He added Lugo will not require surgery at this point and that he is ""perfectly fine, lucid, and without problems and pain."" Paraguay's president was diagnosed in August with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer affecting the immune system. It was detected at an early stage. Lugo is a former Roman Catholic bishop. His five-year term is slated to end in August 2013. He was admitted to a hospital in Paraguay's capital Thursday, and later transferred to the hospital in Brazil to avoid possible complications, said Boccia. Lugo, 59, was suffering from redness and swelling around the face. Doctors initially were concerned the president might have had an infection. According to the American Cancer Society, non Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most common caners in the United States, according for about 4 percent of all cancers.","He was transferred to hospital in Brazil after having redness, swelling around his face .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is concerned that Pakistan may have given China access to the high-tech helicopter that crashed in the U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, a U.S. official said Monday. ""We have reason to suspect China was given access but we cannot confirm it definitively,"" said a U.S. official who is not authorized to discuss intelligence matters publicly. ""We have strong suspicions."" The comment came after news reports suggested Pakistani authorities may have allowed Chinese engineers to see the stealth aircraft. Pakistan's military has denied the allegation, saying there is ""no truth to the report."" In a written statement, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN the claim is part of a ""malicious campaign"" against Pakistan's security forces. Abbas ""expressed his astonishment at the far-fetched reporting of certain foreign media outlets,"" the statement said. Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times newspaper in London reported that it had learned that Pakistan ""allowed Chinese military engineers to photograph and take samples from the top-secret stealth helicopter."" It added that ""people close to the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency"" told the paper that ""the Chinese were in fact given access to the helicopter."" China declined to comment, the article said. The New York Times reported that ""Pakistan's intelligence service probably allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage,"" citing ""American officials and others familiar with the classified intelligence assessments."" It noted that the ""American assessments were disclosed"" by The Financial Times. When the aircraft crashed during the raid that killed the al Qaeda leader in May, Navy SEALs destroyed most of it to protect the technology. But the tail section remained mostly intact and it was that area that the Chinese engineers examined, according to the New York Times report. China and Pakistan enjoy a long-standing military relationship, and the May raid that killed bin Laden -- staged without informing the Pakistani government -- stoked tensions between Washington and Islamabad. In July, the United States said it was withholding $800 million in aid to Pakistan. ""They've taken some steps that have given us reason to pause on some of the aid which we're giving to the military, and we're trying to work through that,"" White House Chief of Staff William Daley said at the time.

Around 150 tons of seeds have been used to make an inches-thick carpet that visitors to the gallery will be encouraged to play in and crunch under foot. The enormous installation, which opens Tuesday, is the work of artist Ai Weiwei, known as China's ""Andy Warhol."" The work is the 11th commission in the internationally acclaimed Unilever Series at the gallery, an annual series kicked off in 2000 by Louise Bourgeois's spiders and mirrors. Ai's seeds are porcelain, each one individually handcrafted by laborers in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen. Each tiny piece has been individually molded and hand-painted, according to the gallery. Sunflower seeds are a popular Chinese street snack and one of the country's most famous exports, according to the gallery. But they hold greater significance for Ai, who spent his childhood in Xinjiang as the son of a celebrated poet exiled by the Chinese communist government during the Cultural Revolution. He told CNN: ""It was very poor and rural there, we had nothing else to enjoy. Sunflower seeds were something basic that everyone could have. Every holiday, wedding or even just going to the movies, we would all share sunflower seeds with one another. I think it's a very common, very inconspicuous object, but it also has a special relationship to our daily lives ... Of course, during the cultural revolution we all knew that the Sun symbolized the leader, and sunflowers represented the people. So I think these seeds carry multiple meanings."" Ai is a well-known and controversial figure in China, probably best-known today for the design -- in collaboration with Herzog & de Meuron -- of Beijing's ""Bird's Nest"" stadium, built for the 2008 Olympics. Shortly after, Ai -- who is one of China's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the Olympics calling for a boycott and saying the Chinese government was using them as propaganda. In the 1990s, Ai came to international attention when he helped establish the avant-garde East Village in Beijing where a group of artists took up residence in impoverished migrant workers housing on the city's outskirts. It became a mecca for radical Chinese contemporary artists like Ma Liuming. Other notable large-scale artworks that have filled the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall include Carsten Hollers' slides which had visitors shouting with excitement as they slid down; Olafur Eliasson's giant projection of the sun in ""The Weather Project"" and a huge crack in the floor courtesy of Doris Salcedo's ""Shibboleth.""","Visitors encouraged to play on crunchy carpet of seeds .

"(CNN) -- Kenyans worldwide called for unity Monday by singing the national anthem in unison -- a rare gesture in a continent facing violent uprisings for leaders to step down after decades in power. Citizens in the nation and other parts of the world took a break at 1 p.m. Kenyan time (5 a.m. ET) to collectively sing the hymn. Drivers pulled over on the side of the roads while crowds gathered at malls and busy intersections to sing the anthem. The singing drifted over the bustling capital of Nairobi, where lunchtime rush hour noise includes honking car horns and loud music blaring from stores. Organizers said the grassroots effort is aimed at promoting unity in the east African nation, where ethnic violence left more than 1,000 people dead after disputed elections four years ago. ""The whole point is to unite Kenyans in one action and provoke reflection about personal responsibility,"" said organizer Al Kags. ""We decided to go with the national anthem because it is the main prayer that binds us together. It's a clarion call that transcends all boundaries -- physical, mental, tribal, you name it."" Francis Mwiwa, 29, crawled out of bed to join in the singing from the Toronto suburb of Brampton. ""At the very least, I hope singing the national anthem together jolts regular Kenyans into looking at the big picture,"" Mwiwa said. ""Ethnic and tribal differences are obsolete. Instead of fighting amongst ourselves, we should be busy competing with the rest of the world."" The movement started on social media, and later expanded offline. It comes as much of Africa and the Middle East -- including Libya and Yemen -- are embroiled in violent protests demanding changes in leadership. Uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt have led to the toppling of long-term leaders after decades in power. However, the Kenyan effort is not an uprising, organizers said. ""Those nations are going through what we went through in 2002,"" Kags said, referring to the election of a new president after strongman Daniel arap Moi stepped down following 24 years in power. His retirement sent throngs of citizens dancing in the streets of the capital, Nairobi. ""We all have our different situations,"" Kags said. ""In a way, we are ahead of the game. We don't have to deal with dictatorship, and I know a few years down the line, they will be done with regimes and calling for unity."" Organizers say it will be an added bonus if it sends a warning to the government that the youth can organize without their help. ""I hope it also lets them know that we can get together and intellectually influence each other,"" said Antony Mwangi, another organizer. Mwangi said that the movement is ""simply a social cause"" and not a call to arms. ""Our government may not be perfect, but at the very least, we are a democracy,"" he said. Kenya is East Africa's largest economy and provides an important buffer of stability against the volatile Somalia and Sudan. In 2007, the nation's disputed election sparked ethnic violence. It pitted supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Youth in the nation have turned to social media to call for an end to ethnic division, and demand reform and accountability from the government.","The singing is a rare gesture in a continent facing violent uprisings .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid made amends for their midweek Champions League defeat in Lyon with a 6-2 rout of Villarreal in the Bernabeu on Sunday night. Inspired by the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo, Real closed to within two points of leaders Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga. The 1-0 defeat at Lyon has added to the pressure on coach Manuel Pellegrini, but he will rest easier after a comprehensive rout with former World Player of the year Ronado at its heart. Gonzalo Higuain and Brazilian ace Kaka both scored twice but it was Ronaldo who set Real on the way in the 18th minute with a trademark free kick. Madeira-born Ronaldo then paid his own tribute to the victims of the floods and mudslides on the Portuguese island by lifting his jersey to reveal a white t-shirt with ""Madeira"" written on it. A penalty from former Liverpool star Xavi Alonso completed the goal glut as they kept pace with Barcelona, who had beaten Racing Santander 4-0 on Saturday. Atletico Madrid had inflicted a first league defeat of the season on Barca last weekend but their joy proved short lived as they were beaten 1-0 by lowly Almeria. Pablo Piatti scored the winner three minutes from time for Almeria while Malaga boosted their hopes of survival after a 2-1 win at Espanyol.

"(CNN) -- The owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded last year, killing 11 workers and leading to what has been called the worst oil spill ever, said Monday that calling 2010 its ""best year"" in safety ""may have been insensitive."" Transocean Ltd., in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said hefty bonuses and raises to top executives were based in part on the company's ""performance under safety"" last year. ""We acknowledge that some of the wording in our 2010 proxy statement may have been insensitive in light of the incident that claimed the lives of eleven exceptional men last year and we deeply regret any pain that it may have caused,"" Transocean said in a statement to CNN. ""Nothing in the proxy was intended to minimize this tragedy or diminish the impact it has had on those who lost loved ones. Everyone at Transocean continues to mourn the loss of these friends and colleagues."" The statement did not address the controversy over the decision to give out cash awards despite the oil spill disaster. That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean President and Chief Executive Officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, the SEC report said. Newman's bonus was $374,062, according to the report, which Transocean filed Friday. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. ""Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,"" the SEC statement reads. ""As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our company's history."" The company called that record ""a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,"" the SEC filing said. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. The commission said problems with deepwater drilling are ""systemic"" and that only ""significant reform"" will prevent another disaster. Another report released March 23 determined that the oil spill was caused by a piece of drill pipe trapped in the rig platform's blowout preventer, a device intended to stop oil from flowing into the Gulf. The report was commissioned by various U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The Interior Department has said a much broader report that relies on additional sources of data, including eyewitness accounts and photos, will be released this summer. The oil spill has prompted a flood of lawsuits against BP, Transocean and Halliburton from a variety of plaintiffs, including owners of Gulf businesses who say they suffered heavy financial losses because of the spill. The plaintiffs also include Transocean shareholders who contend the company falsely claimed it had remedied past safety problems with its blowout preventers before the Gulf spill.","Transocean acknowledges words were ""insensitive"" in light of 11 worker deaths .

"Washington (CNN) -- Global energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp. will be forced to face a lawsuit over alleged murder and torture committed by company agents in remote Indonesia, after a federal appeals court said Friday that corporations cannot claim immunity from liability. A divided 2-1 panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reinstated a massive lawsuit filed by 15 Indonesian villagers from the oil-rich province of Aceh. They claim government security forces working for Exxon Mobil committed brutal oppression while guarding a natural gas facility in 2000-01. At issue is whether foreign nationals can go into U.S. courts to press civil claims stemming from actions overseas by non-American citizens in a time of martial law. The decision will have widespread implications for multinational corporations doing business in other countries. ""It would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in lawsuits brought for 'shockingly egregious violations of universally recognized principles of international law,'"" wrote Judge Judith Rogers in a detailed, 112-page opinion. ""The law of the United States has been uniform since its founding that corporations can be held liable for the torts committed by their agents. This is confirmed in international practice, both in treaties and in legal systems throughout the world."" Rogers was supported by her colleague Judge David Tatel, both named to the bench by President Bill Clinton. Company spokesman Patrick McGinn said the ruling was being reviewed, and that the Irving, Texas-based firm has ""fought these baseless claims for many years."" ""The plaintiffs' claims are without merit,"" he said. ""While conducting its business in Indonesia, ExxonMobil has worked for generations to improve the quality of life in Aceh through employment of local workers, provision of health services and extensive community investment. ""The company strongly condemns human rights violations in any form."" The litigation is more than a decade old. The company had contracted with the Indonesian government to explore, extract, and process the gas. It hired military personnel as private security for the remote location. A key sticking point in the legal fight was the level of control Exxon Mobil officials in Aceh had over the actions of the Indonesian military. The plaintiffs alleged company officials in Indonesia were aware the military had committed past human rights violations. And they claim Exxon Mobil offered ""material support"" by separately hiring private mercenaries who provided ""advice, training, intelligence, and equipment"" to the dedicated military unit, which in turn committed brutal repression of locals, according to the lawsuit. Other allegations included sexual assault, battery, kidnapping, and false imprisonment against the villagers, many of whom had protested the presence of the company, fearing ecological and cultural damage to the region. Those questions will now be presented at trial, as the lawsuit is allowed to proceed. There was no timetable for when that trial will begin. In dissent, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President George W. Bush, said the federal law in question, the Alien Tort Statute, applies only to actions committed in the United States. ""The presumption helps the United States avoid conflicts with other nations, which of course have a strong interest in policing and regulating conduct in their own countries,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The ATS contains no textual indication that it was meant to apply to conduct in foreign countries."" The issue may eventually reach the Supreme Court, since lower federal courts have disagreed on the liability of conduct by U.S. companies operating around the world. The case is John Doe VII v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (09-7125).","Exxon Mobile cannot claim immunity in the case, an appeals panel says .

"(CNN) -- A former detention deputy with an Idaho sheriff's office has been charged with raping his wife, placing her in a car trunk and driving to his mother's residence, where he allegedly killed his mother, authorities said Wednesday. Michael James Lee, 24, of Meridian, had no previous criminal history and was fired from the department about a year ago, said Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for the Ada County Sheriff's Office in Boise. Lee was arraigned Wednesday on six felony charges, including first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, rape and aggravated assault, Dearden said in a press release. According to the sheriff's office, Lee on Tuesday assaulted his wife, bound her with chains and tape, put her in the trunk of a car and drove to his mother's house in the neighboring city of Eagle, about 15 miles northwest of Boise. He also threatened to harm their 4-month-old daughter, who also was driven to the house, according to the statement. Lee's wife later said he was going to his mother's house to rob her, authorities said. Lee had dinner with his mother, and spoke with her and the woman's 56-year-old female roommate. The roommate said she went to lie down. The roommate ""heard a noise"" and found Lee with his mother, authorities said. The suspect was holding a knife and had stabbed his mother multiple times, according to authorities. CNN affiliates KTVB and KBCI identified the victim as Lynn Marie Blake, 46. ""While this was going on, the wife, who had been in the trunk for an hour, heard a car and used the emergency latch to get out of the trunk and ran to get help,"" according to the Ada County Sheriff's Office statement. Deputies found Lee next to his mother's body, according to authorities. The roommate, who had tried to intervene, was attacked by Lee but managed to escape from the house with the infant girl, Dearden said. Her injuries were not life-threatening.","Former deputy charged with murder, rape and kidnapping .

"Washington (CNN) -- Current and past first ladies Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan will attend a memorial service Tuesday in California for former first lady Betty Ford. The White House announced that Obama would travel to Palm Desert, California, for the Tuesday service, which will be followed by a private funeral Thursday in Michigan. Clinton, the current secretary of state, will be accompanied Tuesday by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, an aide told CNN. Reagan also will attend the California service at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, a Reagan Foundation official said. Former President George W. Bush also will attend the service but without his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, who had previous travel commitments, according to a spokesman. Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, will attend the Michigan funeral, the spokesman said. Following the Tuesday service, Ford's remains will lie in repose at the church until midnight, then be flown on Wednesday to Michigan to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, according to a website on the memorial plans. Ford's remains will then lie in repose there beginning at 7 p.m. local time, said a statement posted on the website. On Thursday, Ford's private funeral will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, the statement on the website said. Ford, who died Friday at age 93, raised awareness of issues involving women's rights, cancer, alcoholism and substance abuse during and after her stint as first lady. Her late husband, former President Gerald Ford, died in 2006. The alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Rancho Mirage, California, that bears her name has become one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the country. In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton said she was ""grateful for having known"" Ford. ""Her commitment to speaking out on issues that, before she took them on, were just not discussed made a huge difference in the lives of Americans,"" Clinton said. ""I remember well when my mother's best friend was dying of breast cancer, nobody talked about it in those days,"" Clinton continued. ""But Betty Ford made it acceptable"" to discuss the issue in public. Also planning to be in California for the Tuesday service are protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church of Kansas, which cited on its website what it called Ford's infidelity by divorcing a first husband to marry Gerald Ford. The church is known for publicity seeking protests at funerals of U.S. soldiers and others to promote its radical conservative Christian agenda. CNN's Elise Labott and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Former President George W. Bush to attend, but not Laura Bush .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The legendary rock band KISS signed up to pay tribute to Michael Jackson in an October concert that will also headline Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis, Smokey Robinson, Cee Lo Green and JLS, the promoters told CNN Monday. Musicians who played in Jackson's touring band for the past two decades will also reunite as the house band for ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert"" in Cardiff, Wales, according to promoter Global Live Events. Kevin Dorsey, who served as musical director for several Michael Jackson tours, will also direct the October 8 show, it was announced Monday. Katherine Jackson, matriarch of the musical family, appeared on CNN Monday to discuss the show, which will also include performances by her children and grandchildren. ""I know he would be very excited about KISS,"" Michael Jackson's mother said. But fan reaction posted on the concert's Facebook page was negative to news that KISS would perform. ""This is a complete disgrace,"" wrote one fan.  ""You can kiss your audience goodbye folks. I doubt whether any self-respecting fan will pay a penny to see that man after the comments he made about Michael. I'm shocked this act was even considered."" Many of the negative comments referred to a story published by the Canadian Press a week after Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, quoting KISS leader Gene Simmons concerning sexual molestation allegations against the pop star. The promoter appeared unaware of the controversy Monday when CNN asked for a reaction. It appeared unlikely the tribute stage would be the scene for a reunion for the surviving members of the Jackson 5. Two of the brothers, Jermaine and Randy, have publicly objected to the show being held at the same time Michael Jackson's doctor is on trial for his death. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement after their mother and four siblings endorsed the show. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death,"" Jermaine and Randy Jackson said. Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial begins in September and is expected to continue through October. ""The trial is very important and I can understand how Randy and Jermaine feel, but it's been two years,"" Katherine Jackson told CNN Monday. ""I thought it was a good idea; I'd like to keep Michael's legacy alive."" Katherine Jackson plans to attend the trial, although she will miss some days to fly to Wales to attend the show with Michael Jackson's children, she said. ""It will be on a Saturday when the courtroom is dark,"" Paul Ring, a Global Live Events executive said. Members of the Jackson family taking the stage October 8 include several of Michael Jackson's brothers, ""the next generation of Jacksons,"" and 3T, which consists of Tito Jackson's three sons, the promoters said. Alternative rock band Alien Ant Farm and British R&B singer Craig David are also on the bill. ""This concert will unite various generations and musical genres, reminding everyone of just how amazing a talent Michael was,"" Ring said. Fans can ""register their interest for tickets"" online at www.michaelforevertribute.com. The concert in the Wales Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which seats 75,000 people, would be at least four hours long, Global Live Events CEO Chris Hunt said. A spokesman for Michael Jackson's estate said last month that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate's executors to use the late pop singer's name or image. ""The estate has not been contacted and is not involved with Global Live Events in the UK tribute concert announced today,"" spokesman Jim Bates told CNN at the time.","NEW: Some Jackson fans object to KISS performing because of Gene Simmons' comments .

"(CNN) -- The president of Turkish football champions Fenerbahce has been arrested as part of a nationwide investigation into match-fixing. Aziz Yildirim was among three club presidents to be detained during a raid on 12 provinces which began on Sunday and concluded on Monday, according to the Anatolia News Agency. Fenerbahce vice-president Sekip Mosturoglu and the club's new signings Sezer Ozturk and Emmanuel Emenike were also taken into custody, along with more than 50 others including former player and current staff member Cemil Turan. ""Club president Aziz Yildirim was detained in a probe into match-fixing allegations in the Turkish football league,"" read a statement on the Fenerbahce website. ""We would like to stress our trust in our legal system once again, wishing that the truth will come on as soon as possible.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Bobby Maurice Tillman, the Georgia teen stomped to death outside a home where a party was being held, died from a lacerated heart, Douglas County Coroner Randy Daniel told CNN Tuesday. He said the 18-year-old likely suffered a break in a rib bone, which in turn punctured his heart. If the young man had not been stomped, he probably would not have been injured in that way and would have survived the beating, Daniel added. Police say Horace Damon Coleman, 19, Emanuel Benjamin Boykins, 18, Quantez Devonta Mallory, 18, and Tracen Franklin, 19, stomped and beat Tillman outside a party in metro Atlanta over the weekend. The four men are facing felony murder charges. Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller has said the attack happened after some girls got into a fight, and one of them hit a boy. That boy, according to Miller, said he wasn't going to ""hit a girl,"" but the next guy who came by was going to get ""beat down."" Tillman walked by. Miller said the victim was a ""little guy, 18 years old, 5-foot-6, weighed 125 pounds."" ""He was small in stature, but ... his spirit and his strength were bigger to me than this world,"" Tillman's mother, Monique Rivarde, told CNN Tuesday. ""My son was bullied by four cowards.""

"(CNN) -- When all is said and done, Wendy Leigh is just a name on a book cover. Sometimes her name is accompanied by the word ""with,"" or, in the case of one juicy memoir, the phrase ""assisted by, edited by, and put into proper English by ..."" Leigh is a celebrity ghostwriter -- as crucial to the publishing process as paper and ink. ""Clearly I am not sitting there holding a pen with the [celebrity],"" said Leigh, who has co-written autobiographies with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone. ""It's a very delicate relationship,"" she said. ""I'm not there as an interrogator. ... Nothing will go in that book that they don't want. But that's not to say you're not going to do quite a bit of coaxing and convincing."" Leigh's latest, Barbara Eden's ""Jeannie Out of the Bottle"" is due out in 2011. Dan Strone, the CEO of Trident Media Group, a New York-based literary agency, said the reason celebrity memoirs are taking over bookshelves is simple: People buy them. More than 80 celebrity autobiographies have already been published this year. ""When certain books do well, publishers want more of those books. These books have been doing really well: The Toris [Tori Spelling] and the Kendras [Kendra Wilkinson] and the Jon Stewarts,"" he said. And with the increased interest in celebrity memoirs comes a need for people who can help get the celebrity's words down on paper. Enter Leigh, and a small circle of Hollywood ghostwriters. ""Sometimes celebrities will try to write a book themselves. ... But because everything in their life seems important, you get to page 200 and they're only 12 years old,"" Strone said. ""It's difficult to sit there by yourself and remember your life because you're in the center of it."" And not every star has the skill set or even the time to sit down and write an autobiography, said Stone. And it's not just memoirs. Some celebrities employ ghostwriters to help bring their novels to life. But according to ghostwriter Jon Warech, there is little appeal to co-writing someone's novel. ""The argument could be made that more people are going to read it or see it that way, but you're just handing over the credit to someone else,"" said Warech, who has co-authored memoirs with Kendra Wilkinson and Jodie Sweetin. ""But a memoir is their life. They deserve the credit because they lived it. All I'm doing is helping them put it on paper."" Warech said, despite being responsible to tell someone else's life story, there's little pressure involved. ""It's all about staying realistic,"" he said. ""If someone knows who they are ... and what their fan base is looking for, that's really helpful."" But even with the most accommodating, self-aware subject, ghostwriting is not for everyone, Strone said. ""You have to be sort of a shrink -- taking someone through their life, you need patience and put your own ego away because you're not the boss."" As a ghostwriter, ""you're part psychoanalyst, part best friend, part lion tamer, part interviewer and part nanny,"" Leigh said. ""You have to crack the whip now and again."" Leigh recalls working with Gabor, who went through co-authors like she went through husbands. Leigh, the fifth and final writer to attempt Gabor's memoir, ended up uncovering a long list of lovers Gabor had previously chosen to keep under wraps -- simply by asking -- including a secret affair with Frank Sinatra. ""I thought, 'Well, she's met all these people. ... If I had met those people, who would I have had affairs with?' "" Leigh used the same techniques when helping Madonna's younger brother Christopher Ciccone write his best-selling memoir, ""Life With My Sister Madonna."" ""I knew this was the most amazing topic. ... You could feel Madonna's breath on your face when he talked."" ""We live in an age where there's so much out there,"" Leigh said. ""You're very lucky if you have a scoop."" Even so, there's no guarantee that the scoop will end up in finished product, hence the aforementioned coaxing. ""It's the celebrity's book,"" Strone said. ""You can't make someone put something in a book that they don't want to put in it. They're not on the witness stand.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Five Yemeni civilians were killed and 18 others were injured Tuesday in government air raids just outside Sanaa, tribal leaders and eyewitnesses said. But two government officials said those killed were tribesmen who were taking up arms against the government. The fighting, which occurred in Arhab province just north of Sanaa, is the latest to erupt in Yemen, which has been wracked by insurgent activity and anti-government ferment. One of the government sources, a security official in Arhab, said that clashes erupted when the government ordered the tribes to hand over wanted criminals in the district. When the tribes refused, the government responded with force. ""The tribes are harboring criminals who stand behind the attacks on soldiers,"" the official said. A Defense Ministry official said slain militants ""put law in their own hands and looted governmental property. They were not civilians."" Eyewitnesses said that guards raided most of the villages in the district, damaging many homes, and residents estimate that more than 240 homes have been destroyed over the last month. ""We were sleeping in our houses when governmental rockets hit our house. We did not raise arms against the government but are still being attacked,"" said Abdul Kareem Mubarak, a resident in Barman village. Republican guards have been clashing with tribesmen in Arhab over the last month. The government also claims that the tribes attempted to seize the military compounds in the district. The security official said that the tribes have injured more than 25 government soldiers during the last two weeks. ""Our soldiers are being attacked. The government is trying to ensure law and order in Arhab district,"" the official said. Residents blame the guards for randomly attacking civilian property in Arhab. ""The guards are attacking anything they see. Everyone is a target and people are displaced,"" said Abdullah Mansour, an Arhab resident who lost his home. This comes after a surge of violence in a western Yemeni city overnight Monday. Supporters of Yemen's president converged on a central square in Hodeidah and killed an anti-government protester and injured more than 150 others, according to witnesses and a medical team member. The fighting around the city's Change Square was the bloodiest since May, and comes as tensions remain high between those who support President Ali Abdullah Saleh and those who have been demanding his ouster for months. Saleh, who was injured in an attack on the presidential palace last month, is now being treated in Saudi Arabia. John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, met Monday in Sanaa with Yemeni Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansoor Hadi, according to a report from Yemen's official Saba news agency. Hadi is officially the nation's acting leader, though Saleh has indicated his intention to return to his homeland. Brennan met with Saleh Sunday at a military hospital in Riyadh. Video of the meeting shows the Yemeni president wearing a suit jacket, his face still singed from the June 3 blast. Brennan wished Saleh ""a speedy recovery"" but also ""emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa,"" the White House said in a statement on Sunday's meeting. He urged Saleh to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council's political transition plan for Yemen, one that mandates that the president leaves the post he has held for many years. Saleh has voiced agreement with the plan brokered by the regional council, but he has not signed it.","Several people were wounded in the fighting .

"London, England (CNN) -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber. The police offered ""a further unreserved apology"" for the death of de Menezes in 2005, plus an undisclosed compensation package, the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement. ""All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved,"" the statement added. De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7, 2005. The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations, including one that found police acted illegally. A jury found in 2007 that London's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting. It did not examine the cause of death. Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him. They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train, which would have given them a reason to shoot. But the coroner at the inquest, who acted as the judge, had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing. They returned an open verdict in the case, meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death. De Menezes' family called the proceedings a ""whitewash"" because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing. De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system. Two weeks earlier, four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and wounding 977. The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers. Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes, 27, believing he was one of the suspects. They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station, where they chased him onto the platform and into a train, and shot him dead. The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action. ""We made a most terrible mistake,"" Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time, adding police needed to learn from the incident. ""I am sorry."" The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair. CNN's Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report.","UK police reach settlement with family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom police shot dead in 2005 .

"(CNN)  -- Cesc Fabregas is to move from Arsenal to European champions Barcelona, both clubs confirmed Sunday. The drawn out transfer saga concluded as Fabregas' new club laid claim to yet another honor by holding arch-rivals Real Madrid to a 2-2 draw in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. The Catalan giants confirmed the deal at halftime of the match at the Bernabeu in a short statement. ""Initial agreement between Arsenal and FC Barcelona for the transfer of Cesc with the signing of contracts and medical to take place on Monday,"" it read. Arsenal, who had been reluctant to let their captain go, conceded defeat. ""Arsenal announces today that they have reached an agreement in principle with Barcelona for Cesc Fabregas to move to Spain,"" said a statement on their club website. Manager Arsene Wenger, whose team drew 0-0 in their English Premier League opener at Newcastle, also gave his reaction. ""We have been clear that we didn't want Cesc to leave and that remains the case,"" he said. ""However, we understand Cesc's desire to move to his home town club and have now accepted an offer from Barcelona. We thank Cesc for his contribution at Arsenal and wish him future success."" Fabregas, who played in Spain's World Cup winning team in South Africa, left Barcelona as a 16-year-old in 2003 to play for Arsenal where he made 303 appearances, scoring 57 goals. He has played 58 times for his country. Neither club disclosed the transfer fee, with reports suggesting in the region of €40 million ($57m). In the absence of any last-minute hitch, Fabregas will be eligible to play in the second leg of the Super Cup final at Barcelona's Camp Nou Wednesday. Mesut Ozil put Jose Mourinho's Real ahead in the first half, but before the break goals from David Villa and Lionel Messi had left the Spanish champions in charge. Xabi Alonso's 54th minute equalizer salvaged a 2-2 draw for the home side.","Cesc Fabregas to move from Arsenal to Barcelona, clubs confirm .

"(CNN) -- As President Obama pushes forward with his agenda, he may find that a homecoming king's likeability is just as integral as the power and authority inherent to the Oval Office. President Obama's likeability is key to his leadership, experts say. ""I just don't think you can be effective without being liked,"" said Bruce Newman, a professor of marketing at DePaul University and editor of the Journal of Political Marketing. Newman describes Obama's leadership as a ""two-pronged support system of both being popular but yet having the respect."" ""I don't think you can be effective without that first step of making that emotional connection with the voter, but to continue to be effective, it's not enough,"" he said. Newman pointed to three recent examples of presidential candidates who lacked the appeal of their opponent: Bob Dole vs. Bill Clinton, John Kerry vs. George W. Bush, and John McCain vs. Obama. ""We are looking for leaders that we could relate to, that we would like to have dinner with or have a beer with or a glass of wine with,"" he added. Obama has been likened to Republican President Ronald Reagan, who was generally considered more popular than his policies at the start of his first term. Nearly 80 percent of those surveyed in a  CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released earlier this month said they approved of Obama as a person. But when poll takers were asked if they approved of how Obama was handling his job, the number dropped to about 60 percent. Surveys this week show Obama's approval ratings to be in the mid to high 50s, down a few points from last month.  Watch: Is the honeymoon over? » . While Obama's numbers have dropped since he took over the job, Mark Penn, who polled for President Clinton, says it's not time to worry yet. ""The kind of numbers you see in the high 50s are, in fact, very good numbers. Look, they're not the Inauguration Day numbers, but there's a very tough economy out there. The president is trying to move forward health care. There's a lot of increased contentiousness, given these issues,"" said Penn, who is the CEO of public relations firm Burson-Marsteller. Obama's numbers are particularly low on health care. A USA Today/Gallup poll released last week found that half the country disapproves of how he's handling the issue. The president has a lot riding on health care because he's championed it as his top domestic priority. ""It is pivotal to his presidency,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said. ""It's his single most important domestic initiative. He didn't run to fix the economy -- he inherited that. But he ran to fix health care."" Shortly before the presidential election, Brad VanAuken, a leading expert on brand management and author of ""Brand Aid,"" conducted an analysis of McCain and Obama's political brands. On specific issues, ""supports universal health care"" was the quality closest associated with Obama. ""His success with that issue is, to a very large degree, going to reflect on him because it's so closely associated with him. So therein lies the difficulty of that particular issue,"" VanAuken said. Obama's leadership is based on the fact that he is liked, Newman said, and that's something he can use to his advantage. ""He's created an emotional connection with the American public now,"" he said. The currency Obama has amassed in that emotional bond is what allows him to take gambles on issues like health care, he added. ""I think he's got an awful lot of currency built up. And I think he can make several mistakes before he begins to go down in popularity."" VanAuken's survey showed that Obama has a lot of strong personal capital built up with voters. He attributes Obama's ability to connect with audiences of different ages, races and religions to the fact that ""he is as much a part of the American melting pot as anyone."" But with Obama's added role of being the United States' homecoming king comes an added responsibility of being all things to all people at times. Last week, for example, the public turned to Obama to get his opinion on the controversy surrounding Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct after a confrontation with an officer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. That charged was later dropped. Obama said police acted ""stupidly"" in the arrest, but then backpedaled, saying he did not mean to slight the Cambridge Police Department. The president also acknowledged his words ""helped to contribute to ratcheting"" up the situation. ""Obviously, he had no authority over that whatsoever, but as the chief communicator ... they ask him for ceremonial and symbolic reasons,"" said Vincent Hutchings, an associate professor of political science at the University of Michigan. And that ceremonial role crosses borders each time the president travels outside of the country and becomes the face of the United States government to the rest of the world. A Pew study released last week indicated that the United States' image has improved considerably in much of the world since Obama took office. ""Ideally, of course a politician would like for their personal popularity to translate to their policies, and sometimes that does happen and it's maybe even happening now to a degree, but there are limits,"" he said. But, Hutchings noted, it's premature to start pointing to disparities in Obama's personal popularity and that of his policies to come to conclusions about his performance. ""The jury is still out on that,"" he said. ""It may well be that this is the beginning of a trend, or it may just be that this is just a blip.""","A president can't be effective without being liked, marketing professor says .

"(CNN Student News) -- June 1, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Germany  • Joplin, Missouri . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The start of a new month, the start of a new day of CNN Student News! Hi, I'm Carl Azuz, and I'm delivering your 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines. First Up: Home Prices Drop . AZUZ: First up, we're talking about a new low for the price of homes in the United States. During the first quarter -- the first three months -- of 2011, home prices dropped more than 5 percent from where they were last year. Now, that's according to a new report that came out yesterday. And the comparison gets even worse when you go back a little farther. The housing market hit its highest point five years ago in 2006. Compared to that -- that highest point -- prices of homes have dropped almost 33 percent. Home prices are down; so what? It might not be something that you think about every day, but some of your parents are paying close attention. Home prices affect a lot of other industries -- like banks, like construction -- so that's one of the big indicators that experts use to figure out how the U.S. economy is doing. And prices have gone through kind of a double-dip. They went down after that peak in 2006. Then they went back up a little bit around 2009. Some government programs designed to encourage people to buy houses helped with that increase. But now, they're dropping again. And one expert says it doesn't look like that's going to change any time soon. E. coli Outbreak . AZUZ: Officials in Germany are warning people there not to eat raw cucumbers, leaf lettuce, or tomatoes. The reason: an outbreak of E. coli. That's a bacteria that can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, especially raw vegetables. Reports have connected at least 16 deaths to the outbreak. Hundreds of other people have gotten sick. German authorities are trying to contain the outbreak. In the meantime, scientists are trying to figure out where it started. They don't have that answer yet. They think it could be traced back to produce from Spain. Germany buys more Spanish fruits and vegetables than any other country. And the concerns about those foods could cost Spain's food industry millions of dollars. Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What's the term for when energy travels in particles or waves? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Diffusion, B) Sublimation, C) Radiation or D) Circumnavigation? You've got three seconds -- GO! When energy is transmitted in particles or waves, it's called radiation. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Cell Phones & Cancer . AZUZ: The World Health Organization says that radiation from cell phones could possibly cause cancer. That announcement came after a group of scientists analyzed studies that have been done on cell phone safety. What this means is that the scientists found some evidence of an increase in certain types of cancer for cell phone users. They weren't able to make any conclusions about other types of cancers. One expert says it's hard because it can take several decades of exposure to see if there are any consequences. The wireless industry said the announcement does not mean cell phones cause cancer. It pointed out that the scientists didn't do new research, but just reviewed studies that already existed. This announcement probably will lead to more research on the issue. Tornado Recovery . AZUZ: Recovery efforts are getting started in Joplin, Missouri, and help is coming from some unexpected places. For example, a group of homeless volunteers from Kentucky. They collected donations for the tornado victims and then drove to Joplin to distribute them. Another unique source of help: an elephant from a circus that was supposed to perform in the area. The show, of course, couldn't happen. But the animal was able to use its strength to help workers clear heavy debris from some areas. Many residents of Joplin are still coming to grips with the devastation that hit their hometown. Morgan Schutters of affiliate KODE reports on the tornado's impact on the Joplin High School community. (BEGIN VIDEO) MORGAN SCHUTTERS, KODE REPORTER: Katie Wood graduated from Joplin High School just an hour before the tornado hit. KATIE WOOD, JOPLIN HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI: Even looking at it, it's still really hard to believe it. SCHUTTERS: Now, she's singing the national anthem at a memorial service for her classmates and the community. WOOD: It's so hard singing it right in front of my school that just blew away. SCHUTTERS: But Joplin High School sophomore Chanci McGowen still has the rest of her high school career ahead of her, as she looks at what is left in shambles. CHANCI MCGOWEN, JOPLIN HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE: It's indescribable. It's horrible, just devastating to see all the destruction of my school, my home. SCHUTTERS: McGowen is one of many students who lost both. MCGOWEN: It was heartbreaking. My whole neighborhood is gone, but everyone's OK. SCHUTTERS: It was a somber afternoon as they gathered outside the school. A moment of silence honoring military and tornado victims. Eight people in the Joplin R-8 School District are confirmed dead: seven students and one staff member. WOOD: Wondering who is still alive and who's not. SCHUTTERS: Superintendent Dr. CJ Huff said last Friday, when he got word, his world stopped. Sorrow for the lost and relief for the living. CJ HUFF, SUPERINTENDENT, JOPLIN R-8 SCHOOL DISTRICT: As a result of your diligence and unwavering fortitude in the face of insurmountable challenges, 100 percent of our family are accounted for. SCHUTTERS: Summer classes will begin as scheduled in less than three weeks, on June 13th. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a famous landmark visited by millions every year. I'm located in Arizona. I was formed by the Colorado River. I'm the Grand Canyon, a huge rock formation that's a mile deep. All Work, No Play . AZUZ: The Grand Canyon's a major vacation destination. The nearly 5 million people who go there every year prove that. But would the Canyon get even more visitors if American workers took as much vacation as employees in other countries? That's what we're talking about. When it comes to time off, the U.S. is not number one. Karin Caifa looks at some of the reasons why. (BEGIN VIDEO) KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Days at the beach, trips you'll remember for a lifetime. That's what summer is all about, right? Not for most American workers, who lag behind international counterparts in the vacation time given and the time taken. According to a survey by Expedia, workers in Great Britain got an average of 28 days' vacation last year. In France: 37. Here in the U.S.: 18. And they only used 14. So, what's holding Americans back? With the economy still recovering, some workers are just happy to have a job to go to every day. And with staffing pared to bare bones during the recession, they'd rather be at their desks than on a guilt trip. JEFF GARDERE, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: We feel that we're letting our colleagues down. We're afraid of the work that's waiting for us when we get back from vacation. And that guilt will make us not take the days off that we really need. CAIFA: There are also the lingering financial concerns. A recent survey from CareerBuilder found one in four workers simply can't afford a getaway this year. Twelve percent say they can afford it but won't go. And only one in three said they felt more comfortable taking a vacation this summer than they did last year. (END VIDEO) Driving Knowledge . AZUZ: Sticking with the idea of hitting the road, it turns out about 37 million American drivers shouldn't! According to a new survey, one out of every five people in the United States would fail a driving test if they had to take one today. And what's even more strange: that's an improvement! Last year, 38 million people -- one million more -- would have failed. This survey asked drivers from all 50 states 20 questions about basic driving knowledge. What do you do when you're approaching a yellow light? What's a safe following distance? Things like that. The concern is that not knowing the rules leads to dangerous driving habits. Daily E-mail . AZUZ: Teachers, we know a lot of you get our daily e-mail. As you get ready to head off for the summer, you don't need to unsubscribe. The email is not gonna come out every day. We'll only send you something when we have something to say, like when one of our special summer shows goes up at CNNStudentNews.com. So stay subscribed; we will not spam you, we promise! Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we're checking out a barnyard brawl. Boom! Only problem is, this isn't the barnyard. It's somebody's back yard! A flock of sheep showed up in a California neighborhood, and they didn't want to go anywhere. Police surrounded the feisty flock and eventually had to call in animal control. It's not like you could ask the sheep to leave nicely. I mean, you might try, but you know they wouldn't go for it. Goodbye . AZUZ: Those guys just look like they have baaaaad attitudes. Or maybe they were hoping not to get noticed so they could pull the wool over everyone's eyes. That would have been shear genius. It's always fun to see sheep on the lamb. But now that the whole thing's over, I bet they felt sheepish about causing such a problem. They are known to have bleat-ing hearts. You can tell the year's winding up, because we're getting awfully punchy. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Consider the significance of a drop in U.S. home prices .

"(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 ""the best year in safety performance in our company's history,"" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's ""performance under safety,"" the Transocean filing states. ""Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,"" the SEC statement reads. ""As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history."" The company called that record ""a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,"" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. The commission said problems with deepwater drilling are ""systemic"" and that only ""significant reform"" will prevent another disaster. Another report released March 23 determined that the oil spill was caused by a piece of drill pipe trapped in the rig platform's blowout preventer, a device intended to stop oil from flowing into the Gulf. The report was commissioned by various U.S. agencies, including the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. The Interior Department has said a much broader report that relies on additional sources of data -- including eyewitness accounts and photographs -- will be released this summer. The oil spill has prompted a flood of lawsuits against BP, Transocean and Halliburton from a variety of plaintiffs, including owners of Gulf shore businesses who claim they suffered heavy financial losses because of the spill. The plaintiffs also include Transocean shareholders who contend the company falsely claimed it had remedied past safety problems with its blowout preventers, prior to the Gulf spill.","Transocean executives get pay raises, bonuses, SEC filing says .

"Paris (CNN) -- Five French troops and an Afghan civilian were killed on Wednesday in an insurgent attack in an eastern province of Afghanistan, the French president's office said. The incident occurred in Afghanistan's Kapisa province, where the French have a strong troop presence, and it comes a day after French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited the country to meet with French troops. The office said the soldiers were protecting a shura, a gathering of high-profile figures, in Joibar village when ""a terrorist detonated his bomb within proximity of the French soldiers."" The village is in Kapisa's Tagab valley. Along with those killed, four French soldiers and three Afghan civilians were injured. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said ""the Taliban claim responsibility for the suicide attack."" Capt. Justin Brockhoff -- a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force --also reported five international troop deaths, but the spokesman did not disclose the nationalities of those killed per ISAF policy. He said ISAF received a report that the strike could have been a suicide attack and a ""small and heavy weapons attack as well."" France has about 3,900 troops in Afghanistan, according to the NATO mission there, and the Defense Ministry says it has lost 69 service members in the long war. France has said it will begin to reduce troop numbers, following a ""timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the American troops,"" according to a statement from the president's office last month. In addition, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told France Info radio last month that all French soldiers could be out of Afghanistan by 2013. According to the U.S. timetable, some 33,000 U.S. troops will be withdrawn by September 2012. That will leave just under 70,000 Americans in Afghanistan. Sarkozy, who is back in France after his Afghanistan trip, passed along his condolences and said France is determine to continue working with ISAF ""to restore peace and stability"" in Afghanistan. CNN's Mishan Afsari, Matiullah Mati and Dheepthi Namasivayam contributed to this report .","NEW: 69 French service members have died in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- The parents of missing English toddler Madeleine McCann on Friday unveiled a digitally enhanced picture showing what she might look like today if she is still alive. Madeleine McCann was 3 when she disappeared in 2007; this photo shows what she may look like at 6. Madeleine was 3 years old when she disappeared during a family vacation in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 4, 2007. Portuguese police closed the case last July without a resolution. The picture, which her parents revealed in an interview on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" airing Monday, is a school-style photo showing Madeleine at 6 years old, with a pink headband and shoulder-length hair. An expert at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created the image using photographs of Madeleine's parents, a spokesman for the center told Guardian.co.uk. Kate and Gerry McCann also discussed how they're coping with the disappearance of their daughter. ""Child abduction, I think, could destroy any family. There's no doubt about it,"" Gerry McCann told Winfrey.  Watch why the McCann's are waiting for Madeleine » . ""But we've been supported tremendously well and I think that's helped us stay strong and stay together. Obviously, we're really united in our goal and our love of Madeleine and Sean and Amelie."" Kate McCann said she keeps Madeleine's room ready for her and admitted to visiting it twice daily, ""just [to] say hello... just [to] tell her we're still going ... to do everything we can to find her."" Madeleine vanished from the family's holiday villa at the Portuguese beach resort while her parents dined in a nearby restaurant. The couple have campaigned publicly for information about their daughter's whereabouts since her disappearance.","Digitally enhanced image shows what Madeleine McCann may look like today .

"(CNN) -- This is a tale of two cities tied together by two tornadoes of the most wicked order, the apocalyptic EF-5 -- and by acts of charity that followed. It demonstrates how one good turn -- or town -- deserves another. First, the town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, got hit by a twister on April 27, killing 41. So, like many others across the country, the residents in and around Joplin, Missouri, dispatched volunteers and relief goods to the Alabama community. Melodie Schultz of Joplin even participated in a fund-raiser. ""I got involved just by seeing that they needed the help in Tuscaloosa, and a friend of mine started just a group of us: 'Joplin Helping Tuscaloosa, Alabama,' "" Schultz told CNN. Pastor Matt Harenza of Carterville Christian Church in Carthage, Missouri, just 16 miles from Joplin, donated manpower to the Tuscaloosa wreckage. ""When the tornado happened in Tuscaloosa, a sister church there in Nashville (Tennessee) called and asked if we could bring our team to Tuscaloosa and help out,"" said Harenza. ""So we got our team and got our tools and stuff and went down there to help out."" Then, a month later, fortunes between the Tuscaloosa and Joplin were reversed. The single deadliest U.S. twister since modern record-keeping began in 1950 ripped through Joplin, killing 142 persons. It, too, was an EF-5. So the people of Tuscaloosa and elsewhere in Alabama returned Joplin's favor. A truckload of water, diapers, baby food and other relief materials arrived Saturday for the people of Joplin, and the goods were being stored in a warehouse at Harenza's church because Joplin is too obliterated to house the supplies. The donations were delivered courtesy of the relief group Toomer's for Tuscaloosa and Ashley Furniture HomeStore of Birmingham, Alabama, said Chris Fields, a spokesman for Toomer's. ""Sunday afternoon, we saw on the Weather Channel that there was a storm that was about to hit Joplin, and we wondered why we recognized that name so well,"" Fields said. ""We realized why we recognized it,"" he said. Joplin residents ""sent down a giant truck of aid for the residents of Tuscaloosa,"" he said. So, the residents of Tuscaloosa and other parts of Alabama donated enough goods to fill two 53-foot trucks and a 26-foot truck, Fields said. The 26-foot truck, with a Toomer's banner saying ""Stuff-The-Truck. Joplin, Mo bound,"" was eventually diverted to another tornado-wracked community in Arkansas, but the two bigger trucks continued on their mission to provide relief to Joplin, Fields said. Fields was amazed at the outpouring of support for Joplin, with donations arriving by the pickup load, leaving him in tears, he said. ""These people have been through it and they know exactly what to bring,"" from flashlights to batteries to baby bottles, Fields said of Tuscaloosa residents' donations. ""It is part of our healing process to help someone who has been through the exact same thing that we had been through. That's why so many people stepped up to the plate,"" Field said. ""This movement is so large, so many people stepping up as individuals taking care of their neighbors, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing to happen in this country,"" Fields added. For Schultz's part, she was volunteering for a Tuscaloosa fund-raiser in Joplin on the very day that the tornado ripped through her Missouri town, she said. In dramatic fashion, she raised money by doing mini-photo shoots and managed to do 20 of them before disaster struck Sunday, she said. ""We managed to make it to safety probably five or 10 minutes before the tornado hit,"" Schultz said. Tuscaloosa's mutual humanitarianism moved her, she said. ""They just want to do whatever they can to help us, which is amazing to me. They've gone through the exact same thing, not even a month ago, and are so willing to send truckloads of food and anything that we need down here, and they're happy to do it,"" Schultz said. ""They've got our backs, and they're completely supportive."" Harenza, the pastor, said seeing the truckload of donations from Tuscaloosa was ""an emotional thing."" Similar trucks from around the country arrived in Tuscaloosa during his volunteer efforts there last month, he said. ""You just go, 'Wow, people care about people,' and this tragedy almost pulls us together as a nation,"" Harenza said. Said Fields: ""It's supernatural what has happened here as far as I'm concerned."" CNN's Chris Turner and Emily Robards contributed to this report.","A tornado hits Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in April .

"(CNN) -- Argentina are into the quarterfinals of the 2011 Copa America after the hosts scored a comfortable 3-0 victory against Costa Rica in Cordoba. Two goals from Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero and one from Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria secured the three points Sergio Batista's team needed to avoid an early exit from the quadrennial competition. The two-time world champions advanced from Group A in second position, after Colombia defeated Bolivia 2-0 on Sunday to advance in first place. La Albiceleste will now face the second-placed team from Group C, which will be one of Chile, Peru or Uruguay. Is Argentine football in crisis? Argentina were gifted the lead on the brink of half-time, when goalkeeper Leonel Moreira spilled midfielder Fernando Gago's volley and the 23-year-old Aguero finished from close range. Aguero's second goal, and third of the tournament, arrived seven minutes into the second half, when the former Independiente striker latched onto a perfectly weighted pass from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi to sidefoot the ball beyond Moreira. Di Maria completed the scoring just past the hour mark, firing home from 10 yards after another perfect pass from Barcelona's Messi. River Plate's fate a warning to Latin American giants . Batista made four changes to his starting line-up after two draws in Argentina's opening two matches against Bolivia and Colombia. The most high-profile name to be dropped was Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez, with the 48-year-old coach preferring to field a front three of Aguero, Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain anchored by Messi. ""We needed a game like this to restore the confidence of the players,"" Batista told the tournament's official web site. The 1986 World Cup winner praised the impact of Messi, who showed glimpses of the dazzling form he displayed for European champions Barca last season. ""Messi was brilliant and I was pleased by the application of the team, this is the game we want. ""We needed to have security as a team and keep the ball. Lionel knows how to overcome these situations and he showed today."" Messi, 24, thanked the fans in the Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes for their support. ""I want to thank the fans, we missed this affection. From now another Cup begins, more than anyone, we want the best for Argentina.""

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- Gunmen who shot dead Facundo Cabral likely did not have the Argentine folk singer as their intended target, said Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Menocal. Cabral, one of Latin America's best-known folk singers, was killed Saturday on his way to the airport in Guatemala City. In the car with Cabral was a Nicaraguan businessman, Henry Farina, who was driving, said Menocal. ""Everything points to that the attack was directed at him (Farina), and not the artist,"" he said. Still, a motive for the shooting remained unclear. Farina was wounded, but survived the attack. Cabral died, becoming the latest victim in a wave of violence that has rocked the nation ahead of elections. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared three days of national mourning in honor of the singer. In Guatemala on a Latin American tour, Cabral, 74, left his hotel early Saturday morning in a white SUV for an eight-minute ride to the airport. Gunmen attacked the SUV -- at least 20 bullet holes could be seen on the Range Rover. Nothing was reported stolen from the vehicle, government spokesman Ronaldo Robles said Saturday. Police found a brown Hyundai Santa Fe nearby containing bullet-proof vests and AK-47 magazines. Robles and other authorities have said an investigation was underway. ""You can't blame New Yorkers for the death of John Lennon. Just like you can't blame Guatemalans for the death of Facundo Cabral,"" said Ernesto Justo Lopez, the Argentine ambassador to Guatemala. Ironically, Cabral, who said he was inspired by Jesus Christ and Mohandas Gandhi, was recognized in 1996 by the Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a ""World Peace Messenger."" Cabral gained fame as a protest singer. His song, ""No Soy De Aqui, Ni Soy De Alla"" (""I'm Not From Here Nor There"") was recorded in nine languages by stars including Julio Iglesias and Neil Diamond.","Shots were directed at the singer's driver, an official says .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's defense minister rejected U.S. allegations that the country was helping insurgents in neighboring Iraq, saying Wednesday that such ""baseless claims"" demonstrate U.S. failure in the Middle Eastern country. Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi's comments were reported by the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Vahidi said the United States was trying to sow discord among the countries in the region. His comments came after U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta became the latest U.S. official to reiterate that Iraq needs to crack down on armed factions that have been targeting U.S. troops with Iranian-supplied weapons. ""We are very concerned about Iran and weapons they are providing to extremists here in Iraq, and the reality is that we've seen the results of that,"" Panetta told troops in Baghdad Monday. ""In June, we lost a hell of a lot of Americans."" The U.S. force of 46,000 has come under increased attacks in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said any potential agreement with Iraq for U.S. forces to stay on beyond the end-of-the-year deadline must confront the issue of Iranian involvement. ""Iran is playing an out-sized role right now,"" Mullen said. ""Iran is very directly supporting extremist Shia groups (in Iraq), which are killing our troops."" He added that Iran had made a decision in 2008 to scale back its involvement in Iraq but had recently stepped up its activities, possibly so it could claim credit for the American withdrawal. Tehran has said Washington, with its accusations, is trying to project the blame for U.S. troop deaths elsewhere.","Iran's defense minister says the U.S. is trying to sow discord in the region .

"(CNN) -- Luke Donald gave his preparations for next week's British Open a massive boost by securing a comfortable four-stroke victory in the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, Inverness on Sunday. The world number one secured his third title of 2011 with a superb nine-under-par final round 63 -- his lowest-ever round on the European Tour -- for a 54-hole total of 197 (-19) in a tournament reduced to three rounds because of adverse weather conditions.

"Paris (CNN) -- Monaco newlyweds Prince Albert and Princess Charlene are suing the French magazine L'Express for spreading what they say were false rumours about them in the lead-up to their July 2 wedding. The news magazine reported on its website June 28 that Princess Charlene, née Wittstock, tried to flee for her home country South Africa days before the lavish wedding. It alleged that she wanted to leave after she discovered that Prince Albert had fathered a third illegitimate child while still engaged to her. The prince has previously admitted fathering two children out of wedlock with two different women. The press service for the royal palace confirmed Tuesday that a lawsuit had been filed. In a statement July 22, Michel Roger, the principality's head of government, said the couple are suing the weekly magazine for ""invasion of private life and printing fallacious information on its website following unfounded allegations."" The royal couple's Paris-based lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, could not be reached for comment. The article purported that Charlene was stopped from leaving the Nice airport after the palace tipped off police. L'Express told CNN it could not comment on the issue since it has not yet received an official complaint from the royal couple. But in an article July 22, the magazine said it stands by its original reporting, which it said came from sources close to the wedding process. French privacy laws are very strict, and prohibit publications from intruding on the private lives of public figures. Celebrities commonly file lawsuits against tabloid and gossip magazines and win damages from the publications.","The couple married July 2 .

"(Mashable)  -- The United States no longer owns the world's fastest supercomputer. A computer called Tianhe-1A, unveiled on Wednesday at a conference in Beijing, China, can run calculations faster than the previous speed leader, a computer at a U.S. lab in Tennessee. The new computer set a performance record by crunching 2.507 petaflops of data at once. The previous leader, a computer called Cray XT5 Jaguar and located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, completed 1.75 petaflop calculations. Analysts say the new record underscores China's place as a global tech leader. According to Nvidia, the computer technology company, the world's fastest computer will be operated as an open access system and will be used for large scale scientific computations. Supercomputers, which essentially are many computers strung and networked together, fill entire rooms and even small warehouses. They are often used to processes huge amounts of scientific data.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Fashion designers are giving new life to worthless candy wrappers, newspapers and plastic bags; turning trash into trendy tote bags, purses and jewelry. Target stores objected to this Timbuk2 purse which included  plastic bags with its bull's-eye logo. From ""post-consumer and industrial waste"" comes durable, funky accessories reportedly worn by celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Cameron Diaz and Petra Nemcova. One self-described eco-fashion label, Ecoist, has partnered with Coca-Cola, Luna Bar and Aveda to create handbags made from misprinted and discontinued packaging. ""We tap into that source of waste because it is reliable, and unfortunately, it's abundant,"" Ecoist co-founder Jonathan Marcoschamer said. ""We believe that for the next few years, there's going to be a significant amount."" How about 7.6 billion tons of waste? That's how much American companies toss each year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. During the past four years, Ecoist said, it has sold more than 100,000 accessories created by its designers in Peru and Miami, Florida. The bags -- some of them one-of-a-kind -- are priced from about $30 for smaller versions to about $180 for larger ones. ""For now, we're an immediate solution for many of these companies to utilize waste for something that's creative and promotes environmental awareness,"" Marcoschamer said. Ecoist isn't alone. Katherine Rasmussen, owner of the label Reiter8, creates totes from recycled boat sails. Nicola Freegard and Robin Janson, the design team behind Vy&Elle, have recycled 100 tons of vinyl billboard ads to create wallets, bags and a variety of other products. Another designer, Anna Built, has opted to create jewelry from recycled tin cans. But it's not always easy being green. Timbuk2, a company famous for its messenger bags, has encountered resistance in its attempt to produce totes made from discarded plastic bags. The idea seemed feasible when Timbuk2 formed a partnership with RootPhi, which developed a machine capable of bonding plastic bags together. The machine, called the Lamitron, allowed them to produce a new fabric while maintaining the visual details of the original plastic bag.  See photos of the eco-friendly accessories » . The timing seemed appropriate; San Francisco had banned the use of plastic bags, and other cities worldwide were considering similar initiatives. Despite a following of 3,000 potential customers on the Timbuk2 Web site, the bags are unlikely to be sold any time soon, if at all. The companies have encountered legal and technical hiccups in their efforts to mass produce the bags. ""Everyone is afraid to be the large-scale manufacturer, to stick their toe in the water. It's a risk and a cost issue,"" says Doug Patt, co-founder of RootPhi. Tinbuk2 also found that, although trash may no longer have an owner, logos on trash still do. Target sent Timbuk2 a cease and desist letter in September when it discovered that some Lamitron bags showed the company's bull's-eye design. RootPhi and Timbuk2 scrambled to identify and remove the offending bags from its limited collection of prototypes. ""We encourage and promote recycling efforts, including ones that use our recycled bags,"" Target said in a written statement to CNN. ""However, in this particular case we believed that the prominent use of our bull's-eye design mark implied a sponsorship or affiliation with Timbuk2 that did not exist at that time."" Target said Timbuk2 has cooperated. Perry Klebahn, Timbuk2's CEO, acknowledges that Target wasn't technically wrong. ""The onus was on us to talk to Target and get them to say OK, in this particular case, to grant us a license. If we really are going to make use of this, we should be responsible as the manufacturer."" However, the initial draw for Timbuk2 was the possibility that it could simultaneously clean up neighborhoods and satisfy a market demand for highly localized and personalized eco-products. ""What's great here is that no two bags are the same. ... What if you could roll into a town and make artifacts that have a local flavor?"" Klebahn asked. His vision was that one day, anyone could drop off their used shopping bags at Timbuk2 and receive a customized tote bag a few weeks later. For now, the masses will have to wait. Eco-fashion has certainly proved that it has enough caché in the fashion world. Last year, British designer Anya Hindmarch created an instant eco-fad with her $15 limited edition ""I Am Not A Plastic Bag"" bag. The cotton bags quickly sold out in London and New York, with hundreds of people lining up for them. The bags fetched $400 on eBay and spawned a dizzying number of knock-offs. Atlanta, Georgia, boutique owner Joyce Justicz said she doesn't think consumers buy eco-fashion exclusively for environmental reasons. ""They buy them because they're cute, and it's an added bonus,"" she said. Will the trend last? Yair Marcoschamer, another Ecoist co-founder, is optimistic. ""Businesses and individuals have realized that if something isn't done [about the environment], this is going to have a profound effect on each of our lives,"" he said. ""Consuming products that are fair-trade, that are environmentally responsible, is our responsibility as consumers.""","""Cute"" accessories have ""added bonus"" of being environmentally friendly .

"(CNN) -- United States health authorities have added eight commonly used substances to its official ""Report on Carcinogens,"" saying they may put people at increased risk of developing cancer. The industrial chemical formaldehyde and a botanical substance known as aristolochic acids are listed as ""known human carcinogens"" while six others, including certain inhalable glass wool fibers and styrene, used in Styrofoam, are listed as substances ""reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogen,"" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday. Formaldehyde, which was listed on a previous report, was upgraded to ""known carcinogen"" after it was found to cause nasal cancer in rats. A colorless, flammable chemical, formaldehyde may be found in a wide range of products from plastics, synthetic fibers to hair straightening products and textile finishes. Aristocholic acid -- a natural-occurring botanical substance -- may cause cancer of the urinary tract and permanent kidney failure, the report stated. It is used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine and in some weight-loss herbal medicines. Six other commonly used products were listed as ""reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens"", including styrene, a chemical found in products such as Styrofoam and fiberglass.

"(CNN) -- Journalists in Sri Lanka have come under a growing number of attacks and intimidation, with some fleeing the country or losing their lives, media analysts and rights groups say. Chief editor of the privately-owned Rivira newspaper after he was attacked on Friday. On January 8, a prominent journalist who had been critical of the government was shot and killed by unknown assailants on the outskirts of Colombo. His death came days after masked gunmen besieged a privately owned television station and destroyed its equipment; and in another attack in January, a newspaper editor and his wife were stabbed on their way to work. While Sri Lankan authorities have denied any government involvement, the cases have prompted international criticism of Sri Lanka over the safety of journalists. There are also questions about press freedoms. ""As the [President] Rajapakse government ramps up the war against the Tamils, there's been growing criticism of the government and at times it's been partisan --partisan journalists -- but basically in the last year and a half we have most likely seen five or six senior journalists either thrown in jail, threatened or gone into exile because of disagreements with the government,"" said Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator of the journalism watchdog group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Rajapakse has condemned the violence against journalists and promised thorough investigations. Dietz said attacks against journalists are not new in the nation, whose government has been battling ethnic Tamil rebels-- known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)-- since the 1980s. The conflict has claimed more than 65,000 lives. Sixteen journalists have been killed in Sri Lanka since 1992, and three journalists were imprisoned, including one on terrorism charges, in 2008, according to CPJ. The group said many journalists also have faced threats and intimidation. As the civil conflict first unfolded, minority Tamil journalists were targeted, but pressure against the media has gradually fallen upon mainstream news organizations, including those from the majority Sinhalese ethnic group, Dietz said in a telephone interview. ""What we're seeing in the last year and a half is a change in tactics from the government of just putting pressure on Tamil journalists to putting the pressure on mainline Sinhalese or Muslim journalists who write for more legitimate papers or news outlets and are critical of the government,"" he said. The allegations come as Sri Lanka's government said it was close to defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, who have been fighting for an independent homeland in the South Asian nation. Rajapakse has given assurances that no journalist or media institution has reason to fear any threats or attacks by the government. In a statement posted to the Ministry of Defence Web site on January 15, the president said: ""The government had no interest whatever in seeking disgrace through any attacks on the media."" ""The president said that at a time when the government was at the very height of its popularity due to the success of the offensive against terrorism, it had no interest in losing this public acceptance by even an iota, by attacks on the media as had taken place,"" the statement said. Still, many journalists say they feel threatened. The Web site for the Ministry of Defence has named journalists who officials consider to be traitors, Dietz said. Sanjana Hattotuwa, editor of a citizen journalism Web site groundviews.org and a senior researcher at the Center for Policy Alternatives, said the government ""through inaction or through complicity"" has allowed for an environment where violence against journalists can grow with impunity. ""People are scared. People are worried,"" Hattotuwa said. ""Nobody wants to be killed, nobody wants to be incarcerated, nobody wants to leave a country which is home."" Police are investigating the three recent attacks on journalists but no arrests have been made, Lucien Rajakarunanayake, Sri Lanka's Director of Policy Research and Information in the Presidential Secretariat, told CNN in a telephone interview. The U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Robert Blake, is among those who have expressed concern over the attacks. Blake said, ""we have called on the government of Sri Lanka to investigate these attacks expeditiously."" ""It's difficult to speculate about what's behind all this, but I think what's important for the government to focus on now is what they can do to address this problem of impunity, whereby no one has been brought to justice for the many high profile killings -- not just of journalists but many other people -- for the many abductions that have occurred and other human rights abuses that have occurred."" Rajakarunanayake told CNN there ""is no government policy of impunity."" He also noted: ""I can categorically tell you that there is no restriction on the media, there is no censorship in our country."" In his final editorial before he was gunned down on January 8, Lasantha Wickrematunga, editor-in-chief of The Sunday Leader, predicted his own death in a posthumously published column and pointed the finger at the government. ""It is well known that I was on two occasions brutally assaulted, while on another my house was sprayed with machine-gun fire. Despite the government's sanctimonious assurances, there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks, and the attackers were never apprehended,"" he wrote in the column titled, ""And Then They Came for Me."" Many fear this case will never be solved.","Journalist slain, another stabbed and a TV station attacked in last four weeks .

In May, Tibetan representatives will meet to discuss the Dalai Lama's proposal of political retirement. Their recommendations will be forwarded to the exiled parliament so that it can ratify the constitution and relieve the spiritual leader of his political responsibilities.

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- At least 76 people died in Norway in a terror attack July 22 that started with a bomb blast in the capital Oslo and continued with an hour-long gun rampage at a camp for Labour Party teens and young adults on nearby Utoya Island. Police arrested a lone gunman, Anders Breivik, 32. Here are the latest developments. NEW DEVELOPMENTS . --Anders Breivik was "" a little bit surprised"" that his attacks succeeded, his lawyer Geir Lippestad says Tuesday, adding that Breivik had not expected to get to Utoya Island. --The suspect was on drugs to make him stronger and more awake during the attacks, Lippestad says. He says Breivik ""may be"" insane, but that it is too early to say if he will mount an insanity defense. --Police say they will announce Tuesday when they will publish the list of names of the victims. --Police continue to search Utoya island and the surrounding waters for four or five missing people, and the island itself for clues. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED . --Anders Breivik, 32, appeared in closed court Monday. Judge Kim Heger later says Breivik admits carrying out the attacks but claims they were necessary to prevent the ""colonization"" of the country by Muslims. Breivik says the deaths are the price the Labour Party had to pay for its ""treason,"" the judge says. --Judge Heger orders Breivik held in custody for eight weeks, until his next court date. The first four weeks are to be in solitary confinement to prevent the possibility of tampering with evidence, the judge says. --The suspect's father, Jens Breivik, tells Norway's TV2 that his son must have mental problems. ""In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life,"" the father says, answering a reporter's question about mental illness by saying: ""There is no other way to explain it. A normal person would never do such a thing."" --Police announce Monday that the number of confirmed dead in the bombing is eight, an increase of one from previous reports. The number of dead on Utoya is 68, down from earlier reports as high as 86. That makes the confirmed death toll 76, down from earlier reports of 93. --Police say they are investigating Breivik claims that two other terror cells assisted him in the attack. They do not confirm the existence of the cells. --Breivik is charged with two acts of terrorism, police spokesman Henning Holtaas says. The maximum sentence is 21 years in prison, with the possibility of an extension at the end of the term if the court rules Breivik is still a threat. Norway does not execute people. --A 1,518-page manifesto bearing Breivik's name circulates online, containing rants about the rising number of Muslims in Europe, describing detailed plans for getting weapons, explosives and fake uniforms, and saying how to avoid detection by police while preparing the attack. --Almost 200,000 people participate in a memorial Monday in downtown Oslo to honor the victims, authorities say. Ringerike hospital chief surgeon Colin Poole says he has never seen gunshot wounds like those of the victims from the island, and speculates the injuries were caused by expanding or ""dum-dum"" bullets, a hospital spokesman says. Police decline to comment on the type of bullets the gunman used.","The suspect was on drugs to make him stronger and more awake during the attacks, Lippestad says.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Authorities in Northern Ireland have arrested a tenth person in connection with the death of a police officer in a car bombing last April, police said Wednesday. A 23-year-old woman was arrested in Omagh by detectives probing the death of Constable Ronan Kerr ""and associated incidents,"" the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. Five men were arrested Tuesday. Kerr died April 2 when an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh.  The 25-year-old had only recently joined the service, Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris said at the time. ""Our determination to pursue every possible line of enquiry remains undiminished,"" Detective Superintendent Raymond Murray said Tuesday. Of the 10 people arrested, only one has been charged in connection with the investigation -- though not with the killing.

Northern Ireland was racked by violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,500 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998. In August of that year, Omagh was the scene of the conflict's most deadly terrorist attack, in which a car bombing by the paramilitary splinter group Real IRA killed 29 people.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, landed in Havana on Monday for a private visit aimed at reducing tension between the Cold War enemies and seeing first-hand the economic reforms sweeping the communist island. But expectations are high that Carter also will work behind the scenes to secure the release of American contractor Alan Gross, who was recently sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison. Unlike his first visit in 2002, when then-President Fidel Castro personally greeted Carter on the tarmac, this time Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez was on hand to receive the former American leader. The Carter Center has called the three-day trip a non-governmental mission at the invitation of the Cuban government. On Monday afternoon, he met with Jewish leaders and the archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega. Carter declined to comment Monday when reporters asked him about Gross, shouting, ""There will be a press conference later."" A press conference is scheduled for Wednesday. Cuba accuses the U.S. Agency for International Development subcontractor of ""subversive"" work connecting people to the internet illegally, with the ultimate goal of undermining the government. Washington says he was simply helping the Jewish community connect to the worldwide web and has repeatedly said that bilateral relations cannot improve until Gross is released. Carter visited the Patronato Jewish center and Temple Beth Shalom. When Adela Dworin, the president of the temple, was asked if they discussed Gross, she said: ""We didn't talk about politics. We told him about the Jewish community in Cuba, how many members it has, how we openly practice our religion, etc."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Carter before his departure to discuss the issue, according to Molly Koscina, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. ""We hope President Carter will urge the Cuban government to immediately release Mr. Gross on humanitarian grounds,"" she told CNN. On Tuesday, Carter will have a face-to-face session with President Raul Castro. In many ways, the time is ripe. Castro has launched a major shakeup of the nation's Soviet-style economic model, paving the way for more small businesses and private enterprise. And just last week, Cuba released the last of 75 dissidents jailed in a 2003 crackdown on the opposition that prompted worldwide condemnation. So at least in theory, two of the major obstacles to bilateral negotiations have been lifted.","NEW: Carter visits a Jewish center and temple and meets with the archbishop of Havana .

"(CNN) -- An indictment unsealed in New York Tuesday provides further evidence of links between al Qaeda affiliates in Somalia and Yemen, a growing concern to counter-terrorism officials. And the indictment also sheds light on the Obama administration's policy on how to handle terror suspects detained overseas. The indictment charges Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame with providing material support to the extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, and to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen. He is also charged with conspiring to teach and demonstrate the making of explosives. If convicted, he faces a mandatory life sentence. Warsame, a Somali national, was captured by U.S. forces on April 19 in what the U.S. attorney's office in New York describes only as ""the Gulf region."" He was interrogated overseas for ""intelligence purposes"" for two months before finally being transferred to FBI custody and brought to the United States Tuesday, when he made an appearance in federal court. During that appearance, he pleaded not guilty, according to Ellen Davis, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. Warsame was held on a U.S. Navy ship in the Gulf region after his capture until being brought to New York for Tuesday's court appearance, according to the attorney's office. Neither the indictment nor the accompanying press release disclosed where the interrogation took place, but there is a substantial U.S. naval presence in the Arabian Sea. According to the indictment, Warsame, said to be in his mid-20s, provided material support for Al-Shabaab, which controls large areas of central and southern Somalia. He also provided the group with explosives, weapons and communications equipment. He also spent time in Yemen in 2010 and earlier this year, allegedly receiving explosives and other training from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which in the past two years has emerged as one of the most active parts of the organization. Unconfirmed local reports in Somalia have spoken of Al-Shabaab boats leaving Kismayo for southern Yemen as Islamist groups there -- including al Qaeda - have taken advantage of a growing political vacuum. Warsame is also alleged to have tried to broker a weapons deal with AQAP on behalf of al Shabaab. Both groups are designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. U.S. officials have recently spoken of growing links between Al-Shabaab and AQAP, and their ambitions to hit targets overseas. A joint Pentagon-CIA task force has recently stepped up pressure on Al-Shabaab, visiting Somalia to gather intelligence against the group. Late last month a U.S. drone strike against an al-Shabaab camp near the southern port of Kismayo is said to have killed several militants. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","A federal indictment is unsealed against a Somali man facing terrorism charges .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new national guidelines on Wednesday for mercury and air toxics released from power plants. The move came in response to a court-ordered deadline and would require many power plants to install pollution control technologies. ""Today we're taking an important step forward in EPA's efforts to safeguard the health of millions of Americans,"" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said at a press conference to sign the new order. ""Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution technologies to control and cut harmful emissions like mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases,"" Jackson said. Jackson said the new standards would ""prevent 91% of mercury in coal from being released in the air."" The D.C. Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to make the rules final by November. Companies have three years to comply, but some could get a one-year extension if the technology cannot be installed in time. The Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are expected to have broad health benefits, according to the EPA. The pollution control methods are expected to prevent 17,000 premature deaths and 11,000 heart attacks. The EPA said it would also help eliminate 10,000 cases of childhood asthma. The announcement was hailed by the American Lung Association and several groups of doctors who spoke at the press event. A group of second-graders from Amidon-Bowen Elementary School in Washington, D.C., joined EPA Administration Lisa Jackson as she signed the new guidelines. Dr. Marian Burton, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the students, ""I think you already know this rule is for you and for all the children in the America who will follow you. ""Dirty air makes people sick. That's the long and short of it,"" Burton continued. ""If you think it's expensive to put a scrubber on a smokestack you should see how much it costs to treat a preventable birth defect."" Jackson said the instillation and maintenance of the pollution controls would provide jobs as well as health benefits. ""These are good labor-intensive jobs that cannot be shipped overseas,"" she said. Jackson emphasized these new measures would come at a financial cost for utility companies but said it would level the playing field for utility companies once they are all operating from the same clean air standard. Consumers will see a bump in their bills while utility companies put the new technology in place, she said. ""We estimate impact on utility bills that are pretty minor, three to four dollars a month,"" Jackson said. Those costs to companies and consumers she said would be far outweighed by the benefits.","Many utilities would have to install new pollution controls .
Thousands of deaths expected to be prevented .
EPA rules will be final by November .
Companies would have up to 4 years to comply ."
"(CNN) -- Investigators in the case of a missing Indiana University student hope forensic evidence will help them determine whether a decomposing body found in a creek Monday north of Indianapolis is connected with the disappearance of Lauren Spierer. Bloomington police are in contact with the Indianapolis Metropolitan police, the agency that recovered the body, but there is not enough information for police to ""determine the identity or a basic description of the body,"" Lt. William Parker said in a statement. Parker hopes a pending forensic examination will provide more information, his statement said. CNN affiliates reported an autopsy on the female body will be performed Tuesday. Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer, 20, since June 2, when she was last seen leaving a sports bar in Bloomington after a night out with friends. In mid-June, police had found possible new clues to Spierer's disappearance -- images of a white pick-up truck caught on a security surveillance video. But they ruled out a connection and were back to square one. Officials have received thousands of tips but none so far have yielded anything concrete.","An autopsy is expected to be performed Tuesday, according to CNN affiliates .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fresh explosions rang out early Tuesday near Tripoli, hours after South African President Jacob Zuma held talks with Moammar Gadhafi and signalled he was ready to accept an African Union plan for a cease-fire. Around 12:45 a.m. Tuesday, a pair of large blasts were heard about five minutes apart, as jets flew over the capital of Tripoli. A Libyan government official said the first strike hit Abu Sita, a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the city center. There was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred. Nor was there an immediate response from NATO, which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt Libyan leader Gadhafi's forces from killing innocent civilians. Hours before the blasts, Zuma emerged from a meeting with the longtime Libyan strongman convinced that Gadhafi was ready for an end to hostilities, including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the Benghazi-based opposition movement. But he gave no indication that Gadhafi was prepared to step aside, as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand. ""Brother leader took the position today that he is ready to implement the decision of the AU (that) there must be a cease-fire,"" Zuma told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at Tripoli's Mitiga International Airport before boarding a jet. ""The view is that that must include -- bombing by NATO must also come to an end,"" he said in the news conference, which was broadcast on Libyan state television. Zuma added that Gadhafi said any cease-fire must apply to all parties, ""but also, he makes the point that: Let the Libyan people be given a chance to talk among themselves. And therefore, he's ready to implement the road map of the AU."" Unlike some other world leaders, Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down. Neither has Zuma's African National Congress party nor the African Union, which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led. In fact, the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes. In April, Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli, where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed, in principle, to the African Union's ""road map"" proposal for peace. But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years. A government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi also attended Monday's meeting. Baghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport, where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters, some of which said, ""May the leader be victorious"" and ""Thanks for great Africa."" The African Union has helped mediate peace talks before, including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control. It was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl. Hammerl has been missing in Libya since April and is believed dead. South Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive. But a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown. ""We never had him with us at any stage,"" spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said. The meeting came as Gadhafi's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen. Eight generals from his army have defected to Italy, the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday. The generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers, a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of, and responsibility for, the operation said. The Libyans crossed their country's border into Tunisia, where they were met by Italian intelligence agents, the official said. Italy announced Monday that it will open a consulate Tuesday in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi. Also Monday, the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The station was founded by Momammed Nabus, who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict. ""Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime,"" said Zuheir Al-Barasi, who was to open the station's broadcast from the city's courthouse. In recent weeks, Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi's ""reign of terror is coming to an end."" ""He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad,"" Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria. ""Even those closest to him are departing, defecting or deserting."" Rasmussen also said NATO has made ""significant progress"" in its Libya operation. NATO said Monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since March. ""We have seriously degraded Gadhafi's ability to kill his own people,"" Rasmussen said in his speech. ""We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country, and we are saving lives every day."" The NATO-led bombing campaign began in March after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. On Sunday, Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel-held port city of Misrata. But rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically. ""We are going through a financial crisis,"" said Jalil, chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council. In a speech in Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations' top human rights official noted Monday ""the brutality and magnitude of measures"" taken by the Libyan government. The government's actions have been ""shocking,"" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said, criticizing the ""outright disregard for basic human rights."" CNN's Sara Sidner, Ben Wedeman, Nkepile Mabuse, Amir Ahmed, Raja Razek and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","NEW: Two large explosions are heard early Monday near Tripoli .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Baghdad that his current visit to Iraq will probably be his last. He has previously announced that he intends to retire sometime this year. Gates made the comment while speaking to reporters at the U.S. Division-Center headquarters, where he addressed about 200 soldiers from Kansas and Hawaii. He called it ""the high point of my trip."" Gates also addressed the possible U.S. government shutdown. He explained that, even if troops didn't get a paycheck due to a government shutdown, they would be paid back. Differences between U.S. Democrats and Republicans have kept them from reaching agreement on a budget for this year. If there is no deal by midnight Friday, when the current spending authorization measure expires, parts of the government will close down. ""As a historian, it always occurred to me the smart thing for government was always to pay the guys with guns first,"" he said in response to a query on a shutdown's possible impact. Earlier Thursday, Gates met with the Commanding General of U.S. Forces in Iraq, General Lloyd Austin, and with the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, James Jeffrey, at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad. Later, Gates will meet with Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said a senior defense official who agreed to talk on background . Gates message to Iraq's leadership will be ""that it is important for them to complete the government-formation process, particularly to get the security ministries dealt with,"" a senior defense official said. Gates arrived in Baghdad Wednesday night on an unannounced visit. Prior to touching down in Baghdad, Gates was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with that country's leader, King Abdullah. Like most top-level U.S. visits to regional hot spots, Gates' visit to Iraq was unannounced, most likely for security reasons. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with the Saudi monarch, Gates said they discussed ""developments all over the region"" and ""obviously they talked about Iran."" He described the talks as an ""extremely cordial, warm meeting."" He chided Iran for meddling in the Persian Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, where recent protests led the government to call in troops from member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. ""We already have evidence that the Iranians are trying to exploit the situation in Bahrain,"" Gates told reporters Wednesday. ""We also have evidence that they are thinking about what they could do to try to create problems elsewhere, as well.""","NEW: Gates calls time with troops the ""high point"" of his trip .

"(CNN) -- Democratic leaders took the initiative Monday to go after one of their own, U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, hours after he admitted to lying about posting an explicit photo on his Twitter account and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women he'd met online. Two Democratic sources said that Weiner, in a brief telephone conversation Monday with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, made it abundantly clear that he was not going to resign. At his press conference later that day, the New York Democrat said that Pelosi was ""not happy"" but ""also told me that she loved me and wanted us to ... pull through this."" Pelosi, D-California, who until last January was House speaker, reacted by calling for the chamber's Ethics Commission to open an investigation into the seven-term congressman ""to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred."" Weiner apologizes for lying, 'terrible mistakes' Such a probe is rare, especially when called by a member of one's own party, the Democratic sources said. One question that is sure to be central to such an investigation is whether Weiner used congressional resources while sending -- as he admitted -- explicit photos and messages to ""about six women"" over a three-year period. The New York Democrat claimed that his BlackBerry device is not paid for by the government, and added, ""I don't believe that I used any government resources"" in conducting the illicit, largely electronic affairs. iReport.com: Share your reaction to Rep. Weiner's press conference . In a statement, Weiner said he will ""welcome and will fully cooperate with an investigation by the House Ethics Committee."" Other Democrats, many of whom initially rallied behind Weiner and his initial claim that his Twitter account had been hacked, backed Pelosi's call for an investigation. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, chastised his fellow New Yorker for what he called ""a deep personal failure and inappropriate behavior that embarrassed himself, his family and the House."" He threw his support behind the ethics probe ""to remove all remaining doubt about this situation."" Katie Grant, the spokeswoman for House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, told CNN that ""if there have been any questions regarding ethics that have been raised in the public sphere that the Ethics Committee should look at them."" But while some Democrats are touting the ethics probe as a bold and significant step, one Republican source calls it ""hollow."" The GOP source said it is noteworthy that Pelosi called for an investigation but did not demand Weiner step down -- as happened with former Rep. Chris Lee. The married Republican from western New York resigned in February, following a report that he had tried to meet a woman on Craigslist. CNN's Kate Bolduan, Deirdre Walsh and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calls for an ethics probe into Rep. Anthony Weiner's behavior .

"(CNN) -- Chinese tennis star Zheng Jie will miss January's Australian Open due to a persistent wrist injury. The 27-year-old has not played since she reached the second round of the U.S. Open in September due to the problem. ""It's a hard decision for me to make,"" she wrote on social networking website Twitter. ""But I believe there will be more Australian Opens for me to attend if I can regain my health."" The injury means the world number 26 will not be able to improve on her impressive showing at the 2010 event, when she was beaten in the semifinals by Belgium's eventual runner-up Justine Henin. The tournament has happy memories for Zheng, who won one of her two grand slam doubles titles there in 2006. Is Nadal's battered body his biggest threat? In 2008, Zheng became the first Chinese player to reach the semifinals of a grand slam tournament, losing to Serena Williams in the last four at Wimbledon. The following year she became the first woman from her country to be ranked in the world's top-15. She has since been overtaken by compatriot Li Na, who ended the 2010 season ranked 11th after also reaching the semifinals in Melbourne last January -- the first time two Chinese players had done so in the same grand slam -- and later winning her only final on grass in England. The Australian Open is the first major event of the tennis season, and the outdoor hardcourt tournament begins on January 17 at Melbourne Park.","Zheng Jie will not play in January's Australian Open due to a persistent wrist injury .

"(CNN) -- Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho has rejoined former coach Jose Mourinho after completing a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid. The 32-year-old, who made 22 appearances for Chelsea last season as the London club clinched their second English Premier League title, signed a two-year-deal. Carvalho will join his international compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo at the Bernabeu, becoming Madrid's fifth signing of the close season. ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm it has agreed terms with Real Madrid for the transfer of Ricardo Carvalho,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""Chelsea would like to thank Riccy [Carvalho] for his six years of service, and we wish him well in his future career."" Mourinho tells CNN: Real can reign in Spain . It is the second time Mourinho has signed Carvalho. After winning the European Champions League with Porto in 2004, a side which featured Carvalho at the heart of the defense, Mourinho took the central defender with him to Stamford Bridge in a deal worth $31 million. He made 210 appearances for the Blues, becoming the club's fourth longest-serving player. During this six-year spell, Carvalho scored 11 times and picked up three Premier League titles, as well as five domestic cups. Yet Carvalho's relationship with Mourinho has not always been smooth. In 2005 he publicly criticized Mourinho's selection policy, leading the coach to question Carvalho's intelligence during a press conference. ""Ricardo Carvalho seems to have problems understanding things, maybe he should have an IQ test,"" said Mourinho. However, Carvalho told Spanish newspaper AS last month that he relished the chance of a new future in Spain with his former boss. ""With Mourinho I experienced two marvelous stages at Porto and Chelsea. To have the opportunity to win another Champions League with him at Real Madrid would be tremendous."" Since leaving Inter Milan, where he won the Scudetta and the Champions League last season, Mourinho has been linked with a string of his former players, including Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole and Inter's Brazilian wing-back Maicon.","Ricardo Carvalho rejoins his former coach Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Seeing lightness and color are the simplest sensations the brain has. And yet even at this most basic level we never see the light that falls onto our eyes (called the retinal image) or even the real-world source of that image. Rather, neuroscience research tells us that we only ever see what proved useful to see in the past. Illusions are a simple but powerful example of this point. Like all our perceptions, we see illusions because the brain evolved not to see the retinal image, but to resolve the inherent ""meaninglessness"" of that image by continually redefining normality, a normality that is necessarily grounded in relationships, history and ecology. Which is why we innately find regularities in information and reflexively imbue those regularities with value. But it is the value, not the information itself we see. So, tomorrow morning when you open your eyes and look ""out into"" the world, don't be fooled. You're in fact looking in. You're not seeing the world; you're seeing a world ... an internal map of value-relations derived from interactions within a particular, narrow context. Another essential point about illusions implied in my TED talk is that they reveal our amazing capacity to entertain mutually exclusive internal realities simultaneously. Learn what TED is all about . For instance, while looking at one of my color illusions (say the multicolored cube) you're aware of one reality: that two tiles look very different, while simultaneously being aware of an opposite reality: that the two tiles are in fact physically the same. This capacity to be an observer of yourself is phenomenal and possibly unique to humans. Indeed, to literally ""see yourself see"" is in my view the principal act of consciousness, which has the power to transform one's view of the world and of oneself. The importance of the above observations stemming from my own work and that of others transcend neuroscience. They show us in an explicit (and I hope engaging) way that our senses are not ""fragile,"" as many would have you believe. They show us instead that we are not outside observers of nature defined in isolation. We are instead indivisible from nature, defined by the trial and error process of interaction, a process in which we can choose to become active agents (but too often choose not to). Understanding this point is I believe critical to personal and social well-being, since the typical barrier to a deeper insight into oneself and others is the overriding, but necessarily false impression that what ""I"" see, what ""I"" hear and what ""I"" know is the world as it really is. But, by ""seeing yourself see,"" in other words by actively exploring how your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and even the colors you see reflect your physical, social and cultural ecology, only then is it possible to understand the source of coherence and conflict within and between individuals. Put another way, only by accepting my own humanity can I accept the humanity of others. ""Seeing myself see"" creates the opportunity for this acceptance. Illusions, then, were not the point of my talk, but simply a tool for encouraging this process. Resolving uncertainty is essential to our survival. Hence our fear of ambiguous situations is palpable -- e.g., the inability to resolve sensory conflict between the eyes and ears can result in nausea (like seasickness). And yet it is only by embracing the unknown within education, science, art and most importantly within our own private lives that we will find new routes to more enlightened ways of seeing and being. Thus, courage not confidence is at the heart of this process of actively redefining normality, which is the route to compassion and creativity. Encouraging this process by celebrating uncertainty is the raison d'etre of my work ... from the science of human and bee perception, to the art of translating images into music, to the design of a glass windmill for primary schools, to the creation of the ""My School"" educational program (a framework for teaching and architecture that directly supports creativity, community choice and compassion), even to giving a talk at TED. By providing relevant, tangible and accessible frameworks for others to take part in the process of discovery, I hope -- in a very modest way -- that my work will help foster a more empathetic view of nature and human nature.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A stolen Statue of Liberty replica has resurfaced in a disturbing video posted on YouTube that shows someone decapitating the blindfolded lady and smashing her head into pieces. The YouTube video shows a gloved hand sawing off Lady Liberty's head before smashing it. The 200-pound replica was stolen less than a month ago from Vox Pop, a coffee shop in Brooklyn. ""It's very disturbing,"" shop operator Debi Ryan told CNN, adding the video struck a chord similar to that of terrorist assassination videos. ""I don't know what it means. ... I don't know who would do this."" The YouTube video begins with a waving American flag, and then shows a gloved hand sawing off the head of the statue before crushing it. The slogans ""We don't want your freedom"" and ""Death to America"" flash across the screen during the one-minute video, which is dated July Fourth. It was anonymously e-mailed to the Daily News and Ryan earlier this week. Ryan said she's sure the statue in the video is the one stolen from her cafe. ""She's unique. I know my girl,"" she said of the statue. ""We just had her completely refurbished, outfitted with a solar torch and painted."" Authorities told CNN they are handling the case as a larceny rather than separately investigating the YouTube video. ""We want to verify who sent the e-mail with the video and see if they're responsible,"" police said. A sign on the store, located in Ditmas Park, reads, ""Books, Coffee, Democracy,"" near where the 8-foot replica of Lady Liberty used to stand outside. The self-described community coffee shop is also a bookstore and a spot for artists and performers. ""We've created a space here that's owned by the community,"" Ryan said. ""We're all about freedom of speech and freedom to be who you are and say whatever you think."" But Ryan doesn't consider the YouTube video featuring her stolen statue appropriate free speech. ""Vox Pop stands for freedom of speech. You don't get to steal somebody else's property to send that message. We have to respect each other,"" she said. Although the coffee shop recently faced economic problems and neighborhood tension, the motive behind the statue's theft remains unknown. As for whether there will be a replacement statue, Ryan said, ""I'm hoping. I think she belongs here. But she added, ""Whether we have a physical statue or not, what she stands for remains here.""","Video shows Statue of Liberty replica blindfolded before it's decapitated, smashed .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Continuing anti-India demonstrations claimed four more lives in India's Kashmir Valley on Saturday, police said. Violence triggered by the recovery of a young man's body killed three people in the town of Anantnag, police said. Six others were wounded in the deadly clashes that erupted after the body of Maroof Ahmad Nath, 25, was pulled out of the Jhelum River. He had jumped into the water after being chased by Indian security forces earlier this week. Angered by the grisly discovery, thousands of Kashmiris took to the streets demanding independence from India. They hurled stones at security forces and attempted an attack on a house belonging to a pro-India politician, police said. Indian forces opened fire to quell the crowds. In the town of Palhallan, another person was killed and three others were wounded in similar clashes, police said. One of the wounded later died of their injuries, police said. Almost 100 people have died since violent anti-India demonstrations erupted in June. The mainly Muslim Kashmir Valley is part of India's Jammu and Kashmir state but many residents favor independence. It is a dispute rooted in the 1947 partitioning of India when Kashmir was divided into two -- a part going to Pakistan and a bigger chunk remaining in India at the the ruling king's request. In 1989, Kashmiri separatists took up arms but the violence had waned in recent years, until this summer. The government has imposed strict curfews and deployed extra forces on the streets to keep the calm, senior police officer Shafaqat Ahmad said. Residents were warned to stay indoors as the funerals commenced for those who were killed. In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, crowds turned out for the funeral of a youth who died Saturday from injuries sustained two days earlier. They chanted: ""Freedom.""","The deaths occurred during continuing anti-India demonstrations .

"SISAKET PROVINCE, Thailand (CNN) -- The foreign ministers of Thailand and Cambodia will meet Monday in an effort to resolve a week-long military standoff over an ancient border temple that sits on disputed land, Thailand's prime minister said Thursday. Cambodian Buddhist monks walk at Preah Vihear temple on Monday. The meeting will take place in Siem Reap, Cambodia one day after Cambodia's general election on Sunday, Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej told CNN. An eight-hour meeting between Thai and Cambodian officials ended earlier this week with both sides agreeing on only one point: that troops each country has amassed at the site of the Preah Vihear temple will not fire on each other, the Thai News Agency reported. The site of Monday's meeting is closer to the better-known Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia. For now, the countries are seeking regional intervention from their Southeast Asian neighbors. Foreign ministers of the 10 countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are meeting in Singapore this week. Sundaravej spoke to his Cambodian counterpart, Hun Sen, on Thursday to arrange next week's high-level meeting. He said Hun agreed to stop pursuing the issue at the U.N. Security Council. Cambodia had sent a letter to the council to call attention to the standoff. As a result, the Security Council postponed a meeting planned for next week on the tensions, the council's president, Vietnamese ambassador Le Luong Minh, said Thursday. The dispute is over an 11th century temple to which Cambodia and Thailand both lay claim. It sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. This month, the U.N. approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places that have outstanding cultural value. The decision reignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it would make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph in the run-up to the general elections. The current flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Dozens of anti-government demonstrators were wounded Tuesday when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. According to Ala'a Al-Khowlani, at least 40 anti-government demonstrators were wounded and at least one of them was in critical condition. Other witnesses put the total number wounded as high as 67. ""Live bullets are being shot -- we do not know from which angle,"" said Yaser Al-Hasani, one of the demonstrators. ""The security forces are using force against us because we are bringing in food into the protest area."" Al-Hasani said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of Sanaa University. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out in front of the university calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Al-Khowlani described a similar scene. In a statement e-mailed to reporters, the government blamed the violence on people who had tried to sneak weapons into a ""weapon-free area"" outside the university, then resisted arrest. ""Late Tuesday evening, during a routine police inspection on Al-Hurriya street in Sanaa, police discovered individuals with a stash of fully automatic rifles hidden inside thick blankets and camping equipment,"" the statement said. ""The individuals were attempting to enter the 'weapon-free area' of University Square, where anti-government protesters have been camping for days. ""The suspects resisted arrest and soon thereafter a gun fight broke out, injuring dozens of suspected militants, policemen and innocent bystanders. Panic from the shootings set off a raging stampede in the area. There is no official confirmation on casualties at this point."" It said early Wednesday that the situation was under control and that the Ministry of Interior would investigate the incident. Tens of thousands of protesters also demonstrated in the city of Taiz and thousands demonstrated in Ibb, witnesses said. Both cities are south of Sanaa. Another demonstration -- this one at Sanaa Central Prison -- erupted Monday evening when inmates gathered in the main hall, said a prisoner who has spoken with CNN in the past. The inmates raised their voices against the government and demanded more rights. Guards fired warning shots and tear gas as prisoners chanted anti-government slogans, according to the prisoner, who obtained access to a phone during the incident and spoke with CNN Tuesday. Guards ordered the prisoners to return to their cells. The inmates refused but dispersed and re-entered their cells after the guards exerted force, the prisoner said. Tuesday morning, they reassembled in the main hall and resumed their protests, the prisoner said. Again, guards responded with tear gas and bullets fired in the air. Two prisoners were killed and seven were wounded, said the prisoner, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal from prison guards. Protesters in Yemen been demonstrating for weeks, demanding the ouster of Saleh, who has ruled Yemen since 1978. An Interior Ministry official commented solely on Monday's incident. ""Prisoners were causing chaos and security forces had to do what was necessary to keep matters under control,"" the official told CNN. A government statement said the inmates rioted because they wanted pardons. It acknowledged that riot police had subdued the inmates and said it was investigating the incident. The government said it was beefing up security around Sanaa, the capital, ""over terror concerns in the aftermath of multiple terror attacks on security and army personnel."" Yemen's anti-government demonstrations are unfolding in a nation wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing and impoverished young population. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom.

"(CNN) -- Sony is reducing the price of the PlayStation 3 game console, hoping to help the 5-year-old system reach a larger audience, the company said on Tuesday. The base model now costs $250, and another system with twice the storage space is $300. Sony cut $50 from each, which is nearly the price of a new game. ""While others in the space are losing steam, PlayStation 3 is gaining momentum,"" Jack Tretton, the president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, said in a statement. ""The new price will make the PS3 more accessible than ever before."" Sony last cut prices on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, when it released a slimmer model. Microsoft has not reduced the Xbox 360's price since 2009, and analysts are split on whether it will do so this year as a response to Sony. The entry-level Xbox 360 costs $200. Sony's move is seen by analysts as a usual part of a game system's life cycle. Game console generations typically last four to six years, but some predict that motion-detection peripherals like Microsoft's Kinect for the Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation Move could prolong the current cycle. Nintendo announced last month that the successor to the Wii, a tablet-controlled device called the Wii U, will hit the market next year. The news comes as the Wii, this generation's top-selling console, is experiencing a sales slump. Nintendo reduced the price of the Wii from $200 to $150 in May. Last month, Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS, its handheld game console that displays 3-D graphics without needing special glasses. The 3DS now costs $170, a 40% reduction for a console that's less than five months old. Sales of the 3DS tumbled quickly after a promising launch, and analysts have attributed the proliferation of inexpensive, quick-hit games for Facebook and smartphones as a hindrance to growth in the market for hand-held game systems. Sony is gearing up for the release of the PlayStation Vita, a portable game console that follows the PlayStation Portable. To compete with smartphones, it will have downloadable games, a touchscreen and 3G cellular data connectivity. The version with 3G will cost $300, and the one without will cost $250. Sony is still recovering from a nearly monthlong outage that affected its online game networks. The cyberattack, which resulted in stolen personal and financial information, did not seem to harm sales of the console, according to reports. Sony, which has sold more than 50 million PlayStation 3 systems, compensated customers with free game downloads.","Sony cut the PlayStation 3 to a base price of $250 .

"(CNN) -- A series of four strong earthquakes spanning just over an hour struck the Philippines' Moro Gulf on Saturday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Three of the four earthquakes had magnitudes between 7.3 and 7.6; the other came in at a 5.4 magnitude. The first quake struck at 6:08 a.m. (6:08 p.m. ET Friday) and the fourth hit at 7:15 a.m. The last quake ran the deepest at 616 (382 miles) kilometers. The epicenters of the quakes were about 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the coastal city of Cotabato and roughly 950 kilometers (590 miles) southeast of Manila. No tsunami warning was immediately issued for any of the quakes. There were no reports of damage, said Rona Faeldin of the Philippines Coast Guard.

"New York (CNN)  -- There are some very happy chefs and restaurateurs, cookbook authors, food journalists and other outstanding names in food and drink. They are the latest winners of the James Beard Foundation Awards, which are often referred to as the Oscars of the food world. The ceremony was held at New York's Lincoln Center on Monday night. The awards were established in 1990 by the nonprofit that bears the name of one of America's founding food writers and cooks.

"(CNN) -- An Irish man known as ""The Naked Adventurer"" was rescued off the coast of Western Australia during a failed attempt to row across the Indian Ocean. Keith Whelan -- whose website says he wants to become the first Irish person to row across the ocean -- was hit by a wave Monday and ""sustained a large laceration,"" said Tracey Jiggins of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. ""He was rescued 206 kilometers (128 miles) off the shore northwest of Geraldton,"" Jiggins said Tuesday. She said a merchant ship picked up Whelan, who was en route to Bunbury in Western Australia on Tuesday. ""His injuries are not life threatening, so (he) will remain on the ship until it docks at Bunbury tomorrow afternoon,"" Jiggins said. A statement on Whelan's website -- TheNakedAdventurer.com -- says Whelan was asleep Monday night when the force of the wave threw him across the boat's inner cabin. ""Keith was able to stop the bleeding himself and ... decided to seek help at first light,"" the statement said. When asked why he decided to attempt the 6,000-kilometer (3,728-mile) journey from Western Australia to Mauritius, Whelan said on his site, ""I am a risk taker and risking your life to achieve a dream is the biggest risk you can take. Some might say it's foolish but to my mind it is only foolish if you don't know the risks and you don't prepare for them and train for every possible scenario."" Whelan is also raising money for Keep a Child Alive, which helps provide life-saving treatment, care and support to children and families in Africa and India affected by HIV/AIDS, according to the website. The site also said Whelan embarked on the solo challenge in the buff. ""Having gotten into a rowing boat for the first time only a year or so beforehand, he will spend 110 days alone at sea, facing 50 foot swells, hurricane force winds and unrelenting sunshine ... and he'll be naked,"" it said. Why naked? ""As the Ocean is a very salty environment, clothing tends to become encrusted with salt,"" Whelan said on the site. ""I will have no means of cleaning this from any clothing at sea, so wearing this clothing when full of salt would lead to severe salt sores on my body which is why I will be naked for most of the journey."" Jiggins said she was not sure whether Whelan was found naked, ""nor do I care."" CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Keith Whelan is hit by a wave and suffers a ""large laceration""

"(CNN) -- A ""flash mob"" believed to have been organized on the Internet robbed a Maryland convenience store in less than a minute, police said Tuesday, and now authorities are using the same tool to identify participants in the crime. Surveillance video shows a couple of teens walking into the Germantown 7-Eleven store Saturday at 1:47 a.m. Then, in a matter of seconds, dozens more young people entered and grabbed items from store shelves and coolers. Police said the teens left the store together, without paying for anything. ""At least 28 different individuals"" have been confirmed on the video, Capt. Paul Starks told CNN Tuesday. Montgomery County Police posted the video on YouTube.com and asked for help from the public in identifying the perpetrators. ""We're getting a lot of response from sources in the community who have seen the video, who are concerned, and are calling police with tips,"" Starks said. Several suspects have already been identified, but police have made no arrests and hope the public can help them locate the individuals on the tape. Although investigators have said they '""can't confirm how this (robbery) was organized,"" Starks does believe the Internet was involved. While working to identify and find the group of teens, Starks said Montgomery County has been ""coordinating with the state Attorney General's office and discussing what charges will be appropriate"" when arrests are made. Flash mobs -- usually announced online in social networking sites, or by e-mails or text messages -- were once benign and entertaining, but recent gatherings by groups of teenagers have evolved into more sinister actions. Earlier this month, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter signed an order moving curfews to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays for people younger than 18 in Center City, the heart of Philadelphia's downtown, and in University City, home to the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. Nutter announced the earlier curfew following a string of mob attacks by young people alerted to gatherings via e-mail and social media. Parents and minors face hefty fines if caught violating the new rules. Violent ""flash mob"" attacks have also been reported recently in other cities across the country, leading to crackdowns on curfew enforcement and stepped-up police patrols. Extra state troopers were ordered in after what was described as a ""mob beating"" took place at the Wisconsin State Fair. Attacks in Cleveland, Chicago and Washington, D.C. have all led to the arrests of dozens of teens and resulted in extra police patrols in and around these cities. Montgomery County Police said Saturday's ""flash mob"" theft was the first such incident in their jurisdiction, but Starks admits he is concerned about the growing trend. ""I assure you we're taking this crime very seriously,"" Starks said. In England, where riots erupted earlier this month, authorities say social networking sites and mobile messaging services were used as tools to organize looting and violence. In the aftermath of the riots, Cheshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Phil Thompson cited ""the way in which technology was used to spread incitement and bring people together to commit acts of criminality"" as a factor. And last week, Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that ""when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them."" The government was working with the police and intelligence services, he said, ""to look at whether it would be right to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality."" Meanwhile, police in northwest England said Tuesday that two men have been jailed for four years each for inciting disorder via social networking sites. The two had urged activists to cause trouble in the towns of Warrington and Northwich, but neither posting resulted in riots, police said.","Maryland police post video of the 'flash mob' robbery online .

He started from Camp IV at an altitude of 7,950 meters with five other climbers on Tuesday night and reached on Wednesday morning, according to Asian Trekking, which organized the expedition. Sherpa is the climbing leader of the expedition, which collects trash such as oxygen cylinders, tent poles, tents and other mountaineering equipment from the mountain.","Apa Sherpa first climbed Mount Everest in 1990 .

"Paris (CNN) -- France will start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, following a timetable similar to the one U.S. President Barack Obama announced, the French president's office said Thursday. ""This withdrawal will be done in consultation with our allies and with the Afghan authorities,"" the statement from Nicolas Sarkozy's office said. All French troops could be out of Afghanistan by 2013, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told France Info radio Thursday. Longuet declined to give specifics, citing the ""safety of our soldiers and the people they protect. ""So we cannot say right now it will happen from such a place or it will be this type of troop because we have no information to give to our adversaries, the Taliban,"" he said. But he said that NATO had planned on ""a complete transition in 2014,"" and that ""what has emerged today is that we will undoubtedly gain a year on this calendar."" France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according to the NATO mission there. Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. would withdraw 33,000 U.S. troops by September 2012. That will leave just under 70,000 Americans there. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose country has the second largest number of foreign troops in Afghanistan, welcomed Obama's announcement. He said the British will keep ""force levels in Afghanistan under constant review,"" adding: ""I have already said there will be no UK troops in combat roles in Afghanistan by 2015 and, where conditions on the ground allow, it is right that we bring troops home sooner.""

"(CNN) -- Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there. At least five people died on Tuesday, according to a resident who requested anonymity for safety reasons, and the city remained under siege amid a military offensive against protesters. The humanitarian situation deteriorated amid the government's offensive in the city. Shops and bakeries were closed, and at least two mosques were damaged. The gunfire could be heard ""all night and morning,"" the witness said. ""This is the fourth day that we do not have electricity or water. Landline phone connections have been down most of the day,"" he said by satellite phone. Snipers perched atop various locations in the city's al-Ramel neighborhood, the site of a Palestinian refugee camp, he said. Demonstrations have taken place in the Ramel area every day since the Syrian uprising began five months ago, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC, a network of opposition activists, said the area's lack of basic urban services could be a reason why those in Ramel are angry at the Syrian government. ""The tragedy of (Ramel) has not stopped since yesterday,"" the LCC said in a statement Tuesday. The refugee camp normally holds 10,000 people, but reports have surfaced of many people fleeing violence there. The resident said a large portion of the Ramel area has been evacuated. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, has expressed alarm over reports of heavy gunfire from Syrian security forces into the refugee camp and other areas. ""Reports from various sources indicate deaths and casualties among the Palestinian refugee population, although poor communications make it impossible to confirm the exact number of dead and injured,"" it said in its latest statement. Christopher Gunness, UNRWA spokesman, said refugees in Latakia had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces. He said some left on their own because they were afraid for their lives. ""We are asking the Syrian government for immediate access to the Palestinians, as their well-being is our responsibility,"" Gunness told CNN. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces entered the city only to protect its residents from armed gangs. The Syrian government vehemently denied reports that more than 5,000 Palestinians fled the refugee camp in the area after it came under fire from Syrian security forces. It also reported Tuesday that reports of shelling by the navy on Ramel are ""completely untrue."" A video posted on YouTube Monday purportedly shows a dead girl who was shot in the eye as her father drove by a security checkpoint in Latakia. Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said the girl and her parents were trying to flee in a car. The father was shot in the shoulder and the mother was lightly injured. Bloodshed in the country has persisted since a government crackdown on anti-government protesters started in mid-March. The LCC said at least 2,545 people have died. The vast majority were civilians, and 391 were security personnel, the LCC said. The strong security reaction to demonstrators calling for political changes has spurred outrage among world powers, like the United States, and among Syria's neighbors, such as Jordan and Turkey. CNN cannot independently verify opposition or government claims because Syria has restricted international journalists from reporting inside the country. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","NEW: Resident: At least five people have died on Tuesday .
