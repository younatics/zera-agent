Police marksmen were accused last night of Tasering a man as he lay grievously wounded in the street after they had shot him four times with live bullets. Witnesses claim they heard one of the 50,000 volt stun guns being discharged after George Asare, 25, collapsed in a pool of blood. One claimed officers repeatedly kicked the suspected knifeman on the ground as they surrounded him in a chaotic confrontation. Wounded: George Asare, the British Ghanaian who was allegedly shot and tasered by police in Forest Hill, London . Medical evidence has emerged that one of at least four Taser shots hit him in the groin, something his family believe was deliberate. Last night they demanded answers. His mother, Elizabeth Benin, said: ‘Why wasn’t there a stand-off? I want to know why the police did not try to talk to George. ‘George is not a bad person, he is a good person but he was not well, I don’t understand why they had to shoot him. I just thank God that he was not killed.’ Asare is due to appear before magistrates in Bromley, Kent, today accused of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to police and affray. He is being held in a secure psychiatric ward at the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Bromley, where he is recovering from his injuries. The new claims dramatically contradict the original chain of events that emerged in the days after the shooting in Forest Hill, South-East London. It was originally believed that police shot Asare with live rounds only after several Tasers were discharged but failed to restrain him as he threatened them. Stun gun: Tasers deliver a 50,000-volt shock to incapacitate suspects. Witnesses to the incident claim police used the weapon after Asare was shot . Allegations he was Tasered after . suffering potentially life-threatening injuries raises fresh disturbing . questions about the use of the controversial devices. This . week, it emerged that Bernard Hogan-Howe, the country’s most senior . policeman, has privately pledged to put more Tasers in his officers’ hands. Critics fear expansion of their availability could reduce control of their use. Asare, a British-born Ghanaian university graduate, was left fighting for his life with wounds to the abdomen, leg, groin and hand in the early hours of February 19. Local officers attended the suburban street where he lives with his mother after a member of the public dialled 999 to report someone suspected of trying to break into a car. But they were forced to retreat and call in armed colleagues when Asare allegedly threatened officers with a ‘large bladed weapon’. It was later claimed that ‘several’ knives were found nearby. Injuries: Bethlem Royal Hospital, Bromley, where Asare is being held in a secure psychiatric ward while he recovers from the shooting . Five live rounds were fired by police marksmen and photographs from the scene showed at least four discharged Taser cartridges. They also showed two of the bright yellow plastic weapons amid a tangle of thin metal wires that deliver the supposedly incapacitating electrical charge. A family friend said: ‘George has suffered horrific injuries. The family believe it is the other way around, he was shot and then he was Tasered. Witnesses claim that when police came shots were fired almost immediately. ‘As soon as George hit the ground they surrounded him and started to kick him and then they heard the distinctive pop-pop-pop noise of a Taser.’ It was the first police shooting since the death of suspected gangster Mark Duggan last August, which sparked the riots. A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is investigating the shooting, confirmed that it is looking at the exact sequence of events and appealed for anyone with information to get in touch. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said she could not comment while the IPCC inquiry and criminal prosecution is under way.",One witness claims officers kicked suspected knifeman George Asare as he lay on the ground .

Sitting in the pews behind him was his girlfriend and their young daughter – one of four children they had together. Although the wedding appeared real, it was  a complete sham designed to allow him to stay in Britain. Sham marriage: Olukayode Olusanya (left) and Zucina Sabina (right) sign the register, minutes before she left her 'husband' to return to her native Holland . Tying the knot: Olukayode Olusanya with Zunica Sabina in her wedding dress . Olusanya, 34, was tying the knot with a total stranger, Dutch resident Zunica Sabina, 28, and when the ceremony was over she simply drove back to the airport, got on a plane and flew back to Amsterdam. Her identity was then assumed by Olusanya’s long-term partner Esther Ogunrinde, 30. The bogus ceremony allowed illegal immigrant Olusanya, and Ogunrinde – a failed  asylum-seeker – to avoid being deported. 'Mixed feelings': Esther Ogunrinde attended her partner's sham marriage with their four children . Nigerian-born Olusanya was able to work as a nursing assistant while his partner, posing as Sabina, worked as a care assistant and cleaner and continued to claim food vouchers intended for asylum seekers. The couple kept their pretence going for three years, using fake documents to fool three employers. The identity swap even began before the wedding at St John’s Church in Moston, Manchester. When Sabina was unable to attend the church to apply for the marriage banns, Ogunrinde stood in for her. A court heard there was no  suggestion that church officials had any idea the wedding might be a scam. On a previous visit, the sham bride had set up a bank account and secured a National Insurance number in her name for Ogunrinde to use. Months later, Sabina flew in for the big day and was paid £3,000 to act as a fake bride, a sham that included posing for wedding photographs in a white dress. The trio were reunited this week when they were hauled into court to answer charges of breaking immigration laws. Olusanya was jailed for 32 months after admitting two charges of conspiracy while Sabina was jailed for 16 months. But Ogunrinde escaped a prison sentence after the judge took into account the fact she had four young children to look after. Instead she must serve a 12-month suspended sentence and do 180 hours of unpaid work. Sentencing them at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Martin Steiger QC said the conspiracy had been ‘highly sophisticated’ with ‘ingenious features’. But he said he could not ignore ‘humanitarian considerations’ in Ogunrinde’s case and jail her, since she had four children, ‘even if her continued reproduction’ had  been in part an attempt to ‘cynically’ improve her hand with the authorities. Gill Crossley, defending  Olusanya, said he had wanted to do better for his family by remaining in the UK. Just married: Olusanya, 34, signs the register after the wedding which allowed him to stay in the UK . The scam, which dated back to 2008, was exposed in June when the UK Borders Agency received  a tip-off. John Dilworth, head of the CPS’s North West Complex Case Unit, said: ‘The marriage was a sham  in an attempt to defeat the immigration rules that protect  UK borders. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service will continue to pursue anyone involved in such offences and prosecute robustly.’ Immigration sources said the trio will be deported when they have served their sentences.","Illegal immigrant Esther Ogunrinde watched her failed asylum seeker lover marry an EU national .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:57 EST, 16 March 2012 . Though animal rights groups like PETA outraged over the deaths of three horses on the set of HBO’s now-defunct series Luck, one animal trainer says the animals’ deaths are nothing more than tragic accidents. Matthew Chew, who trained two of the three horses that died, reportedly told friends that it has been about luck only – or rather a lack of it – that has resulted in the horses’ deaths. ‘We were just horribly unlucky… sometimes s**t happens,’ he said, according to TMZ. However, PETA alleges that he knowingly used ‘arthritic and injured horses’ and . raced even healthy horses more than the recommended amount. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Things happen: Matthew Chew, a horse trainer for the now-cancelled show Luck, reportedly told friends that 's**t happens' after three horses died on the series . Equestrian series: Actor Nick Nolte touches a horse in a scene from 'Luck', which shows the behind-the-scenes world of jockeys, gamblers, horses and trainers . Mr Chew was in charge of both Outlaw . Yodeller and Marc’s Shadow. Outlaw Yodeller suffered a fatal injury on . April 30, 2010, and Marc’s Shadow suffered a catastrophic breakdown on . March 28 of last year. Dr Rick Arthur, who worked on the . production and serves as medical director at the California Horse Racing . Board, agrees that injuries happen. ‘Accidents do happen,’ he told TV . Guide. ‘It’s not as outrageous as it’s been played to be. Any of these . accidents are not unique circumstances.’ The third horse, for example, died on . the way back to its stall and hit her head on the ground. Trainers then . made the decision to euthanize her. He said these so-called accidents are not ‘unique circumstances.’ Controversial: Now three horses have died on the set of Luck and HBO has suspended filming as the protocols are being reassessed . From left: Joan Allen, Dustin Hoffman, John Ortiz and Dennis Farina are shown in a scene from the HBO original series which has now been cancelled . The HBO drama series Luck was . cancelled earlier this week by network brass after a third thoroughbred died during . production of the show, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte. The decision came after the horse was injured and euthanised on Tuesday. A . humane group that oversees Hollywood productions had issued an . immediate demand 'that all production involving horses shut down'. The American Humane Association has been overseeing the production since it started. HBO said: 'While we maintained the highest safety standards possible, accidents unfortunately happen and it is impossible to guarantee they won't in the future'. 'Accordingly, we have reached this difficult decision.' 'Racing itself is dangerous enough. This . is a fictional representation of something and horses are still dying, . and that to me is outrageous' -PETA representative . Animal rights group PETA have . challenged HBO on their claims, saying these 'accidents' were waiting to . happen and a 'sloppy oversight'. Whistleblowers . contacted them during the first season of the show but their complaints . went nowhere, even after the death of the first two horses, according . to CBS. The group then obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act. Earlier . this week they asked the Los Angeles district Attorney's Office to . investigate the deaths of the horse. Spokeswoman Lisa Lange said: 'We . got the necropsy reports on those horses and what we found was shocking. 'One of the horses had been pumped full of painkilling drugs, another one was old and arthritic.' In . its defense, the AHA tried to argue the latest horse to die did not do . so on set but as the result of an accident while being led back to its . stable by a groom when it reared and fell back, suffering a head injury. In its complaint, PETA said the first two horses died during and immediately after running in a 'race' being filmed for the show and that it is too mentally and physically demanding on retired racehorses. Cancelled: John Ortiz appears in a scene from Luck which is still being questioned by PETA over the alleged inhumane treatment of their horses . Karen Rosa, senior vice president of the AHA's Film & TV Unit, told the Washington Post that the races filmed for the show weren't full length and no more than a quarter mile each. But PETA vice president Kathy . Guillermo said the horses would not understand it wasn't a real race . and would have exerted themselves as if it was and the first two horses . that died should not have been 'anywhere near a racetrack'. 'Racing is an exhausting activity and most young horses have at least a week’s rest between races to recover. These horses were sometimes asked to race twice in a day.' Hard tack: Jill Hennessy also starred in in the series . She told the Washington Post: 'One of the horses was so sore, he was given a potent cocktail of . muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs, including . Butorphanol, a painkiller so strong that it's often used as an analgesic . for horses undergoing some kinds of surgery. 'They could castrate a horse on that drug.' But doctors hired by HBO contend that PETA misread the death report and the network released a statement saying that any allegations of 'lax attitudes or negligence couldn't be further from the truth' Dr Rick Arthur, a veterinarian at the Santa Anita racetrack in California, told CBS News: 'HBO did everything they possibly could to ensure the safety of those horses. 'We see several of these injuries every year, it is more common than people realize.' According to autopsy results, the first horse was a five-year-old male who suffered from a 'catastrophic humeral fracture' of its right front leg and was on multiple pain killers and anti-inflammatory medications. The second, an eight-year-old male, had an open fracture of its right radius and a history of arthritis. In the series, which looks at racing's . seedier side, Dustin Hoffman plays a crime kingpin who's scheming to . gain control of a racetrack and introduce casino gambling. During season-one filming in 2010 and 2011, two horses were hurt during racing scenes and euthanized. HBO defended its treatment of the animals, saying it's worked with the American Humane Association and racing industry experts to implement safety protocols that exceed film and TV industry standards. The American Humane Association's film and TV unit, the group sanctioned and supported by the entertainment industry to protect animals used in filming, called for a production halt at the Santa Anita Racetrack in suburban Arcadia after the second horse's death. Racing resumed after new protocols were put in place and proved effective, Karen Rosa said in February. See video here .","HBO series cancelled after third horse was euthanized earlier this week .

Tragic: Little Harry Connolly died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after being sent home by doctors twice in just five days . A devastated mother is demanding to find out why her young son died after medics sent him home three times in less than two weeks. Harry Connolly died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after medics repeatedly failed to diagnose his illness. The 19-month-old first became ill with severe diarrhoea and vomiting on 23 April 2011, and was taken to a local GP three days later. With his worried mother Lucy at his side, Harry was admitted to Northampton General Hospital that evening, before being discharged the next day. However when he was unable to keep down fluids, his family took him back to the same hospital on April 28. But he was sent home after a paediatrician told Mrs Connolly he wasn’t dehydrated and he did not have a virus. When he was still ill the following day, his desperate mother was told the hospital was closed for Good Friday, so she took Harry to an out-of-hours emergency GP service, where he was seen by a doctor. Mrs Connolly claims she repeatedly asked that Harry be referred back to hospital, but instead he was sent home again. Horrifying: Less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry's father found him tragically dead in his bed . Then, less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry’s father found him dead in his bed. It later emerged he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon. Now his distraught mother and her husband Raymond, who have two other sons aged 11 and 17, are demanding a full investigation into the standard of care they received. Mrs Connolly said: 'The fact remains that Harry died as a result of dehydration and acute renal failure despite being admitted to hospital twice and attended by an out-of-hours doctor in the space of just five days. 'He would have survived if he’d remained in hospital from 26 April and fully rehydrated, he would have survived had he been readmitted on 28 April, and would have survived had the out-of-hours doctor referred him to be readmitted on 29 April. 'Three opportunities to save my son were wasted.' Mr and Mrs Connolly will be represented at an inquest into Harry’s death next week by law firm Access Legal from Shoosmiths. Phil Barnes, a medical negligence specialist for the firm, said: 'We are supporting the family in the lead up to, during, and after the inquest process; and hope that it will produce a clear and definitive picture of the cause of Harry’s death.' A spokesman for Northampton General Hospital said: 'In light of an impending inquest, we regret that we are unable to make any comment about the circumstances surrounding this case at the present time.' A two-day inquest will start at Northampton General Hospital on Tuesday.","Harry Connolly, 19 months, died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after being sent home by doctors .

Greatrex stole £150,000 from a charity care home to do up his house . The former president of a mineworkers' union who stole almost £150,000 from a miners' charity to improve his home has been jailed for his 'calculated and sophisticated greed'. Neil Greatrex, ex-Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM) president, was sentenced to four years for stealing money intended for a home for sick and retired miners. Judge John Wait said the thefts, from Phoenix Nursing and Residential Home, were 'a breach of the highest degree of trust'. Greatrex, 61, of Stanley, Nottinghamshire, spent £148,000 of the money on outside paving and new windows and doors for his home, as well as the home of co-director Mick Stevens, Birmingham Crown Court heard. He was convicted of 14 theft charges earlier this month, while UDM general secretary Mr Stevens, accused of the same charges, was cleared. Greatrex was a founder of the UDM in the 1984-85 miners' strike. The UDM, which was largely made up of Nottinghamshire miners, split from the National Union of Mineworkers after disagreeing with NUM president Arthur Scargill's leadership. Trustee Greatrex stole the cash and spent £11,750 alone on a new kitchen, with much more going on new windows, doors and landscaping work at his house in Nottinghamshire. Sentencing him yesterday Judge Wait said: 'As a trustee of the charity you were not entitled to profit from your role. 'Over the five year period you stole very nearly £150,000 from those you held office to protect. 'You have never accepted you did anything wrong despite the blatant breach of trust and procurement of false invoices. 'I reject as did the jury you had an honest belief that you were entitled to payment for your work at the Home. If you had had any such belief I have no doubt that you would have canvassed with advisors how such payment might be made. 'This was calculated and sophisticated greed. You used your influence with contractors to persuade them to provide false invoices, each of them knowing your position and no doubt hoping for further work. 'After the incorporation of the company you saw an opportunity to make personal profit at the expense of those less fortunate than yourself whose interest you had agreed as a trustee to protect.' DIY job: The stolen money was used to give his home, pictured, new windows, door and a kitchen among other improvements . Mr Greatrex, from Stanley, Nottinghamshire, showed no emotion during his sentencing and waved to members of his family in the public gallery as he was led away to to prison. Greatrex had spent more than 20 years in the National Union of Mineworkers before forming the UDM in 1985. He became a controversial figure for speaking out against then president Arthur Scargill’s tactics in the 1985 strikes. He formed the UDM claiming that nobody was speaking out for Nottinghamshire miners, prompting a great split between workers. In 1987 he was earning £67,000 a year in that role. Christopher Sallon QC, defending Greatrex, said he was 'instrumental' in the sale of the Phoenix Home, which was bought for 1.65 million in 2007. Scam: Greatrex wrote himself cheques and cashed them because he was a trustee of the Lincolnshire care home (pictured outside court with an unknown woman) He said it would have fetched a higher price but Mr Greatrex had insisted that the staff would be kept on as a term of the sale. Mr Sallon added that Mr Greatrex and his family had been subjected to harassment since the end of his trial earlier this month. He said: 'Since his conviction he and members of his family have been the victims of sustained harassment, with unsolicited text messages containing threats demanding money for those from whom it was said to have been stolen, namely miners. 'Political animosity is now being channelled into these kinds of communications.' The court heard that a police investigation into the alleged threats against Mr Greatrex and his family has been launched. UDM general secretary Mick Stevens, who was accused of the same charges, was cleared by the jury. A further hearing to decide issues of confiscation, compensation and costs will be held on June 29.","Scargill-rival Neil Greatex, former president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, wrote himself cheques .

Terrorist widow Samantha Lewthwaite has been charged with plotting to kill hundreds of British tourists. The Muslim convert – who was married to 7/7 Tube bomber Jermaine Lindsay – is on the run in East Africa after police foiled an Al Qaeda-linked bomb plot against holidaymakers in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa. Yesterday it emerged that ‘white widow’ Lewthwaite, 28, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been charged in her absence by Kenyan police with ‘conspiring to improvise an explosive device with the intent to cause harm to innocent civilians’. It is believed she has fled to lawless Somalia with her three young children. Jermaine Grant, centre, faces 14 years imprisonment for his alleged involvement in the terror plot . Married to a bomber: Lethwaite with Jermaine Lindsay who blew himself up in the 2005 terror attack near Russell Square which claimed 26 lives . A police source said: ‘Lewthwaite has now been charged. Even if she is being protected in Somalia, it is very unusual for a white woman to be there with three children and it will not be long until somebody gives her away.’ Police . believe 28-year-old Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and . British accomplice Jermaine Grant were days away from carrying out their . attack before he was arrested in December. She stands charged alongside another Briton, Habib Saleh Ghani, who is listed with the alias Abu Osama. Grant, a Muslim convert, went on trial for his role in the alleged Al Qaeda-linked plot this week. He faces the same allegations, of possessing chemicals and 'conspiring to improvise an explosive device with the intent to cause harm to innocent civilians.' But it was only yesterday that Kenyan authorities revealed that they had also charged Lewthwaite. Luxury: The five-bedroom villa in Shanzu, Mombasa, where it is believed Lewthwaite used to live. Police found her forged passport there and a diary detailing how to be a suicide bomber's wife alongside diet tips . Spacious: The villa, understood to be one of many hideouts used by Samantha Lewthwaite, has a large living room and is simply furnished . Lewthwaite, who was seven months’ pregnant when her husband Jermaine Lindsay detonated a bomb that killed . himself and 26 others on July 7, 2005, was travelling in East Africa on a . false passport when she was arrested with Grant five months ago. She fled and is now being hunted by the CIA, Scotland Yard and Kenyan police and is thought to be in hiding in Somalia. Islamic fundamentalist Grant, 29, from . Newham, East London, denies bomb-making charges with intent to ‘cause . loss of lives to innocent civilians’. Police believe their targets included the Serena Beach Hotel, popular with British tourists, and a nearby shopping centre. Grant said nothing when asked by . reporters if he knew the whereabouts of Lewthwaite, who is also a Muslim . convert.

The inquiry, set up by Apple after a series of suicides at its Chinese factories, revealed employees often worked more than 76 hours a week and 11 days in a row.

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 16:47 EST, 2 February 2012 . A former lawyer who sued car giant Honda after claiming her hybrid Civic failed to live up to gas mileage expectations has won almost $10,000 in compensation. Heather Peters, 46, from Los Angeles, filed a suit in the small-claims court after the 'high-mileage machine' only delivered 30 miles per gallon instead of the 50 promised. Honda contested the claim, but a court ruled yesterday that the car manufacturer has misled Peters about the potential fuel economy of her hybrid car and awarded her $9,867. Winner: Heather Peters, 46, from Los Angeles, filed a suit in the small-claims court after the 'high-mileage machine' only delivered 30 miles per gallon instead of the 50 promised . Angry: Heather Peters (right) decided to pursue Honda in the small claims court rather than take part in a class action because her Civic did not reach 50 miles per gallon (left) but only around 30 . The money is much more than the couple of hundred dollars cash that a proposed class-action settlement is offering. Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Douglas Carnahan said: 'At a bare minimum Honda was aware, that by the time Peters bought her car, there were problems with its living up to its advertised mileage.' Honda said it disagreed with the judgment and that it plans to appeal. But Peters, who gave up practicising law 10 years ago, said she was now going to renew her lincese so she could represent other Honda owners who have the same problems she did. She said: 'Wow! Fantastic. I am absolutely thrilled. Sometimes big justice comes in small packages. This is a victory for Honda Civic owners everywhere.' Carnahan included in his 26-page decision a long list of misleading representations by Honda that he said Peters had correctly identified. Court case: Honda contested the claim, but it was ruled yesterday that the car manufacturer has misled Peters about the potential fuel economy of her hybrid car and awarded her $9,867 . Among them were that the car would use 'amazingly little fuel', 'provides plenty of horsepower while still sipping fuel', and that it would 'save plenty of money on fuel with up to 50 mpg during city driving'. He said: 'Actual performance of plaintiff's vehicle did not live up to these standards.' He noted that when she began receiving much less than the advertised mileage 'she knew she had a problem'. It is a hybrid version of the Honda Civic. First introduced in Japan near the end of 2001. Introduced to the U.S. in Spring 2002 as a 2003 model. It was the second best selling electric hybrid car in the U.S. It has sold more than 255,000 units worldwide. Peters opted out of the class-action lawsuit so she could try to claim a larger damage award for her 2006 Honda Civic's failure to deliver the 50 mpg that was promised. The proposed class-action settlement would give aggrieved owners $100 to $200 each and a $1,000 credit toward the purchase of a new car. Legal fees in the class action would give trial lawyers $8.5 million, Peters said. In small claims court, there are no lawyers' fees and cases are decided quickly. Peters hopes to inspire a flood of small-claims lawsuits by the other 200,000 people whose Honda Civic hybrids are covered by the proposed settlement. If all 200,000 owners sued and won in small claims court, she said, it could cost Honda Motor Co $2 billion. Peters launched a website, DontSettleWithHonda.org, and said she was contacted by hundreds of other car owners seeking guidance on filing small claims lawsuits if they opted out of the class-action case. But legal experts say it is unlikely that many owners would take the small-claims route because of the time and energy involved in pursuing such lawsuits. Carnahan found that Honda did commit fraud, but he could not find intentional fraud and thus did not award punitive damages. Most of the damages Peters was awarded were for extra money spent on fuel, both in the past and future, the cost of the car battery, and the decrease in the car's value because of its problems. A judge in San Diego County is due to rule in March on whether to approve Honda's class-action settlement. Members of the class have until February 11 to accept or decline the deal.

Senior Cambridge Don: Dr Peter Smith was convicted of downloading child porn from an illegal website . A Cambridge University don convicted of downloading child pornography could be allowed to carry on lecturing. Dr Peter Smith was arrested after an international police investigation into an illegal website based in Luxembourg showed he had been a customer. More than 4,000 images were found on his computer, ranging from level one to five – the most serious. He was spared jail last month only after a judge ruled that, as he had been diagnosed with cancer in 2005, a custodial sentence would not be appropriate. Smith was banned from using any computer with internet access, sentenced to 180 hours of community service and ordered to attend a rehabilitation course. He was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. A senior source at Cambridge University confirmed that although Smith would not be allowed to carry out tutorials with students, he would continue to give ‘guest lectures’ and work for the faculty of philosophy. The university’s website still lists Smith, 67, on the faculty’s staff. It is not the first time the professor has been punished for his sexual misdemeanours. The university suspended him for three-and-a-half months in 2003 after it was revealed that he entertained prostitutes in his book-lined study at Jesus College, whose alumni include Prince Edward and novelist Nick Hornby. Dr Smith, 67, may still be allowed to give guest lectures at Cambridge University, pictured above . Cambridge University previously suspended Dr Smith for three-and-a-half months in 2003 after it was revealed that he entertained prostitutes in his book-lined study at Jesus College . The £120-an-hour prostitutes were . provided by the internet agency Stansted Escorts, which waived Smith’s . fee after he provided lurid reviews of their sessions for a website. After details of the scandal were revealed, Smith resigned his £30,000-a-year post as a fellow, a position achieved only by those who produce first-rate academic work and have reputations of the utmost moral rectitude. He returned in December 2003 to lecture students until ‘retiring’ in September last year, although he is listed after that as a lecturer on the October rota for a metaphysics group in the philosophy faculty. Cambridge University Students’ Union women’s officer Ruth Graham said: ‘It seems reasonable to ask that the university make a formal inquiry into Peter Smith’s activities during his time as an employee of the philosophy faculty, given the appalling nature of his offence. ‘The decision to allow him to return to teaching after sleeping with prostitutes in his college study seems incredible, and certainly requires some explanation.’ A Cambridge University spokesman said there were no immediate plans for Smith to give lectures, despite his appearance on official lists and rotas. The spokesman failed to explain why Smith had continued to teach after resigning last September. A statement said: ‘Dr Smith’s resignation from his fellowship was accepted by the then master in July 2003. Dr Smith retired from his position at the faculty of philosophy in September 2011.’","Dr Peter Smith was convicted of downloading child pornography and placed on sex offenders' register .

A retired British businessman extradited to the United States over arms dealing charges was today granted bail and will be released later this week, his lawyer said. Christopher Tappin, 65, of Orpington, Kent, will be released from the Otero County detention centre in New Mexico either tomorrow or Wednesday, his U.S. lawyer Kent Schaffer said. Judge David Briones set the bond at $1million (£620,000) and Tappin's family must pay $50,000 dollars (£31,000) before he can be released, documents filed at the US district court in the Western District of Texas show. Bail: Christopher Tappin, 65, pictured with his wife Elaine, as he arrives at Heathrow Airport ahead of his deportation, could be let out of jail as early as tomorrow . Tappin, the former president of the Kent Golf Union, was told last month that he must remain in custody while he awaits trial in El Paso, Texas. Although he is to be released he will be forced to remain in Texas. Tappin, who faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran, originally spent 23 hours a day locked in his cell before being moved to a shared cell. He denies the charges. The case fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. Custody: Tappin was initially held in a cell for 23 hours a day at the Otero County Prison Facility in the New Mexico desert . Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said Tappin's extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not 'readily curable', warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system. Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have described it as 'one-sided', but an independent review by retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Scott Baker last year found it was both balanced and fair. Tappin's extradition follows an investigation which started in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags. Extradition: Christopher Tappin, pictured with his wife, was sent to the U.S for allegedly trying to import batteries to be used in missiles by Iran. He denies wrongdoing . Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies. Briton Robert Gibson, an associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles. Gibson provided ICE agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers. American Robert Caldwell was also found guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal transport of defence articles and served 20 months in prison.","Christopher Tappin, 65, will be forced to remain in Texas where he faces trial .

The Professional Footballer's Association has been forced to defend its decision to include convicted rapist Ched Evans in their League One Team of the Year. The players' union chief executive Gordon Taylor admitted there had been discussions about withdrawing the Sheffield United striker before Sunday's awards ceremony, in view of the fact that the ballot papers had been returned before Evans was jailed for five years for the rape of a 19-year-old girl. Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted. 'If he had been removed from the team it would have created more of a storm and would have been manipulating the vote. 'Votes are cast on footballing ability, obviously everyone is quite disturbed about the conviction and whether that would have changed the vote we just don't know.' Wales striker Evans, who hit 35 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions for the Blades, has indicated that he wants to appeal against the conviction.

Mother Victoria Rodriguez, 19, told reporters that she found the twins, Giselle and Julian, in the same crib, apparently not breathing. They were unresponsive even after she splashed cold water on their faces, she said. The young mother said she put a blanket over them earlier this morning and said they may have accidentally suffocated. Scroll down for video . Horrific: (left to right) Julian and Giselle Romero, five-month-old twins were found unresponsive in their crib Thursday morning - DCFS is launching an investigation into their deaths . Emotional: Father Josue Romero, 26, said he came home to find his 19-year-old wife crying on the floor . She said each child had their own crib, but were found together. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is looking into the deaths of Giselle and Julian, and had previous allegations of neglect against both Victoria, and her husband, Josue Romero, 26. The family lives in Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, one of the city’s most prominent areas for Mexican immigrants. DCFS spokesperson Jimmie Whitelow said that the agency had contact with the family in March of 2011 after they received reports of neglect and abuse against Romero and an uncle. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, DCFS had a pending investigation for a neglect complaint from April 9. Romero told the Sun-Times that he thought it was an accident. He recounted: ‘I saw her crying on the floor in shock.' Modern family: The couple lived on this block of Little Village in Chicago, a predominately Mexican neighbourhood . Guilt: Romero said his wife takes the blame for their children's deaths; she believes they suffocated in their sleep . He said she kept crying 'the babies!', adding that she told him their children were in bed, but that he didn’t ‘want to see.’ He added: ‘I’m shocked and sad.’ The father said that the twins were having trouble sleeping Wednesday night, and his wife went in to calm them. He was up early Thursday – around 8:30, he said – to take their older children to daycare. The young couple have four other children between the ages of one and five, two from Romero and two from Rodriguez. Autopsies for the two children are scheduled for Friday. Rodriguez, who told the Tribune that she is unemployed, also voiced fears over how she and her husband will cover costs of their funerals. The twins were born November 17, 2011, and were premature. However, Romero said they were ‘getting chubby’ and enjoyed talking to each other. Experts said that both children dying of SIDS – sudden infant death syndrome – is highly unlikely, but not impossible. The risk for SIDS increases if babies sleep on their stomachs, with an adult, or are born severely prematurely.","Mother Victoria Rodriguez, 19, said she found twins Julian and Giselle unresponsive in their crib .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 06:48 EST, 25 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:26 EST, 26 April 2012 . Israel's senior military chief has claimed that Iran will decide against building a nuclear bomb as the Iranian leadership is composed of 'very rational people'. Lt Gen Benny Gantz said he believes that diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions, along with Israel's determination to strike if necessary, will deter Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Gantz's comments have put him at odds with Israel's more pessimistic prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has complained that international sanctions have not changed Iran's behavior. Lt Gen Benny Gantz's assertion that Iran is not building nuclear weapons is in contrast to that of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu . But speaking to the Haaretz daily, Lt Gen Gantz said: 'I don't think (Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei) will want to go the extra mile. 'I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people.' At the same time, he warned that Israel is moving forward with its preparations to take military action if necessary. 'We are preparing for it in a credible manner. That's my job, as a military man,' he said. He said this year would be critical in determining whether Iran decides to take the final steps needed for a weapon. 'We're in a period when something must happen: Either Iran takes its nuclear weapon to a civilian footing only or the world, perhaps we too, will have to do something. We're closer to the end of the discussions than the middle,' he said. Gantz's comments contrasted with much tougher statements by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who complained in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that international sanctions have not changed Iran's behavior. He told the network that Iran continues to enrich uranium - a key step toward developing a weapon. Leaked documents earlier this year have shown that Iran has made significant improvements to its nuclear enrichment facility in the central city of Natanz . The sanctions 'are certainly taking a bite out of the Iranian economy, but so far they haven't rolled back the Iranian program or even stopped it by one iota,' Netanyahu said. Nuclear centrifuges are 'spinning as we speak. 'So if the sanctions are going to work, they better work soon,' he said. Israel and much of the West believe Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon. But differences have emerged on how to deal with the issue. The U.S. and other major powers have imposed a series of economic sanctions while opening a dialogue with Iran. Netanyahu has voiced skepticism about the negotiations, saying Iran is merely trying to buy time as it pushes forward with a weapons program, while hinting that Israel would be ready to attack Iran's nuclear installations. Israel views a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its very existence. Iranian claims that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Western concern has been steadily building over Iran's nuclear capabilities as they develop the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant . Netanyahu sarcastically dismissed the denials. He cited Iran's development of missiles capable of dropping a bomb on Israel, Iranian leaders' repeated calls for Israel's destruction, and fortifying Iranian nuclear facilities deep underground. 'Nobody can take them seriously,' he said. Both Netanyahu and Gantz gave the interviews as Israel marked its annual Memorial Day for soldiers and civilians killed in violence with Arab neighbors - a solemn day that leads into the festive Independence Day at sundown. Under Netanyahu, peace efforts with the Palestinians have ground to a standstill due to disagreements over Israeli settlement construction in occupied areas claimed by the Palestinians. In the interview, Netanyahu said he is not convinced that Palestinian leaders are serious about making peace with Israel. He said if he believed Palestinians would be ready to compromise for peace, he could convince the Israeli public to support a peace treaty. He said Israel has no interest in ruling another people, and that he wants an independent but demilitarized Palestinian state. Worry: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has complained recently that international sanctions have not changed Iran's behavior . He also voiced support for a contiguous Palestinian state - addressing Palestinian fears that Netanyahu wants to give them little more than autonomous cantons in the West Bank separated by Israeli forces and settlements. He said a Palestinian state would not be 'Swiss cheese.' Earlier this week, Israeli President Shimon Peres told Haaretz that in contrast to Netanyahu, he is convinced that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is a credible partner for peace. On Wednesday morning, Israelis stood for two minutes as sirens wailed throughout the country in an annual ritual to remember fallen soldiers and victims of Palestinian militants. Memorial ceremonies were held throughout the day, bereaved families visited the graves of their dead relatives, flags were at half-staff and radios played somber songs. Earlier this week, Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yonatan, an army commando who was killed in a famous 1976 rescue operation on a hijacked airliner. At sundown, Israelis were to begin celebrating Israel's 64 years of independence with fireworks, concerts, street parties and folk dancing in public squares. Israel's military said it closed entry points into Israel for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, citing security concerns. The closure is routinely done during Israeli and Jewish holidays, when fears of militant attacks are heightened.",Lt Gen Benny Gantz says economic sanctions will deter Iran from building weapons .

A heroic Royal Navy airman helped save seven sailors from the stricken cargo ship which ran aground off the North Wales coast on his very first day on the job. Just hours before the vessel 'Carrier' hit rocks in the Colwyn Bay area at around 8.15pm, Petty Officer Mike Henson was taking his final assessment to become a qualified search and rescue aircrewman. Little did he know that later that day he would be putting his training to the ultimate test after being left on board the stranded ship for two hours with powerful waves lashing its side. Scroll down to see the RNLI rescue of the stricken crew . Drama: An RAF rescuer, believed to be Petty Officer Mike Henson, helps a crew member on board the stricken cargo ship 'Carrier' On the rocks: The boat, carring a cargo of stone, crashed against the rocks at Colwyn Bay . PO Henson was part of the crew on the . Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet in Prestwick, Ayrshire, . which was first on the scene after the vessel ran aground in rough seas . near Colwyn Bay in North Wales. The search and rescue crew battled . Gale Force Nine winds and five metre swells to get to the seven polish . seamen on board the ship. PO Henson was lowered onto the deck to help attach the men to the helicopter’s winch. Four of the crew were airlifted off . the boat but while the fifth man was being rescued the aircraft . developed a problem with its winch wire. PO Henson said a huge wave crashed . over the side of the boat, pushing one of the crew members against the . wall of the ship and causing the wire to slack, making it unsafe to haul . any further crew members from the stricken 82-metre long vessel. Rescue co-ordinators were forced to . scramble a second helicopter from RAF Leconfield to collect PO Henson, . the captain of the 'Carrier' boat and the final crew member. The ship, seen at low tide today, is now resting against the sea defences on the side of the bay . 'It is a fantastic job and I am very fortunate to do it,' said PO Henson. 'It was a very hard and testing first day but I have been lucky to be taught by some very good instructors.' Rescue workers are now urgently trying to pump fuel from a stricken ship that crashed into the shore of North Wales last night. Fuel has started to leak from the cargo ship 'Carrier', which was carrying 40,000 litres of 'gas oil' when it hit rocks, with seven crew-members aboard, in the Colwyn Bay area at around 8.15pm. Environmental officers are today working to safely remove 40,000 . litres of fuel from a stricken cargo ship which ran aground in rough . seas, sparking the rescue of seven crew members. The ship has leaked a 'small quantity' of oil into surrounding waters, the Environment Agency said.

A Los Angeles-area elementary school teacher accused of taking bondage-style photos of students, some with cockroaches on their faces, and spoon-feeding students semen-laced cookies, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 23 counts of lewd acts on children. Mark Berndt, 61, entered the not guilty pleas during a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court attended by parents from Miramonte Elementary School, where he taught for more than 30 years. Berndt, the first of two teachers accused of molesting students at Miramonte, is being held on $23million bail - $1million for each charge and is due back in court next month. Not guilty: A bearded Mark Berndt, right, looks to his attorney, Victor Acevedo during his arraignment today; he plead not guilty . Scraggly: Berndt appeared in court today looking disheveled; he plead not guilty to the 23 counts against him . All of the 23 initial victims were between the ages of seven and ten years old and 21 were girls, court prosecutors said. In some of the pictures children were pictured with large, ‘live, Madagascar-type cockroaches’ on their faces, sheriff's officials say. In others, students were seen with spoons of a substance later determined to be semen held to their faces. Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt Dan Scott said today in court that the young students ‘didn’t realise they were victimised. ‘They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,’ he said,’ and were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar, (but) they did not realise the spoon contained semen.’ One alleged victim spoke out on the Dr Phil show last week. When Phil McGraw asked the young student what the cookie fed to her by Berndt was like, she said: ‘It had something like saliva, and it was slimy.’ Riddled with problems: Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles has been racked with scandal; another teacher has also been charged with lewd acts against students . Her face and identity were not revealed. Prosecutors say the allegations came to light after a photographer developing Berndt’s prints discovered lewd photos in January 2011. By law, commercial film developers are required to report child pornography. The second Miramonte teacher, Martin Springer, 49, was charged earlier this month with three counts of lewd acts on a child and is free on $300,000 bail. In the slammer: Mark Berndt, 61, was arrested this January . Berndt was arrested in January following a year-long investigation that began when photos showing blindfolded and gagged students were turned over to police by a drug store photo technician. He had been a teacher at Miramonte for more than 30 years, and was beloved by many parents. He was arrested in January and charged with committing lewd acts on children as young as six years old. The accusations have touched off protests by infuriated parents and prompted Los Angeles County school officials to replace the entire staff at Miramonte during an exhaustive investigation. The shocking allegations of the two teachers brought into question how well students are protected by school systems. NBC Los Angeles reports that Berndt was ordered to remain in custody until his next trial, to take place on March 28. Shocking pictures released earlier this month shows the teacher and his letters to pupils at the centre of a disturbing alleged sex scandal that has led to the closure and reopening of a Los Angeles elementary school. The photos show Mark Berndt dressed in black leggings and shorts. In one he is wearing Mickey Mouse ears and has his arm around a female student. Berndt appears to be eating a cookie of some sort, but it's unclear whether it was one of his own 'special' concoctions. New images: Mark Berndt, seen here dressed in tights as Mickey Mouse, allegedly fed semen-laced cookies to students at Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles, California . Inside his mind: One photo shows Mark Berndt with a pupil, left, and a letter he sent to one student is seen right, saying he's 'very happy' they were his student . Authorities re-opened Miramonte earlier this month with an entirely new staff after it was closed down entirely when a second . teacher was charged with sex abuse against students at the school. In one physical-education class, . first-graders reportedly had to tell their teacher where to find the . class schedule and what they were supposed to be doing that period. 'It's kind of hard. You barely know your teacher, and they're gone. The kids don't know what's going on' Miramonte pupil's parent .

Some students wrote farewell letters . to their former teachers. ‘You had to go because of somebody evil,’ one . first-grader wrote. Others wrote: ‘You were a good teacher’ and ‘I will . miss you.’ Parents were offered the option of . transferring their children to another school.

Two Southern California men pleaded guilty on Thursday to indecent exposure in Dominica after they were arrested during a stop on a gay cruise of the Caribbean. John Robert Hart, 41, and Dennis Jay Mayer, 43, of Palm Springs, apologized in court and said they regretted their actions. Police said they were seen having sex in plain sight of people on land, prompting officers to board the ship and arrest them on Wednesday. Gay cruise: John Hart, 41, left, and Dennis Jay Mayer, 43, both of Palm Springs, California, pleaded guilty to indecent exposure after they were caught having sex . Mayer, 43, second from left, and Hart, 41, third from left, are escorted by police officers back to court following their arrest during a stop on a gay cruise of the Caribbean . The two initially were arrested on suspicion of the local equivalent of sodomy in the eastern Caribbean island, which prohibits sex between two men. The men's attorney, Bernadette Lambert, said they were remorseful. 'They were struck by the beautiful mountains, the clean and clear fresh air and were having a few cocktails, and so threw caution to the wind,' she told the court. Chief Magistrate Evaline Baptiste ordered the men to pay a nearly $900 fine after calling them 'rogues and vagabonds'. They made no comment after the hearing and police drove the men to the airport after they were released. The two were aboard the Celebrity Summit cruise ship that had departed Puerto Rico on Saturday with about 2,000 passengers. The ship departed for St Barts late Wednesday, leaving the men behind. Arrest: Two men on board a gay cruise of the Caribbean were arrested yesterday in Dominica, after being spotted having sex on the Celebrity cruise ship, pictured, from the port of Roseau . The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. President . Rich Campbell said Thursday that the outcome of the case would have . been the same had it involved a heterosexual couple instead of two gay . men. 'It had nothing to . do with their sexual orientation and everything to do with their public . conduct,' he said. 'I have been in contact with the guests and they are . in good spirits.' Dozens of islanders packed the courtroom in the capital of Roseau to attend the 30-minute hearing. Dominica . Tourism Minister Ian Douglas said that tourists should abide by local . laws regardless of their religious or sexual orientation, and that . cruise ship officials should make passengers aware of these laws. 'It . cannot be the responsibility of Dominica to screen guests and tourists . before they come into the country,' he said. 'It is expected that any . time people come to a country, they will respect the laws of the . country.' Gay Caribbean . cruises have been popular for several years despite hostility to . homosexuality on certain islands, especially in Jamaica, Barbados and . the Cayman Islands. Party boat: The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. The ship departed for St. Barts without the men, who are being held in a cell at police headquarters in the capital of Roseau . The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. President Rich Campbell, who is aboard the cruise, said in a phone interview earlier that the company has organized many trips to Dominica and would 'happily return'. 'Many countries and municipalities that gay men visit and live in have antiquated laws on their books,' he said. 'These statutes don't pose a concern to us in planning a tourist visit.' Statement: President Rich Campbell, pictured, who is aboard the cruise, said 'The guests' actions were unfortunate but minor in this case and have no bearing on our overall guest experience' 'The guests' actions were unfortunate but minor in this case and have no bearing on our overall guest experience,' he said via email. The pastor of Dominica's Trinity Baptist Church, Randy Rodney, praised the police for their intervention. 'I . am very pleased that the police were called in and have arrested the . people in question. I have warned about gay tourism and its implications . for Dominica,' said Mr Rodney, who is a vocal critic of homosexuality . and lesbianism. Holiday ethos: On the company website, guest are encouraged to enjoy themselves and it states 'The only rule is there are no rules' According to Cruisemates.com, no gay cruise lines sail to Jamaica or Barbados for fear of homophobia and possible violence. It said other places like the U.S. Virgin Islands welcome gay cruises. In 2010, the Cayman Islands rejected the arrival of an Atlantis gay cruise amid protests from religious groups even though homosexuality is legal on the archipelago. Don Weiner, a spokesman for Atlantic Events, referred all questions to Campbell, including why the company organized a trip to Dominica and whether it knew about the island's anti-sodomy laws. Elizabeth Jakeway, a spokeswoman for Celebrity Cruises, referred all questions to Atlantis. The last time authorities in the Caribbean intervened on a gay cruise was in February 2011, when agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested a California man aboard the Allure of the Seas, which had docked in St. Thomas. The man, Steven Barry Krumholz of West Hollywood, pleaded guilty to selling ecstasy, methamphetamine and ketamine to fellow passengers.","Men were spotted having sex on Celebrity Summit from dock in Dominica, where sex between two men is illegal .

The militant Muslim accused of the Bali bombing which killed over 200 people today apologised for the first time to victims of the atrocity. Umar Patek, a leading member of the Al-Qaeda-linked network Jemaah Islamiyah, is standing trial in Jakarta on terrorism charges in connection with the 2002 attack which killed 202 people. Today Patek, nicknamed 'Demolition Man' after the explosions, said sorry to the victims and their families before adding in court that he 'feels guilty' about the bombings. Accused: Umar Patek faces terrorism and criminal charges over the Bali nightclub bombing which killed 202 people in 2002 . Plea: An emotional speech by the alleged bombmaker saw Patek apologise to the bombing's victims and families . Patek admitted mixing some of the parts in the bomb's explosives, but has denied playing a major part in the attack . Patek denies playing a major role in assembling the massive car bomb that, on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2002, went off outside two nightclubs packed with foreign tourists on the busiest night of the week. But an emotional Patek today told a courtroom: 'I still feel guilty.' He later added: 'From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the victims and their families.' Patek said: 'I knew about the plan. I helped mix some of the chemicals use in the explosives. ... Why didn't I inform the police?' A suicide bomber inside one of the clubs had blown himself up, killing many people and forcing others to run outside where the vehicle loaded with the bomb was parked. Another suicide bomber then blew that up in an attack which eventually killed 88 Australian victims and seven Americans. After the bombings, Indonesia was thrust onto the front lines in the battle against terrorism. Trial: Patek, pictures speaking to the court in Jakarta today, faces the death penalty if found guilty of terror and criminal charges . In court: Umar Patek, pictured in court earlier this year, is the top remaining suspect . in the Bali nightclub bombings, which killed 202 people about a year . after the Sept. 11 attacks and brought international attention to an . al-Qaeda-linked group . Refusal: After the case was adjourned until earlier this year, Patek shook hands with all of the prosecutors except Rini . Hartati, the only female team member. Ms Hartati held out her hand but . Patek rejected it by putting his right hand on his chest . There have been several attacks targeting Western hotels, restaurants and an embassy since then. But all have been far less deadly, thanks in part, security experts say, to a relentless crackdown on Jemaah Islamiyah that has largely decimated their ranks. Patek, who was arrested in Pakistan just over a year ago, told the court the Bali bombings were in theory meant to avenge Western policies in the Palestinian territories. 'From my point of view, it was total failure,' the suspect told the court, adding he saw 'no connection' between the original mission, fighting against the oppression of fellow Muslims, and the target, partying tourists. 'Yes, most of the victims were white, but there were no Israelis,' he said. 'Some were even Indonesian. That's a failure.' Destroyed: Three masterminds in the Bali bombing . attack already have been tried and executed, and authorities have made . big strides in dismantling their regional terror group, Jemaah Islamiyah . Planned: Patek left Bali a few days before the . Oct. 12 attacks were carried out, while Imam Samudra and two other . masterminds of the Bali attacks - brothers Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali . Ghufron - were caught, tried and executed . Patek faces a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty of terror-related and criminal charges. He insists he didn't play a major role in assembling the massive car bomb - saying that job fell to Jemaah Islamiyah bomb-making masterminds, Azahari bin Husin and Dulmatin, both of whom have since been killed in police raids. 'I only played a small role,' he said, acknowledging that he helped mix less than 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of nearly a ton of the chemicals used in the explosives. 'But I still feel guilty, because I was involved in an event that caused massive casualties.' 'From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the victims and their families,' he said. Wreckage: Patek, is accused in a string of Christmas Eve bombings at churches in Indonesia in 2000 that claimed 19 lives . Patek, nicknamed 'Demolition Man' by Indonesian investigators, escaped the country after the attack and went on a nine-year flight from justice that took him to the Philippines and Pakistan, allegedly in pursuit of more terror opportunities. Patek was captured in January 2011 in Abbottabad, where U.S. Navy Seals would kill Osama bin Laden just a few months later. Patek was then one of Asia's most wanted terror suspects, with a $1 million bounty on his head. The trial could shed light on what Patek was doing in Abbottabad. Indonesia's Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro has said he was believed to be trying to meet with bin Laden, but Patek has denied that, saying he was on way to seek shelter in Afghanistan. U.S. and Pakistan investigators have suggested Patek's stay in Abottabad was pure coincidence.","Umar Patek apologises for terror attack in nightclub which left scores dead .

One kidney has made its way to three people in two weeks, in what looks to be a medical first. The kidney in question was donated by 21-year-old Cera Fearing, who originally donated the organ to her brother Ray, 27, who suffers from a common form of kidney disease. When Mr Fearing’s body rejected the transplant, he chose to pass on the kidney to someone else who could use it. And so, 67-year-old Erwin Gomez, a surgeon and father of five, was the final recipient of Ms Fearing’s kidney. Scroll down for video . Line of progression: Cera Fearing, right, donated her kidney to brother, Ray, centre; the kidney then went to Erwin Gomez, left, after Ray's body rejected the transplant . The miraculous story of the Chicago-area transplant is detailed in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been other cases since the 1980s of transplant organs being used more than once, but they were rare and involved instances in which the first recipient died. Typically when transplanted organs fail in living patients, doctors throw them away. But with more than 73,000 people awaiting transplants nationwide, some specialists say doctors should consider trying to reuse more organs to ease the severe shortage. 'The need for kidney transplantation doesn't match our capacity,' said Dr Lorenzo Gallon, a Northwestern University transplant specialist who oversaw the kidney recycling operation in Chicago. 'People die on dialysis' while awaiting kidneys. That was the possible fate awaiting two strangers. A research letter describing the unusual case was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. The donated kidney lasted just two weeks in Mr Fearing. The same disease that ruined his kidneys started to damage the new kidney, given to him by his sister. Sibling love: Cera donated her kidney to her older brother Ray, but his body soon rejected the transplant . He was getting sicker, and doctors needed to act fast if they were going to save the organ. With permission from the man and his sister, they removed it last July and re-transplanted it the Indiana surgeon. Mr Fearing is back on dialysis and will probably get another transplant eventually. Still, reusing a transplanted organ can be tricky - and riskier - because surgeons have to deal with scar tissue that typically forms around an organ as the body heals from the operation. Wayne Shelton, a bioethicist at Albany Medical College in New York, said the practice may raise ethical questions. He said doctors need to make sure patients who are offered reused parts understand all the risks and are not made to feel coerced into accepting such organs. 'I just assumed it's damaged, it's . garbage. The fact that they were able to give it to someone . that somehow was able to benefit from it was great.' -Cera Fearing . And because these cases are so rare, there is little data on how patients with recycled parts fare, Shelton noted. Fearing had a disease that caused scarring that prevented the kidneys from filtering waste from blood. He had to quit his industrial machinery job and went on dialysis a year ago. His sister donated a kidney last June in what was 'probably the happiest moment of my life,' Fearing said. The worst, he said, was a few days later, when doctors told him the kidney was damaged and had to be removed. Gallon, medical director of Northwestern's kidney transplant program, thought the kidney could be reused in somebody else if it was removed quickly, before it became irreversibly damaged. Gallon needed Fearing's permission, and also asked the young man's sister, Cera Fearing. Clandestine meeting: Dr Lorenzo Gallon, transplant nephrologist and medical director of the kidney transplant program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, talks with the three in their first meeting . Mr Fearing said he was heartbroken and reluctant to abandon an organ that had been his only hope for a normal life. But he decided it was the only option that made sense. His sister, too, was crushed but said she didn't hesitate when told her kidney might help someone else. 'I just assumed it's damaged, it's garbage,' she said. 'The fact that they were able to give it to someone that somehow was able to benefit from it was great.' Gomez was selected because he was a good match. But Gallon said doctors also thought Gomez's medical background would help him understand the complexities. Gomez said he had never heard of reusing transplant organs, and he worried about taking what seemed like damaged goods. But he agreed after the Northwestern team explained the risks and possible benefits. The removal and retransplant operations took place July 1. Within two days, the transplanted kidney had regained function. Gallon said he is convinced the damage is reversed. Gomez is taking anti-rejection drugs and is off dialysis. 'I finally feel normal,' he said. Fearing is back on dialysis and said he is doing OK. Gallon said it is not uncommon for patients with Fearing's disease to go through more than one transplanted kidney, and he expects Fearing will eventually get another one. Despite his own misfortune, Fearing said he is 'extremely happy about being a part of this medical breakthrough' that might end up helping others.

David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne are just two of the 1.2 million British people who suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) which leaves those afflicted neurotically obsessed about things such as tidiness or cleanliness. A mental health organisation is now expanding research to see if a strain of bacteria may cause children to develop a particular condition with OCD-type symptoms. The study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH), based in Maryland, United States, will see if there is a link between Streptococcus bacteria and a condition called Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). Cause: Research is to begin to find out if the Streptococcus strain of bacteria could be the cause of an OCD type condition in children . PANS causes children and teens to suddenly develop symptoms or abnormal eating behaviors, along with other psychiatric symptoms without any known cause. Susan Swedo, Managing Director of the NIH, said: “Parents will describe children with PANS as overcome by a ‘ferocious’ onset of obsessive thoughts, compulsive rituals and overwhelming fears.' Scientists think that after it detects a Streptococcus infection, the body's immune system responds by creating antibodies which sometimes mistakenly attack the heart, joints, and brain. In children, this attack on the brain can cause the bundle of nerves called the basal ganglia to become inflamed. This, in turn, can lead children to develop, seemingly overnight, severe symptoms of OCD and anorexia. According to the NIH children with the condition can appear terror-stricken, suffer extreme separation anxiety, shifting from laughter to tears for no apparent reason and regress to temper tantrums, ""baby talk,"" or bedwetting. Other symptoms include undergoing sudden deterioration in school performance or learning abilities and exhibiting sensory and motor abnormalities. OCD sufferer: David Beckham is one of 1.2 million British people who suffer from OCD . The NIH hopes the study will improve diagnosis and treatment. It also wants to find out if there is an alternative cause of PANS apart from Streptococcus bacteria. Between one and two per cent of the UK population are thought to suffer from OCD  although most people only have minor symptoms. One of the most common examples is an irrational fear of germs and dirt. Other obsessions include worries about security issues such as having left the cooker on or the house unlocked, a need for everything in life to be ordered with extreme precision, and a fear of making a mistake. Such obsessions make the sufferer feel anxious. In an effort to ease that anxiety they take actions such as washing their hands every few minutes or going around the house checking everything is locked. Many sufferers know they are being irrational but feel powerless to stop. The NIMH has now launched a project to find such cases and improve diagnosis and treatment, including a study to see how well IVIG, a human antibody treatment used to dampen autoimmune reactions, reverses the syndrome. It also wants to find out how many such cases are related to strep infections, or if there are other causes. The NIMH has now put out guidelines for diagnosing Sydenham's chorea whenever it appears, whether or not the child is known to have had a recent strep infection. Tracking all cases this way should allow researchers to investigate causes more thoroughly, as well as diagnostic signs, and treatments.",Study will look for link between Streptococcus bacteria and OCD .

The mother of a small-town girl who dreamed of becoming a Hollywood actress was today reunited with her daughter after she went missing for four months. Sharon Stratton drove from Tennessee to Los Angeles to see her daughter Satara, who she says was 'drugged and tortured' by a registered sex offender who held her captive. Ms Stratton told MailOnline of her joy at being able to 'hug her, talk to her, tell her none of this is her fault' - but said Satara was still in 'too bad a shape' to leave hospital. And the family has refused to reveal Satara's current location, or the hospital she will be moved to, as they fear her alleged captor poses a continued threat to the 24-year-old. Alive: Police have located actress Satara Stratton, pictured, who went missing in November. She was believed to be addicted to heroin and under the influence of a sex offender . The . emotional reunion brings an end to the harrowing story of the wannabe . star who saw her ambitions crushed by the reality of life on the dark . side of Tinseltown. Satara . had travelled west with dreams of stardom, but was allegedly drawn into . drug addiction after meeting a sex offender who took her into his care. Her . youthful good lucks were ravaged by heroin, and a series of police . mugshots taken following drug-related arrests showed the toll that her . lifestyle was beginning to take on her body. Although . Mrs Stratton reported her daughter as missing after she stopped . returning her phone calls, authorities claimed there was no evidence she . had been abducted. But . after a nationwide publicity campaign, Satara turned up at a Los . Angeles hospital - apparently left there by the man who allegedly held . her captive. Police are now trying to track the man down and bring him to justice for his role in the young woman's dramatic fall. Ambition: Satara dreamed of becoming a Hollywood star when she was growing up in Tennessee . Mrs Stratton said: 'That man destroyed my little girl. He held her captive for more than four . months in a place where she could not escape from. 'He drugged her, . tortured her, attacked her and who knows what else. 'She needs to be with her family and . we need to get her healthy and back to normal and give her time to . recover from the nightmare she has been through.' She added that when Satara is awake in the hospital, she screams uncontrollably - terrified the man will find her and drag her away. Los Angeles police announced yesterday she had been located in 'good condition' at an unspecified hospital. Career: Satara (right) has appeared in several films, including the 2010 movie Fairer Blood, pictured . Ms Stratton, who is a university professor, said it was the registered sex offender who had kidnapped her daughter who left her at the hospital after increasing pressure . from police. He fled soon afterwards and is thought to be still on the run. Satara, whose screen name was Satara Silver, is now being held in a secure place until he is found. She is being treated for some external injuries and . bruising over her body. She is also suffering withdrawal symptoms from . the drugs she was injected with. Over the last eight months, police . have arrested Satara on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting . how her life had spiraled out of control. Arrests have . included possession of narcotics . in a hospital. Police are now looking for the sex offender whose offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14. Downfall: Police mug shots from drug charges show Stratton looking increasingly disheveled and ill . Her mother revealed that prior to this, Satara was a normal, happy and quiet young girl who loved dancing and soccer. She had been acting since she was three-years-old and enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie. It was when she was working in New York that she was advised to move to LA as she had dreams of also becoming a film director. Determined to make a success of her . new life, the petite blonde began taking classes and started a job . at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard. But . it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, . causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los . Angeles Times last month. Hometown: Before moving to Los Angeles, Satara lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where her mother is a professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee, pictured . Mrs Stratton added that her daughter's . troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her . and harassing her. She said she believes the employee may have been working with the sex offender as the two were friends. Satara Stratton was said to be a happy fun-loving girl until she moved to Hollywood . 'I don't know what their motive was or . if it was a money thing,' she said. 'But my daughter is very petite and . young looking and I believe one of the men is a registered pedophile, so . perhaps that was why he went after her. 'She was very vulnerable. They singled . her out and preyed on her. My daughter never touched hard drugs in her . life. She was always a very demure and quiet girl.' The university professor said she is just glad Satara is still alive after a threatening email was sent to Satara's boyfriend last month saying he was going to kill both her and her mother. 'I spent two weeks in LA looking for . her after that. I got no help from police who warned me victims aren't . usually found alive after three months missing,' she said. 'It was only when I made a plea on . Facebook and then the media got hold of it that the police really . started to investigate her disappearance.' Police had considered her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refused to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly. The . last time Sharon spoke to her daughter before she was located was in . November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died. Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times. Sightings: Stratton, who appeared in a handful of films, was seen 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard . Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began . Though Ms Stratton doesn't know the full details of what her daughter went through, she believes her daughter was stalked before being 'grabbed' after being offered a ride home. It will likely be a while before her daughter can even talk about what happened, she said. 'I want to get my daughter back and . give her the love and care she needs. The last four months have been a . nightmare, I haven't been able to sleep or eat or work or even think. 'Once she is back to normal, I know . Satara will go back to pursuing her dream. She will not give that up . just because of what that man did to her. She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'. Authorities have never divulged the nature of her health issues. On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.' She added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants. 'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections. So where is she?' Hunt: Satara was noted as 'voluntarily missing' but her mother disputes this, saying they spoke every day .","Satara Stratton, 24, moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dream .

A man has been convicted of capital murder for killing a 14-year-old cheerleader whose charred body was found at the asphalt plant where the man worked. Adam Longoria, 38, stood and stared straight at jurors, wearing a blank expression as the judge polled each of them to confirm the decision. The jury had deliberated less than four hours after closing arguments capped six days of testimony about the August 2010 killing of Alicia DeBolt. Brutally murdered: The charred remains of Alicia DeBolt, 14, were found at a Kansas asphalt plant in 2010 . Facing life: Adam Joseph Longoria, 38, has been found guilty of capital murder after Alicia's death . Carefree: Alicia was just 14 when she was brutally murdered by Longoria not far from her home . Alicia was last seen alive when she left her home in Great Bend, Kansas for a party just before midnight on August 21. Her family reported her missing the next day, setting off a search that ended three days later when her remains, with traces of duct tape on her ankles and face, were found at the Venture Corp. plant. Alicia's remains were so badly burned that the coroner had to rely on dental records to identify her. The community of Great Bend was so shaken by the cheerleader's August 2010 death that more than 2,000 people attended a vigil to remember the teen known as 'Babygurl.' En masse: The community of Great Bend was so shaken by the cheerleader's August 2010 death that more than 2,000 people attended a vigil to remember the teen known as 'Babygurl' Disbelief: Friends and classmates of Ms DeBolt exchanged hugs and cried during the vigil . A town in shock: Mourners held candles at the August 29, 2010 vigil for Alicia DeBolt in in Great Bend . Longoria was 36 when he began pursuing the teen after meeting her at a party in July that year. 'She is a teenager,' prosecutor Kevin O'Connor told jurors earlier on Friday. 'Maybe this little girl is trying to be a little bit older than she was - but he was a lot older.' Mr O'Connor reminded jurors of the hundreds of text messages Longoria exchanged with Alicia, underlining his obsession with the teen, including the text messages that showed he picked her up the night she disappeared and that she thought she was going to a party. The prosecutor noted Longoria's semen was found mixed with Alicia's DNA in his vehicle. Other evidence indicating Longoria was involved in Alicia's grisly death included gasoline on his gym shoes and video surveillance showing him buying $1.32 of gas on the night she disappeared. His ex-girlfriend testified that he smelled of gasoline when he came home and that her car reeked of it the next morning. Other witnesses testified that Longoria asked them to lie about his whereabouts that night. Denial: Factory worker Longoria pleaded not guilty to the killing but failed to convince a jury . Fatal attraction: Longoria, left, seduced the teen through text messages and had a 'depraved fantasy' Mr O'Connor also pointed to the destruction of evidence: Alicia's body was burned so badly it was impossible to determine if she was sexually assaulted; Longoria's ex-girlfriend testified that he washed his clothes when he came home that night, and later shredded his T-shirt and asked her to dispose of it. Defence attorney Jeff Wicks said text messages indicated Alicia was in a sexual relationship with another boy and suggested that boy or someone else could have killed her. He said Longoria had bragged about having sex with Alicia, meaning her DNA could have ended up in his car on another occasion. And DNA from an unknown male was found in the girl's mouth. Mr O'Connor said text messages sent from Longoria's phone did not indicate he had 'accomplished his goal, his conquest of a 14-year-old,' and he derided Mr Wicks's efforts to portray someone else as a possible killer. 'It is his fault,' Mr O'Connor said, pointing to the defendant. 'And the evidence establishes that.' To find Longoria guilty of capital murder, jurors had to determine he committed criminal sodomy, aggravated criminal sodomy or attempted rape during the killing. Jurors were also allowed to consider lesser charges such as first-degree murder and second-degree murder.","Adam Longoria sent a series of text messages to Alicia DeBolt .

A murder investigation has been launched after a two-year-old boy was found dead at his home. Rio Smedley was found unconscious at the two-bedroom home, in Bolton, Lancashire, yesterday evening after police were called following reports that his heart had stopped. Medics rushed the toddler to the Royal Bolton Hospital but were unable to revive him. A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently being quizzed by detectives. Leon's mother, Kirsty, in her 20s, is believed to be pregnant by the man now under arrest, who is not the dead boy's father. Her oldest daughter, five-year-old Ella, is being comforted at her grandmother’s nearby home. The arrested man and Kirsty were both at home in Bolton when police arrived. Rio’s family said in a tribute: 'Rio . was the loving son of Kirsty, brother of Ella, grandson of Karen and . Paddy, Gordon and Yvonne, nephew of Shaun and Jason.

A one-year-old baby boy drowned in just seven inches of bath water after his mother left the room for less than a minute, an inquest heard. Leo Clark, who had just turned one, slipped underwater on his back and drowned when his mother briefly left the bathroom at their home in Chippenham, Wiltshire. His horrified mother, Natasha Clark, returned to the bathroom to find the youngster submerged in the tub next to his older brother Jamie. Tragic: Leo Clark was rushed to Royal United Hospital, in Bath after being found by his mother submerged underwater, but could not be revived . Natasha made frantic attempts to revive him and had her young son rushed to hospital, but he could not be saved. A coroner yesterday cleared the devastated mother of any blame in Leo's death, saying it had been a 'tragic accident.' An inquest into the one-year-old's death at Trowbridge Coroner's Court, heard that Natasha gave her two children a bath as part of their normal routine on July 16 last year. She poured just 18.5cms of water into the tub for Jamie and Leo at around 6.30pm and sat down nearby to make a phone call to their father Darren Scrivens. Leo's mother had briefly left the bathroom to phone the baby's father Darren Scrivens when tragedy struck . In a statement read to the court, Miss Clark, who did not attend the inquest, said: 'After finishing the phone call I went to get something out of the kitchen. 'I am not sure how long I was gone for, but it could not have been more than a minute. When I came back Leo was on his back under the water and not breathing.' Desperate Natasha took Leo out of the bath and carried him down the hallway into the bedroom of her ground-floor flat. She tried to call 999 but could not connect - but she managed to get through to her mother who called an ambulance. Miss Clark started CPR on Leo until paramedics arrived and he was airlifted to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset. But he could not be resuscitated and was declared dead at 9.42pm. Wiltshire Police attended the flat, in Neeld (corr) Crescent, but decided there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Sergeant Simon Garrett (corr), who attended the scene with PC Melony (corr) Neal, said: 'I went into the lounge where Natasha was sitting on the sofa. 'She was very upset and emotional about what had happened. 'From my time at the address there was nothing that made me believe there was anything suspicious about Leo's death. It was just a tragic accident.' The inquest heard Leo had a history of breathing problems and had been airlifted to hospital with the condition just weeks before his death. But the court was told the existing issues were not deemed to be contributory towards his death. Dr David Singleton, assistant deputy coroner at Trowbridge Coroner's Court, recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Wednesday. He said: 'The children were put in the bath at 6.30pm, prior to going to bed. 'Their mother gave evidence that she left the room for a minute or two and came back to see Leo on his back, under the water and not breathing. 'On the balance of probabilities I believe the appropriate verdict is one of accidental death.' Verdict: Accident .","Leo Clark slipped underwater when mother left bathroom .

The Second World War veteran, who fought in the D-Day landings in Normandy was followed by a car after he got off the bus.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:40 EST, 21 January 2012 . Remembered: Former Tuskegee airman Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, shown in 2006, was laid to rest Friday after serving among an elite all-Black fighter squad in World War II and shooting down two German fighter planes while escorting a damaged bomber to its base . A Tuskegee airman who shot down two German fighter planes while escorting a damaged bomber to its base now lies in Arlington National Cemetery after a burial with special honors. On the same day that retired Air Force Lt. Col. Luke Weathers Jr. took his resting place among other war and military heroes, his real-life story as a World War II aviator played out on movie screens across the country. Weathers was buried Friday in a service that began with a flyover of four F-16 jets in the Missing Man formation, a special honor reserved for pilots, by the 113th Wing of the D.C. Capital Guardians, the same unit that guards the airspace over the nation's capital. Weathers died Oct. 15 in Tucson, Ariz., of pneumonia at age 90. His burial coincided with the official opening in theaters of 'Red Tails,' a George Lucas-produced movie retelling the story of the Tuskegee Airmen who debunked widely held beliefs that black pilots were incapable of fighting in combat. Shortly after the flyover, in which one of the three jets departed from formation, a caisson pulled by six horses carried Weathers' body to his burial spot amid hundreds of the stark marble tombstones that cover the grounds of the national cemetery. An Air Force band accompanied the wagon, its drummer thumping a solemn beat as family followed on the chilly, overcast Friday morning. Family members wore red ties and scarves, as they had at Weathers' Memphis funeral, as a nod to the aviators who painted their aircrafts' tails red to set themselves apart. Luke Weathers III, 61, said his father and other black Americans who fought in World War II did so to prove they were men, 'and then they wanted their country to love them, but that didn't happen, either.' Friday's ceremony, however, finally delivered recognition of his father as a national hero, Weathers said. This kind of attention to the Tuskegee Airmen is what the elder Weathers wanted throughout his life, said his daughter, Trina Weathers Boyce. Weathers was not vain, but he wanted to . share the lessons of the airmen's courage in war, their struggles for . equality and their victory over a wartime enemy and over racism, she . said. History retold: The same day the retired Air Force pilot took his final resting place, his real-life story as a World War II aviator (two of those men shown right) played out on movie screens across the country in a George Lucas film (left) titled Red Tails . 'He would talk about his hard trials and tribulations to others, to children, because he never wanted us to feel like this (racism) is a reason we couldn't make it,' Weathers Boyce said in a telephone interview Thursday. 'He would tell us nothing good comes easy. He'd say there are going to be barriers ... and you can overcome them.' Before the Tuskegee Airmen were formed in 1941, black men were forbidden to fly for the U.S. military, even though they could be drafted. After years of struggle, the Army Air Corps began to allow African Americans to train for flight, albeit in still-segregated units. Special honors: A United States Air Force casket team carries the remains of Mr Weathers to his burial site at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington where he will rest among other war and military heroes . Many of the Tuskegee airmen, which included navigators, mechanics, medical personnel and others in support roles, trained from 1941 to 1949 at the Tuskegee Institute, which was founded by Booker T. Washington and was already home to an aeronautical engineering program. More than 900 Tuskegee Airmen were U.S. pilots, said Trent Dudley, an Air Force lieutenant colonel who is president of the East Coast Tuskegee Airmen Inc. chapter. An estimated 250 to 300 Tuskegee airmen are still alive. The exact number is not known because some have not registered with chapters. 'As with all the airmen, when we lose one of them, there is a chunk of history that goes with them,' Dudley said. Honored: Colonel Weathers, wrapped beneath the stars and stripes he flew to protect, was recognized in 2007 with a Congressional Gold Medal for his flight of P-51 and P-39 fighters in World War II as a Tuskegee airman . First in his class: With a drummer thumping their procession, six horses carried the honored Tuskegee airman who was apart of the first black aviators in U.S. military history and are among World War II's most respected fighter squadrons . National hero: A child looks on before him as Weathers is carried to his final resting place on a cold January morning . Leading by example: Mr Weathers is survived by five children who say their father took the lead in demonstrating no racial divide in his life as an elite pilot nor his family's with society . Defying social norms was already a family trait when Weathers was born in Grenada, Miss. At the time, the town's railroad track served as the economic dividing line. The relationship between Weather's mixed-race father and black mother defied that dividing line, which led Weathers' family to move to Memphis, where they worked in a grocery store. Years later, Weathers was studying biology at Lane College in Jackson, Tenn., when he stumbled on an article in an international newspaper about the Tuskegee Experiment, the federal government's name for the Army Air Corps training of African Americans, Weathers Boyce said. Memory: Jacqueline Weathers (center), the widow of the former Tuskegee airman held the arm of a family member while honoring her late husband whose first October service was held at a Catholic church in Memphis they had attended since the 1960s . Service: Air Force Col. Charles Cornelisse, right, presents a flag to Mrs Weathers, following a service that included a four F-16 flyover reserved for pilots and performed by the same unit that guards the airspace over the nation's capital . His mother turned to the prominent Memphis family she worked for and, with the help of the family's connections, Weathers was considered and eventually accepted into their program. He always talked about the maneuver that save his life, Weathers Boyce said. A skillful pilot, he was a target of the Germans. In one combat flight, German aircraft were pursuing him and firing. He was forced to dip down and make a few turns in his plane to keep from getting shot, she said. Pride and sadness: Friends and family of the former Tuskegee airman gather around his casket to pay their final respects . Respects: Friends and family of Mr Weathers listen to 'Taps' played in the former Tuskegee airman's honor . Weathers flew P-51 and P-39 fighters during his service from 1942 to 1945 and earned a Distinguished Flying Cross, according to the National Guard Bureau. He and other Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. After the war, Weathers went on to become the first African American air controller, run a coin-operated laundry, raise five children, open a flight school, provide vocational rehabilitation for veterans and write a book about his life story that has not yet been published, Weathers Boyce said. 'We are still educating people on the Tuskegee history,' Weathers said, 'because it's a big part of American history, not African American or black history, but American history.'","Burial coincided with the official opening in theaters of 'Red Tails' a George Lucas-produced movie .

Detectives believe tests on microscopic human traces on a hand towel in dead spy Gareth Williams' flat could identify his killer . Britain’s top policeman told MI6 last night that no one is above the law as he demanded unprecedented access in a bid to solve the murder of spy Gareth Williams. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said there was ‘nothing in law’ to stop police making secret agents give statements and forensic samples. The Scotland Yard chief said employees at MI6 and GCHQ could face mass voluntary DNA screening within weeks.

It has been claimed that MI6 and the government eavesdropping centre GCHQ, to which Williams was attached, have been working on a computer virus designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear programme.

One woman is not ready to give up the search for the remaining yachter who is still missing ten days after his boat crashed during a race. Niki Burgan has said that she will continue to look for the lone sailor who was on the 37-foot sailboat called the Aegean that crashed, leaving three of the four crewmembers dead. 'We're there to pick up the pieces when the other resource agencies have to call off,' she told NBC San Diego. The boat's skipper, Theo Mavromatis, 49, remains missing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragedy: This photo shows the Aegean with crew members at the start of their 125-mile race, before the devastating collision . The yacht was destroyed while racing from California to Mexico ended up on the rocky shore of an island just past the border. Initially believed to have crashed into another boat, GPS tracking devices shows that the boat likely hit rocks instead. Eric Lamb, who found the wreckage Saturday while on safety patrol, said debris strewn over 2 square miles looked as if the boat had ‘gone through a blender,’ with some of it a quarter-mile from the shore. The San Diego County medical examiner said Kevin Eric Rudolph, 53, of Manhattan Beach and William Reed Johnson Jr., 57, of Torrance, both died from blunt force injuries. Rudolph's injuries were to his head and neck. Rescuer: Niki Burgan is going to continue the search, with the help of her rescue dog . Search: In this image taken from U.S. Coast Guard video, a rescuer retrieves a piece of debris from the ocean off the Baja California, Mexico coast near Ensenada on Sunday, April 29, 2012 . Joseph Lester Stewart, 64, of Bradenton, Fla., drowned, but head injuries contributed to his death. The boat's skipper, Theo Mavromatis, 49, remains missing. The coroner's report listed all three deaths as accidents but did not say what could have caused the wreck. Troy Sears, an experienced sailor who owns the San Diego-based charter company Next Level Sailing, said the GPS chart ‘gives an important clue if not verification of what happened to the vessel.’ ‘It looked like they plotted a course for Ensenada and North Coronado Island was directly in the way.’ Debris: A white seat cushion is seen on a white tarp covering wreckage recovered from a yacht that collided with a larger vessel, on a boat used for a rescue search, seen moored with other boats in Ensenada on Sunday . Participants: Yachters and others view lists of race winners posted outside a hotel in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, yesterday . Sears, who visited the part of the island where the GPS tracking ended, said it was unlikely that the device fell off the boat because the chart shows a steady speed and straight course. ‘That section of North Coronado Island is near vertical and it would be like hitting a wall. There's no beach to stop or slow a vessel, so a vessel would make contact with a near-vertical wall,’ he said. The deaths were the race's first fatalities in its 65 years and came two weeks after five sailors were killed in the waters off Northern California when their 38-foot yacht was hit by powerful waves and ran aground on a rocky island. Race: The route cose from Newport, California, to Ensenada, Mexico. Other yachts near the Coronado Islands in Mexico reported seeing debris Saturday morning . The family of the one missing sailor has reached out the Ms Burgan, thanking her for continuing her search. She knows their pain, having lost her parents and sister when they died when a plane they were on crashed in the ocean. She has since founded SoCal H20 Rescue Team.

Controversial: An article written by Rod Liddle, pictured, called defendants Gary Dobson and David Norris 'disgusting racists' during the Old Bailey trial . A magazine is being prosecuted for potentially putting the Stephen Lawrence trial in danger of collapse. The Spectator is accused of breaching a court order preventing prejudicial material being published before jurors reached verdicts. An article written by Rod Liddle called defendants Gary Dobson and David Norris 'disgusting racists' during the Old Bailey trial. Mr Justice Treacy said the Spectator article titled 'A Vindictive Charade' breached three specific sections of the contempt order placed on the case by the Lord Chief Justice in the appeal court, and continued at the trial. He referred the magazine to the Attorney General for contempt of court in November. The judge also banned the jury from reading that week’s Spectator, even if they were a subscriber and it had dropped through their letterbox. Liddle wrote that Dobson and Norris were part of a bigger group of suspects who had been named in the press, including Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight. He also said that Norris had a father who was a major criminal. The Spectator took down the article from its website that afternoon. The Crown Prosecution Service announced today that the magazine would be prosecuted for breaching a court order. CPS London chief prosecutor Alison Saunders said the publisher of the magazine had been summonsed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on June 7. Prosecution: Liddle wrote that Dobson, left, and Norris, right, were part of a bigger group of suspects who had been named in the press . However, Neville Lawrence has criticised the decision to prosecute the magazine for . jeopardising his son's murder trial as 'a slap on the wrist'. The Spectator said it would admit the offence and faces a fine of up to £5,000. But Mr Lawrence said it should have been dealt with under contempt of . court legislation, which could have seen the publisher jailed or face an . unlimited fine. Mr Lawrence said: 'I am very disappointed by this outcome and think the charge should have been for a more serious offence. 'The article was published at a critical time at the start of the case . when it was clear that any press comments could cause the trial to . collapse. 'I understand that the maximum fine is £5,000, which is little more than a slap on the wrist for a magazine like The Spectator.' Not happy: Neville Lawrence, right, has criticised the decision to prosecute the magazine for jeopardising his son's murder trial as 'a slap on the wrist'. The murdered teenager is pictured left . Jocelyn Cockburn, acting for Mr Lawrence, added: 'It was open to the . Attorney General to go for a more serious contempt of court charge. 'His decision not to refer this charge to the CPS was based on his . judgment that the course of justice was not seriously impeded or . prejudiced by the article. 'This article came out at the worst possible time, particularly for my client, who had already witnessed one aborted trial. 'It was a cruel and reprehensible act by this magazine which does merit a more serious punishment than a minuscule fine.' Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, said the magazine would admit the offence. He said: 'We apologised in court . for this article in November, and accept that it transgressed the . reporting restrictions then in place. 'The judge accepted our apology and we will not be contesting the CPS's decision.' In the article, Liddle said the judge had asked jurors to approach the case with a clean slate. Legal action: The publisher of The Spectator has been summonsed to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court, pictured, on June 7 . He . added: 'That is, not be inclined to prejudge the issue as a consequence . of having been assured, repeatedly, for the last 12 years, by the . entire press, that the men accused are disgusting racist bastards and . definitely guilty. 'Judge . Treacy might as well have told the jurors that they must approach the . case ‘by eating 15 Jacobs cream crackers, without any water or other . emolument, inside one minute’. The case is a charade, and a vindictive . charade at that.' The Crown Prosecution Service today informed the publishers of The Spectator of its decision to charge them with an offence under Section 83 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Ms Saunders said: 'On 24 November 2011 the Attorney General referred an article published in The Spectator magazine to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration of whether a reporting restrictions Order in place at the time had been breached. 'Due to the intense media interest in this case an Order under Section 82 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 prohibiting publication of certain assertions about the defendants was in place. 'This Order was imposed by the Court of Appeal on 18 May 2011 and was continued at the commencement of the trial on 14 November 2011. 'Having applied the full code test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors I have taken the decision that there is a realistic prospect of conviction. 'The Attorney General has determined that it is in the public interest to proceed and he has given his consent to this prosecution. 'Where a charge is brought under Section 83 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the publication is a newspaper or periodical, the proprietor, editor or publisher may be liable for the offence, and not the author.' A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The Attorney did consider the article in terms of the strict liability rule under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, but concluded that the matter was best dealt with in relation to the order under section 82, given the particular reporting.'","It is accused of breaching a .

One of the UK’s most wanted men, who left a hand grenade outside the home of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, was arrested in Amsterdam today, nine months after he broke free from a prison van. Kirk Bradley was wearing flip-flops, shorts and a T-shirt when officers raided his luxury apartment in the Bijlmer region of Amsterdam, the Serious Organised Crime Agency said today. He is expected to face an extradition hearing in the Dutch capital later today, the agency said. Search over: Kirk Bradley has been arrested at a flat in Amsterdam following a nine-month international search . An international search had been going on for months since Bradley escaped the van with Anthony Downes while en route for trial. Downes was also arrested in Holland and is fighting extradition proceedings after both were convicted in their absence earlier this year. Both were found guilty of firearms offences after a series of shootings and leaving a hand grenade at the home of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish. Ian Milne, head of European operations for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, said the capture shows there is no such place as a safe haven, adding that Bradley was shocked as officers burst through his door as he had no idea the agency was on to him. 'Blood brother': Anthony Downes who was also arrested in Holland after escaping the police van with Bradley . ‘Joint working with Merseyside Police and the Amsterdam police has led to the capture of these two violent and dangerous individuals,’ Mr Milne added. ‘They are now back behind bars where they belong. This shows that criminals who flee to other countries are not beyond our reach.’ Last month, both Bradley and Downes, both 26, were sentenced to a minimum of 22 years after being convicted at Woolwich Crown Court. Bradley was convicted in his absence. Detective Superintendent Richie Davies, of Merseyside Police, hailed the ‘excellent arrest’. He said: ‘The capture of Bradley, and Downes before him, underlines Merseyside Police’s commitment to work with other authorities to ensure that serious criminals have no place to hide. ‘The sentence handed down to Bradley highlights the real risk that he posed to the people of Merseyside and beyond. We will act on all information provided to take dangerous criminals from our streets, which we cannot do without the assistance of the community.’ Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran a criminal network between 2009 and 2010. Three gang members who worked for them admitted possessing firearms and causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life and were jailed in March. Gary Wilson, 27, of Promenade in Southport, was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years; Joseph Farrell, 23, of Brandearth Hey in Stockbridge Village, Knowsley, will serve a minimum of 12 years, and Craig Riley, 25, of Boode Croft, also in Stockbridge Village, will serve a minimum of 14 years. The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld. Jail break: The police van, pictured, was held up by armed and masked men, who fled with two of the prisoners inside . Close call: The grenade was left on Mr . Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not the five-time . European cup winner’s manager, but it was not intended for him . Menace: An Uzi sub machine gun and silencer left by the gang following a shooting . The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not Liverpool’s manager, but it was not intended for him. Bradley’s uncle Raymond, from Woolton, was arrested in central Amsterdam for possession of cocaine with intent to supply, the Merseyside force added. A specialist arrest team from the Amsterdam police arrested Bradley on a British-issued European arrest warrant. Arno Julsing, chief of detectives for the Amsterdam police, said: ‘What a successful arrest. ‘The collaboration with our British colleagues has so far been fantastic. Together we have managed to apprehend many dozens of dangerous criminals in the last couple of years. ‘Our approach works and we have found that the number of fugitives hiding in Amsterdam is decreasing. 'Our message ""Amsterdam is not the place to be"" has apparently been heard. Those who still don’t get it will be traced, arrested and handed over to the British authorities.’","Kirk Bradley fled a prison van in Manchester on the way to trial .

Jilted: Ahla Arbid admitted sending emails to airport authorities claiming her ex-lover's new wife was carrying explosives from Iran to the UK . A jilted lover is facing jail after she tried to convince airport authorities her ex-boyfriend's new bride was carrying a bomb aboard a passenger jet. Ahla Arbid, 34, claimed that Hossain Ansari Pour, a former BBC journalist, was part of a terrorist plot to kill hundreds aboard an international flight. She told airport security that his new wife, Sara Aryan Pour, was smuggling explosives as she travelled from Iran via Turkey to the UK. The bogus warning sparked a major . security alert. Ms Aryan Pour was seized from her plane as it waited on . the tarmac in Istanbul and searched, but no explosives were found. Arbid, a mother of two, had been due to face a retrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict in her original trial. But instead she pleaded guilty to one charge of communicating false information with intent. At her first trial in August 2011 Southwark Crown Court heard Arbid made the hoax bomb warning to get back at Mr Hossain Pour after learning of his arranged marriage to Ms Aryan Pour. Arbid confessed to sending the emails to airport authorities, but she claimed that her fears had been genuine. Jurors heard Arbid and Mr Ansari Pour, who now works for Rupert Murdoch’s Dow Jones newswire, had met on an Islamic dating website and entered into a ‘temporary marriage’ in early 2010. Mr Ansari Pour said he had already been taken his wedding vows twice, once in a ‘full’ Islamic marriage, from which he has an 11-year-old daughter, and in a previous ‘temporary’ marriage, which under Iranian law allows legal sexual relationships on a less formal basis. He said that when he started seeing Arbid, he had told her that his parents were looking for a wife for him in a traditional arranged marriage. He said: ‘Even on the first day that I met Ahla, I did tell her my parents were looking for a wife for me.’ The court heard that the couple entered into a sexual relationship, and that Arbid later told the journalist she was pregnant by him, subsequently having an abortion. Mr Ansari Pour’s parents found him a bride in Iran, and although he was still engaged in his ‘temporary marriage’ to Arbid, he flew to his homeland for a religious wedding ceremony. He then arranged for his new wife, Sara Aryan Pour, to come to Britain, booking her a flight to London via Turkey on 2 May last year. After she discovered what was happening, Arbid contacted both the British Airports Authority and the authorities in Turkey to tell them that Miss Aryan Pour was carrying an ‘explosive substance’ to give to her husband in London. Giving evidence Arbid denied that she had made the bomb threat to hit back at Mr Ansari Pour. She told jurors she grew suspicious of him after she overheard him say in a series of phone conversations the ‘flight will fall’ and talk of ‘documents’, which she believed was a coded reference for explosive materials. Arbid said she believed Miss Aryan Pour was going to meet a man by the name of Suleman Mohammed at Ataturk Istanbul airport to exchange the bomb parts. She said: ‘I thought maybe they were planning for something; that he would meet her and they would do bomb building to make the flight fall.’ She claimed Hossain held ‘extreme’ views on religion and politics and felt duty bound to report her suspicions. Arbid, of Pimlico, south-west London, admitted communicating false information with intent. She was remanded on bail ahead of sentence on April 19.","Ahla Arbid claimed her ex-boyfriend, a former BBC journalist, was part of terrorist plot to kill hundreds .

A woman juror who abandoned a four-week robbery trial to jet off on holiday to Malta was jailed last night for 56 days for contempt of court. Janet Chapman, 51, said she thought it would fine to travel abroad for a week because her doctor had signed her off work due to a bad back. The next day she phoned the court and left a telephone message saying: ‘Hello, this is Janet Chapman.... I won’t be attending court for a period of up to two weeks. 'I have got to return to the doctor’s next Tuesday. I have got sciatica. Thankyou. Bye.’ She then flew off to enjoy some winter sun on a £669 week-long holiday in Malta with her long-time partner Raymond Pritchard. But she had a nasty surprise when she touched down at Liverpool Airport as a welcoming party of police officers was waiting to arrest her. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘It is clear you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure. ‘Your assertion that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous. ‘I am satisfied that if you really . suffered back pain of such severity that that you could not continue . your jury service you would not have been able to endure the travel to . Malta. ‘I am driven to the . conclusion that you pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem . in order that you could take a holiday in Malta.’ Busted: Chapman was caught after an official at Preston Crown court noticed she had called from a foreign number . Preston Crown Court heard potential jurors were told to indicate if they had a holiday or hospital admission which would leave them unable to sit on a serious robbery trial. At the start of the trial of robbery suspect Raymond Mallen, Chapman did not notify the court why she should not be part of the jury. He was accused of being part of an organised gang which carried out a . series of high value cash-in-transit robberies across the North West of . England. Evidence had been . heard and Judge Stuart Baker was about to begin summing up when Chapman . phoned the courts and left her message. Yesterday . she told the court the holiday last month had been a birthday surprise . from her partner and she had only learned about the trip the night . before they flew out. Chapman, a deputy manager at a children’s residential home, said that having suffered a back injury and been signed off sick from work she didn’t think she would have to attend the trial. She said: ‘On the Monday morning I couldn’t get out of bed. I went to the doctor that night. I was signed off for a week. I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong.’ Surprise: Chapman's partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he had booked the £669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before . Her partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he booked the £669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before. Judge Russell said it had been a serious contempt of court. He said: ‘You have manifestly failed to perform your public duty. Further, it is clear that you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure, namely taking a holiday in Malta.’ The case carried on and Mallen was convicted of conspiracy to rob and jailed 12 years. Various gang members have now been jailed for a total of more than 80 years in all. Last night Mr Pritchard choked back tears at his semi-detached property on the outskirts of Blackpool and said the mistake would cost them dear.. He said: ‘Obviously we did not know what the consequences would be. I have never stepped into a court of any kind until today. This could well lose my wife her job.

A 31-year-old man faces capital murder and molestation charges after he allegedly stabbed his nine-year-old stepdaughter to death to cover up months of sexual abuse. Prosecutors claim Jacinto Zuniga Trujillo, from Long Beach, Los Angeles, stabbed the girl as he feared she would reveal he had been sexually abusing her since November. The body of the girl - identified in court papers as Xiomara Fernandez -  was found in the parking lot of Los Altos United Methodist Church on Saturday at about 11 a.m., according to the LA Times. Victim: Prosecutors said nine-year-old Xiomara Fernandez, pictured, was murdered and dumped in a parking lot by her stepfather to cover up years of alleged abuse . 'Killer': The child's stepfather Jacinto Zuniga Trujillo allegedly stabbed her before stabbing himself . She was in a pool of blood and had been stabbed several times on her upper body. Trujillo's body was found close by with a number of self-inflicted stab wounds. It is believed he tried to commit suicide. He was taken to hospital for treatment but survived and was immediately taken into custody on suspicion of murder. Words and letters written in blood . on the side of a grey container near to where the girl's body was found. Investigators are considering the scrawls as evidence in the . case. While authorities have not revealed . what the words say, the large letters are clearly visible in footage . from the scene and may contain expletives. Scene: Trujillo was found nearby with self-inflicted stab wounds, but had survived . Sick: Letters and words were written in blood on the side of a container where the girl's body was found . The girl's body was found by passerby Nancy Eomurian, who told NBC she then saw the man get up off the pavement and start to walk away. Killed: Although Trujillo was not Xiomara's biological father, he had raised her since she was a baby . 'He had actually gotten up and started to leave, but he had blood on him,' Mrs Eomurian said. Though he was not Xiomara's biological father, Trujillo had raised her since she was a few months old and was the only father she ever knew, her family told the Long Beach Press-Telegram. Her mother, Graciela Fernandez, said she never saw any signs of physical or psychological abuse in her daughter. She described Xiomara as happy and talkative - and a daddy's girl. Fernandez has five other children, aged eighteen months to 21. Trujillo, who is unemployed, is the biological father of the two youngest children. One of Fernandez's daughters said Xiomara was devoted to her father. 'All he had to do was get mad at her, and she would cry,' Alma said. 'My mother would get mad and nothing. But if he got a little upset, she would be in tears.' She added of the alleged abuse carried out against her little sister: 'Maybe she was too young, she didn't know how to tell us.' Trujillo has been charged with five counts of . oral copulation and sexual penetration with a child under the age of ten . involving the victim. Mourning: Xiomara's mother Graciela Fernandez said she never saw any signs of abuse in her daughter . Witness: Nancy Eomurian found the girl's body and saw the stabbed man get up and walk away . The District Attorney's Office filed a . special circumstances murder charge - as the girl was killed because . she was a witness to a crime - which would allow it to seek the . death penalty in the case. The criminal complaint claims the . sexual assaults occurred between November 1, 2011 and April 28 - the day . the girl's lifeless body was found. Trujillo has yet to enter a plea in the case but made a brief appearance in Long Beach Superior Court earlier this week. Trujillo is being held without bail at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles. He will appear at Los Angeles County Superior Court on May 22. Graciela Fernandez and her family are struggling to raise $15,000 for the funeral arrangements and are holding . fundraisers to cover the costs.","Body of Xiomara Fernandez found by passerby in church parking lot .

The 2010 discovery of the ship, believed to have sunk in the 1840s, also included the world's oldest champagne considered drinkable, which has since been auctioned off. Rare find: One of the bottles of beer found in the 1840s shipwreck - researchers say they may be able to recreate beer after finding living bacteria inside . During the summer of 2010 divers discovered unique bottles of champagne in a shipwreck in the Åland archipelago.

The bottle of shipwrecked Veuve Clicquot sold for $43,630, surpassing the world auction record. Researchers analysed two bottles of . beer, which they admitted 'had not stood the test of time well' but . retained a pale golden colour and could originally have had hints of . rose, almond and cloves. 'Based on the chemical analysis we . made of the beer and with help from a master brewer it would be possible . to try to make beer that would resemble it as much as possible,' Annika .

Don't waste time with frivolous calls: Foreign Secretary William Hague's plea to tourists and ex-pats . British nationals are wasting embassy time with 'ludicrous' inquiries about lost false teeth, runny jam and plastic surgery problems, William Hague said today. The Foreign Secretary urged expats and tourists not to stretch scarce consular resources by making 'bizarre demands'. Among the calls logged by overseas Foreign Office staff are requests for help erecting a chicken coop, advice on where to have Christmas lunch in Spain and a plea for assistance translating 'I love you' into Hungarian. Mr Hague said: 'It is not our job, for example, to book you restaurants while you are on holiday. 'This is obvious, you may think. But nonetheless it came as a surprise to the caller in Spain who was having difficulty finding somewhere to have Christmas lunch. 'If, like a man in Florida last year, you find ants in your holiday rental, we are not the people to ask for pest control advice. 'If you are having difficulty erecting a new chicken coop in your garden in Greece as someone else was, I am afraid that we cannot help you.' Mr Hague then listed a dozen other issues that had confronted Foreign Office staff when they answered the phone. 'Equally, I have to say that we are not the people to turn to if: . - you can’t find your false teeth, . - if your Sat Nav is broken and you need directions, . - if you are unhappy with your plastic surgery, . - if your jam won’t set, . - if you are looking for a dog-minder while you are on holiday, . - if your livestock need checking on, . - if you would like advice about the weather, . - or if you want someone to throw a coin into the Trevi fountain for you because you forgot while you were on holiday and you want your marriage to succeed. 'And our commitment to good relations with our neighbours does not, I am afraid, extend to translating ‘I love you’ into Hungarian, as we were asked to do by one love-struck British tourist. 'There are easier ways to find a translation.' Holiday-makers in Girona, Spain: If you have an emergency, phone the Foreign Office. If you don't, then leave them alone! In the speech on strengthening Britain’s consular diplomacy, Mr Hague said Britons make more than 55 million individual trips overseas every year and around six million live abroad for some of or all of the time. Around one in ten murders of Britons in the last two years took place overseas and around 6,000 nationals are arrested every year. Mr Hague said the figures showed the 'immense demand' for the service. He added: 'We ask British nationals to be responsible, to be self-reliant and to take sensible precautions.'",My Sat Nav is broken! I can't find my false teeth! Where can I get hold of a dog-minder?

Tory Cabinet ministers warned Liberal Democrat colleagues yesterday that gay marriage and Lords reform cannot be priorities, amid growing signs that senior Coalition partners are flexing their muscles in the wake of poor local election results. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond - increasingly tipped as a future Chancellor - became the most senior member of the Government to suggest plans to allow gay couples to marry should be shelved. And he echoed David Cameron’s warning last week that the Coalition must not become ‘bogged down’ on House of Lords reform, saying it should only proceed if legislation can go through Parliament relatively easily. Bigger priorities: Both Philip Hammond and Baroness Warsi have called on the Government to 'prioritise' Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi also said Lords reform was not a priority, saying not one voter had raised the issue on the doorstep with her in the last six months. Mr Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme that proposals to legalise gay marriage should be delayed to ensure ministers focus on ‘the things that matter’. He said: ‘Clearly it’s not the number one priority. If you stop people in the street and ask them what their concerns are, they’ll talk to you about jobs and economic growth, they’ll talk to you about the level of the wages they’re earning, wanting to see real growth in wages again. ‘The government has got to show over the next couple of years that it is focused on the things that matter to the people in this country - not just the short-term things but the long-term things as well: the reform of our education system, changing the welfare system - which is like turning around a super-tanker - changing the welfare system so that work always pays and people have an incentive to work.’ Opposed: Tim Loughton, the children's minister, wrote to a constituent to say he was opposed to gay marriage . Mr Hammond’s comments came after Tim . Loughton, the children’s minister, wrote to a constituent to say he was . opposed to gay marriage. ‘Marriage as a religious institution cannot be anything other than between a man and a woman. 'I do not see why we need to change the law, especially at this time when there are so many other important matters for the government to be addressing,’ Mr Loughton wrote. A poll yesterday showed strong support for gay marriage among women, with 53 per cent supporting it and 30 per cent opposed. The gap is narrower among men, though they still back the idea by 48 per cent to 39 per cent. The issue divides the generations, however, with over 60s more likely to be opposed. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday gave his backing to gay marriage, urging colleagues not to get themselves ‘hot under the collar’. ‘We’re still out to consultation. It was never intended that we would legislate this year,’ Mr Pickles told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme. ‘It just seems to me to be a question of good manners and if you’ve got something like civil partnership, which are for all practical purposes a marriage, let’s drop the hypocrisy and go all the way.’ Mr Cameron recently said: ‘I ask myself the question, ‘why is it that we deny gay couples the ability to get married?’ And, I don’t think that’s right. ‘Obviously this is a controversial issue. I feel the time for change has come. If you ask, particularly young people, they say this feels like a very natural change to make. We are not changing what happens in church.’ Voters have until next month  to submit their views on the gay marriage proposals, championed by Lib Dem equalities minister Lynne Featherstone and backed by Mr Cameron.","Baroness Warsi says Lords reform should be pushed down the priority list as voters weren't interested .

Guilty: Laura Johnson is facing a lengthy jail term after being convicted of burglary and handling stolen goods . A Metropolitan Police detective is under investigation for allegedly sending an 'inappropriate text' to the daughter of a millionaire midway through her trial for looting during the London riots. Detective Constable James Quigley is said to have sent former grammar school prefect Laura Johnson the message when he completed his evidence for the prosecution. She was yesterday facing a lengthy jail term after being convicted of acting as a chauffeur for a drug-dealing gangster and his friends as they pillaged electrical goods during a seven-hour crime spree. The matter was raised in the absence of the jury after Johnson, who was due to give evidence, reported it to her barrister Martin McCarthy. The communication is not believed to contain anything sexual. But the officer could be held in contempt of court over the allegations he contacted the 20-year-old, a fellow witness in a trial. Detective Constable Quigley, an expert on gangs in South London, became involved in the case when the Johnson family complained to police about alleged media intrusion. He visited them at their home in Orpington, Kent, after the Johnsons reported fearing for their safety. Young love: Laura Johnson at school with her first boyfriend, Rebyn Buleti . This was after pictures of their home were broadcast in the news and they were concerned this could tip-off south London gangs about where they lived. The matter of the inappropriate text has been passed to the Met's internal disciplinary body the Directorate of Professional Standards. A Met Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm a 38-year-old male officer, from Bromley, has been placed on restricted duties, pending the outcome of an internal investigation, following allegations of inappropriate behaviour.' Johnson was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods after the two-week trial at Inner London Crown Court. The maximum sentence for handling is 14 years. She was acquitted of stealing cigarettes from a BP garage. Jurors heard how Johnson became friends with convicted crack dealer and thief Emmanuel Okubote after being introduced to him through a mutual friend. Concern: The detective constable facing the allegations visited the Johnson family at their home in Orpington, Kent, after they reported fearing for their safety . On the evening of 8 August, as riots erupted across the capital, she drove to Okubote's house initially to drop off a phone charger. But she ended up chauffeuring him, 18-year-old Alexander Elliott-Joahill and an unnamed 17-year-old on a looting spree. With Johnson at the steering wheel, the gang of thieves jumped out and either looted stores or robbed passers-by at knifepoint. The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was also convicted of burglary. Trial judge Patricia Lees warned the pair that they faced a custodial sentence, adding: 'You have both been convicted of serious offences.' During her testimony, Johnson claimed that she had felt powerless to stop the gang, who she said had jumped into her car wearing hooded tops and balaclavas before ordering her to drive. She will be sentenced on 3 May.","Officer, 38, on restricted duties while internal investigation is carried out .

Mystery: Despite two post mortem examinations, the cause of Lily Channon's death is still not known . A couple have been left heartbroken after their six-year-old daughter suddenly collapsed and died of a mystery illness. Mark Channon and his partner Kelly Mullett assumed their only child Lily had caught a common cold when she came home from a party feeling unwell. But just four days later her condition worsened and she was rushed to hospital where she later died. Despite two post mortem examinations, the cause of Lily Channon’s death is still not known. Mark, 50, and Kelly, 40, say not knowing has made coping with the tragedy much harder. Speaking from their home in Gosport, Hampshire, Mark said: 'What caused Lily’s death is still a mystery. Not knowing makes everything so much worse. 'It has left a void in my heart that has broken me. I can’t understand why this has happened.' Lily first showed signs of being unwell on Saturday, March 3, after coming home from a birthday party at a local play centre. Mark and Kelly assumed she was suffering with a cold that had been passing around her friends and kept her home from school. But on Wednesday, Lily’s temperature dropped dramatically and her pulse weakened. Mark, a Ministry of Defence guard, said: 'We thought Lily had a cold. It didn’t seem like anything drastic, there was no cause for concern. 'But after four days she got worse. She said her chest and stomach hurt and she got very cold. She looked like the blood had drained from her.

'She woke up but when we got her out she was sick and became unresponsive. Her pulse was so weak I couldn’t feel it on her wrist.' The paramedics were called and she was taken to nearby Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth where she put on a ventilator and given a saline drip. Mark and Kelly hoped their daughter was improving but after several hours she stopped breathing and doctors fought to resuscitate her. Answers: Mark and Kelly hope they will finally . find out the cause of their daughter’s death at her inquest, due to take . place in three months . Mark said: 'Kelly and I were sitting in the family room when a doctor rushed in to tell us Lily was extremely ill. 'To me it seemed like a dream, that it wasn’t real. 'We ran to her room and there must have been about 25 doctors and nurses working on her. They seemed to be trying everything. 'At one point her heart beat picked up again but then it went flat and it never came back.' He added: 'Kelly and I are finding it very difficult to come to terms with what has happened. 'We have good and bad days and there are tears but we are trying to be strong for each other.' Lily’s funeral is being held today at St Thomas the Apostle Church in Gosport. Mark and Kelly hope they will finally find out the cause of their daughter’s death at her inquest, due to take place in three months. Kelly added: 'It kills us not knowing how our happy, lively six-year-old could could be wiped out in four days after having what looked like a common cold. 'She has left a gaping hole in our lives.

'She was unaware that she had entered restricted air space,’ local deputy police chief Ray Cordell said. ‘“Surprised” was probably the right term. Return to land: Ms Rose had taken off from the tiny Mill Rose Farm Airport, which is a green landing field (centre) in the middle of an Illinois residential area . ‘We do not have fighter jets flying over the village very often.’ The town is home to about 4,500 residents and is 30 miles from Chicago.

It has survived the strife of two world wars, including a bombing attack from a German Zeppelin, and the attention of rioting Luddites in the early 19th century. Yet this grand horse chestnut tree is now facing perhaps the toughest test in its 200-year history - at the hands of property developers. Taylor Wimpey wants to chop it down and build 74 homes on the site in Helmshore, Lancashire, where the 52-feet tall tree, has stood for two centuries, but residents are determined to save it. As these old photographs show, the tree has been a constant feature of the village, not to mention a popular spot for youngsters to collect conkers in days gone by. Iconic: This photograph, taken at the time of the celebrations marking the coronation of King George V in 1911, shows the horse chestnut tree in the background . Uncertain future: The tree as it appears today, with a sign giving details about the the forthcoming development in the foreground . Residents were so incensed when they learned that the tree was to go that they have previously physically blocked workmen from cutting it down. They have also contacted the local authority and set up a Facebook group calling for the tree to be saved. More than 1,000 people have joined this online group and villagers are demanding that developers work with them to protect the important village landmark. Ann Hodgkiss, 49, an administration officer said: 'This is the only horse chestnut tree there in that vicinity. 'People say it’s only a tree, but it’s been there for up to 200 years. It’s part of the village, you don’t just go chopping this trees down. 'When this is in bloom it’s fantastic, it’s absolutely gorgeous. It’s almost a piece of outstanding natural beauty. 'All the kids collect conkers there, somebody built a tree house there as a kid. It’s part of Helmshore Village.' She continued: 'It’s been there for years. Staff would come out and have their lunch on the benches and the kids would go and sit by the river and have picnics. 'What can we do? We just feel that it doesn’t matter what we do it will happen regardless so we’ll just keep banging on and rattling on and hopefully one person will say yes we can save this.' Bygone era: The horse chestnut tree, circled, in 1905. More than 100 years on, it is facing the axe at the hands of a property developer . Lucky escape: The tree pictured during the floods which struck Helmshore, Lancashire, in July 1964 . Developer Taylor Wimpey was originally refused planning permission by Rossendale Borough Council to chop down the tree after objections by locals. But they successfully appealed to the Planning Inspectorate in March and were given the go ahead to build houses and apartments on the site with parking. The land is currently being prepared by another company who have already begun felling trees. But after realising that their beloved horse chestnut was one of the trees earmarked to be felled, locals spurred into action. Garage workers spotted workmen about to chop down the tree last week and stepped in to prevent them, as it was subject to a Tree Preservation Order, although this has been superceded by the planning application. Locals have since banded together to organise petitions and gather support on a social networking site to lobby the developers to reconsider. Ann, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said: 'This development is horrific and it’s caused an outcry in Helmshore. 'Once they said that about the site we thought it’s progress, fair enough, we’ll move on, but when they said about the tree we were like hang on a minute. 'For years people have tried to stop the old buildings being knocked down and this is just the final straw now. 'The site is going ahead, we can’t stop it, the main thing is this poor tree now. 'It’s a fabulous one, it’s massive. 'I think the canopy spreads over 8m. 'They said it’s diseased but it’s never done any harm. 'They have said a branch fell off but it was struck by lightning and it took the environmental agency a long time to remove it from the river. 'They’ve said if it’s diseased they will cut it down and replace the tree with another in a different location which makes me feel that they don’t want it in that location. 'We think the least they could do is keep the tree where it is, and, if it’s diseased, treat it. 'To me, nobody has looked at whether they can treat this disease or not and whether we can try and save it. 'It’s just coming into full bloom now and if it’s that diseased why is it still living? 'We understand if it’s diseased and going to die, fair enough, but I think it’s not a good idea to chop it down.' Battleground: Ann Hodgkiss and residents of Helmshore, Lancashire, are united in their opposition to the horse chestnut tree being felled . The tree survived the 'power-loom' riots of 1826 when hand loom workers angry at the introduction of new machinery in the village smashed up 108 looms in three days of rioting at a mill next to the tree. The village then narrowly escaped disaster in September 1916 when a German military Zeppelin flew over on a bombing mission along the railway and bombs devastated the neighbouring villages. Local Tory MP Jake Berry said: 'This historic tree should remain a part of the history of our village and should remain in situ. 'I will do all I can to ensure that the wishes of local residents are taken into account as part of this development and that we continue to enjoy this tree for many years to come.' A spokesman for Taylor Wimpey said: 'An independent tree survey was carried out, and consequently some trees, which were diseased with numerous splits and open wounds were consequently found unsafe and have been felled. 'This particular tree was deemed unsafe, however, in light of public concerns Taylor Wimpey has suggested to the local authority that there is a further independent survey on this particular tree. 'Until the report is completed no decision will be made on whether the tree should be felled or not. 'Taylor Wimpey is keen to stress that they take public concerns very seriously, hence the further report on this tree. 'The local authority is happy with Taylor Wimpey’s approach on this matter.' A council spokesman said: 'The tree survey identified that the mature horse chestnut was in very poor condition with evidence of decay deep inside the base of the tree on the eastern side, and other evidence of decay throughout major limbs in the lower canopy including splits in lower limbs and numerous open wounds. 'The council recognizes the passion and importance that local residents feel about the tree and we have contacted the developer to see if anything can be done. 'However, this decision in relation to the erection of the houses and the tree, was not made by Rossendale Borough Council. 'We understand the developer is talking to local residents about the future of the tree.'",Taylor Wimpey wants to build 74 homes nearby .

'Abhorrent': Christopher Blackburn lived with his father's corpse for nearly five months while claiming £2,000 of his benefit payments . A man left his father's dead body in bed for nearly five months so he could claim his benefit payments - even telling his innocent 10-year-old daughter that her grandfather was just asleep. Christopher Blackburn was jailed for three years after police found the body of his father Guy, 54, on a bed in the living room of his home in Penwortham, Lancashire. The macabre discovery was made after neighbours raised concerns when they did not see the elder Mr Blackburn for five months. Blackburn had been living at the house alongside the body but kept quiet about his father's death as he pocketed nearly £2,000. The 29-year-old, now of Birkby, Huddersfield, admitted preventing a lawful and decent burial of a dead body between October 31, 2010 and March 22 last year. He also pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to theft after collecting £1,869 of his father's income support payments from the post office. Sentencing him at Preston Crown Court, Recorder Judge Anthony Russell said: 'Such offending is abhorrent to all decent-minded people who will be disgusted by your behaviour. 'It was callous and offensive to his [Guy Blackburn's] friends and family who no doubt have been caused considerable distress by these circumstances. 'It also seems to me that you were motivated in part by greed.' Blackburn falsely told police he had spoken to his father since November 2010 and had had a drink with him at Christmas. Concerns: Police found the body of Guy Blackburn, 54, on a bed in the living room of his home in Penwortham, Lancashire . An inquest last February was told Mr Blackburn had a long history of poor . health, including heart attacks and strokes, and had been in ‘extremely . emaciated’ with a protruding rib cage and long fingernails. He had lived in the house for 26 years . but his health had deteriorated due to heavy drinking and smoking . and he was largely confined to his bed after returning from a spell in . hospital. Distressing: Christopher Blackburn even lied to his 10-year-old daughter and told her her grandfather was asleep . His dead body was found last March after neighbours became concerned for his welfare, having not seen him since the previous October. The neighbours contacted Eaves Brook . Housing Association, and police then visited the house, where they found . Mr Blackburn’s partially mummified body on a bed in the front room. A post mortem examination revealed he had died of coronary artery atheroma, with no evidence his death could have been suspicious. A verdict of death by natural causes was recorded. Judge Russell told Blackburn: 'You pretended he was still alive, misleading others - particularly your own daughter, a little girl. 'You have shown little remorse for your offending. 'A decent person would have immediately admitted to the police that this poor man had died months before but you tried to pretend he had been dead for only days.' Det Insp Marc Nasser of Lancashire Police said: 'This is an unusual case and it is the first of its type that we have . dealt with in Lancashire. 'It was a challenging crime and one that most members of the community . will have found appalling and I am pleased that Blackburn has now been . punished for what he did.' One neighbour said: 'I had always got on with Guy, he was a nice bloke, . but I had not seen him for ages. I kept asking his son if he was OK, . and he would say ""yes"". 'We thought his son was looking after him, I was constantly saying ""Is . your dad alright?"" and obviously he was not. It is not nice, it has . upset me.'

An amateur footballer who almost blinded a referee by kicking him in the face for sending him off has been spared jail. Philip Giles was sent off by match official James Johnson for swearing and aggressive behaviour during a Sunday league match in Manchester. But as Giles left the field having been sent off, he ran back towards the 19-year-old referee and launched a flying kick at him as Johnson recorded the sending-off in his notebook. Cowardly: Amateur referee James Johnson thought he had been blinded after the thuggish attack which left him needing six stitches above his right eye . Giles, 22, jumped at Johnson with both feet and kicked him in the face with his left boot. The official only realised what had happened when he woke up in an ambulance, and needed six stitches to a large wound above his right eye. The court was told Mr Johnson feared he had lost vision in his right eye and had been left with a permanent scar. But the violent Sunday league player was spared a prison term after a judge ruled his attack did not pass the custody threshold 'by a whisker'. Giles, who pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, said he had been ‘infuriated’ by the referee who he thought had been ‘winding him up’ during the match at Turn Moss playing fields, Chorlton, last October. He was told by the judge, Recorder Arthur Noble: 'It doesn’t need me to emphasise to anyone reading a paper, or seeing a photograph of this injury, that it was extremely unpleasant indeed. 'You risked causing permanent damage to this man’s eyesight. It appears that you regarded the referee with less than favour for some time, and used foul language to an official merely trying to do his job. ' Thug: Philip Giles, 22 (left) had already been sent off for aggressive behaviour when he assaulted the match official, leaving him with a permanent scar . The judge said although the offence crossed the custody threshold, he felt able - ‘by a whisker’ - to suspend a 10-month jail sentence for two years. The court heard that Giles, of Teddington Close, Moston, became increasingly agitated as his Waldorf FC side fell 2-0 behind to Woodsend Athletic - and had a penalty awarded against them. Mr Johnson, a Manchester University student, told police the attack was ‘cowardly’ and said it would affect him for life. He said: 'I was unconscious for a while. There was blood everywhere and I thought I had been blinded, as I could not see through one eye. It was terrifying. ' Michael Knowles, defending, said Giles, who has been banned by the league, had acted on the spur of the moment, never been in trouble before and had expressed genuine remorse. Giles will be subject to supervision by the Probation Service for 12 months. He was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and to pay his victim £750 compensation.","Philip Giles kicked official James Johnson in the face .

This year is set to see a battle between two of the biggest entertainment behemoths in history as shoot 'em ups Call of Duty and Halo release sequels within a week of one another this November. The last Call of Duty grossed $1 billion faster than any entertainment . product in history, beating James Cameron's Avatar to the record by 24 hours. Halo 3 was the biggest entertainment launch of all time when it launched in 2007. The series has sold 40 million so far. Scroll down for video . Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 has a 'near future' sci fi setting where an army of 'drones' has been turned against the West . Halo 4: The relaunch of the Halo franchise will be done by a new studio, 343 studios, but will feature the same robot-suited hero, Master Chief . Call of Duty: Black Ops abandons the realistic historical settings of previous Call of Duty games for a new near-future plot . Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 also features a massively enhanced graphics engine - and more multiplayer modes. The developers also promise more zombies . Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will release on November 13 - just seven days after Halo 4. Analysts and critics are divided over which way the battle will swing. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is a radical departure for the series - abandoning the gritty realism and historical settings for a near-future look. Gamers have had mixed feelings about the first trailer - but many hope that it could rejuvenate the franchise. Although Modern Warfare 3 was commercially successful, it was less well received by critics - who claimed the franchise was becoming tired. 'Black Ops 2, thankfully, shows a way forward for the Call of Duty brand as it appears to be something genuinely new,' says Pat Garratt, editor of game news site VG247. 'There was talk about stagnation after Modern Warfare 3, largely because it was assumed the next game would be entirely predictable. That Activision has surprised everyone by moving into true sci-fi territory is fantastic news for both fans and the games business in general.' The new Call of Duty features a sci-fi setting far more similar to the Halo games - which also revolved around an attack on cities on Earth . 'Hands down, this is the most ambitious Call of Duty ever,' said Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing. 'We are bringing disruptive innovation to the franchise and we are doing it on several fronts. We're pushing the boundaries technologically, graphically, and from a narrative and gameplay perspective.' Gamers will also be reassured to know that there will be more zombies than ever before . Mark Lamia, Studio Head for Treyarch, said, 'Running in the multiplayer engine for the first time, Zombies gives players a bigger and more diverse set of gameplay experiences, as well as entirely new ways to wage war with the undead.'","Black Ops 2 is sequel to game which grossed $1 billion faster than Avatar .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:11 EST, 2 May 2012 . Strength: Austin Hatch hopes to play college basketball at University of Michigan next year after surviving two plane crashes which killed his entire family . In the ten months since the horrific plane crash which killed his entire family, Austin Hatch has made an incredible recovery, focusing on looking forward to his dream of playing college basketball. On June 24 last year, a small plane piloted by his father and carrying his stepmother and two pet dogs crashed after leaving Fort Wayne in Indiana and trying to land at Charlevoix Airport. Austin told the Detroit Free Press this week that he is determined to play with the Wolverines at the University of Michigan in 2013. Austin said: 'The most difficult thing is just missing my biological family, because I’m the only one left. 'I wish there was an instructional manual in how to deal with this kind of loss.' The 16-year-old suffered a brain injury, punctured lung, broken ribs and was put into a drug-induced coma following the crash which only he and one dog survived. Austin said he will use a basketball scholarship for Michigan in the class of 2013 . to live the life he and his father always imagined. However the 17-year-old has yet to . be cleared to play - but has put his trust in his doctors. The teenager also said that he didn't believe anyone else could relate . to his situation. 'No one that I know of,' he said. 'If there is someone, I haven’t met them yet.' Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report that the crash that killed Austin's father, Dr Stephen Hatch and his stepmother Kim, occurred after the single-engine plane stalled because of inadequate air speed. The report said Stephen Hatch failed to follow the proper protocol. After the aircraft missed its instrument landing approach at the Charlevoix Municipal Airport, Dr Hatch turned around and attempted a second landing on the runway from the opposite direction before crashing into a garage in a neighborhood near the airport, according to witness statements. Stephen Hatch, who was an anesthesiologist and partner at Pain Management Associates, also was piloting a similar plane in September 2003 that crashed in Indiana. On the court: Before the plane crash last June, Austin Patch had been a promising high school basketball star at Fort Wayne Canterbury high school, Indiana . His other children, Lindsay, 11, and five-year-old Ian, died along with . his first wife, Julie, 38. Austin, who was eight years old at the time, only survived when his father flung him out of the burning plane. Following last year’s crash en route . to a summer home near Boyne Falls in northern Michigan, Austin Hatch was . in a medically-induced coma for weeks before returning to Fort Wayne. He was a standout basketball player . at Canterbury High School in Fort Wayne. He didn’t play basketball for . Canterbury this past season. Austin Hatch had a serious head injury from last year’s crash and admitted that his recovery has been difficult. 'My dad’s dad, my grandpa Jim Hatch, . he’s as close a thing to my dad as there is,' he said. 'So he’s been . very instrumental in helping me with the recovery process.' Smashed: The wreckage of Dr Hatch's plane after it crashed into a garage in Charlevoix, Michigan on June 24 last year . Austin was given a small measure of comfort last year when his dog, a labradoodle named Brady, was found wandering near the crash site in the days following the accident. The teenager's basketball coach at Fort Wayne Canterbury High last year spoke about the student's strength of character after the family tragedies he had suffered. I wish there was an instructional manual in how to deal with this kind of loss. Plane crash survivor, Austin Patch . ‘He never talked about (the previous . crash) one time,’ Canterbury School basketball coach Dan Kline said. ‘I'm sure he carried it inside.’ ‘He's a very mature young man (and) you'd never know he was 16 years old,’ Mr Kline said, adding he is . someone ‘who can handle things'. ‘Right now, (the team) are just trying to collect our thoughts and stick together,’ Mr Kline said. ‘They're a close-knit group.’ David Bojrab, Dr Hatch's close . friend and business partner, said in 2011 that he loved flying so much he felt 'compelled' to continue, even after his wife and children died in 2003. Best friends: Austin Patch and his labradoodle Brady were the only survivors of the horrific plane crash last year which killed his doctor father and stepmother . Dr Bojrab said: 'He was such a strong . proponent of flying and teaching people to fly ... I think he felt . compelled to continue his passion. 'He felt compelled to show people that accidents do happen. He didn't want people to look in the other direction.' He described Austin as 'the apple of his dad's eye', and said Dr Hatch took great pride in his son's athletic prowess. Dr Bojrab said his friend had planned . to go to Spain to celebrate his parents' 50th wedding anniversary with . the rest of his family, but he cancelled the trip to spend time with . Austin and his adult stepchildren. He said: 'Steve was a very big family man.' Terrible twist: Dr Stephen Hatch died in a plane crash in 2011 - eight years after he survived a deadly smash that killed his wife and two children . Earlier crash: Austin and his father survived another crash in 2003 that killed the boy’s mother, Julie, left, and his two siblings, Lindsay, 11, centre and Ian, 5, right . A federal report into the 2003 crash found inaccurate pre-flight planning resulted in the plane not having enough fuel. The National Transportation Safety . Board also ruled that a utility pole the airplane hit during its forced . landing, a low ceiling and dark night also contributed to the crash. But Dr Bojrab said his friend disputed the report's findings, believing equipment failure caused the crash. He said: 'When he crashed, it was an inferno, which makes you wonder how he could have been out of gas.'","Austin Patch suffered a brain injury and broken ribs in the crash where his father and stepmother died .

"By . Julie Cross . PUBLISHED: . 04:24 EST, 26 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:00 EST, 26 March 2012 . A former hedge fund boss is taking . the biggest gamble of his life by opening the country’s newest and . largest vineyard – with plans to produce one million bottles of fizz a . year. Mark Driver, 47, and a team of 30, . will attempt to take on the French at their own game, producing quality . sparkling wine to rival the best Champagne has to offer. His picturesque 400-acre plot, . nestled on a south-facing slope, near the coast at Alfriston, East . Sussex, is just 88 miles as the crow flies from Champagne in France, and has a very . similar soil and climate. The Rathfinny Estate will be one of . the largest single site vineyards in Europe and aims to capitalise on . the booming demand - both nationally and internationally - for high . quality English sparkling wine. Scroll down to see the first vines being planted . Ready for action: Mark Driver, pictured with his wife Sarah, on the freshly-ploughed South Downs vineyard . Some fizz in Sussex? The Rathfinny Estate in South Downs is only 88 miles from Champagne in France, and is said to have similar growing conditions . A taste of things to come: Grape-pickers work in the Champagne Banette's vineyards in Tauxieres-Mutry . England currently produces only four million bottles of wine each year - which is actually less than we consume each day. Mr Driver, father-of-four, said: 'A . lot of people don’t realise that English wine producers are making some . of the best sparkling wine in the world. Ridgeview, another local Sussex . producer, won the prestigious Decanter award in 2010 for its sparkling . wine, the first time the award has been won outside of France. 'So, we know it can be done. We hope that opening such a large operation will help put English wine on the map. 'I want Rathfinny to be sold not just . in the best restaurants in London, but in Paris, New York, Beijing and . Hong Kong as well,’ he said. He said that his aim was to produce . sparkling wine that compared favourably with the likes of Bollinger and . Pol Roger, with a retail price of around £25 to £26. He said they would . be using the same methods and grapes as they do in Champagne, so the . wine should be similar, although a touch fruitier. Mr Driver, whose usual dress as a . stockbroker and then co-manager of a hedge fund, was a suit and tie, now . finds he spends a lot of time traipsing about in wellies on his 400 . acre site, which he bought in October 2010. His ambitious plans are even . more astounding, considering that he is in the middle of a degree – in . wine-making. 'I was lucky enough to be able to . step down from my job and venture into something new. I’ve always been . interested in wine, I’ve drunk a lot of it over the years, and I have a . small, but growing, collection. It was from a personal interest that I . decided to consider the idea of a vineyard . 'The other students find it very . amusing that I am opening up the largest vineyard in the country, when I . haven’t even finished my studies,’ said Mr Driver. 'However, I think . they believe it is great news for the industry and for them as I may be . employing some of them in the future.’ Mr Driver said that he hadn’t . anticipated buying land until after his degree at Plumpton College, but . when the Rathfinny estate came up for sale the opportunity was too good . to miss. 'We were originally looking for a 250 . acre site, because we wanted the vineyard to be commercially viable, . not just a hobby, so we needed a large plot of land. When this farm came . up, we jumped at it. 'We were incredibly lucky, as sites . like this do not come up for sale very often in this part of the world,’ said Mr Driver, who is employing 30 people full-time and will need up . to 200 seasonal workers to help pick the grapes. Vision: This ruined farmhouse will be restored to its former glory and used as accommodation for workers when they come to pick the grapes . Mists and mellow fruitfulness: Mr Driver said the chance to buy the Rathfinny estate was too good an opportunity to miss . The planting of the four varieties of grapes - Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Riesling –started this week. Around 50 acres of grapes will be planted a year until 2020, when the full 400 acres will be under vine. The first still wine could appear as early as next year, with sparkling hitting the shelves in 2016 or 2017. 'We will produce small amounts of . still wine, but this is going to be a predominately sparkling wine . vineyard. High quality Sussex sparkling wine requires at least three . years of bottle fermentation, so everyone will have to be patient while . they wait,' said Mr Driver. To help him with the wine production, . Cameron Roucher, estate manager at Rathfinny, moved 12,000 miles from . New Zealand to be part of the ambitious project. 'You couldn’t really . ask for a better location than this for growing sparkling wine grapes. The soil, the climate, the geography - they are all perfect,’ he said. A state-of-the-art winery will be . completed by the summer of 2013. A staff hostel is also being built to . accommodate seasonal workers, who will be needed during harvest and . during the winter to maintain the vines. The hostel, which uses reclaimed old flint barns, is due to be completed in time for the winter of next year. Rathfinny has also hired Jonathan . Médard, a renowned French winemaker, who has spent the last ten years . working in California, to oversee the design and construction of the new . winery as well as make all of the wines. Joining Mark and Sarah Driver on the project are Cameron Roucher from New Zealand as vineyard manager and Frenchman Jonathan Medard, winemaker . 'The soil, the climate, the geography - they are all perfect, says estate manager Cameron Roucher . Working with Natural England and the . National Trust, a programme of improvements is being made to enhance the . local natural habitat while reviving and reclaiming the natural chalk . grass downland and creating wildlife corridors to improve biodiversity. A . new walk, the Rathfinny Trail, is being established, allowing the . public access to parts of the Estate. One of Rathfinny’s aims is to provide a sustainable built infrastructure to support the vineyard. Buildings feature locally-sourced oak . and flint. A renewable energy strategy is being implemented based on . photovoltaic cells so that each building is energy self-sufficient. Ground water is being sourced from the Estate’s own bore hole, purified to removed calcium and microbes. Can we compare? The vineyards of Ville Dommange, in the Champagne region of France are about to face competition from English sparkling wine . Channelling the French flavour: Around 50 acres of grapes will be planted a year until 2020, leading to 400 acres of growing goodness . Alfriston is already known for a wine heritage: The English Wine Centre is also based there . The waste water used within the wine . making process will be treated on site and released back onto the land. New windbreaks using indigenous hedge plants and trees are being grown . to manage the micro-conditions on the slopes of the vineyard. Rathfinny is also funding the . construction of a new Wine Research Centre at Plumpton College, part of . Brighton University, to support the development of skills that the . English wine industry will require as it grows. Mr Driver said: 'The Rathfinny . project is not just about making wine: we are committed to supporting . the wider ambitions of the English wine industry and that means . nurturing the skills it requires to fulfill its potential. 'You’ll find that every major wine . area is supported by a research centre, which is why I was so keen to . invest in one at Plumpton. We will need skilled workers in this area as . the industry takes off. 'I do believe we are at the beginning . of an emerging industry in southern England and I know the local people . here are very supportive of what we are trying to do. We have also had . encouragement from other local wine producers too. All we need to do is . convince people in London and across the country to buy English.’ As for the winemakers across the Channel, they are 'intrigued’ to see what we are doing here, said Mr Driver. 'Several French vineyard owners are trying to purchase or rent land here because it is much cheaper than in Champagne.’ Now, all there is to do for Mark and his wife Sarah, is to watch the grapes grow and cross their fingers for some good weather. So, as a former stockbroker and hedge fund manager, how risky is this venture? 'Of course, we have done a lot of . research, we know the land is perfect for sparkling wine, we’ve brought . in some experts to help, and we’re feeling very confident. But of . course, the one thing we can’t control is the vagaries of the English . weather,’ he said. Sussex: Achingly trendy coastal city Brighton and South Downs, England’s newest . national park, stretching from Beachy Head to Harting Down in West . Sussex . Champagne: Rheims Cathedral is one of the finest medieval cathedrals in . France and is a UNESCO World Heritage site - and even better it is just . 45 minutes from Paris on the high speed TGV train. Sussex: Alfriston, a quaint village, is also . the home of former Prime Minister Ted Heath, and where Rathfinny will . eventually have a wine tasting shop and heritage centre .

A former Los Angeles police detective has been sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for murdering the wife of her former lover in a jealous fit of rage 26 years ago. Stephanie Lazarus, 52, was found guilty in March of killing Sherri Rasmussen, a nurse who was bludgeoned and shot to death in the condo she shared with her husband of three months, John Ruetten. Rasmussen's mother, sister and widower spoke during the sentencing hearing about their pain and described the victim as a warm, caring and loving person. Sentenced: Stephanie Lazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for murdering the wife of her former lover 26 years ago . Write caption here . Ruetten, visibly emotional, told the judge he still grieves. 'The fact that Sherri's death occurred because she met and married me, brings me to my knees,' he said. 'I do not know ... how to cope with this appalling fact.' Superior Court Judge Robert Perry gave Lazarus a term of 25 years with the possibility of parole for first-degree murder and an additional two years for personal use of a firearm. He said Lazarus would be credited with 1,608 days, or nearly 4 1/2 years, for good behavior and time already served. Prosecutors said in a 'statement of views' that 'Lazarus misused her police training in the most profound way imaginable by utilizing that training and experience to commit murder and to cover up her crime.' 'Lazarus betrayed the trust placed in her by the Los Angeles Police Department and by people of Los Angeles in order to pursue her own murderous ends' 'Lazarus' profound narcissism led her to kill and continues to motivate her denial of responsibility,' the prosecution concluded. Passive: Stephanie Lazarus betrayed no emotion as she listened to victim impact statements during her sentencing today . Emotional: The victim's sister, Teresa Lane, wiped away her tears as she gave her victim impact statement in court today . Lazarus' defense attorney said an appeal has been filed. Outside court, Lazarus' brother and mother said their hearts go out to Rasmussen's family, but they still support Lazarus and believe she did not get a fair trial. 'There was never a presumption of innocence,' said Steve Lazarus. 'The media got to listen to DNA and guilt for 2 1/2 years before Stephanie had her trial.' During the trial, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college - claiming Lazarus was consumed with jealousy when Ruetten decided to marry Rasmussen instead of her. The case hinged on DNA from a bite mark prosecutors say was left by Lazarus on Rasmussen's arm. Shock: Stephanie Lazarus (right) listens as she is found guilty of first-degree murder in Los Angeles on March 8 as her attorney Mark Overland (left) turns away . Her defense attorney countered that the . DNA was packaged improperly and deteriorated while stored in a coroner's . freezer for two decades. He also suggested there might have been . evidence tampering. After a day and a half of deliberation, the jury of eight women and four men delivered its guilty decision on March 8. Victim Sherri Rasmussen was bludgeoned and shot to death in 1986 in the condo she shared with her husband of three months. Detectives initially believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame. But two decades later, a cold case team using DNA analysis concluded the killer was a woman and authorities began looking at Lazarus as a suspect. Love triangle: John Reutten, right, married former hospital nursing director Sherri Rasmussen, 29, left, before Stephanie Lazarus, 51, killed her in 1986 . During the trial Ruetten testified that he never intended to . marry Lazarus, although they were intimate for about a year. He also . said she enticed him into having sex with her shortly before his . wedding. 'Here's the deal,' he testified. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.' Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, ridiculed the claim of a fatal attraction between Lazarus and Ruetten, saying she never tried to reunite with her former lover after his wife was gone. 'So this obsessing with John must have fizzled out I guess,' he said. Shocking close-up death pictures of the . battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors during the trial of . Lazarus, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open. Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her . hands held up as if in a defensive posture. Fatal jealousy: Sherri Rasmussen (pictured left) was brutally murdered by LAPD detective Stephanie Lazarus (right) in 1986 . Justice: Neil and Loretta Rasmussen, parents of Sherri, who was beaten and shot in 1986 . Lazarus went on to marry another . policeman and adopt a daughter. She rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles . Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and . thefts. Overland also pointed to the lack of physical evidence against her. No blood, fingerprints, hair or fibers connected her to the scene. But prosecutor Shannon Presby told jurors the case was based on more than just DNA. At the outset of the trial, he said it featured 'a bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart'. Convicted: Lazarus married another policeman and adopted a daughter . He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm . contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades . after the killing. Lazarus' gun was never found, but Mr Presby called experts to testify that bullets fired into Rasmussen's body matched those issued to police officers in 1986. Mr Presby drove home the idea in his closing . argument with a familiar line from poet William Congreve: 'Heaven has no . rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.' Lazarus' husband attended most of the trial along with other family members. Ruetten sat across the courtroom with Rasmussen's family. The defendant and her white-haired former boyfriend never looked at each other. But their past moved before them on screen as both sides showed pictures of them as a young couple. Among the trial's most dramatic moments came when Ruetten testified tearfully about finding his wife slain. He said it never entered his mind that Lazarus might be responsible. It was the first time in living memory that an active-duty LAPD officer was arrested on a murder charge and later convicted, according to the Los Angeles Times.

When life was just beginning to emerge  on Earth, nearby Mars could also have been a watery world shrouded in a dense atmosphere that could have supported life. One of the reasons water no longer flows on Mars's surface is because its atmosphere is less than 1% of the density of the Earth's. But Professor Josef Dufek, of Georgia Tech university, looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago, found by Mars Rover Spirit - and realised from the depth of the crater that the atmosphere must once have been much thicker.

Valles Marineris on Mars - which some scientists believe may have been carved by glaciers. A growing body of evidence points to the fact that water once flowed on the planet . A Georgia Tech university researcher looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago - and realised from its depth that the atmosphere must once have been much thicke . It adds to a growing body of evidence that water once flowed on Mars. He began his studies with a rock fragment propelled into the Martian atmosphere during a volcanic eruption roughly 3.5 billion years ago, reports journal Geophysical Research Letters. The Mars rover Spirit landed at the site in 2007 and took a close look at the remaining fragment, enabling prof Dufek and colleagues to calculate the size, depth and shape of the divot. The team then created craters of their own for comparison, firing particles into grains the same size as those found by Spirit. They calculated that the speed the particles must have been moving to recreate the divot would have required an atmospheric pressure 20 times greater than that found today. This suggests Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, said prof Dufek. He said: ‘Atmospheric pressure has likely played a role in developing almost all Mars' surface features. ‘The planet's climate, the physical state of water on its surface and the potential for life are all influenced by atmospheric conditions. ‘Our study is consistent with growing research that early Mars was at least a transiently watery world with a much denser atmosphere than we see today. The mosaic image captured by the Mars Express orbiter is colour-coded for elevation, showing the valleys and cliffs thought to have been carved out by ancient floods on the surface .

She's had a rough few years, and though things appeared to be looking up for Camille Grammer, she's found herself in the middle of more drama. Though she has moved on from her broken marriage to Frasier star Kelsey Grammer, her new boyfriend's ex is creating problems. According to RadarOnline.com, the mother of Dimitri Charalambopoulos' child, ex-girlfriend Lisa Chynoweth, threatened Camille during a crucial time during her own divorce proceedings. More drama: Camille Grammer was reportedly 'threatened' by the ex-girlfriend of new love Dimitri Charalambopoulos . Coming out fighting: The 43-year-old reportedly counter-attacked when threatened by Dimitri's ex . This caused the 43-year-old to counter-attack: she threatened Lisa with lawyers and public embarrassment as she tried to protect her privacy. The site reports that Lisa called Camille and sneakily recorded a four hour chat between Dimiti's ex and current girlfriends. During the taped recording, the former Playboy model tells Lisa: 'If you go to the press, I have lawyers that are beyond what you can imagine and they will pull stuff on you and you will be so mortified about your life and your family and what you have done. You don't want to do that to Marcus [her son].' Never been happier: The former Housewife claims she's given up her reality show in order to regain her privacy . Camille, naturally, had no knowledge that she was being recorded or that her words could be used against her boyfriend, as Dimitri is currently embroiled in a nasty custody battle with his ex for care of their five-year-old son. He even has a temporary restraining order against his ex because of the situation after she leaked the video deposition tape. A source tells Radar: 'Lisa is the one that called Camille about a month and a half ago and she had a laundry list of issues she needed to address. 'Camille was very gracious in the beginning of the conversation and just let Lisa talk. Camille had a lot going on in her life because she was still in a custody dispute with Kelsey. 'Towards the end of the conversation, Lisa told Camille that the press had been calling her and brought up Camille's children. Lisa knew about the custody battle and threatened to insert herself into that situation. Camille was provoked and reacted as any mother that loves her children would, period. The big reveal: Camille sat down with guest host Katie Couric yesterday on Good Morning America . 'Camille didn't threaten Dimitri's son, Marcus, she was simply saying that no child should have to deal with the fallout of their parents feuding. The tape was aired as evidence in a video deposition between Dimitri, a bankruptcy attorney, and his ex. When Lisa's attorney asks Dimitri if he thinks it's ok that Camille threatens his ex and his son, he replies, 'I'm not going to answer that because I didn't hear the rest of the conversation and I don't want to hear the whole conversation...I didn't hear a threat and I don't know what that conversation was about and it was a little snippet and that has absolutely nothing to do with this...I didn't hear a threat, it sounded more like a rebuttal.' According to the insider, Lisa edited the tape for her own gain. A rough few years: Camille has had a hard time while going through her divorce from husband of 14 years Kelsey Grammer . Moving on: The Frasier star has since remarried flight attendant Kayte Walsh . No longer a housewife: The former Playboy model revealed she cut her ties with her Bravo show after just two seasons . The source reports: 'Dimitri wasn't with Camille when the phone call was made and they both find it extremely interesting that only a snippet of the conversation was recorded. 'Lisa didn't record the portions of the phone call when Camille praised what a great dad Dmitri was and what an amazing little boy they were raising. 'Lisa purposefully recorded when she had provoked Camille and attempted to use it against her. How did the deposition end up on YouTube? The lawyers involved are the only ones that have access to that information.' The drama has not affected Dimitri and Camille's relationship, however. In fact, she is reportedly happier than ever since filing for divorce from Grammer, her husband of 14 years, in 2010. Says the site: 'Dimitri and Camille have never been closer and more in love. Camille has handled herself with true class and Dimitri is so grateful to have her in his life. 'Neither one of them thought they were ever going to find true love again and be able to trust someone with their heart. They are a fantastic couple and are rock solid.' She told Good Morning America's guest correspondent Katie Couric yesterday that she left her Bravo reality show after just two seasons in order to regain her privacy in relation to her boyfriend and children.","Dimitri has a restraining order against his ex .

Robert Graves the soldier-turned-poet, (pictured in 1967), twice turned down the offer of an honour from Downing Street . Robert Graves used his Claudius novels to warn of the dangers of becoming too close to the centre of political power in Ancient Rome. But newly released documents show that the soldier-turned-poet was equally sceptical about modern politicians – and twice turned down the offer of an honour from Downing Street. Graves feared that his artistic independence would have been jeopardised if he had accepted either of the honours offered to him by two different Tory Prime Ministers – Harold Macmillan and Margaret Thatcher. His reluctance to embrace the honours system is revealed in Cabinet Office letters obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws. They show that other writers and artists, including Roald Dahl, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, also turned down honours. Graves, who died in 1985 aged 90, refused Harold Macmillan’s offer of an OBE in 1957. In a letter to Downing Street on May 10, 1957, he wrote: ‘I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will not consider me churlish or ungrateful if I decline his proposal. 'My reason is that I am primarily a poet, and poetry is a private activity which in my opinion should not be recognised by the award of an honorific appropriate to public servants.’ Artists Francis Bacon, left, turned down a CBE in 1960, and Lucian Freud, right, declined a CBE in 1977 it has emerged. The writer, who served as an Army officer in the First World War, added: ‘I am content with the three campaigning medals awarded me by Her Majesty’s Grandfather [King George V] for my services as a soldier only.’ Graves later rejected Margaret Thatcher’s plan in May 1984 to enrol him as a Companion of Honour. He was in poor health and his wife Beryl declined the honour on his behalf. The writer’s son Robert said last night: ‘My father turned down the honours because he didn’t want to be beholden to anyone. 'He thought artists should have complete independence so they could speak their minds.’ Roald Dahl’s rejection of an OBE in 1986 was abrupt. He wrote: ‘I refer to your letter . . . telling me my name is being considered . . . This is to inform you that I do not wish to accept.’ Francis Bacon had turned down a CBE in 1960, saying: ‘I do not want my name now or ever to be recommended to Her Majesty for such an honour.’ Lucian Freud declined a CBE from Labour’s James Callaghan in 1977, writing: ‘I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his kind thought . . . Although unable to accept this honour, I hope it will be understood that I have come to this decision for selfish reasons.’","Tory Prime Ministers Harold Macmillan and Margaret Thatcher approached him .

"By . David Williams and Vanessa Allen . UPDATED: . 00:56 EST, 8 September 2011 . Nato will not prevent Colonel Gaddafi fleeing Libya, a senior Western diplomat said last night. The diplomat said the West had no remit to bomb any vehicles the ousted tyrant may be using. Rebels also seemed anxious for Gaddafi to leave as they tried to avoid further bloodshed and finally end his 42-year rule. Which way? Anti-Gaddafi fighters ride on a vehicle with a multiple rocket launcher outside Khamis brigade's military base, which was destroyed by a Nato air strike, some 22 miles east of Bani Walid . On the march: Anti-Gaddafi fighters drive their vehicles past the Khamis brigade military base . The envoy spoke as special forces claimed Gaddafi was in the south of Libya, just 200 miles from Niger. He said: ‘Convoys heading a long way away from civilian centres don’t seem to meet the Nato mandate. ‘If they start threatening civilian  centres then I suspect they will come under that mandate. ‘But we haven’t got any evidence that that’s in train at the moment.’ Asked about reports of a Gaddafi convoy crossing into Niger, he said: ‘Those around Gaddafi appear to be recognising that the game is up.Those are welcome indications.’ Yesterday the 69-year-old was said to be in the village of Ghwat, close to the Algerian and Niger borders. Libyan rebels chant anti Gadhafi slogans and flash Victory signs, near a checkpoint between Tarhouna and Bani Walid, south-east of Tripoli . Anti-Gaddafi forces man the Al-malti check point on the outskirts of the town of Bani Walid, which is still held by pro-Gaddafi forces . Anti-Gaddafi fighters arrive at Al-malti check point from Tajura, on the outskirts of the town of Bani Walid . His wife, daughter and two sons have been given sanctuary in Algeria but  a rebel official leading the hunt for him said ‘many sources’ suggested Gaddafi was heading south to Niger or Chad. Niger has said it is unable to meet Libya’s request to close the border because it is simply too big to police. The SAS and special forces from Arab countries have been tracking Gaddafi and his family since the fall of Tripoli more than two weeks ago, but his fate will rest in the hands of rebel fighters. Last night claims emerged that his family remaining in Libya, including his son Saif al-Islam, had fled the town of Bani Walid in the past week and were also heading south. To add to the mystery, some rebels claimed they had Gaddafi cornered and would ‘detain him or kill him’. One, Anis Sharif, declared confidently: ‘He can’t get out.’ A . terrifying cache of  missiles capable of shooting down passenger planes . has been stolen from Gaddafi’s arsenal in Libya, it was claimed . yesterday. Almost 500 of the Russian-made . heat-seeking missiles have been looted in the past week, prompting fears . they have been sold to Al Qaeda  for use against the West. Peter Bouckaert, of Human Rights Watch, said: ‘These missiles are some of the most advanced weaponry in the world. ‘If Al Qaeda get hold of them, they could turn all of North Africa into a no-fly zone.’ The SA-24 ‘Grinch’ missiles were . moved out of Tripoli when the Nato bombing began and hidden in farm . buildings and warehouses, with other missiles, land mines, plastic . explosives, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. But after Tripoli fell to rebels last month, the weapons were left unguarded. Mr Bouckaert said similar warehouses . had been looted across Libya and surface-to-air missiles targeted, . suggesting that they were stolen to order. The Government will spend £140million buying new bombs to replace those dropped on Libya, the Defence Secretary has announced. Liam Fox said the Treasury reserve, money kept aside from routine budgets, will fund the cost of the explosives. He said: ‘Based upon current consumption rates, we estimate the cost of replenishing munitions may be up to £140 million. ‘The Treasury has agreed to meet these costs from the reserve.’ The RAF and Royal Navy waged a . campaign on Libyan targets as part of a coalition enforcing a United . Nations Security resolution in March. The resolution aimed to protect . civilians as then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s forces closed . in on its second city, Benghazi. David Cameron had previously told the Commons on Monday  that the operation had cost £120million with pilots . flying more than 2,400 sorties enforcing a no-fly zone and hitting . targets. He said Gaddafi was trapped within a 40-mile radius in an area surrounded by rebels and with his movement monitored by spy planes. ‘It is only a matter of time,’ he added. ‘We are just playing games with him.’ However he did not say exactly where rebels believe Gaddafi is. Other senior rebel leaders remained cautious, saying Africa’s ‘most wanted’ man was still in the country but not that his hiding place had been uncovered or he was close to arrest. Earlier this week a convoy of Gaddafi loyalists, including his security chief, fled across the Sahara into Niger in a move that Libya’s former rebels hoped could help lead to the surrender of his last strongholds. The safe passage of the convoys, which included wagons loaded with gold and cash, into landlocked Niger was said to have been brokered by South Africa and France on behalf of Nato.

In Niger’s capital Niamey, a spokesman for the president confirmed that Gaddafi’s security chief had crossed the desert into Niger but categorically denied that Gaddafi or his sons had entered the country yet. With many vehicles carrying Gaddafi loyalists heading for the former French colony of Burkina Faso, it was reported that the ex-leader had joined them en route. Burkina Faso, one of the world’s  poorest countries, is one of the few to have offered Gaddafi political asylum and a major part of the convoy is said to be heading for the capital Ouagadougou. A spokesman for the government of President Blaise Compaore said Gaddafi would be arrested and handed to the International Criminal Court if he turned up there.","Special forces claim dictator is just 200 miles from country's border .

More than 700 inmates on Death Row in California could have their sentences converted to life in prison without parole if state voters decide to abolish the death penalty. California will soon get the chance to decide whether to replace the death penalty with a no-parole life sentence, after it was decided a measure to abolish capital punishment now qualified for a ballot in November, Secretary of State Debra Bowen said. If it passes, it would mean the sentence of life without parole would be the harshest penalty prosecutors could seek and all 725 inmates on Death Row could have their sentences converted. A guard tower rises above San Quentin State Prison. California has 714 inmates on death row, costing $184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole . Death row: An inmate sits at a table with a towel draped over his head, left, in the North Segregation section at San Quentin Prison. Pictured right is an execution chamber at the prison - with the lethal injection table inside . Waiting room: File photo of the execution holding cells at San Quentin Prison in Marin County, California . Should California abolish the death penalty? Backers of the measure say abolishing . the death penalty will save the state millions of dollars through . layoffs of prosecutors and defense attorneys who handle death penalty . cases, as well as savings from not having to maintain the nation's . largest death row at San Quentin State Prison. Those savings, supporters argue, can . be used to help unsolved crimes. If the measure passes, $100 million in . purported savings from abolishing the death penalty would be used over . three years to investigate unsolved murders and rapes. The . measure is dubbed the 'Savings, Accountability, and Full Enforcement . for California Act,' also known as the SAFE California Act. It's the . fifth measure to qualify for the November ballot, the secretary of state . announced on Monday. Supporters collected more than the 504,760 valid . signatures needed to place the measure on the ballot. Jeanne Woodford, the former . warden of San Quentin who is now an anti-death penalty advocate and an . official supporter of the measure, said: 'Our system is broken, . expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake.' The measure will also require most . inmates sentenced to life without parole to find jobs within prisons. Most death row inmates do not hold prison jobs for security reasons. Though . California is one of 35 states that still authorises the death penalty, . the state hasn't put anyone to death since 2006. A federal judge that . year halted executions until prison officials built a new death chamber . at San Quentin, developed new lethal injection protocols and made other . improvements to delivering the lethal three-drug combination. Walking dead: A prisoner on Death Row is led back to his cell in California's San Quentin prison in 2003. Due to legal challenges and long delays, the state hasn't executed anyone since 2006, despite a crowded death row . Last to face the death penalty: Clarence Ray Allen (left) was executed in January 2006 for the murder of three people. Donald Beardslee (right) was executed a year earlier for the murder of two people during a drug deal . Demonstration: Anti-death penalty protesters raise their arms in support of Stanley Tookie Williams, who was executed at San Quentin in 2005. The death penalty remains controversial . A separate state lawsuit is challenging the way the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation developed the new protocols. A judge in Marin County earlier this year ordered the CDCR to redraft its lethal injection protocols, further delaying executions. Since California reinstated the death penalty in 1978, the state has executed 13 inmates. A 2009 study conducted by a senior federal judge and law school professor concluded that the state was spending about $184 million a year to maintain Death Row and the death penalty system. The last inmates to be executed in California were at San Quentin. Clarence Ray Allen was executed in January 2006 for the murder of three people. Donald Beardslee was executed a year earlier for the murder of two people during a drug deal. Supporters of the proposition, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, are portraying it as a cost-savings measure in a time of political austerity. They count several prominent conservatives and prosecutors - including the author of the 1978 measure adopting the death penalty - as supporters and argue that too few executions have been carried out at too great a cost. 'Our system is broken, . expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake' 'My conclusion is that he law is totally ineffective,' said Gil Garcetti, a former Los Angeles County district attorney. 'Most inmates are going to die of natural causes, not executions.' Garcetti, who served as district attorney from 1992 to 2000, said he changed his mind after publication of the 2009 study, which was published by Judge Arthur Alarcon of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and law professor Paula Mitchell. Opponents of the measure, such as former Sacramento U.S Attorney McGregor Scott, argue that lawyers filing 'frivolous appeals' are the problem, not the death penalty law. 'On behalf of crime victims and their loved ones who have suffered at the hands of California's most violent criminals, we are disappointed that the ACLU and their allies would seek to score political points in their continued efforts to override the will of the people and repeal the death penalty,' said Scott, who is chairman of the Californians for Justice and Public Safety, a coalition of law enforcement officials, crime victims and others formed to oppose the measure. The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, meanwhile, remains one the biggest backers of the death penalty in the state and opposes the latest attempt to abolish it in California. The foundation and its supports argue that federal judges are gumming up the process with endless delays and reversals of state Supreme Court rulings upholding individual death sentences. The foundation on Thursday filed a lawsuit seeking the immediate resumption of executions in California. The foundation's lawsuit, filed directly with the state Court of Appeal, argues that since the three-drug method has been the subject of so much litigation - and the source of the execution delays - a one-drug method of lethal injection like Ohio uses can be substituted immediately.",All 725 inmates on Death Row could have their sentences converted to life without parole if capital punishment is abolished .

A mother who became known as 'Vodka mom' after passing out drunk and rolling onto her three-day-old son, suffocating him, has burned herself to death after weeks of condemnation. Toni Annette Medrano, 29, became the subject of hate after Nancy Grace decried the mother's carelessness on her cable television talk show last month. She died of injuries after using a flammable liquid to set herself on fire in the backyard of a home in St. Paul Park, Minnesota last Monday. The exact cause of her death is under investigation. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Toni Medrano (left) has died after setting herself on fire. She had been charged with manslaughter in the death of her newborn son Adrian (right) after suffocating him as they slept on the couch . She had been charged with manslaughter in the death of her newborn son, Adrian, whom she allegedly rolled onto as they slept on the couch in her home in Cottage Grove in November 2011. She had drank an entire fifth of vodka when she fell asleep on the couch with the boy between her and the back cushions. Throughout the night she woke to feed the newborn and left the couch to get formula at around 3am. She then drifted in and out of sleep, without getting up again, as her other children got ready for school, Pioneer Press reported. Alcohol fueled: Medrano had drunk a fifth of vodka before she suffocated her son last November . Innocent: The three-week-old baby was purple when she woke up and realised she had rolled on him . At 10.30 a.m. she realised Adrian was cold and purple and screamed to her husband Jason: 'The baby is dead!' Mr Medrano had warned his wife that . she risked suffocating the infant if she slept with him on the couch, . according to the St Paul Star Tribune. Nearly shouting on her cable television show, Nancy Grace described the events: . 'Did mommy booze it up and kill her baby? 'The mother spent the weekend drinking. She's waking up and she is so drunk off a fifth of vodka she doesn't . even know her baby is laying there - dead - beside her. 'This woman laid on top of this baby for hours. It had been dead for hours. 'Isn't it true that she stated that she had been drinking the entire time and that she had other children in the home? In fact, the other children wondered about the baby, and didn't realise he was dead? 'There was a long . period of time that her baby could have been - could have been - saved.' When she found Adrian unresponsive, the pair called 911 and tried to revive their baby. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Woodwinds Hospital in Woodbury. The official cause of death was ruled 'asphyxia due to being laid upon while sleeping with an adult' by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's office. Medrano was tested and found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.11. When the story featured on Nancy Grace, the . host condemned the 29-year-old mother, showing that the amount she had . drunk prior to the death was equal to 17 drinks containing vodka. 'She's waking up and she is so drunk off a fifth of vodka she doesn't . even know her baby is laying there dead beside her,' Grace said, nearly yelling. 'There was a long . period of time that her baby could have been saved.' A doctor on the show noted that the . baby had probably been dead for hours when he was discovered as he was . purple - a sign that blood is pooling in the body. This takes hours, he . said. Nancy Grace added that the mother had a history of heavy drinking, with two DWIs in a single month. Warnings: Medrano's husband Jason had warned her about the dangers of sleeping next to their son . Ridicule: Nancy Grace featured the story on her show last month, branding her 'Vodka Mom' After featuring on the show, Medrano became the subject of condemnation on blogs and social networking sites. Medrano faced two counts of . second-degree manslaughter, one charge for 'culpable negligence creating . unreasonable risk' and a second for 'committing or attempting to commit . a violation'. If she had been convicted, she would have faced up to 10 years in prison.

A couple from rural Washington are on trial after being accused of starving their adopted children and forcing them to live off goat and dog food. Jeffrey and Rebecca Trebilcock, both 45, face charges of criminal mistreatment and assault involving their five adopted children at their home in Longview. The couple were first arrested after Rebecca brought her then 13-year-old boy to the doctors. Jeffrey and Rebecca Trebilcock, pictured during an earlier court appearance, face charges of criminal mistreatment of their five adopted children . He was found to be suffering from broken ribs, severe malnutrition and weighed just 49 pounds. The boy, who was just 4ft 4in at the time but is now a healthier weight after being taken into care, testified against the Trebilcocks yesterday and spoke of the abuse he suffered at their hands. He told the court how he ate the food intended for animals because he 'didn't get to eat anything else and I was hungry.' Fox News reported that the boy, who is now 14, also testified that the couple had installed alarms to prevent him and his siblings from obtaining any food. The couple's home in Longview, Washington, where the abuse was alleged to have taken place . Dog food: Court documents say that the children told authorities they resorted to eating the pet dog's food to avoid punishment and in order to to survive . 'The alarm was right in front of the hallway to go into the kitchen, so if you went past that it would go off,' the court heard. The boy also said he had been forced to drink his own urine. Doctors at the Doernbecher Children's Hospital, pictured, who examined the couple's 13-year-old son reported he had the weight and height of a six-year-old . A doctor examining the boy in 2008 said he had the weight and height levels of a six-year-old, and that he suffered severe malnutrition, hypothermia, a slow heart rate and muscle wastage. He was also diagnosed with psychosocial dwarfism - a growth impairment believed to be caused by severe environmental stress. A doctor had estimated the boy was 10 inches shorter than a normal, healthy child of his age. Meanwhile the Trebilcocks themselves, especially Jeffrey, were described as overweight in court documents, and their four biological children also showed signs of being fed properly. Ironically, the father's job included delivering meals to schoolchildren in the area, as part of his work as a warehouse driver for Longview School District. The Trebilcocks' lawyer claimed the adopted children were well cared for, however, and accused them of giving conflicting statements to the court. 'Over the course of a number of interviews, some of them rather lengthy, (they) did tell a number of different renditions of what happened in the family home during the time they were there,' Ted Debray told the judge in a statement reported by Fox News. He also said the boy's unusually low weight was caused by illness. The Trebilcock children, both biological and adopted, were home educated and never enrolled in local schools.","Jeffrey and Rebecca Trebilcock, both 45, face charges of mistreating their five adopted children .

Valdarno, the Petrolo Estate is in the heart of the Chianti region, so . popular with British holidaymakers it has been dubbed ‘Chiantishire’, . and it is also close to the city of Florence - the name given to their . youngest daughter. She was born last year while the Camerons were on an ‘austerity’ staycation in Cornwall. This year, aides have told the Prime . Minister he has done enough to show he is tightening his belt in the . wake of the economic downturn, and can eschew the ‘hair shirt’ British . summer holiday in favour of getting away from it all for a fortnight in . the Mediterranean sun. Time off: David and Samantha Cameron holiday in Ibiza in May . In another break from the Labour . years, Mr Cameron will not be meeting Silvio Berlusconi, the troubled . Italian prime minister who became friends with Tony and Cherie Blair. Last night a Cameron friend said firmly: ‘This is a holiday, not a work trip.’ Earlier this year, David treated his . wife to a weekend in Granada, Spain, for her 40th birthday, and the . whole family have enjoyed short trips to Polzeath in Cornwall and the . Spanish holiday island Ibiza – where Mrs Cameron attended a rave-style . nightclub. In Tuscany, the Prime Minister’s party will have free run of the entire villa, which sleeps 19 people and has several bathrooms. The 300-year-old property has its own . private garden, swimming pool and tennis court and is surrounded by . high walls and tall cypress trees ensuring total security. Musician Sting and his wife Trudie . Styler own a luxurious former hunting lodge nearby, and the estate even . featured in Jamie Oliver’s cookbook ‘Jamie’s Italy’, in which the . television chef was photographed making pasta with Adriana, one of the . housekeepers. Inside, the villa is decorated with . antique furniture, crystal chandeliers, marble bathrooms, . state-of-the-art TV and a full-size billiard table, as well as antique . and contemporary paintings. It is surrounded by lush working . vineyards and olive groves, as well as oak woods which contain roaming . wild boar, and there are also fishing lakes on the estate. Getaway: Tony Blair and his family pose for a photocall during their stay in Tuscany in August 1998 . The estate produces organic wine, . olive oil, salami and honey, and Marco and Nada, who run it, can . organise Tuscan cooking lessons in the villa’s spacious kitchen. Reviews of the estate on the Tripadvisor website are mainly positive, with one recent guest describing it as simply ‘amazing’. But pitfalls of choosing an old house . were identified by another reviewer, from Wales, who reported ‘several . problems while we were there: fridge door falling off, leaking showers, . loos that wouldn’t flush properly’. The owners said these problems had since been fixed. When the Blairs visited the area, . they stayed with Italian aristocrat Prince Girolamo Strozzi. During one . free stay on an estate near Pisa, Mr Blair was accused by locals of . being a ‘scrounger’ after he left a paltry tip during a dinner at a . restaurant. In the middle of 1992, Mr Cameron met . his wife in Tuscany when she came on their family holiday because she . was a friend of David’s sister Clare. The Camerons were celebrating . David and Clare’s parents’ 30th wedding anniversary. According to his biographers, Mr . Cameron set his sights on Samantha and they played tennis together. Mr . Cameron - despite being a competitive player - took pains not to . humiliate her. Winning the match was clearly not his aim, and when they . were back in London, they went on their first date at Kensington Place . restaurant. Yesterday Luca Sanjust, who owns the . Petrolo Estate with his mother Lucia, said: ‘We have known for a few . months they were coming here but had been asked to keep it quiet. ‘It was booked via an agency and I can assure them that they will have a lovely, relaxing time here. ‘They have exclusive use of a pool . and tennis courts and there is some beautiful countryside as well as the . historic cities of Florence and Siena nearby. ‘We have an extensive wine cellar . here, as that is primarily what we do here - make wine - and I would be . delighted to show him our vineyards and our collection. ‘We also have a group of ladies who can cook traditional Tuscan lunches and dinners if they so wish.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We never comment on the Prime Minister’s movements.’ During the PM’s absence, and with . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg already on holiday in Spain with his . family, Foreign Secretary William Hague will be left as the most senior . Cabinet minister in the UK. But Number 10 insists that Mr Cameron . is always in charge and able to keep up with ‘the details of . government’ even when on holiday.

"By . Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 22 February 2012 . Rubbernecking at the scene of an accident is something we’ve all seen and done – but is it something to feel guilty about? After all, it involves staring at the suffering – or even death – of others. However, one U.S academic is convinced that taking in a scene of destruction can be good for your mental health, because it can bring home the value of your own life and loved ones. Light from the dark: Destruction can help us empathise with suffering and make us value life more, argues Professor Wilson . Eric Wilson, professor of English at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, argues his case in a new book called Everyone Loves A Good Train Wreck: Why We Can't Look Away. He told MailOnline that his investigations into obsessions with the macabre began after he realised that he was becoming increasingly drawn to the darker side of life. He said: ‘I was asking myself: “Why am I so interested in writers such as Edgar Allen Poe and Mary Shelley and becoming increasingly fixated on horror movies? Why as I become more mature – I have a wife, a daughter – why can’t I stop watching bad Boris Karloff movies?” ‘I realised, though, that maybe my morbidity doesn't make me weird, maybe it's not such a bad thing - that we all have a morbid side.’ To find out more Professor Wilson took a journey to what he described as ‘the dark underbelly of America’. He interviewed a host of experts from biologists to sociologists, psychologists to anthropologists – and even spoke to Rick Staton, who sells the art of serial killers. Dark subject: The book, left, came about after Professor Wilson, right, wanted to know why he was becoming increasingly fixated with macabre subjects . ‘I did a lot of field work, visited what you might call “masters of the macabre”’ he said. What he concluded was that if we approach darkness in the right way, it can lead to light. ‘There are many reasons why we're attracted to the morbid,’ he said. ‘It's titillating, it's a weird physiological arousal, an animal stimulation - some scientists even think it has an evolutionary value. ‘For instance, some gazelles watch while one of their own is eaten by a lion. And some humans might share this trait - we learn what not to do.’ This was something that the renowned psychologists Carl Jung believed in, says Professor Wilson. He said: ‘Jung might say that we have a shadow side. Most of us go through life repressing it, yet it draws us to death and gore. But Jung says it's psychologically healthy, because it can help us get to know ourselves. ‘Morbid curiosity allows us to think about the meaning of suffering and death.’ The key, though, says Professor Wilson, is using imagination. He said: ‘If a celebrity falls from grace we commodify these experiences, we're not allowing ourselves to imagine it. If we open up empathetically to the other person it can make us more human. ‘It’s about the necessity of using our imagination in trying to make suffering meaningful. What's the difference between titillation and exploitation? The power of imagination to empathise. It’s not something I’d thought about before.’ Professor Wilson draws a firm line, however, between looking at destruction and empathising – and becoming obsessed with it. He said: ‘If you look at a car accident by the road, hopefully you think about the suffering of others and feel relieved, you don't seek out other accidents. You don’t dwell on it. ‘Someone who seeks out pain, suffering and catastrophe as his main purpose in life - that can lead to depression. It leads to insensitivity, to being less sensitive to the meaning of catastrophe and a bleak life.’ The Shining: A film that illustrates the difference between healthy and unhealthy morbid curiosity, says Professor Wilson . His argument for why morbid curiosity is healthy is obviously greatly expanded upon in his book – but Professor Wilson acknowledges that there is one horror film that sums it all up – Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. He adds: ‘The danger is when we don’t realise the monsters are inside of us, that's when we become monsters. And Jack is not aware the monster is inside him. ‘Also, the name of the hotel in the movie is The Overlook Hotel – and I think Kubrick is saying: ""Do not overlook the darkness within.""","Thinking about destruction can help you value your own life, argues a U.S academic ."

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:18 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:18 EST, 20 May 2012 . Barack Obama opened the Nato conference today by telling the alliance there were still 'hard days ahead' after a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and insisted the fighting coalition will remain effective despite France's plans to pull combat troops out early. With a global economic crisis and waning public support for the war, world leaders opened the summit confronted by questions about Afghanistan's post-conflict future. They were also papering over a crack in the alliance due to the planned French withdrawal along with concerns over money for Afghan security forces and the coming elections. In agreement: Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai shakes hands with Barack Obama today before the start of the 2012 Nato Summit in Chicago . President Obama said: 'We still have a lot of work to do and there will be great challenges ahead. The loss of life continues in Afghanistan and there will be hard days ahead.' The end of the war is in sight, Obama said following a lengthy discussion with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the sidelines of the Nato summit. The military alliance pledged to remain in Afghanistan into 2014 but will seal plans today and tomorrow to shift foreign forces off the front lines a year faster than once planned. Afghan forces will take the lead throughout the nation next year, instead of in 2014, despite uneven performance under U.S. and other outside tutelage so far. The shift is in large part a response to plummeting public support for the war in Europe and the United States, contributors of most of the 130,000 foreign troops now fighting the Taliban-led insurgency. A majority of Americans now say the war is unwinnable or not worth continuing. Karzai said his nation is looking forward to the end of war, 'so that Afghanistan is no longer a burden on the shoulder of our friends in the international community, on the shoulders of the United States and our other allies'. Obama said Nato partners would discuss 'a vision for post-2014 in which we have ended our combat role, the Afghan war as we understand it is over, but our commitment to friendship and partnership to Afghanistan continues'. Public unrest: Protests surrounded the start of the Nato summit in Chicago as demonstrators made clear their disapproval of the Afghanistan war . Newly elected French president Francois Hollande has said he will withdraw all French combat troops from Afghanistan by year's end - a full two years before the timeline agreed to by nations in the U.S.-led NATO coalition. 'There will be no rush for the exits,' NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. 'Our goal, our strategy, our timetable remain unchanged.' Rasmussen denied there were fresh cracks in the alliance. He suggested a deal will emerge for France to move into a noncombat role but continue to support the international mission. Obama later met Rasmussen, thanking him for his leadership at Nato through some rocky periods. Obama said in addition to Afghanistan, the summit would focus on the alliance's defense capabilities and partnerships with non-Nato countries. Before the one-hour meeting with Karzai, a senior U.S. official said the prime topic was planning for Afghanistan's 2014 elections, as well as the prospect of a political settlement with the Taliban. Karzai has said repeatedly he will step down from power when his term ends in 2014, opening the way for new elections. Nato's scheduled end of the war was built around those plans, with foreign forces staying until the 2014 election but exiting the country by 2015. Obama and Karzai will discuss ways to ensure that political rivals can compete fairly in the run-up to the election, as well as ways to reduce fraud and support the winner who emerges, the official said. Past Afghan elections were riddled with irregularities, and the U.S. applied heavy pressure to Karzai to schedule a second round of voting during the last presidential contest in 2009. The runoff was never held because Karzai's challenger pulled out, protesting what he said was an impossible level of corruption. Discord: French president Francois Hollande (right) meets with Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen as he said French troops would withdraw by the end of the year . The election chapter opened a rift between the U.S. and Karzai, who suspected that the Obama administration wanted to replace him. The Obama administration has mostly repaired its relationship with Karzai, but mistrust remains on both sides. The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said before the meeting that Obama and Karzai also were to discuss prospects for a political settlement or peace pact between Karzai's government and the Taliban-led insurgency. The Taliban pulled out of U.S.-led talks in March, but separate talks among Afghan and other contacts continue, the U.S. official said. The official said Obama believes political reconciliation is essential to the country's future security. The Taliban is urging nations fighting in Afghanistan to follow France's lead and pull their international forces from the war this year. 'We call upon all the other NATO member countries to avoid working for the political interests of American officials and answer the call of your own people by immediately removing all your troops from Afghanistan,' the group said in a statement before the meeting. The insurgent group cited declining public support for the war in the West and said political leaders should listen to their constituents and get out of Afghanistan. The national security-focused Nato summit caps an extraordinary weekend of international summitry. Obama and the leaders of the world's leading industrial nations convened at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, for two days of talks focused in large part on Europe's economic crisis. Joining Obama and many of the G-8 leaders in Chicago are the heads of alliance nations and other countries with a stake in the Afghan war. Prominent among those nations is Pakistan. Tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan have been running high following several incidents, including the U.S. raid in Pakistan that led to the death of Osama bin Laden and a U.S. airstrike that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers. Both countries have been seeking to restore normal relations. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's acceptance of an invitation to attend the summit was seen as an indication that his country would reopen major roads used to supply Nato fighting forces in Afghanistan. White House officials said that while they believe an agreement on reopening the supply routes will be reached, they do not expect that to happen during the meetings. The two nations are haggling over how much Pakistan will be paid to allow the heavy transport truck to pass through. A senior U.S. official said the two sides are far apart. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. Officials have indicated that Obama and Zardari will not hold a separate bilateral meeting until the matter is resolved. Although miffed, Zardari is expected to see Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other U.S. officials in Chicago. 'I do hope that we will see a reopening of the transit routes in the very near future,' Rasmussen said. 'These negotiations will continue, but I am hopeful that they will be concluded in a positive manner.'",Tensions as French president Francois Hollande confirms he will withdraw country's troops by end of the year .

Small change: Christoffel Wiese, worth £3billion, had been on his way to Luxembourg with the cash . A billionaire who was discovered . leaving the country with nearly £700,000 in his luggage has won back the . cash from the UK Border Agency. Dr Christoffel Wiese, South Africa's . third richest man, was carrying £674,920 in used bank notes in his . suitcases at London City Airport as he checked in for a flight to . Luxembourg. Officials siezed the supermarket . baron's cash and a district judge later ordered its forfeiture, saying . it was probably derived from criminal money laundering. However, the High Court has now . ordered UKBA to hand back the money, ruling it 'unlikely' such a . fabulously wealthy man would muddy his hands with anything of the sort. Dr Wiese - who is aged in his . seventies and worth an estimated £3billion - is the largest single . shareholder in Africa's Shoprite supermarket chain and has investments . in mining and wine companies, according to Forbes. He was stopped by border officers in . April 2009 when a security check found £120,000 in his hand luggage and a . further search unearthed more than £500,000 in two bags he had checked . into the hold, the judge said. Dr Wiese told officers at the time the . money came from decades-old 'diamond deals' and had been kept in a . safety deposit box at London's Ritz hotel. He had been on his way to Luxembourg, a . financial jurisdiction noted for its secrecy and light tax regime, . where he said he intended to invest the money and return to London the . same day. A district judge ordered the . forfeiture of the money in 2010 finding that 'on the balance of . probabilities' the cash came from criminal money laundering. Challenging that decision, Dr Wiese's . barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, said the cash was not very much to a man . who earns £25million-a-year and represented only a 'minute fraction' of . his fortune. Suspicions aroused: Customs officials found £120,000 in Dr Wiese's hand luggage as he went to board a flight at London City Airport and more than £500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold, the High Court heard . Mr Justice Underhill revoked the . district judge's order, ruling it was 'unreasonable' to force Dr Wiese, . who has an entirely clean criminal record, to give up the money. The judge said: 'It is unlikely that a . businessman of previous good character, already enormously rich from . legitimate business, would become involved in money laundering. 'The fact is that the court was told . absolutely nothing which rendered it likely that Dr Wiese was engaged in . money laundering, save for the fact of his possession and attempt to . take out of the country a very large sum of used notes. 'As to that, there was an explanation which, although not credited, was plausible and, in my judgment, more plausible.' He added: 'It may be, in cases where . people are found carrying large sums of cash at the airport, that there . will be circumstances, including their refusal to explain their conduct . or lies told about the origin and purpose of the cash, which will render . an inference that the cash was obtained by money laundering legitimate. 'But, in the present case, there were no such circumstances and an entirely plausible alternative explanation was put forward.' UKBA will now have to return the seized cash, along with interest accrued on it over the past three years.

Argentine jail on suspicion of drug smuggling claims he is the victim of . a honey trap after being duped into believing he was starting a new . life with a Czech glamour model. Professor Paul Frampton was arrested in Buenos Aires after two kilos of cocaine were found in a suitcase he was carrying. The academic insists he thought the . case belonged to Denise Milani – an underwear model  who won the Miss . Bikini World title in 2007. The 68-year-old professor said he had been exchanging messages with someone he thought was the model on a dating website. After three months of correspondence, . Professor Frampton, who was teaching at the University of North . Carolina, agreed to meet his online ‘girlfriend’ in Bolivia before . flying back to the US to start a new life with her. But when no one turned up after ten days, he claims he was persuaded to travel to Argentina to catch up with her there instead. Despite being stood up a second time, . the professor says he agreed to carry a case he was told belonged to the . model to Brussels. Days later he was arrested. Prof Frampton believed he was chatting to bikini model Denise Milani, but it turned out to be a fraud . After languishing for six months in . jail, the Oxford graduate says he now believes the mafia tricked him . into carrying the drugs by posing as Miss Milani. The divorcee, who is described as . ‘naive’ by his ex-wife, said: ‘Perhaps I should have realised earlier . but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent. ‘I never thought these sorts of people existed. For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.’ The professor claims he was given the . suitcase at a hotel in Buenos Aires by an Hispanic-looking middle-aged . man who told him it belonged to the 32-year-old model. The person Prof Frampton claims to have been deceived by was using model Milani's pictures to con him . He told an . Argentine newspaper he planned to take the case to Brussels for a new . meeting with his ‘girlfriend’ but changed his mind and was arrested as . he tried to board a plane to Peru. There is no suggestion the model had . any involvement in the drugs smuggling plot – or knew the mafia was . allegedly using her identity. Professor Frampton, who is suffering . from lung problems following his enforced stay in prison, added: ‘The . person I thought was this woman told me she liked older men and was . tired of doing photo sessions.

Run down: The barren wasteland in Stratford, East London, before building work started on the new Olympic Stadium . The very first stage: Architect Rod Sheard with the model of the Olympic Stadium that he designed . Unrecognisable: An aerial image from 2006 shows the scale of the job . ahead for Olympic planners, as they prepared to change the Stratford . skyline by 2012 . Foundations laid: By 2008, the giant circular hole for the Olympic Stadium is clearly visible as the first signs of a venue take shape . Taking shape: In November 2008, the base of the Olympic Stadium was in place and huge steel structures were in position to form the rest of the arena . Working progress: The first section of the roof support for the Olympic stadium is erected in early 2009 . Towering high: April 2009, and the form of the Olympic Stadium, with its giant side beams, is beginning to dominate the Stratford skyline . Aerial images from 2005 show the extent of the task facing architects, engineers and Games planners, when a huge expanse of land in Stratford was put aside for the Olympic Park. Pictures charting the development of the site show how the facilities and infrastructure have gradually risen from the ground, including the spectacular Olympic Stadium, Velodrome Arena, Aquatics Centre and Westfield Shopping Centre. Even in 2001, years before London won the bid, what is now the Olympic site was a desolate, unloved barren wasteland ripe for redevelopment. Getting closer: With just over two years to go, this shot from May 2010 shows how the stadium and velodrome are almost completely finished, with attention turning to the surrounding park . Almost there: In June last year the park was almost completely finished, with extra pathways, tarmac around the stadium and the giant red ArcelorMittal Orbit structure the noticeable additions . Finished article: The now gleaming Olympic Park, along with the new basketball arena, velodrome (both top right) and athlete's village (right) sits ready to welcome the world . Ready to shine: The £550m Olympic Stadium will be the setting for tonight's spectacular Opening Ceremony . The £550 Olympic Stadium can hold 80,000 people, with its makers claiming the arena is the lightest Olympic stadium ever built. The waved roof of the stunning Aquatics centre, meanwhile, measures 12,000 square metres - one and a half times bigger than the Wembley Stadium pitch. The amount of earth excavated in order the built the swimming and diving arena was the equivalent of 160,000 tonnes of soil. Burgeoning: The next picture, taken by Ordnance .

'There was an incident in the play area with an older child and a . younger child which may have involved some sexual contact'.

"By . Hannah Roberts and Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 10:06 EST, 22 January 2012 . The family of Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, who died Thursday after an accident during a training session, launched a fundraising website to help collect money to cover the estimated $200,000 in medical bills. Burke, who was 29 at the time of her death and one of the top half-pipe athletes in the world, died at the Salt Lake City hospital where she was taken last week following the accident in Park City, Utah. She had sustained ‘irreversible damage to her brain due to lack of oxygen and blood after cardiac arrest’, according to a statement released by her publicist. Winning spirit: Burke celebrates on the podium after winning the women's halfpipe freestyle title at the World Cup finals in Valmalenco, Italy . True champion: Burke won many prizes but will be remembered as much for the legacy she left for women in superpipe skiing . Now faced with massive debt due to his late wife’s medical bills, donations have come flooding in to a website dedicated to helping Burke’s husband Rory Bushfield pay for the expenses. Though originally the costs were originally estimated to be around $500,000, they were updated and lowered to $200,000. By Saturday morning, the site had already raised $246,701 which cleared all of her medical costs. ‘Due to the outpouring of love and support, enough funds have been raised to cover the anticipated costs related to Sarah’s medical care based on the numbers received from the hospital,’ the site read. There are potential complications with Sarah’s insurance coverage because she was treated in an American hospital as a Canadian citizen, and because she is only contractually covered by her health insurance when competing in a sanctioned event. Fatal accident: Sarah Burke crashed on the same halfpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury in 2009 . Sarah died after an accident on a training run for an event sponsored by Monster Energy Drink. She fell on the Eagle Superpipe in Salt Lake City, Utah, after performing a trick known as a Flat Spin 540. Peter Judge, the CEO of Canada's freestyle team, said the injury was due to a 'freak accident' after a trick that was well within her capabilities. He said she performed that stunt ‘many, many times,’ and it ‘was certainly in the realm of her skill capabilities.’ ‘This injury was one - it was more of a freak accident than one caused by anything in specific terms,’ he continued. ‘It was more of a fluke outcome. Safety was paramount to her.’ A four-time Winter X Games champion, she crashed on the same half-pipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training accident on December 31, 2009. As a result of her fall, Burke tore her vertebral artery, which led to severe bleeding on the brain, causing her to go into cardiac arrest on the scene, according to publicist Nicole Wool. Miss Wool said Burke's organs and tissues were donated, as she had wanted. The statement said: 'The family expresses their heartfelt gratitude for the international outpouring of support they have received from all the people Sarah touched.'

A judge has ordered Daniel Morrissey, a father with a lengthy criminal record, to be placed in a pre-trial supervision program a week after his 10-year-old daughter and her 8-year-old cousin vanished. Morrissey’s sister-in-law, Tammy . Brousseau, also said that Iowa authorities have already accused the . 36-year-old and told him they had proof of his connection. The change means Morrissey, 36, who has been free on bond for other charges, will be . supervised by parole officers who will make sure he shows up in court . and does not violate the terms of his release. Scroll Down for Video . Estranged: Lyric's parents, Misty and Dan Morrissey, have chequered criminal pasts; a judge has ruled that the estranged couple can be near each other for public events concerning the investigation . Missing: Eight-year-old Elizabeth Collins, left, . and 10-year-old Lyric Cook disappeared while riding their bikes not far . from Elizabeth's home in Evansdale, Iowa . This news comes as a judge also ruled . that he and his estranged wife Misty, the mother of missing 10-year-old . girl Lyric Cook-Morrissey, are to have no contact during the duration of . the trial, except when they most appear in public together during the . investigation. Ms Brousseau told reporters: ‘They . told him they had proof that he did it. They found out a couple of . family members have a criminal history, so they’re focusing really hard . on them.’ Sh also revealed that an attorney advised the couple to stop talking to . reporters, discontinue television interviews and not agree to take any . more polygraph tests. Morrissey is the father of . 10-year-old Lyric Cook-Morrissey, who vanished near an Evansdale lake . while riding bikes with her cousin, 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins. Their . bikes were later found on a path near Meyers Lake. A special 10-member FBI dive team . used sonar equipment on a boat for hours Friday to search the 26-acre . lake. Divers waded through the water looking for evidence but did not . appear to go beneath the surface. By mid-afternoon, an FBI truck and . many other police officers had left and little search activity was going . on. Black Hawk County prosecutor Brad Walz . petitioned to place Morrissey under supervision Thursday, the day . authorities said he and his wife had stopped cooperating with . investigators. Walz cited Morrissey's arrests on methamphetamine-related . charges and noted Iowa law allows a person on bond who is considered 'a . habitual felon' to remain under supervision as a condition of release. Extra search: An FBI squad today searched Meyers Lake for missing children Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth Collins, 8, who disappeared last week in Iowa . On the hunt: The special 10-member FBI dive team used sonar equipment on a boat for hours Friday to scour the 26-acre lake . The order issued by Senior Judge Jon . Fister on Thursday said the sheriff's office should deliver the . supervision notice personally to Morrissey, who was directed to report . to corrections officials immediately after receiving it. Messages left . for Morrissey's defense lawyer were not returned. Morrissey has been charged with . possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, conspiracy to . manufacture methamphetamine and other crimes. He posted bond and was . released in May. Walz said Morrissey should have been . placed under supervision then, but he declined comment on what prompted . Thursday's order. He said Morrissey faces five charges that carry . 45-year prison terms each. Court records from Black Hawk County, . Iowa show that both parents have multiple drug convictions and Misty . was sentenced to four years in federal prison for helping to run a . methamphetamine drug ring. Indeed, . the couple have said that they have been questioned repeatedly by . police investigating the disappearance of their daughter saying, 'You . tell them the truth and they say, 'You're holding something back,' and . you're not.' The . Evansdale couple has commented that the extensive nature of the police . inquiry has made them feel like they were under investigation in the . case of missing Lyric and Elizabeth. Memento: Crime tape ropes off the lake; two flowers were also added as a nod to the missing cousins . Abandoned? The girls' bikes were found last Friday afternoon near a bike trail at the edge of the lake . 'It made me feel like, 'Yeah, they're looking at me like a suspect,' said Morrissey to ABC News. Misty . was only released from prison on May 30 after serving time for nine . different crimes, including illegal drug use, association with persons . involved in criminal activity, excessive alcohol use and failure to . comply with drug testing. In . addition, eight years prior to that in 2003, Misty was sentenced to . four years in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture . and distribute methamphetamine. The sentence was later commuted to five months in prison and a full year of supervised release. Other criminal convictions belonging to Misty include a 1998 ticket for having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle and in 1997 she entered a guilty plea for making a false report to police, a crime which cost her six days in prison. Morrissey is facing a September trial in Black Hawk County after his arrests for drug possession that date from last year. A look back into court records reveals the depths into which Misty had fallen as she became involved in the meth trade. Working for a David Mickelson, her former boss at the BIG Ten Mart in Waterloo, Iowa, Misty was a key member of the drugs ring eight years ago. 'Cook testified that she obtained pseudoephedrine pills from various people and provided them to Scott Reavis, who used them to make methamphetamine,' court records stated to the Des Moines Register . In fact, Morrissey stormed out of a long interview with law enforcement officials after they point blank accused him of killing Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, the girl's grandmother said. 'Yeah, there's history in our family, but it's not a history that we're scared of,' said 36-year-old Misty. Close: The girls, pictured in 2009, would often spend the day together when Lyric's mother was at work and were very close . 'It's one we've dealt with. It's one we've come past and we've come past it as a family so no matter what anybody thinks about it, it's not one that has anything to do with you know, the disappearance of our children.' Rallying against the speculation that she and Morrissey may have been responsible for the deaths of Lyric and Elizabeth, Misty was adamant that their focus should be elsewhere. 'We want everybody in the main part of the criminal investigation who has the authority or the power to do things and make decisions, we want them focused on our girls and what might have happened to them,' said Misty. 'You know but if looking into our history is what's needed then that's fine, too.' The revelations of the couples criminal past comes as the spotlight falls on the investigation into the disappearance of their daughter and Elizabeth Collins. In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday morning, Misty explained how extensively they have been questioned by the police. Dan Morrissey leans on a tree . near Meyers Lake where his daughter Lyric and her cousin Elizabeth . Collins disappeared last week . 'We've done extensive interviews, hours at a time,' said Misty. 'We've done polygraphs. We have taken many phone calls, answered many questions,' adding that all of her phone data has been turned over to authorities. An FBI expert and former special agent believes that law enforcement is looking at every angle they can in the case. 'What comes into question is how does that play into what is presently going on in their lives?' said Brad Garrett. 'And more particular, does it have any relationship to these two missing girls?' Desperate search: Authorities look for possible . evidence at Meyers Lake where Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth . Collins, 8, disappeared last Friday . It has also been revealed that in the week's before both girl's going missing, Misty and Daniel were having issues at home and were preparing to file for divorce. 'They are not a couple,' said Misty's sister Tammy Brousseau to ABC News. 'They are currently separated and maybe well on the way to a divorce.' Daniel Morrissey also told reporters of his battle to keep a cool head during this stressful time. 'I'll tell you something about emotions,' said Morrissey. 'A lot of people base their decisions off emotions and it doesn't work out too well. They're angry, they make a bad decision, whatever.' He continued: 'So emotions I try to keep control of and keep my head straight. 'During this time, it's definitely challenging, but I have to keep my mind right.' Despite the interest from the authorities, Misty and Morrissey have cooperated fully with their investigation. 'They are still continuing to cooperate with us as we would expect,' said Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ricj Abben. When asked about Morrissey and Misty feeling like suspects in their own daughters disappearance, Abben said he was unsure why. Search: This poster was issued to complement rescue efforts by around 400 officials and volunteers . 'I don't know why he feels that way,' said Abben. 'We expect cooperation from everyone - 100 percent cooperation. So I don't know why he feels that way.' Heather and Drew Collins, Elizabeth’s parents, have minor offenses in their backgrounds, an online check of court records shows. Elizabeth and Lyric were last seen on Friday, riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale, Iowa. When they never returned home, hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, and their bikes were found next to Meyers Lake. More than 350 volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past several days but have found nothing.","Family member said police suspect father Daniel Morrissey's involvement in disappearance of daughter and niece and have 'proof' against him .

A Playboy model and alleged prostitute who sued Oscar De La Hoya after claiming he had imprisoned her in his hotel suite has failed in her fight for $5million compensation from the boxer. Angelica Marie Cecora, 25, said that Mr De La Hoya had repeatedly demanded sex when she was trying to sleep after a drug-fuelled orgy at a Manhattan hotel.

Ms Cecora claimed that after dinner with the married ex-boxer on March 15 last year, the pair retired to his room in the Ritz-Carlton hotel overlooking Central Park. After consensual sex, Mr De La Hoya, 38, put on Ms Cecora’s underwear and ordered drugs to his room at New York's Ritz Hotel, the lawsuit said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:53 EST, 5 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:10 EST, 6 April 2012 . Crazed: Letters that serial killer David Alen Gore wrote detail a deeply disturbed mind . Serial killer David Alan Gore has bragged about raping and murdering four teenagers and two women. In chilling correspondence, Gore sent around 200 pages worth of letters to a man named Tony Ciaglia, who wrote Gore and other serial killers after a severe head injury as a teenager in an effort to better understand them. In one, Gore described step-by-step how he and his cousin abducted two 14-year-old friends and sexually assaulted them. His killings took place in the Vero Beach area of Florida 30 years ago. He began exchanging letters with Gore about five years ago, receiving about 200 pages in all. 'I drug both bodies into the woods where I disposed of them. 'Oh and you can believe, I collected hair. It took a couple days to recover from that. It was a perfect experience,' Gore wrote. In another letter, Gore described his uncontrollable desire to kill. 'It's sort of along the lines as being horny. You start getting horny and it just keeps building until you have to get some relief,' Gore wrote. 'That is the same with the URGE to kill. It usually starts out slow and builds and you will take whatever chances necessary to satisfy it. And believe me, you constantly think about getting caught, but the rush is worth the risk.' Gruesome: Gore detailed how he gutted one victim and put her intestine on the table, and put a smiley face at the end of the sentence . Life too short: Lynn Elliot was 17 when she was abducted, raped, and murdered by Gore . Several people have made sure the boasting did not go unnoticed. There was the Las Vegas man who wrote to Gore, an author who published the inmate's grotesque letters, and a newspaper columnist and editorial board who brought the case to the attention of Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Republican promptly signed the death warrant even though more than 40 other men have been on death row longer; Gore is set to die April 12. 'Those letters are so disturbing and so insightful into who this person is ...,' said Pete Earley, who recently published some of the letters in his book 'Serial Killer Whisperer.' 'Gore, actually, he talked his way into the death chamber.' Gore also wrote about picking up Lynn Elliot, 17, and a 14-year-old friend, who were hitchhiking near the beach on July 26, 1983. Through the years: Gore has been on death row since 1984; his execution date has been pushed up to April 12 in part because of the graphic boasting in his letters . Pen pal: In a series of letters, Gore detailed the specifics of his horrific crimes . Strangely polite: Gore said in one letter: 'Please feel free to ask ANY question you want about anything. You can NOT offend me in any way' Gore and his cousin, Fred Waterfield, took them back to Gore's home, where the girls were bound. Waterfield left, and Gore raped both. Ms Elliot was able to free her feet and, with hands still tied, ran naked from the house. Gore, also naked, chased her and shot her twice in the head. A boy riding a bicycle saw the murder. The boy’s mother called 911 and the 14-year-old was rescued. 'I drug both bodies into the woods where I disposed of them. Oh and you can believe, I collected hair. It took a couple days to recover from that. It was a perfect experience.' After being arrested for Ms Elliot's murder, Gore confessed to the other killings. He led authorities to the remains of all but 14-year-old Angelica Lavallee, who hasn't been found. Waterfield was convicted of manslaughter in Elliot's death and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was later convicted in two of the other murders and is serving back-to-back life sentences. Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers columnist Russ Lemmon, who has written about the Gore case for a couple of years, published a column for a few newspapers in south-eastern Florida on the day the editorial board had an interview with the governor. They talked about the case, the book and read Scott an excerpt from an email from one of Elliott's relatives. The board asked Scott if he had considered signing Gore's death warrant. The governor promised to look into it. Meanwhile, letters poured into Scott's office, many of them mentioning the correspondence. More victims: Gore was convicted of killing 14-year-old Barbara Ann Byer, left, and Judy Kay Daley, right, who was 35 . Neater: He also typed up letters to pen pals outside of prison . 'Pete Earley provides compelling evidence that David Gore relishes every detail of his heinous murders,' wrote Ralph Sexton, whose nephew was married to one of the women killed. About a month after the editorial board meeting, Scott signed Gore's death warrant. A spokeswoman for Scott said he had not read the book. Gore's attorneys are now appealing, arguing in part that the governor's decision to sign the warrant was unfairly influenced by the editorial board. Lisa Burford, who was friends with Ms Elliott, credited friends and relatives of the victims for continuing to press for Gore's execution. 'The timing of the book just happened to work out perfectly. That is the bonus of the book, is that it gave all of us more ammunition and more fire to see this through to the end,' Ms Burford said. Mr Ciaglia said Gore blamed him after the death warrant was signed. 'He was hearing that I used him,' Mr Ciaglia said. 'He said, `It's water under the bridge, Tony, but I'm just kind of surprised. I didn't think you would do that.' Abducted: Elliot and a 14-year-old friend were trying to hitchhike to Florida's Vero Beach when they were kidnapped by Gore . Ciaglia doesn't want credit. He's opposed to the death penalty. 'I told him that I did not actively pursue it. That there's a lot of people - because you did some really, really bad things - there's a lot of people that hate you and they want to see you executed and they used these letters to get people's attention as to the horrible crimes that you committed,' Mr Ciaglia said. Similarly, Earley isn't taking credit. 'The only person you can blame is Gore himself. His candour and his lack of compassion, empathy and remorse is stomach churning,' he said. Gore corresponded with Mr Ciaglia and others for some time - most of the letter's contents are too graphic. In one, he tells of how he raped and murdered young girls in the 1980s.'I drug both bodies into the woods where I disposed of them. 'Oh and you can believe, I collected hair. It took a couple days to recover from that. It was a perfect experience,' Gore wrote. In another letter, Gore described his uncontrollable desire to kill. 'It's . sort of along the lines as being horny. You start getting horny and it . just keeps building until you have to get some relief,' Gore wrote. 'That . is the same with the URGE to kill. It usually starts out slow and . builds and you will take whatever chances necessary to satisfy it. And . believe me, you constantly think about getting caught, but the rush is . worth the risk.' In yet another piece of correspondence, he described what it was like to open up his victim's stomach. 'At the drop of a hat, or (sic) slip her stomach open and not think nothing of it. Once I sliced open her stomach, I’d reach in and pull her intestine and all out. Sometimes I’d put all her intestine on a table and dissect each (of) them just to see what it all looked like. I’ve probably seen things even Drs. Haven’t seen :) '","David Alan Gore sentenced to death for murders of six women in the 1980s .

Nearly two years after his Rutgers University roommate Tyler Clementi committed suicide, Dharun Ravi apologized for using a webcam to spy on Clementi's intimate encounter with another man. Ravi called his actions 'thoughtless, immature and stupid,' but maintained he didn't target Clementi because he was gay and said he didn't act out of bigotry or hatred of gays. This was the first time the 24-year-old has apologized for his role in the September 2010 case that drew national attention to the bullying of gay teens. Mea culpa: For the first time in nearly two years, Dharun Ravi, seen here at his sentencing earlier this month, has issued an apology for spying on his Rutgers University roommate . Tragic: Tyler Clementi (left) and Ravi were freshman roommates at Rutgers University. Ravi admitted to recording Clementi's encounter with another man in their room on September 19, 2010 . Ravi was convicted in March of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence after a highly-publicized trial. A judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail. In the written statement, released through his lawyer, Ravi said he would turn himself in Thursday to begin serving his sentence. 'I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010,' he wrote. 'My behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone affected by those choices.' Too lenient? Prosecutors are appealing the 30-day sentence Judge Glenn Berman handed down and arguing Ravi should have to serve five to seven years in prison . Last Monday, I was sentenced to 3 years probation, 300 hours of community service, a fine of more than $10,000.00, and 30 days in jail. Since the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office appealed that sentence, the sentence does not have to start until the appeal is decided. Nevertheless, I decided to accep and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It’s the only way I can go on with my life. I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010. My behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone affected by those choices. I am surrendering myself to the Middlesex County Correctional Facility on Thursday, May 31, 2012, to start my 30-day period of imprisonment. Ravi maintains he is innocent of committing any crime. Prosecutors are appealing the sentence, . saying Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman was far too . lenient when he gave Ravi just a month in jail. They say Ravi should have been sentenced to the standard five to seven years -- more than 85 times longer than his current term. With good behavior, Ravi could be out in as few as 20 days, the Newark Star-Ledger reports. The mea culpa added that Ravi didn't have to start his sentence until after the prosecution's appeal, but he wanted to get the jail time over with. 'It's the only way I can go on with my life,' he wrote in his statement. On September 19, 2010, Clementi, 18, asked Ravi, his new college roommate, if he could have their dorm room to himself. Ravi left, but set up a webcam and watched Clementi's romantic encounter with another man. Two days later, when Clementi asked for the use of the dorm room again, Ravi set up the webcam a second time and advertised on Twitter that he planned to broadcast the encounter to other students in his dorm. Police say that when Clementi learned the next day that his intimate moments have been recorded, he set his Facebook status to 'Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.' His body was recovered in the Hudson River a week later near the George Washington Bridge. Clementi's suicide was mentioned only a few times during Ravi's trial because prosecutors couldn't make the case that the spying led to Clementi's decision to kill himself.","Former Rutgers University student says his actions were 'immature and stupid' but not 'bigoted or hateful'

The mother of missing 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, who disappeared almost two months ago, sent her love to her daughter today in a heartbreaking Mother’s Day message. Marlene LaMar described her daughter as a ‘miracle baby’ in the message which she posted on the website set up to help find the Californian cheerleader, who vanished on March 16 as she left to catch the school bus. 'Sierra is my miracle baby. I was told that because of my age, the likelihood of getting pregnant was slim,' Mrs LaMar wrote.' I knew she was going to be strong-willed the moment the doctor saw on the ultrasound that she was doing somersaults in utero.' Devastating: Marlene LaMar, left, described her missing daughter Sierra as her 'miracle baby' in a heart-breaking Mother's Day message - the 15-year-old disappeared almost two months ago . 'The greatest gift that God has blessed me with is the joy of being a mom to two beautiful daughters,' she added. 'I love you Danielle and Sierra and I’m so proud to be your mom.' Fresh hope of finding the teen came last week when investigators seized a red Volkswagen Jetta believed to be connected in her disappearance. A search for the four-door sedan car began after it was captured on several surveillance videos close to the missing teen's Morgan Hill, California home and the area where authorities recovered some of her belongings. Seized: A red Volkswagen Jetta connected to the disappearance of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar is now in custody of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's department . The video isn’t clear enough for investigators to make out anyone inside the car and they are appealing for people with information to come forward, ABC News reported. They are interested in speaking to anyone who may have come in contact with the car or occupants in the month of March. Mystery: Sierra disappeared on the walk to her school bus stop March 16 in Morgan Hill, California . In April, the desperate hunt for the missing cheerleader was thwarted by an internet hacker, who used her Twitter account to write: ‘By the way, we do punch’ followed by an expletive. The cryptic hoax message sparked outrage from some of the more than 4,500 people who follow her at twitter.com/cccairuh and was quickly removed, according to Mercury News. Last week the search continued underwater after sonar images revealed suspicious-looking objects in a local reservoir. Sierra's cellphone was found near the side of the road the day after she vanished and her Juicy brand black and pink purse with clothes folded neatly inside was found the day after that. Earlier that month an underwater search at the Chesbro reservoir produced sonar images that revealed suspicious-looking objects in a local reservoir, KTVU-TV reported. Sierra's cellphone was found near the side of the road the day after she vanished and her Juicy brand black and pink purse with clothes folded neatly inside was found the day after that. Because of the murky and dangerous conditions, and two feet of visibility, divers had to be strapped to police on land by rope. Divers, who went as deep as 60-feet, also searched the nearby Uvas Reservoir in Santa Clara County. Detectives uncovered a golf ball and a flipper but there was no sign of Sierra, although her family is refusing to give up hope. The parents of the missing teen are offering a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her. Hope: Sierra LaMar's twitter account had not been updated since she went missing, until a post appeared on Wednesday - giving friends and family false hope she was trying to make contact . Donations: Sierra's family has scraped the $10,000 reward money together through fundraising and donations, the teen's father Steve said . The 15-year-old's mother Marlene, father . Steve and sister Danielle have set up a website dedicated to . finding the cheerleader. Mrs LaMar told ABC7 news that her daughter's disappearance was weighing heavily on her. 'As each day goes on it's agonising,' she said. 'I'm definitely suffering sleep deprivation but I need to focus on the belief that Sierra is going to come forward.' Police believe Sierra has been . kidnapped as she does not have a history of running away and no family . problems. Interviews with friends and a search . of her computer also yielded no information indicating she had fled. Her disappearance has sparked an outpouring of support from the local community and received nation-wide press coverage. Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith also joined the search. Website: The 15-year-old's father Steve, mother Marlene and sister Danielle have also set up a website dedicated to finding the cheerleader . Disturbing: Divers from the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office searched the Chesbro Reservoir after sonar pictures detected areas of concern . Speaking . at a press conference over Easter weekend, Mr LaMar, a computer . engineer at a . tech startup in Sunnyvale, expressed his gratitude at the overwhelming . support the family had received from local residents. 'Everyone's been . so generous,' he said. Yesterday . the family launched the Help Us Find Sierra LaMar website, which . describes Sierra as a 'confident teenager who stands up for not only . herself but others as well'. It also hosts a gallery of pictures and allows friends . to post messages to Sierra. 'The world has seemed so out of . balance since you’ve been gone,' wrote Jenna Wondka. 'I’m missing you . more and more every day, you never leave my mind. You’re too young and . innocent for this to be happening. You’ve always been there for me and . I’ll always be here for you until you’re found and anytime after that.' The family is also accepting donations via the site. They have raised the $10,000 reward money through fundraising and donations, Mr LaMar said. 'We're hoping it might give someone the . motivation to come forward,' he said. 'We're desperate for anything that . can bring her home to us.' Poignant: Posters have been taped up near to where Sierra went missing, as her family hope for more clues . Search: Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area . Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map . As well as the red car the search has turned up an . empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms, found by a search volunteer . within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's phone and purse were found, days after she disappeared. Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police, or it could be a simple coincidence. 'The sheriff’s office will be . sending out deputies on motor dirt bikes later this week to canvass . remote/rural areas in south Santa Clara County areas,' Sgt Jose . Cardoza, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Office of the Sheriff, told the Huffington Post. If Sierra has been killed, her body is likely to be above ground, Sgt Cardoza said. 'Someone like that is not . going to dig a grave,' he said. 'He drove her out someplace and the body . will likely be in a ditch or (easily accessible) location.' He added her abductor could be a serial rapist or perhaps even a serial killer and a person likely familiar with the local area. School: In April sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scent at her mother's driveway Sierra's cell phone was recovered in a field nearby the day after her disappearance . Growing concern: Sierra's purse containing neatly folded clothes was also found two days after her disappearance .

Once the hotel of choice for Charlie Chaplin, Coco Chanel and Princess Diana, it will close on Wednesday after it failed to win France’s coveted ‘palace’ top luxury destination. Owned by Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al Fayed, the 114-year-old landmark hotel is in dire need of revamp, industry insiders say. Closing its doors: Ritz Paris will close tomorrow for two years for a 140 million Euro renovation which includes the refurbishment Coco Chanel suite (pictured) and its other 159 rooms . Vanguelis Panayotis, head of development at the MKG Group hospitality consultancy said: ‘It was a waste to see a hotel with such a location, with such a history, in a state like this. ‘To justify this kind of price, you really have to offer quality on a par with the competition.’ With cables hanging down in full view from its flat screen televisions and ageing elevators and dumbwaiters, a Ritz spokeswoman admitted the hotel has some sprucing up to do to match the competition. Modern-day Marie Antoinette: Kate Moss modelled for a Vogue spread in the Coco Chanel suite in March before the revamp which will last until mid 2014 . In dire need: Industry insiders say the Ritz Paris needs a face-lift after it failed to win France's coveted top luxury destination . For closing night tonight, chef . Michel Roth has put on a special €240 menu with dishes such as foie gras, blue lobster . in raspberry vinaigrette with caviar and the Ritz's signature peach . melba. The . hotel was virtually booked out for Monday night, mostly to regulars, . for prices ranging from €850 to €10,000 for the Coco Chanel suite. The refurbishment, which will last until mid 2014, includes fitting out its 160 rooms with the ‘latest technology’ and a new garden restaurant. All the bedrooms will be redecorated but they would stay traditional in style, in its trademark tones of pink, almond green, yellow and sky blue the spokeswoman said. Last night: Princess Diana stayed at the hotel with lover Dodi Al Fayed before the car crash that killed them in 1997 . Favourite: Ritz Paris was the Parisian hotel of choice for comic actor Charlie Chaplin (left) and fashion designer Coco Chanel who lived at the hotel for some 35 years . Like the rest of the luxury industry, the high end hotel sector is booming thanks to demand from emerging markets. Paris has also seen US clients flood back to take advantage of a weaker Euro. Two state-of-the-art Asian luxury hotels opened in the French capital in 2010, the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental, raising the stakes for historic players like the Ritz. Another established Paris hotel, the nearby Crillon, is closing for renovations in the autumn. The Bristol and Meurice hotels have already had face-lifts, the Plaza-Athenee is working on an extension, and the Royal Monceau underwent a full refurbishment under its new Qatari ownership from 2008 to 2010. Founded in 1898 by Cesar Ritz and the chef Auguste Escoffier, the Ritz is home to L'Espadon restaurant, holder of two Michelin stars and the Ritz-Escoffier cooking school.

A former accountant is facing jail after he admitted stealing £500,000 from a church and a religious charity while working as a volunteer. Stephen Methuen, 57, abused his position of trust while working as a treasurer for his local evangelical church and an international relief charity. A court heard Methuen fiddled the accounts of Amblecote Christian Centre in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where he had been a member for 16 years as well as the Christian International Relief Mission over a six year period. His dishonesty was only discovered . when Adrian Lowe - the church’s senior pastor and a personal friend of . Metheun - noticed irregularities while carrying out a financial . assessment. Police were called in and the subsequent investigation uncovered the extent of his Metheun’s massive fraud. Methuen . pleaded guilty to 12 charges of false accounting committed to disguise . embezzlement while treasurer at both organisations at Wolverhampton . Crown Court yesterday. He also admitted a further four offences of cheating the revenue by submitting over-inflated Gift Aid repayment claims. Methuen, 57, fiddled the accounts while treasurer at Amblecote Christian Centre in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where he had been a member for 16 years . Judge Michael Dudley adjourned the case and warned Methuen, from Wordsley, West Midlands, to expect a jail sentence. After the case Mr Lowe, from Amblecote Christian Centre, said today: 'It’s a very sad day. 'Not only was Steve trusted by the congregation as a volunteer but he was also a personal friend. 'He occupied a position of absolute trust which was abused.

'In all honesty and with the benefit of hindsight we placed naive trust in Steve, and obviously, in retrospect, should not have been so trusting where money was involved. 'We are grateful for the continuing support both of our congregation and our community partners.

Testing electrical activity of the heart using an electrocardiogram is unlikely to help doctors figure out who is at risk of coronary heart disease, according to recommendations from a U.S. government-backed panel. The United States Preventive Services Task Force claims that there is no good evidence the test, also known as an ECG, helps doctors predict heart risks any better than traditional considerations such as smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people with no symptoms. 'It could potentially be helpful if we had evidence that doing a test like an ECG or an exercise ECG would better classify the people who are at high risk' of heart disease, said Joy Melnikow, a member of the task force from the University of California, Davis. 'Ineffective': Electrocardiograms, or ECG tests, are unlikely to help doctors pinpoint who is at risk of heart problems, researchers claim (file picture) 'Then we could intervene more actively with the very high-risk group which has the highest potential to benefit.' The task force, which published a statement in the Annals of Internal Medicine, recommends against ECG screening of people considered at low risk for heart disease and says there's not enough information to rule one way or the other on those at intermediate or high risk. On the other hand, there are both costs and possible harms associated with screening healthy adults, Melnikow said. Blood pressure tests such as this one could be just as effective as an ECG in detecting heart problems, it is claimed . 'The concern is that if people are already at low risk of heart disease and they have one of those tests, if they have an abnormality on the test it's more likely it will be a false-positive result,' she added. 'But an abnormal result, whether a false positive or true positive, generally leads to additional testing, and it's the additional tests that could have some risk.' While ECGs themselves are inexpensive and non-invasive, the follow-up tests can involve passing a tube through the heart or other more intensive, costly procedures. The new recommendations are an update of the USPSTF's 2004 guidelines, which also called for no screening in low-risk adults and said there was insufficient evidence to assess the risks and benefits for screening intermediate- and high-risk people. Melnikow said that instead of asking for tests, people concerned about their heart health can discuss diet, lifestyle and family history risks with their doctor, who can then use a risk calculator to determine their chance of getting heart disease - and treat them appropriately. 'Everyone can benefit from being physically active,' she said. 'Everyone can benefit from not smoking, and people can discuss with their doctors whether they could benefit from taking medication to lower their blood pressure or lower their cholesterol.'","Looking at smoking and cholesterol levels could be just as effective as ECGs, researchers claim ."

San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro will deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in September, the first Latino given the prime-time speaking slot on the opening night of the political gathering. Mr Castro, 37, is a rising star among Democrats, with some political insiders predicting he could be the first Hispanic president of the United . States. The speech promises to raise Mr Castro's profile on the national political stage, following in the footsteps of Barack Obama, who delivered the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 when he was an Illinois State Senator and candidate for U.S. Senate. Scroll down for video . The next big thing: San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro (speaking in June) will offer a rallying cry to Democrats as the keynote speaker at the convention in September . Where it all began: Barack Obama (with wife Michelle) launched his meteoric rise in politics with his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention . Mr Obama wowed Democrats with his 2004 remarks, dubbed 'The Speech,' and four years later he returned to the party's convention to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. 'Being the keynote speaker at the convention this year is an honor I don’t take lightly,' Mr Castro said in a three-minute YouTube video, released Tuesday to announce his upcoming speaking gig. 'I know I’ve got some big shoes to fill,' he added. First Lady Michelle Obama will also speak to delegates on the opening night of the convention,  which kicks off September 4 in Charlotte, North . Carolina. Striking similarities can be seen between Mr Castro and President Obama -- both came from working . class homes, ascended to the ranks of The Ivy League and entered . politics in their mid-thirties. What a difference four years makes: Barack Obama nabbed the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 . With an undergraduate degree from Stanford and a law degree from . Harvard, Castro was elected mayor of his native San Antonio in 2009 and . won a landslide reelection in 2011 with 83 per cent of the vote. The decision to highlight Mr Castro at . the convention is a strategic move by Democrats to mobilize Latinos, who . have traditionally shown lackluster turnout at the polls, for the November presidential election. Democrats will go head-to-head with Republicans in battleground states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada, where the Latino vote could heavily influence the outcome. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been courting Latino voters for the GOP, while George P. Bush (right) has worked to galvanize the Latino and youth vote . Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, is also courting Latinos with the help of Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and George P. Bush, the charismatic son of former Florida Governor  Jeb . Bush and his wife, Columba, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen. A recent poll shows that Latino support for Mr Obama has jumped to 70 per cent, with the surge credited to the President's ruling against the deportation of certain young illegal immigrants. Mr Romney only secured 22 per cent support among Latino voters, according to the poll conducted by Latino Decisions.","San Antonio mayor Julian Castro will speak the first night of the Democratic National Convention .

And the Mayans were right - the Four Horsemen are galloping towards consoles, here to enslave humankind in front of their TVs for eternity. Darksiders II follows on directly from the brilliant 2010 original, which tells the tale of the Four Horsemen getting into trouble for starting the Apocalypse early. Naughty Horsemen... Fight to the Death: He may be a Horseman, but Death will be put through his paces . War, who you play in the first game, has been convicted by the Charred Council for the blunder, and is sent back to Earth as punishment. However, knowing his brother would never do such a thing, Death – the main protagonist in Darksiders II  – flies into a rage, and sets out to clear his sibling’s name. Defying the council, Death travels to the Nether Realms, a place between Heaven and Hell, to call in some favours from some powerful friends who dwell there. Starting the demo, we played as Death rode his trusty horse up a snowy peak – battling some ice monsters on the way. What’s immediately evident is how good the game looks. The art direction, in particular, is superb. That’s no surprise, as the creative director is Joe Madureira, a comic book artist behind the likes of  The Ultimates and X-Men. Ice to see you: Just one of the beasts you'll face . As Death galloped through the jagged icy valleys, snow glistened from mountains far away, the impressive draw distance pushing along a real sense of scale. Indeed, for an agent of doom, Death looked remarkably vulnerable and exposed in his surroundings. The sound is masterful, too. Choirs bellow in the background, creating a haunting ambiance while reinforcing the epic task that Death faces. Then there’s the combat – which plays like a mix of God of War and Zelda. You’ll hack away with one of the buttons, occasionally adding a more powerful attack with the other. It’s simple, but hit detection is excellent and Death’s weapons deal some awesome damage. This is made all the more convincing by Death’s glorious animations. He’ll bob, weave and flip over enemies like an angel of destruction. We even got to fight a couple of the game’s bosses. Our favourite was the huge ice monster at the end of demo. Again, gameplay is kept exciting as the beast throws out various kinds of attacks – forcing you to evade and counter. Wilderness: Death rides his trusty steed through the barren mountains . The action looks great, too – the camera always giving you the best view of the carnage right up until the final, deadly blow. The end of days can’t come soon enough.

When the confirmations finally came through, UBS and other market makers were left owning large amounts of unwanted Facebook stock, which led to losses as the stock plunged. It also is unclear what role UBS's own trading system might have played in the losses or what action the company will take to recoup the $356million. 'There may be limitations on recoveries UBS may receive,' said former SEC lawyer Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg LLC in New York. 'That said, it is such a black eye for the Nasdaq that they're highly motivated in resolving all litigation before it spins further out of control.' Grim news: Swiss bank UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti pictured addressing reporters Tuesday; UBS said its net profit shrank to $433million, hit by a slump in trading and a $536m loss on the glitch-ridden market debut of Facebook . Down and out: Hit by lower trading revenue and fewer commissions and client fees, Switzerland's largest bank said the 58 percent net profit drop reflects 'challenging conditions marked by increased volatility and greater client caution' WHAT WENT WRONG . At the heart of the problems was, by all accounts, a communication issue. For nearly 20 minutes on the morning Facebook opened, a phone call that was supposed to keep traders informed was silent, with no information coming through. But on the line with the order desk at Nasdaq, market makers were being told to keep sending orders. Those should have been processed when Facebook debuted. But once shares started trading, confirmations on many of those orders, usually delivered in milliseconds, never came. Market makers later learned some orders were lost, and others were not processed at the open, but were filled hours later. Market participants calling the exchange to find out what was going on said they encountered wait times of up to an hour -- if their calls were answered at all. That caused confusion about how many shares a market maker actually held, and led to some of the re-ordering that caused UBS's losses. Worth the hype? Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, center, applauded after ringing the opening bell on May 18, the day of Facebook's IPO . When the order confirmations did not come back to UBS from Nasdaq quickly, the systems designed to ensure customers get the best execution and proper trade execution -- something required by regulations governing firms like UBS -- were forced to scan the firm's limit order books repeatedly in order to comply with regulations, said two sources with knowledge of the situation. Overwhelmed by the order message backup, UBS's systems slowed even more, as did the systems at some other market makers, the sources said. Adding to the problem, after Facebook began trading, investors watched as the stock's price dropped below its initial trading price. Some wanted to cancel their orders completely or cancel and re-order at a better price. In many cases the original order to buy the shares still had not been processed by Nasdaq, and appeared to have never gone through at all. At UBS, that sent its system into something akin to a repeat mode. Sliding scale: US stocks have gone back and forth in the past few weeks . Glitch: A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the closing bell; trading was delayed during Facebook's May 18 IPO due to a now-infamous glitch . 'Because there still was no confirmation, UBS's system automatically re-sent the orders,' said the source, who has knowledge of UBS's systems. Several market participants said they tried in vain to get Nasdaq to halt trading on Facebook to fix the problem and called the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make sure it knew the gravity of the situation. Market makers said it was tough to comment without knowledge of UBS's systems and procedures. Most agreed, nonetheless, that an order is deemed live until a cancellation or some sort of acknowledgement is received, or when it is executed or rejected. Sending and resending an order that has not been acknowledged is not a standard procedure. Regulators are now investigating the matter. High hopes: Curious bystanders watched through the Nasdaq windows as Facebook shares begin trading May 18 in New York . LIABILITIES CAPPED? Liabilities at U.S. exchanges are capped in most instances. Nasdaq's cap is $3million and the compensation plan filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is meant to increase that in this specific instance. But a legal source told Reuters a firm could sue in the case of gross negligence. The question remains, though, whether Nasdaq's actions were regulatory -- in which case it has some immunity -- or merely a failure to provide professional services. 'Nasdaq is going to want to say the delays, the screwups on the morning, were because of regulatory decisions to delay trading, disrupt trading,' John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said in an interview. 'If they can convince the fact-finder these were regulatory decisions, then they cannot be held liable. To the extent that Nasdaq makes decisions in a regulatory capacity, it has immunity. UBS is going to say, 'You did not perform the service a professional is supposed to perform,' and that's malpractice.'","UBS lost $356 in the May Facebook IPO and is now suing Nasdaq .

Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . The judge in Drew Peterson's murder trial considered today whether to declare a mistrial after blasting prosecutors for a second time in less than two days for bringing up information he said could prejudice the jury. A furious Judge Edward Burmila sent jurors out of the courtroom before grilling prosecutor Kathleen Patton for allowing a witness to mention a bullet and leave the impression that Peterson left it in the witness' driveway. Burmila then took a recess to allow defense attorneys to file a motion for mistrial. 'It can't be reckless, it is intentional,' Peterson attorney Steve Greenberg told the judge when court reconvened, arguing that prosecutors violated court orders. The former cop was charged in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, after his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007. Drew Peterson is suspected in her disappearance but hasn't been charged. Patton said prosecutors didn't deliberately try to get the witness, former Peterson neighbor Thomas Pontarelli, to mention that he found the .38-caliber bullet on his driveway. The judge appeared close to declaring a mistrial yesterday after a prosecutor began to discuss an allegation that Peterson once tried to hire a hit man. Prosecutors contend Peterson killed Savio and tried to make it look like an accident. Defense attorney Joel Brodsky told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence Savio's death was anything but a tragic accident. It appears the drama surroundnig Peterson's life and his arrest is due to continue in the courtroom. His defense attorney's argued yesterday that Peterson was a victim of a 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man. Sketch: Drew Peterson, left, looks on as defense attorney Joe Lopez cross examines Kathleen Savio's neighbor, Mary Pontarelli, as they view a photo of Savio's lifeless body in the tub of her home . Yesterday: Attorneys for Drew Peterson, from left, Joe Lopez, Steve Greenber, and Joel Brodsky listen as Pam Bosco, a friend and spokesperson for the family of Stacy Peterson address the media during a recess in court . Prosecutors: Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told the court during opening statements that Peterson killed his wife and made it look like an accident . Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident. 'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements. Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . The first witness in the trial - Savio's close friend and next-door neighbor Mary Pontarelli - was called yesterday. She cried as she was shown a picture of Savio lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in March 2004. Mrs Pontarelli told the court she and her husband Tom, their son Nick and another neighbor, Steve Carcerano, entered the home late in the evening after Drew told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife.She recalled: 'I went into the . bathroom, seen Kathleen in the tub and I ran out of the bathroom and . threw myself on the floor and started screaming. ' Peterson checked Savio's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied: 'Yes Mary, she is.' She said she noticed dried blood in . Savio's hair and blood coming from her mouth, and she had bruises on her . wrists and buttocks. Mrs Pontarelli said she offered to . cover Savio with a towel 'because I didn't want people to see her like . that. But he (Peterson) said we weren't supposed to touch anything and . we couldn't do that.' The prosecution is expected to try . and use statements that Stacy Peterson made to her minister before she . vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing . Savio. While hearsay is usually barred, if . the judge admits Stacy Peterson’s statements, the testimony could be . damaging to Peterson, according to Kathleen Zellner, a Chicago attorney . who has been following the case. Distress: Marcia and Henry Savio, parents of Drew Peterson's third wife Kathleen, return to court as he stands trial for her murder . ‘What . the judge is going to do is he's going to wait and make individual . rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay, not give a . blanket ruling, but listen to see if they open the door in some way . that makes the hearsay admissible. He'll make this a day by day ruling . on these different pieces,’ Zellner told ABC News. ‘Essentially . we've got Peterson confessing the murder of Savio to his fourth wife, . but we still have the question of whether that will come in.’ Prosecutors . will also try to admit Stacy Peterson's statements to her minister that . she saw Drew Peterson arrive home with women's clothing around the time . of Savio's death. Savio's . sister may take the stand to describe Savio's statements that Peterson . threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like . an accident.

Carl Anderson, left, and a fellow investigator escort Drew Peterson, centre, into District 5 State Police headquarters in 2009 . ‘That . doesn't concern us,’ Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky told ABC News . this week. ‘Anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce . knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of . character, and clearly Kathy was trying to build a case to try and get . as much money as she could.’ The . outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the . seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or . Larry Blum. Mitchell, . who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head . and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died . earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to . testify that the woman’s death was accidental. Blum, who investigated Savio's body . after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the . trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental . fall to homicidal drowning. ‘First, they are not going to be able . to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job . in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew .

Prescott, 28, made the alarming comments to colleagues last week at his workplace in Crofton, Maryland . An employee who called himself 'the joker' and allegedly threatened to 'shoot up his workplace' has been charged, authorities said. Neil . E. Prescott, 28, raised the alarm after he made comments to a colleague last week. He reportedly said: 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna . load my guns and blow everybody up.' The alarming remarks came a week after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado when a gunman entered a midnight showing at a movie theater and sprayed the audience with bullets. Some 12 people died and 58 were injured in the massacre. Prescott, of Crofton, Maryland, was facing charges of misdemeanor telephone misuse, prosecutors . said today. The offense carries up to three years in prison and a $500 fine. Prescott was taken into custody last Friday for an emergency . psychiatric evaluation after the threats were reported to the police. Officers found large quantities of ammunition and about two . dozen weapons, including semi-automatic rifles and pistols, in his . Crofton apartment. It was not immediately clear when the threat was to be carried out or how seriously it was meant to be taken, but the shooting in Colorado - coupled with the 'Joker' reference - put police especially on edge and gave the comments extra urgency, officials said. Prince George's County . State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said that while the misdemeanor . charge was 'insufficient' punishment, Maryland law does not make it a . felony to communicate general threats over the telephone. She said her . office would be lobbying for a change in the law. Alsobrooks . said: 'I believe that when people like Mr Prescott threaten violence, especially . in this day and age with all that we have going on right now, he ought . to be facing felony charges - not just misdemeanor charges.' Though authorities have determined the . guns were legally owned, Prescott will not be eligible to recover the . weapons while the case is pending. He also won't be able to get the guns . back if he's convicted or if he's hospitalized for mental health . treatment for more than 30 days, she said. Authorities . have said Prescott had either been fired or was in the process of being . fired from his job when he allegedly made the remarks. Police have said the threats, . relayed in two separate conversations last Monday, were made to a  co-worker. Police also said Prescott was . wearing a T-shirt that said 'Guns don't kill people. I do' when officers . made an initial visit to his apartment, at which point Prescott . appeared 'unstable'. Officers haven't been able to interview . Prescott in the hospital, but police believe the threats needed to be . taken seriously, in part because of the 'joker' reference and the . weapons' caches. Prescott will be served with the charges after he's . discharged from the hospital.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:02 EST, 21 December 2011 . Hong Kong health authorities have slaughtered more than 17,000 chickens after three birds were found to have died from the H5N1 bird flu strain in the past week. The city is on high alert having raised its flu warning system level to 'serious' after a chicken carcass found at a bustling market tested positive for the virus. It follows the discovery earlier this week of the bodies of an oriental magpie and a black-headed gull, both found at Hong Kong secondary schools, which also tested positive for the virus. Precaution: Workers collect the bodies of slaughtered chickens at a poultry market in Hong Kong after a chicken carcass there was found to be infected with bird flu . Authorities have now banned live poultry imports for three weeks and are trying to determine whether the infected chicken was imported or came from one of Hong Kong's 30 chicken farms. Agricultural officials have inspected all 30 farms but found nothing unusual. H5N1 can occasionally infect people who have close contact with infected poultry and it is fatal in 60 per cent of human cases. However unlike many other flu-strains it cannot be spread by sneezing or coughing. The World Health Organisation says globally there have been 350 human deaths from bird flu cases since 2003. Containment: The slaughter follows the discovery earlier this week of an . oriental magpie and a black-headed gull, found at secondary schools, . which both tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu strain . Taking no chances: A worker disinfects empty cages at a chicken distribution . centre in Hong Kong. The World Health Organisation says there have been . 350 human deaths from bird flu cases since 2003 when it was first . detected . Bags containing the carcasses of chickens potentially infected with the H5N1 bird flu strain are piled together as a worker adjusts a colleague's protective head gear . At its height in 2005, there were fears of a global pandemic with the disease killing hundreds of millions. However the virus was eliminated from most of the 63 countries infected, but it remained endemic in six countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. The number of outbreaks fell from a high of 4000 in 2005 to 302 in mid-2008, but it has risen progressively since, with over 800 cases reported in 2010-2011. Recent months have seen a resurgence of the virus most notably in Cambodia where it has infected at least eight people this year killing all of them. In August virologists warned of a mutant strain of H5N1 bird flu spreading across China and Vietnam for which there is, as yet, no effective vaccine. Deadly: Scientists in the Netherlands have created a super-strain of the disease which can easily be spread through the air . While researchers are uncertain if this new strain - called H5N1-2.3.2.1 - is more virulent in people, they said it was different enough from its predecessor to escape a human H5N1 vaccine that can tackle the parent strain. Virologist Malik Peiris at the University of Hong Kong said: 'There is a human H5N1 vaccine candidate that is a (WHO)recommended vaccine ... But it doesn't confer full protection against the (new variant),' 'But that is not unusual. H5 viruses keep changing and we have to change the vaccine strain.' Hong Kong has experienced a spate a recent of infectious diseases in recent years. In 2003 an out break of the respiratory disease SARS killed 300 people in the city and a further 500 worldwide. And in 2009, 300 people were placed under quarantine at a Hong Kong hotel after a guest contracted swine flu. This month scientists in the Netherlands revealed they had created in a laboratory a super-strain of the disease which can easily be spread through the air. The team who created the so-called ‘Armageddon virus’ said it is ‘probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make’. By experimenting on ferrets - whose flu symptoms are most like humans – the researchers proved it was possible to change H5N1 into an aerosol-transmissible virus that can be easily spread rapidly through the air. They claim the knowledge would be vital for the development of vaccines and drugs to prevent a possible pandemic. However many argue it should never have been created, warning that the potential if it escaped from the lab is ‘staggering’. There are also fears the technique used to create the strain will be seized on by terrorists looking for a biological weapon. The U.S. government is so concerned that its advisers are trying to block the details of the virus’s manufacture from being published. A warning sign is displayed on a path leading towards a Bernard Matthews turkey farm in England in 2007 . 1996 - H5N1 virus first appears in China . 1997 - The first case of the virus appearing in humans is detected in Hong Kong where it kills 6 of 18 infected people . 1997 - 2005 - Cases of the H5N1 viruses are confined to Southeast Asia, but after it is detected in wild birds in Qinghai Lake, China, the virus rapidly spreads westward . 2005 - H5N1 is first detected in Europe and Africa . 2006 - 65 outbreaks of H5N1 are reported worldwide killing a total of 115 people - the highest number to die from the disease in a single year .

A Texas Air Force basic training instructor has been sentenced to 30 days of confinement and reduction in rank for his part in a sex scandal at one of the busiest military training centers in America. Technical Sergeant Christopher Smith wooed one female trainee and fraternized with another at the Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio which has become the centre of an ongoing sex scandal. Investigators say at least 38 female trainees were victimized with 15 instructors implicated and six of those already charged. Busy: Lackland is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year . A seven-member military jury deliberated for five hours after a three-day court martial at the base before finding Tech. Sgt guilty of sexual misconduct. He was sentenced to 30 days confinement and reduction in rank to airman first class. Lackland is where all American Air Force . recruits go through basic training. It has about 500 instructors for . about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. While one in five recruits . are women, most instructors are men. Last month, a military jury gave Staff Sgt. Luis Walker a 20-year sentence after the former instructor was convicted of rape and sexual assault. The counts against Walker were the most severe in the investigation. Prosecutors say he used his position as a military trainer at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio to gain female recruits' trust, and then he made illicit sexual advances. Walker's court-martial included testimony from 10 women, one of whom wept as she described him luring her into his base office and sexually assaulting her on a bed, ignoring her pleas to stop. Guilty: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, seen arriving at his trial Friday, was convicted of all 28 counts he faced and was sentenced today to 20 years in prison . Sentencing: Walker, seen in a July 16 photo, showed little emotion as the sentence was read, but he appeared to have tears on his face later as he gazed at his wife, Yeimi . Prosecutors say Walker sexually assaulted or had improper sexual or personal contact with at least 10 female recruits from October 2010 through January 2011. The sexual misconduct at the base apparently began in 2009, but the first woman didn't come forward until last year. The first allegations were levied against Walker. Six of the 15 instructors being investigated have been charged, with Walker and another instructor, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, already having been court-martialed. Vega-Maldonado admitted in June to having sex with a female trainee and he was given 90 days of confinement as part of a plea deal. Courts-martial have been set for three more trainers, with Master Sgt. Jamey Crawford scheduled for trial in early September. He stands accused of having a wrongful sexual relationship with a trainee, wrongfully providing and consuming alcohol with a trainee and committing adultery with the trainee. Last arrival: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, right, arrives for the fourth day of his trial at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas . The Air Force has permanently removed Walker and 35 other instructors for a variety of reasons that include misconduct, failure to meet standards and medical issues. A two-star general, Major General Margaret H. Woodward, has launched a separate, independent probe. Nearly 80 members of Congress have called for a hearing. Meanwhile, a Republican senator had blocked a vote on the White House pick for Air Force chief of staff over the service's response to the scandal. In a statement last week, Senator John Cornyn of Texas said he put a hold on the nomination of General Mark Welsh 'until I feel the Air Force is adequately addressing the unacceptable situation at Lackland and taking corrective steps to reform their training program to prevent this from happening again'. However, Cornyn rescinded the hold yesterday after meeting with Welsh to discuss the Lackland scandal. Welsh succeeds General Norton Schwartz as head of the Air Force.","Lackland Air Force Base instructor Christopher Smith had inappropriate relations with two female trainees .

A stalker who broke into the home of music mogul Simon Cowell and hid on a shelf in his giant wardrobe holding a brick avoided jail today. Leanne Zaloumis was given a 12-month community order as well as a restraining order today after getting into his mansion while the X-Factor creator watched TV in his bedroom four months ago. Judge Robert Winstanley at Isleworth Crown Court, west London, also said that the order would have a mental health care requirement. Zaloumis, of Catford, south-east London, had admitted being in possession of a brick with the intent to damage or destroy property, and breaking a window at the Holland Park address. Cowell, 52, was watching TV in his bedroom when he heard a 'loud bang' coming from his bathroom on March 24 and called his staff. Zaloumis was taken to Notting Hill police station after being found inside the property. At a previous hearing, she was told she must stay at her home address, remain inside between 7pm and 7am and wear an electronic tag. She was also told by Judge John Dennis on that occasion that the 102 days she spent in custody was 'sufficient punishment'. Cowell who was not present at today’s hearing, saw that Zaloumis was standing outside his shattered bathroom window, screaming as she held a brick above her head, her hands covered in blood. Incident: Simon Cowell leaves his London home, which was broken into by the woman in March this year . Scotland Yard was called, who sent a squad of armed officers to rescue him as Zaloumis continued to shout, repeatedly slamming the glass with the brick. After a lengthy search of the grounds, police found the intruder hiding on a shelf 7ft up in a walk-in wardrobe next to the star’s bedroom, where the walls had been smeared with blood. Police drew their weapons and asked her to get down, but Zaloumis struggled with officers, screaming: ‘Listen to me, someone is trapped in here.’ The defendant told police: ‘Simon knows me. I didn’t break in, I was already in the house.’ She claimed the star had stalked her via Twitter. She also admitted researching his address on her computer and making a previous visit to his home six months earlier when she believed he was away in America, even though her family has claimed that she isn’t a fan.","Leanne Zaloumis was found by the music mogul screaming and smashing his bathroom window .

He kept in touch, remembered birthdays – and always made sure to drop her a line whenever he invaded a nice country. As nations across Europe toppled to Germany during the Second World War, Himmler’s mother Anna amassed a collection of cheerful postcards from the monster responsible for the murder of millions. One was posted from Paris only three days after the Nazis took control of the French capital in June 1940. Romantic: But this postcard of the Seine was sent by Himmler just after the Nazis had conquered France . Gestapo head: Heinrich Himmler affectionately addressed his postcards to 'Mutti' (the German term for Mummy) Affectionately addressed to ‘Mutti’ (the German term for Mummy), it shows a picture of the Alexander III . bridge over the Seine while the reverse reads ‘the pretty corners of . Paris’. ‘My dearest Mummy!’ wrote the head of . the Gestapo and the SS. ‘Today I am sending you very warm greetings . from Paris. I hope you are well. Your Heinrich.’ Underneath is a message written by . Karl Wolff, Himmler’s chief of personal staff, which adds: ‘With good . wishes for your wellbeing. Heil Hitler.’ There is also a postcard from . Dombas,  Norway, which Himmler sent to his mother in November 1941. He told her how he had visited Oslo and was about to travel to Trondheim, where anti-Semitic riots later broke out. An earlier card displaying a picture . of Mussolini was sent from Rome where Himmler had attended the 1932 . Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution. His boss also passed on his regards . to Mrs Himmler, signing one of  the cards and sending his own telegram . in January 1941 to wish her a happy birthday. It read: ‘Would you please receive my best wishes on your 75th birthday. Adolf Hitler.’ 'Very warm greetings from Paris': Himmler kept his elderly mother updated on the Nazis' rampage around Europe . Norway: Himmler wrote to his mother on the way to Trondheim, later the scene of anti-Semitic riots .

American serviceman from Himmler’s holiday home in southern Germany. Lieutenant Richard J. Wills was asked . to remodel the house into a senior officers’ club after the war ended . and took the items as souvenirs. They include a communion certificate . that Himmler, a Roman Catholic, received from the church as an . 11-year-old. His mother was a strict Catholic and brought her son up in . the faith.

A Cairo hotel was firebombed by angry residents in violent clashes today that after a man was gunned down in a stand-off with police. Dozens of civilians with Molotov cocktails have set light to several parked vehicles beside the Nile City Towers complex and attacked parts of the building. Local residents previously attacked . the towers on June 27 when staff there allegedly refused to provide . water to put out a fire that had engulfed one of their wooden shacks and . led to the death of a five-year old boy. Firebombs: Black smoke rises from burning cars as Egyptian firefighters and bystanders try to extinguish several cars that caught on fire outside the Nile City Towers during violent clashes . A statement issued by Orascom . Construction Industries, which has an office in the towers, claims the latest . incident was sparked when a man entered the adjoining Fairmont Hotel and . demanded money, threatening people with a knife. Police officers confronted the man and was attacked, the statement said, before an officer shot and killed him. Arriving in three minibuses and a fleet of motorcycles a number assailants attacked the building in retaliation. These residents are believed to live on valuable . Nile-front land and have been involved in a long-running dispute with . developers seeking to acquire prime Cairo real estate. Cairo Governorate issued a directive on June 20 authorising local police to evict them. Feud: Egyptian riot police stand behind destroyed cars outside the hotel, which was attacked following an ongoing feud with nearby residents . Security and emergency services have arrived at the scene in a bid to quell the situation with surrounding roads currently completely blocked to other traffic. 'Immediately after the residents of the shacks behind Nile City came to attack the hotel and tried to burn it down,"" the statement read. The management of Nile City sealed the building after residents began to burn motorcycles and cars in the forecourt. The violence is focused around the north tower and the adjacent Fairmont Hotel. Injury and death tolls are yet to be confirmed. The worrying scenes come just a day . after erupting sectarian violence in a village near Cairo, started after . the death of a Muslim man. Aftermath: Security soldiers stand next to burnt cars outside the Nile City Towers following clashes between security and angry residents in Cairo . Violence first erupted in . Dahshour on Friday following an argument between a Christian laundry . worker and his client, a Muslim, whose shirt he burned. The Muslim man . and friends went to the Christian's home to continue the argument, . provoking the Christian to lob firebombs at the crowd gathering outside . his home. The . firebombs injured a bystander who died Tuesday of his wounds, further . aggravating tensions. A group of Muslims tried to attack the local . church, but other Muslims protected it until security forces arrived and . dispersed the mob, but the tensions have prompted all the local Christians to flee. About 10 percent of Egypt's mainly Muslim 82 million people are Christian. Clashes: Smoke and flames rise from a car that caught on fire outside the Nile City Towers, whilst violence erupted elsewhere in Cairo in sectarian clashes . Security officials said police fired tear gas early Wednesday at angry Muslims who were trying to set fire to the local church. The rioters, who were returning from the burial of the Muslim man who died in the clashes, damaged several Christian properties and set three police trucks on fire. Sixteen people, including 10 . policemen, were injured, said the security officials, who spoke on . condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release . information to reporters. The local Giza Archbishop's office . said in a statement that the Christian families fled the village fearing . further attacks from Muslims. Security: Reports state that at least one person was killed during a stand off with police . The rioters 'broke the church's windows, and doors of homes nearby,' the statement said. While security forces prevented a further attack on the church, the rioters 'looted and torched the shops (of Christians), including a jewelry shop ... and terrorized the local community, forcing them to leave their homes.' Sayed Hamam, a 22-year old university student and resident of Dahshour, said security was heavily deployed in the village, and reconciliation attempts were under way to bring the Christians back. He said most have moved to a nearby village. 'We are very saddened,' he said. 'We . used to pride ourselves on how peacefully we lived together for years. We are considering it a big feud in one clan, not a Muslim-Christian . fight.' Hamam said the police and big . families in the village are in talks with the local priest and the . father of the killed resident to calm the tension. The Coptic Christian laundry worker . who threw the deadly firebombs, his father and brother have been . detained and charged with premeditated murder and possession of . explosives, the group said. Burnt out: Security soldiers and onlookers gather round another vehicle burnt out in the clashes in Cairo . Five Muslims involved in the violence are wanted in the case but have yet to be detained, it added. The violence came after the U.S. State Department said in its annual report on religious freedom in 2011 that Egypt's government has failed to curb violence against the Christian minority and has at times itself been involved in the violence. It also criticised the government's recurrent denial that the violence is sectarian in nature, often blaming it on criminal or family disputes. 'The government generally failed to investigate and prosecute effectively perpetrators of violence against Coptic Christians and continued to favor informal `reconciliation sessions,' which generally precluded criminal prosecution for crimes against Copts and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults,' the report said.","Firebombing comes after man stormed reception and was gunned down in a stand-off with police .

Probe: Barclays Bank was at the centre of fresh police investigation today after documents and emails were seized from the offices of its Italian HQ. Its headquarters in London are pictured . Barclays Bank was at the centre of fresh police investigation today after documents and emails were seized from the offices of its Italian headquarters. The raids were ordered by prosecutors and took place just before the start of the business day as stunned employees arrived for work to find officers stationed outside the main entrance. Officials said the raid was part of a probe into the possible manipulation of Euribor, the euro-priced counterpart of scandal-hit Libor interbank lending rates. According to sources close to the investigation, records of emails and other documents detailing exchanges of information between Barclays in Milan and London were being looked at. The raid was led by Trani based prosecutor Michele Ruggiero, known for similar probes and sweeps on the three big New York-based ratings agencies - Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. The raid was part of a probe announced on July 20, which came on the heels of accusations from consumer groups Adusbef and Federconsumatori. The groups called on prosecutors in a number of Italian cities to investigate a slew of foreign banks, starting with Barclays, for manipulating the Euribor interbank interest rate. The Italian consumer groups are up in arms after US authorities - the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) - ordered Barclays to pay a $200-million fine for 'attempted manipulation of and false reporting concerning LIBOR and Euribor benchmark interest rates' at the end of June. Adusbef and Federconsumatori demanded a criminal investigation of not only Barclays, but also of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, by prosecutors in Rome, Milan, Trani and other cities. However, no action has yet been taken by prosecutors against the other banks. Gone: The Libor scandal prompted the resignation of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, pictured . The Italian consumer groups claim the banks caused an estimated 2.9 billion euros in damages to 2.5 million families in Italy, and said a class action suit may be filed on their behalf. In a statement the prosecutor's office in Trani confirmed the raid on the 'Milan offices of the British bank Barclays' adding that 'numerous documents and emails have been taken away as part of the investigation into the Euribor rate which had a negative affect on the mortgages paid by Italians.' Both consumer groups claim that the manipulation of the Euribor rates could have affected as many as 2.5 million families, costing them a total of three billion Euros. Barclays was fined a record £290million over its involvement in the rigging . of Libor, the inter-bank lending rate, which involved the manipulation of key interest rates by the bank. The scandal began with a devastating dossier, published by the Financial Services Authority last month, about the ruthless tactics used by rogue traders at Barclays to fiddle Libor. The 44-page report reveals extraordinary emails showing how traders promised to celebrate together with champagne and cappuccinos if they managed to pull off the con. In one email, a trader at a different bank wrote to ‘Trader G’ at Barclays: ‘Dude. I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of Bollinger.’ The Libor scandal prompted the resignation of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond.

When a gang of armed smash-and-grab robbers on mopeds nearly knocked over his wife on their way to raid a jeweller's, pensioner Michael Graver saw red. In scenes described by police as 'like a cartoon', the 71-year-old grandfather tried to shove one moped and its occupants over, chased one of the thugs into the shop and grabbed a bag off him as he tried to escape. The violent criminal, who was wielding a sledgehammer, was so shocked that he stopped and did a double-take at his empty hands before leaping back on his getaway vehicle. The gang's bad day at the office wasn't over, however. Not only had they been left without the £22,000 of watches they had snatched thanks to Mr Graver's courageous intervention but another passer-by compounded their humiliation by giving chase and trying to wallop them with a bag he was carrying. Mr Graver has now spoken about his extraordinary role in the drama in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after a judge jailed the gang for a total of 36 years and awarded the retired businessman £500 for his 'commendable fortitude and bravery'. 'The police said the CCTV footage of it was like a cartoon,' said the father-of-three, who lives in the town with wife Penny, 64. 'One moment he's got the bag and the next he hasn't and he's doing a double take as he gets on the scooter. '[Afterwards] we just stood there in the doorway waiting for a uniformed officer to give this bag to.' Mr Graver acted after the gang roared up outside Thurlow Champness jewellers on February 28 last year. 'I was really quite annoyed because these guys came on scooters and they nearly hit my wife,' he said. 'She was walking with a stick at the time because she had fallen on the ice a few weeks before. 'They did not slow and nearly hit her. I was really mad. We were in the middle of it all and we couldn't not be involved. 'One of the scooters pulled up alongside me and I tried to push the pillion passenger and the scooter over. Scroll down for video .

I could see that part of the display had been caved in and that a raid was going on. I then ran inside - my wife, Penny, was telling me not to.' Inside the jeweller's, he found one of the gang threatening staff with a sledgehammer in one hand and holding the bag stuffed with watches in the other. 'He rushed towards me. He just wanted to get out. He was working to a timetable as Penny heard them say outside ""We're out of time"". The man was wearing a nylon jacket and Mr Graver ended up grabbing the bag he was holding as he couldn't get a firm grip on his arm. The robber tried snatching it back but let go and ran over to one of the mopeds. Dwayne Marsh (left) was joined by Dean Armstrong (right) in the violent robbery, and have both been jailed . Locked up: Charlie Kavanagh (left and George Paget (right) are now both behind bars for their crime . Jed Macdonald, one of the raiders, is seen here. As they rode off, another have-a-go hero, shop assistant Mark Baker, swatted at them with his bag. He received minor injuries after he was hit on the hand with the sledgehammer. Four months later they staged another raid at Goldsmiths jewellers in Ipswich. On that occasion, they made off with Rolex and Omega watches worth £78,000 and caused £20,000 to the premises. They were caught after witnesses recorded what happened on their mobile phones and residents in a nearby road took down the registration of what turned out to be a getaway car after noticing suspicious activity. Dean Armstrong, 21, Charlie Kavanagh, 21, Jed McDonald, 22, and George Paget, 20, all admitted conspiracy to rob at a hearing in March. Dwayne Marsh, 34, denied the charge but was found guilty following a trial. Kavanagh, McDonald and Marsh, all from London, each received six year jail terms at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday. Armstrong and Paget, also from London, were both sentenced to nine years. Judge David Goodin also awarded £500 each to Mr Baker and off-duty PC Joseph Mullett, who lunged at one of the mopeds in Ipswich.

"By . Oliver Pickup . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 27 August 2011 . At least 18 people were killed yesterday in a car suicide bombing at the United Nations office in the Nigerian capital Abuja. A car laden with explosives rammed through two gates before slamming into the concrete building as it teemed with hundreds of staff. No group claimed immediate responsibility, although Africa’s most populous nation faces a growing threat of homegrown terrorism. Scroll down for a video report . The bomb has killed at least 16 people, according to the Nigerian Red Cross . The suspected suicide attack managed to topple one wing of the building . Militants from a radical Muslim sect have previously carried out attacks in the capital, though never on a foreign target. Unrest in the country’s oil-rich Niger Delta in the south has also spawned a violent militant group. Witnesses described a saloon car ramming through gates at the UN compound as guards tried to stop it hitting the main building. The suicide bomber crashed the car into a reception area and detonated the explosives, inflictingthe most damage possible, a spokesman for the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency said. An injured man is carried down a ladder on a stretcher by firefighters . A wounded person is shown being attended to by a medic before being taken to the hospital . 'I saw scattered bodies,' said Michael Ofilaje, a UNICEF worker at the building. 'Many people are dead.' He said it felt like 'the blast came from the basement and shook the building'. The building houses about 400 employees of the UN in Nigeria, including the majority of its offices. A local UN spokesman declined to comment. Alessandra Vellucci, a spokeswoman for the UN office in Geneva, said the global body's offices in Abuja had been bombed. Ambulances and rescue workers gather after the blast, which is thought to have been cause by a suicide bomber . Survivors and emergency services workers are seen after a bomb blast that ripped through the United Nations offices in the Nigerian capital, Abuja (left) and witnesses to the horrific bomb blast hug each other (right) Crowds of people gather outside the the National Hospital in Abuja, Nigeria, following the large explosion at the UN building . UN officials said the the attack was a suspected bombing . The building, in the same neighbourhood as the U.S. embassy and other diplomatic posts in Abuja, had a huge hole punched in it. Local police spokesman Jimoh Moshood confirmed the blast, but said police were still investigating the cause. Reuben Abati, a spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan, said the presidency would later issue a statement on the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but oil-rich Nigeria faces terrorism threats on multiple fronts. Last year, a militant group from the country's crude-producing Niger Delta blew up car bombs in the capital during Nigeria's 50th independence anniversary ceremony, killing at least 12. Nigeria, a nation of 150 million, is split between a largely Christian south and Muslim north. In recent months, the country has faced an increasing threat from a radical Muslim sect called Boko Haram, which wants to implement a strict version of Shariah law in the nation. The sect has carried out assassinations and bombings, including the June car bombing of the national headquarters of Nigeria's federal police that killed at least two people. Earlier this month, the commander for U.S. military operations in Africa said Boko Haram may be trying to link with two al Qaeda-linked groups in other African countries to mount joint attacks in Nigeria. During a visit to Nigeria earlier this month General Carter Ham said that 'multiple sources' indicate Boko Haram made contacts with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in northwest Africa, and with al-Shabab in Somalia. 'I think it would be the most dangerous thing to happen not only to the Africans, but to us as well,' Mr Carter said. Boko Haram - which in the Hausa language . spoken in northern Nigeria means 'Western education is sinful' - is . loosely modelled on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan. Boko Haram became active in around 2003 and is concentrated mainly in the northern Nigerian states of Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna. The group considers all who do not follow its strict ideology as infidels, whether they are Christian or Muslim. It demands the adoption of Islamic law, sharia, in all of Nigeria. Boko Haram followers have prayed in separate mosques in cities including Maiduguri, Kano and Sokoto, and wear long beards and red or black headscarves. In early July 2010, Abubakar Shekau, a . former deputy leader of the sect who was thought to have been killed by . police in 2009, appeared in a video and claimed leadership of the group. He said he was ready to launch attacks on western influences in . Nigeria. Rights groups say more than 250 people have been killed by Boko Haram since July 2010. In July 2009, Boko Haram staged attacks in the northeastern city of Bauchi after the arrest of some of its members, and clashed with police and the army in the northern city of Maiduguri. Some 800 people were killed in five days of fighting in the two cities. In December 2010 the group said it was behind bombings in central Nigeria and attacks on churches in the northeast that led to the deaths of at least 86 people. In June 2011, Boko Haram claimed responsibility when a suicide bomber detonated a bomb that tore through a car park outside Nigeria's police headquarters in Abuja. It was Nigeria's first suicide bomb, said police. On June 26 around 25 people were killed when several bombs exploded in the Dala ward of Maiduguri after suspected Boko Haram members threw bombs at a drinking spot. On August 25 Boko Haram members attacked Gombi police station in the northeast, killing four policemen and one soldier before driving to the First Bank and Union Bank where they killed seven staff and carried off an unspecified amount of money.","Building is in the same neighbourhood as the U.S. embassy .

A music teacher told a school's deputy head teacher that he had killed a girl in a car accident in a bid to try and get out of going to work. Derek McGlone, 42, fabricated the lie, telling his employers he felt his car wheels running over her body, just so that he could skip work at Calderhead High School, North Lanarkshire, where he was head of music. After admitting the lie, the teacher said he was 'embarrassed and sorry' about his actions and insisted he still wanted to teach, saying he had a 'passion' for the profession. 'Embarrassed': Derek McGlone admitted to lying about killing a girl in car crash to get time off work . But a hearing at the General Teaching Council Scotland found his fitness to teach was impaired. The teacher has a record for missing work after he told a deputy head that he was caught up in Iceland's ash cloud, despite being at home in Glasgow. He had also taken to Facebook to rant about his colleagues, calling other staff 'bitches.' The hearing heard how his former colleagues had complained that his comments were abusive and threatening. Mr McGlone, who represented himself at the hearing, described himself as a 'respected' head of music, art and design when he made false statements about his absence between June, 9 2008 and May, 31 2011. Mr McGlone said his behaviour was inexcusable: 'I can give no reasonable explanation for my actions. 'I make no excuse for any of the three incidents - they are unforgivable, stupid and silly. 'Please believe me, I have had enough time to think about this.' The 'respected' music head tried to get time off work from Calderhead High School, North Lanarkshire (pictured) Mr McGlone admitted three charges brought by the GTCS, including making threatening and abusive comments towards former teaching colleagues on Facebook. The former teacher said he had taken to Facebook in April 2011 in a 'drunken rant' after discovering former colleagues had made statements about him to the GTCS. He said he was 'dumbfounded and horrified' when he read other members' of staff's statements and he was embarrassed his comments were seen as threatening. 'I do not consider myself to be a threatening person - people would laugh if they heard me described as threatening . 'I do admit wholeheartedly the case against me and I have been previously of good character, nothing of these matters will happen again.' Mr McGlone said he tried to carve a living by getting involved in touring productions of Evita and Scrooge since he resigned as a teacher in 2011. He said: 'I have always had a passion to teach. I have tried to make a living doing other things but there is nothing that compares to teaching.' GTCS solicitor Niall McLean read out a statement from deputy head teacher at Calderhead High, Joyce Kilmartin. She said there was a 'number of occasions' Mr McGlone had told lies in order to take days off work. Her statement added: 'He started off telling a few silly lies. 'He then lied about knocking a girl over and killing her - he said he felt his car wheels running over her body.' The hearing panel, presided over by John Kilpatrick, concluded: 'The Panel determined that the Respondent's conduct falls short of the standards expected of a registered teacher and that his fitness to teach is therefore impaired.' The Panel considered that making no order or removing the Respondent's name from the Register would be disproportionate to the seriousness of the complaints. 'In the whole circumstances of the case, and in view of the representations made by the Presenting Officer and the Respondent, the Panel considered that the appropriate outcome in this case is that a reprimand be recorded in the Register against the Respondent's name for a period of twelve months from the date of expiry of the appeal period specified in the Rules.' A reprimand has been recorded in the teaching register against Mr McGlone's name for 12 months.","Said he 'felt the wheels running over her body'

"Kojo Minta, 24, was swept away by the Gave d'Oloron river near the Pyrenees . Doctors spent an hour trying to revive him . By . Peter Allen and Nick Craven . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 17 August 2011 . A brilliant Oxford University student has drowned in front of two despairing friends at a beauty spot in rural France, police revealed today. Kojo Minta, 24, slipped into the fast-flowing Gave d'Oloron river in Navarrenx, in the Aquitaine region, close to the Pyrenees and the border with Spain. He had just received a 'distinction' in his end-of-year exams at St Hilda's College, and was due to start a DPhil in history at Lincoln College. Academic excellence: Kojo Minta (left) celebrates his graduation at Oxford University . But tragedy struck while Kojo was spending a summer's afternoon on an idyllic riverside popular with picnickers and bathers. 'Mr Minta was swept away beyond a small dam and eventually disappeared from two friends who were trying to save him,' said a local police spokesman. 'It appears that he had lost his footing, and was not a very strong swimmer. An English tourist in a separate group raised the alarm, with emergency service boats and a rescue helicopter arriving soon afterwards. 'Loved': Kojo Minta was described by a fellow student as being hugely popular . 'The victim had been swept under the river by the time he was located. He had been in the water for around 20minutes by this time. More than an hour was spent by a doctor trying to resuscitate him, but to no avail. 'The man's friends were in a terrible state and had to be treated for psychological shock. It is normally a very safe, beautiful stretch of river. Many people swim there, especially on fine summer days.' Kojo, a devout Christian who had moved from his home in America to study at Oxford, had been on vacation with friends in a cottage at Lay-Lamidou, a tiny hamlet nearby. The accident - which is still being investigated by police - took place at around 5pm last Wednesday, August 10. Kojo's name was released after his parents, Moses and Victoria Minta, back home in Houston, Texas, had been informed, together with his siblings, Anna and Kofi. Kojo followed in a long line of talented Americans who have studied at Oxford. These include former President Bill Clinton, a former University College student, whom Kojo had met in the USA while completing his first degree at Pennsylvania University. Honour: Kojo met former U.S president Bill Clinton during his studies . Kojo had just left St Hilda's, where he had been the vice-president of the postgraduate common room. His academic results had been so impressive that he had already won funding to start his research at Lincoln in the autumn. A student who knew Kojo well at St Hilda's said: 'Kojo was an absolutely brilliant student, who was loved and admired by everybody. 'He was gentle and kind - an inspiration to anyone who knew him. This is a devastating loss for Oxford University, and for everyone else who was fortunate enough to know Kojo.' Anna Minta, Kojo's sister, has set up a memorial website in which she describes the keen saxophonist and former schoolboy footballer as being 'well known for his kindness, wit, style, and love of cooking, as well as his scholarly mind’. Kojo had travelled to North Africa to study the effects of human trafficking on local communities, and had also helped open a library in Ghana. Anna said that Kojo's last major academic work opened with quotes by Jeremy Taylor, the 17th Century Church of England writer and bishop. They read: 'Death, which is the end of our life, is the enlargement of our spirits from hope to certainty, from uncertain fears to certain expectations, from the death of the body to the life of the soul.’ Kojo's body was due to be repatriated to America with the assistance of the US Embassy in Paris, and his funeral is due to take place at Braeswood Church in Houston on Saturday.","Kojo Minta, 24, was swept away by the Gave d'Oloron river near the Pyrenees .

The final attendance figures hit almost 324,000, the most popular and fastest-selling show for a National Gallery exhibition of that size and in the final week, the gallery extended opening hours until midnight for two days 'to mop up the queue'. The Royal Academy, left, has extended its opening times until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and The Institute of Contemporary Arts, has decided to go open six days a week, instead of five . Jill Preston, the gallery's head of communications, said: 'Throughout the exhibition, there was a lot of pressure to open later. Even when we did, there was pressure to open later, even for 24 hours,' reported the Independent. Although the idea of staying open 24 hours a day was proposed, it was not possible after it emerged that the delicate Leonardo paintings could not be exposed to the light for that amount of time. The Royal Academy has also seen queues for A Bigger Picture, its exhibition of works by David Hockney. It is almost completely sold-out until April and the gallery has extended its opening times until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. The Institute of Contemporary Arts, has decided to go open six days a week, instead of five. When its new exhibition 'Remote Control' opens next month, it will open at 11am instead of noon.

A youth pastor, as well as his church is facing criminal charges for a mock kidnapping of a youth group that was meant to be a lesson in religious persecution. The Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Middletown, Pennsylvania, as well as 28-year-old Andrew David Jordan were charged with false imprisonment and simple assault, authorities said. The church staged the event in March. Mock kidnappers covered the teenagers' heads, put them in a van, and interrogated them. Neither the young people nor their parents were told beforehand that it wasn't real. Scroll down for video . Raided: Leaders at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God staged a raid during a youth group meeting in March, but failed to tell the teens it was staged; the youth pastor is now facing charges . Bruised: The girl, 14, said she was hurt during the raid, displaying purple bruises on her arms and legs . The mother of a 14-year-old girl, . identified only as K.T., filed a complaint with police after she . returned from the ‘object lesson’ traumatised and covered in bruises, . and with a cut lip. Charged: Youth Pastor Andrew Jordan was charged with false imprisonment and simple assault for the March 'raid' According to the York Daily Record, K.T. had been attending events at the Glad Tidings Assembly for less than a month. 'This is a sad case for all those . involved,' Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico told the . Associated Press, adding that while the church's and Jordan's intentions . were not necessarily harmful, 'they in essence terrorized several . children.' 'We need to protect children, no . matter where the harm occurs,' Mr Marsico said, adding that a grand jury . recommended the charges. He noted that some of the teenagers in the . group were not members of the church, and that a semi-automatic rifle . was displayed in the exercise. A message left at the church was not . immediately returned, and there was no phone listing for Jordan. Neither . had defence attorneys listed on court papers . The girl, who has asked to remain anonymous, described her terror to abc27.com in March: 'They pulled my chair out from underneath me, and then they told me to get on the ground,' she told the station.  'I had my hands behind my back. They said, `Just do as I say, and you won't be hurt.'’ The girl said she and about 17 other teens were taken to the pastor's house, where it appeared he was being assaulted, covered in what looked to be blood. Kidnapped: The teens were shoved into these church vans and driven to the pastor's house . Learning exercise: Pastor John Lanza said the staged abduction was meant to show them what sort of persecution Christians face in other parts of the world . Eventually, she said, the adults in charge revealed it was a staged event, telling the traumatized teenagers that Christians in other countries battle with realities like that every day. One of the two ‘kidnappers’ was an off-duty police officer who was carrying a real gun, according to abc27.com. However, the gun was unloaded at the time of the raid. The girl was shocked that no one told her and the rest of the youth group the raid was only a drill. 'They heard me crying,' the girl said. 'Why not right then and there tell us it was a joke, when you see me crying?' 'They pulled my chair out from underneath . me, and then they told me to get on the ground. I had my hands behind my back. They said: ""Just do as I say, and you . won't be hurt.""' -K.T., 14-year-old victim of raid . Glad Tidings Assembly of God’s pastor, John Lanza, told the Associated Press in March that the church is 'so saddened' that the girl was traumatized at the youth meeting. But he said his intent was never harmful – instead, it was designed to prepare them for what they might encounter as missionaries. Lanza didn't disclose the names of those involved but said the mock kidnappers included an off-duty police officer and a retired Army captain. 'It was a youth event, to illustrate what others have encountered on a regular basis,' he said, adding that the focus of the lesson was 'the persecuted church' in other countries. Lanza said there were about 17 students at the meeting and the mock kidnappers covered the students' heads, put them in a van and interrogated them. Neither the students nor their parents were told about the raid beforehand, he said, though it was discussed with the parents of one youth who might have health issues. Lanza said the church has conducted similar events at least twice before, adding that 'there was much thought given to the safety aspect.' 'If anyone was ever uncomfortable, they would be removed' from the exercise, Lanza said, though part of the idea was to shock the students with the experience. In the future: Lanza says: 'I would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value,' he said, 'but I would find a way to inform the parents (beforehand)' Lower Swatara Township police Chief Richard Wiley declined to comment until an investigation into the raid is complete. The names of the mother and daughter who complained haven't been made public. There could be consequences if the teens didn't know what was going to happen and didn't agree to be a part of the event, Dauphin County First Deputy District Attorney Fran Chardo said. One security expert told the Associated Press that role-playing . training is sometimes conducted 'at the quasi-military level' for . groups that are going to work in war zones. Daniel . Karson, chairman of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a . worldwide risk consulting company with headquarters in New York, said . the idea of conflict zone training 'is to acclimate someone to a . possible situation that might arise.' The . training might involve everything from what items they should take to . the country to a review of who they're meeting and security conditions . there, he said. Tom Copeland, who studies international affairs and terrorism at Geneva College, a Beaver Falls school that emphasizes a 'Christian worldview,' questioned the wisdom of submitting a youth group to a mock kidnapping. 'It just seems inappropriate for that age group. You would think there would be permission from the parents,' Copeland said, adding that he's never heard of anything like that happening at a church. He said that while there have been highly publicized episodes of violence directed against Christian missionaries in other countries, it seems those countries' local religious groups are more at risk. Lanza said members of the church have made numerous mission trips overseas and have learned to be cautious. He said they were planning a trip to Mexico but reviewed current news and advisories and decided it was unsafe. Lanza said he 'would love to' apologize to the girl and her mother but feels he can't until the police investigation is done. He said the church wants to keep doing the program but would make changes. 'I would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value,' he said, 'but I would find a way to inform the parents (beforehand).'

Busted: Robert Johns, 37, was arrested after police seized a massive arsenal of guns and ammo from his car . A homeless man from San Francisco has been arrested on multiple drug and weapons charges after police said they found a massive cache of guns and ammunition in his car. Robert Johns, 37, was taken into custody on July 21 in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, where officers found a Jeep filled with guns, knives, a shotgun, close to 6,000 bullets and camouflage gear. According to police, they also seized a card from Johns’ vehicle containing a list of several national politicians, reportedly including President Obama, according to CBS5. Johns had an earlier run-in with law enforcement when he was stopped by officers on June 30 for puffing on a cigarette at Alvord Lake in Golden Gate Park, where smoking is prohibited. During that interaction, Johns made ‘strange comments’ to the officers about wanting to harm a family member, and gave them permission to search his car, where they found a loaded 12-gauge shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle, San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr said during a news conference Wednesday. Johns was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was placed on a mental health detention, but he was later released. On July 17, police received a report from a local Yoga studio about someone living in a vehicle in the area who was harassing and threatening people. Officers found the unoccupied car and issued a 72-hour notice to move it, Suhr said. Massive stash: Officers confiscated several high-powered weapons and pistols from Johns' vehicle . Dangerous cache: As many as 5,800 rounds of ammunition and 14 knives were confiscated from Johns' Jeep in late July . Disturbing finds: Beside weapons and bullets, police seized survival equipment and camouflage clothing from Johns' Jeep . Neighbors on Waller Street where Johns’ vehicle was found said he parked in the same spot day after day and spent hours sitting inside amid piles of trash spilling out of the car, NBC reported. Although the Jeep was plastered with multiple parking tickets, that vehicle was never towed, leading some residents to wonder whether the driver was an undercover police officer. When police returned on July 21, they found that Johns was inside his Jeep Cherokee and beginning to drive away, and they pulled it over. During the stop, officers saw a short-barrel rifle in plain view in the driver's side door, and found a loaded 9mm handgun under the driver's seat, according to Suhr. A subsequent search of the car yielded 5,800 rounds of ammunition, 14 knives, a survival kit, a rifle scope, marijuana and a methamphetamine ‘cookbook,’ and $900 in cash, police said. Vehicle: Neighbors on Waller Street where Johns' Jeep Cherokee was found said he parked in the same spot day after day and spent hours sitting inside amid piles of trash . Response to backlash: San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr said his officers were justified in not further searching Johns' car during their first encounter . Suhr said he was not aware of a specific threat made against any of the politicians on the card, nor anyone else. Johns told a reporter he collected the weapons and never intended to harm anyone. Unsettling discovery: President Obama's name was reportedly on a list seized from Robert Johns . However, the disturbing discovery - . made one day after the tragic Colorado movie theater massacre - put . local residents on edge. Some people were quick to criticize the police . department for letting Johns slip away nine weeks prior. This week, Suhr defended the actions of his officers, saying that they were justified in not further searching Johns’ Jeep following the June 30 encounter since they were primarily concerned with his mental health. ‘I think the officers did a good job at the time in evaluating the person in crisis and the approach they took,’ Suhr said. The FBI was notified of the arrest, but local authorities are handling the case, Suhr said. Authorities are still not sure where Johns obtained the weapons. The district attorney's complaint states that Johns imported one of the guns into California and planned to sell it, ABC7 reported. ‘We're glad to get all of these weapons off the streets,’ Suhr said. Johns has pleaded not guilty to eight felony and misdemeanor weapon and drug charges, and his bail was set at $100,000. The suspect is expected to return to court on August 7 for his preliminary hearing.","Robert Johns, 37, was arrested after police searched his Jeep and found a cache of weapons .

Water companies unveiled an 11-point diktat last night to stop 20million people from beating a hosepipe ban. As the drought-hit South and East of the country faced drastic restrictions on consumption, bosses issued an extensive checklist to prevent households from exploiting loopholes. It includes a ban on using a hose or sprinkler to water plants, wash a car or boat, fill fountains, swimming or paddling pools, or to clean patios, driveways or windows. Even spraying your children to keep . them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed, and those caught breaking . the rules face a £1,000 fine. Seven water companies announced that . they would enforce Temporary Use Bans – affecting one in three UK homes – . from April 5 after the plans were revealed in the Daily Mail yesterday. The strict rules are an attempt to . close any loopholes after the last hosepipe ban in 2006 led to . widespread accusations of cheating, with thousands reported to water . companies by their neighbours or served with 'yellow card' letters . warning them to obey the law. Yesterday water companies stressed . that they hoped the ban would be enforced through goodwill and educating . people about the need to save water.

Water companies said that without persistent above-average . rainfall for several weeks, the unpopular measures could last until the . end of the summer in the 14 counties which are already officially in . drought. Otherwise they face 'severe drought' by the summer, the Environment Agency warned yesterday, which could . result in extending restrictions to businesses. Hosepipe bans may also be enforced in . East Yorkshire and Wiltshire which are at 'high risk' of drought . conditions this summer, the agency's Drought Prospects report said. Its chairman Lord Smith urged . businesses to cut down on use, as electricity companies which use water . for cooling and water-intensive industries such as concrete . manufacturing could be affected.

Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . A judge decided against declaring a mistrial in Drew Peterson's murder case today, saying the former police officer still can get a fair trial despite prosecutors' missteps. The ruling by Judge Edward Burmila followed several blunders by prosecutors, who are seeking to prove the 58-year-old Peterson killed his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004. He is also a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, but has never been charged in her case. A furious Burmila admonished prosecutors on Wednesday after the second witness in just their second day of testimony began talking about finding a .38-caliber bullet on his driveway. Thomas Pontarelli, a former neighbor of Savio's, hinted in his testimony that Peterson may have planted it there to intimidate him. Prosecutors later admitted under tough questioning by the judge that there was no evidence to support the claim. And Burmila wondered aloud about whether the testimony made Peterson appear menacing in jurors' eyes and undermined his ability to get a fair trial. But after heated arguments by both sides on Thursday morning, Burmila told attorneys that 'the court believes that the defendant's ability to receive a fair trial is not extinguished at this time'. Prosecutors contend Peterson killed Savio and tried to make it look like an accident. Defense attorney Joel Brodsky told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence Savio's death was anything but a tragic accident. His defense attorney's argued on Tuesday that Peterson was a victim of a 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man. Sketch: Drew Peterson, left, looks on as defense attorney Joe Lopez cross examines Kathleen Savio's neighbor, Mary Pontarelli, as they view a photo of Savio's lifeless body in the tub of her home . Yesterday: Attorneys for Drew Peterson, from left, Joe Lopez, Steve Greenber, and Joel Brodsky listen as Pam Bosco, a friend and spokesperson for the family of Stacy Peterson address the media during a recess in court . Prosecutors: Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told the court during opening statements that Peterson killed his wife and made it look like an accident . Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident. 'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements. Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . The first witness in the trial - Savio's close friend and next-door neighbor Mary Pontarelli - was called yesterday. She cried as she was shown a picture of Savio lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in March 2004. Mrs Pontarelli told the court she and her husband Tom, their son Nick and another neighbor, Steve Carcerano, entered the home late in the evening after Drew told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife.She recalled: 'I went into the . bathroom, seen Kathleen in the tub and I ran out of the bathroom and . threw myself on the floor and started screaming. ' Peterson checked Savio's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied: 'Yes Mary, she is.' She said she noticed dried blood in . Savio's hair and blood coming from her mouth, and she had bruises on her . wrists and buttocks. Mrs Pontarelli said she offered to . cover Savio with a towel 'because I didn't want people to see her like . that. But he (Peterson) said we weren't supposed to touch anything and . we couldn't do that.' The prosecution is expected to try . and use statements that Stacy Peterson made to her minister before she . vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing . Savio. While hearsay is usually barred, if . the judge admits Stacy Peterson’s statements, the testimony could be . damaging to Peterson, according to Kathleen Zellner, a Chicago attorney . who has been following the case. Distress: Marcia and Henry Savio, parents of Drew Peterson's third wife Kathleen, return to court as he stands trial for her murder . ‘What . the judge is going to do is he's going to wait and make individual . rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay, not give a . blanket ruling, but listen to see if they open the door in some way . that makes the hearsay admissible. He'll make this a day by day ruling . on these different pieces,’ Zellner told ABC News. ‘Essentially . we've got Peterson confessing the murder of Savio to his fourth wife, . but we still have the question of whether that will come in.’ Prosecutors . will also try to admit Stacy Peterson's statements to her minister that . she saw Drew Peterson arrive home with women's clothing around the time . of Savio's death. Savio's . sister may take the stand to describe Savio's statements that Peterson . threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like . an accident. Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . Taken in: Police Lt. Carl Anderson, left, and a fellow investigator escort Drew Peterson, centre, into District 5 State Police headquarters in 2009 . ‘That . doesn't concern us,’ Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky told ABC News . this week. ‘Anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce . knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of . character, and clearly Kathy was trying to build a case to try and get . as much money as she could.’ The . outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the . seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or . Larry Blum. Mitchell, . who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head . and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died . earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to . testify that the woman’s death was accidental. Blum, who investigated Savio's body . after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the . trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental . fall to homicidal drowning. ‘First, they are not going to be able . to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job . in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew . Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have . evidence, you presume innocence.’","Former cop was charged in 2004 death .

The wife of an ousted Chinese politician will go on trial next week for the murder of a British businessman. Gu Kailai, the wife of former Communist Party Politburo member Bo Xilai, is accused of poisoning Neil Heywood with cyanide after he allegedly threatened her son in a row over money. A family aide - Zhang Xiaojun - has also been charged. If Gu, 53, is found guilty of the murder she could face the death penalty. Victim and suspect: Chinese prosecutors are charging Gu Kailai (right), the wife of a top Communist Party official, with the murder of British businessman Paul Heywood (left) Scene: Neil Heywood was killed at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November . Two anonymous lawyers close to the . case have told the Associated Press that the trial will start next . Thursday in Hefei city in east China. Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in a . hotel room in China last November. At first officials blamed the expat’s . death on excess alcohol, and his body was cremated without a post- . mortem examination. But in February Mr Bo’s former police . chief, Wang Lijun, told officials he believed the consultant was the . victim of poisoning, allegedly on the orders of Mrs Gu. Mr Heywood mentored the Chinese power . couple’s son, Bo Guagua, to secure a place at Harrow, the leading public . school in North-West London. Mr Heywood went on to work as a ‘fixer’ for Mr Bo, the Communist Party leader in the eastern city of Chongqing. Murky dealings: Mrs Gu with husband Bo Xilai, the purged Communist leader of Chongqinq, and their son Bo Guagua . Reports have claimed Mr Heywood helped . Mrs Gu to smuggle money out of China, and that she allegedly funnelled . up to £3.8billion to accounts in the names of relatives and friends . overseas. Commentators in China have questioned . whether she used some of the money to pay her playboy son’s fees at . Harrow, and subsequently at Oxford and Harvard universities. Mrs Gu, a former lawyer, faces a legal . system in which police, prosecutors and judges are all controlled by . the Communist Party. The country has a conviction rate of around 98 per . cent. Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with . his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a . meeting last November and was found dead a day later. State media said Mrs Gu and her son . had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu . was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’. Scandal: Reports have claimed that Mr Heywood helped Gu, pictured, to smuggle money out of China . If convicted, Mrs Gu and her alleged . accomplice may face death by lethal injection although the death penalty . is sometimes commuted to a life sentence in high-profile cases. The murder case is at the center of a . political scandal that has highlighted factions in the Chinese . leadership ahead of the power handover to a younger generation of . leaders. Bo, 62, was once considered a strong contender for a seat on the all-powerful, nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. Bo was sacked from his position in . March. He is under party investigation for unspecified discipline . violations. No formal charges have been brought against Bo. Political observers have said a . failure to forge a unified stance on handling the divisive Bo case could . affect the Communist Party's focus on working out leadership changes . that will be decided at the 18th national congress later this year.","Gu Kailai, 53, charged with the murder of Neil Heywood along with family 'aide' Zhang Xiaojun .

Magistrates heard that both dogs were 'about to die' when Andrew, 48, and Maria, 49, finally took them for treatment. Andrew Wyatt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the couple took Tottie to a PDSA animal hospital on October 4 last year. Staff said the dog was emaciated, flea-ridden and had sores on its hind quarters. Pebbles was also examined by a vet and found to be in a similarly poor state and close to death. Mr .

On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident . The attorney of a Utah woman charged with ramming an SUV through an office building to hit her estranged husband says she was on a large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind.' The argument came as a part of the trial against Brenda Christine White, the 36-year-old woman who has gone through a series of rejected appeals before being brought to court in Taylorsville. Authorities said White hit her ex-husband twice with her Ford Explorer after crashing through the office building in Salt Lake County. 'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Attorney Jason Schatz said. 'What's in dispute is why this happened.' The incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because her defense attorneys have tried to use the defense that White was under extreme emotional distress. Lawyers argue that she had taken too much Xanax which also was partially to blame for the incident. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief. The trial is scheduled to last through Thursday in 3rd District Court in Salt Lake City. The woman’s ex, Jon Robert White, said he initially ran from a parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV. Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack . He said he ran between two parked cars, jumped over a concrete wall, and into an office, before his ex-wife crashed through the glass doors and hit him. After being hit, he was still able to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased him, hitting him again. He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him. Brenda White's attorneys say she did not intend to kill her ex-husband. Mr Schatz said she suffered from panic attacks and anxiety and on that day she had taken a lot of medication. 'At some point in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz said.","Trial of Brenda Christine White, 36, began Tuesday in Utah .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:12 EST, 3 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:22 EST, 3 August 2012 . Bryshon Nellum's doctors told him he might never run again. Not on an elite level. And surely not in the Olympics. Yet here he is in London, less than four years after gang members shot the former Southern California track star three times in the legs in a case of mistaken identity. Just a year ago he underwent his third and final operation to remove the last remnants of bullet fragments in his left hamstring. Scroll down for video . Qualifying: Bryshon Nellum reacts after placing third in the men's 400 meter final at the U.S. Olympic athletics trials last June, a milestone after told three years ago he would never be able to run competitively again . 'Me making the team, I already feel like I've won,' Nellum said. He will make his long-awaited Olympic debut on Saturday in the preliminary heats of the 400 meters - the same event that features double-amputee Oscar Pistorius of South Africa. The man known as 'Blade Runner' fought to compete alongside the other sprinters at Olympic Stadium. There's also the first big sprint showdown at the track between the U.S. and Jamaica in the women's 100-meter final. In the pool, Michael Phelps will wrap up his final Olympics in the 400-meter medley relay looking to add to his record medal haul. Already, Nellum says, he has won just by wearing the U.S. uniform when plenty of people questioned whether he'd even walk after the attack following a Halloween party in 2008. Shooting: The Southern California sprinter underwent three surgeries after he was shot in the leg in 2008 by gang members who mistook him for someone else . Mission: Getting back on both feet, Bryshon pressed toward his goal of running again, despite the sometimes excruciating pain felt from his injuries . The 23-year-old Nellum is now mixing company with some of the very track stars he has watched and admired in recent Summer Olympics: Jeremy Wariner, Allyson Felix, Sanya Richards-Ross. 'I'm happy to be here to represent where I come from and what I believe in, and my country,' Nellum said. 'I've been through a lot making the team already. I have to continue to work toward my goals.' For him to be competing in these Olympics would have been unimaginable only four years ago - two months after Beijing. But Nellum immediately committed himself to the challenging comeback. Some days, he crawled across the finish line at practice in agony and tears, the pain in his legs so great. USC coach Ron Allice, with him throughout the journey and by his side for the London Games, never doubted Nellum could do it. Then Nellum finished third at the Olympic trials in June in Eugene, Ore., behind defending gold medalist LaShawn Merritt and Tony McQuay. Nellum's mom, LeShon Hughes, put her life aside and dedicated herself to the recovery of her only child. 'Oh, wow,' she said moments before her . flight to London from Los Angeles on Thursday. 'Words can't even . explain the feeling. It's like real heaven. I'm starting to cry right . now.' Nellum took a . bullet to each thigh and another in the left hamstring during the . shooting outside a restaurant near USC's campus as he left the Halloween . party. Two gang members were sentenced last August to 15 years each in . prison for the crime. Prosecutors said the men mistook Nellum for a . rival gang member. Winning: On Saturday Bryshon, running right, will make his long-awaited Olympic debut in the 400 meters despite the athlete saying he already feels like he won having made it this far . Nellum has chalked it up to 'wrong place, wrong time,' unwilling to let that one bad-luck moment derail a promising career. He arrived at college as the 2007 national track athlete of the year from Long Beach Poly High, the first in California to ever win state championships in the 200 and 400 meters in back-to-back seasons. Then he sustained a season-ending hamstring injury in his first race. Not quite eight months later, he was shot. It has been an exhausting journey back, through operations and rehabilitation, and teaching his legs how to function again. He's counting on those limbs being in top form. 'I'm enjoying every bit of it,' Nellum said. 'Yeah, I made it, but I have another goal. I guess after it's all over with, when I'm by myself, then I will have time to think about it.' Repair: One year after his last operation to remove the last traces of bullets in his leg, a scar is the only thing left on the Olympic runner . Shooters: Bryshon's shooters Horasio Kimbrough, left, and Travon Reed, right, were found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison . As Olympic track and field gets in full swing this weekend, Nellum is trying to balance soaking in everything from his first Olympics with performing at his very best at the exact right time. 'He has stayed very focused and he's keeping everything in perspective,' Allice said. 'The practices have been going well and it's just getting ready to race. The real test will be the race. Drawing the heats, you have to be lucky and good.' Nellum said he learned to keep life in perspective, keep sports in perspective. Watching the opening ceremony in the stadium where he'll compete, it was tough to control the emotion. 'That was a great experience, with a lot of flashing lights and a lot of athletes,' he said. 'The whole ceremony itself made me thankful to be at the Olympic Games, thankful to be an athlete and thankful for the United States.' Allice has provided plenty of encouraging words along the way, too. 'He says, 'Continue to do what you're doing and you'll be OK,' Nellum said. 'It's just a bigger stage with more people watching.'

Police found her body hidden in a car after in a lock up in New Malden, south west London last Thursday night. A man arrested in connection with her murder and kidnap has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, Scotland Yard said last week. Found: Police have discovered the body of missing millionairess Carole Waugh, 50, in London . Police erected a tent outside a garage lock-up in the neighbourhood homeowners have described as 'peaceful and quiet' The body was believed to have been found in this blue VW Golf which was inside the lock-up garage, after police received new information . Nicholas David Kutner, 47, of no fixed abode, is accused of pretending to be Chris Waugh, Ms Waugh's brother, in a bid to sell her London home. She is thought to have died from a single stab wound but no further information has yet been revealed. As an inquest into her death was opened at West London Coroners Court today Detective Inspector Andrew Rees said police were unsure how long Ms Waugh’s body had lain there. Family members reported her missing on May 7 but she is not thought to have been seen alive since April 16. DI Rees, of the Met’s Homicide Command, said officers initially thought she was alive and well and not in contact with her family, who she last saw in Easter, of her own volition. Police are patrolling the area as they await the outcome of the postmortem which confirmed the identity of the body to be Carole Waugh . The quiet road has become the scene of a major crime investigation, as police now pursue the possibility that Ms Waugh may have been murdered .

But they became suspicious when hundreds of thousands of pounds were plundered from her bank account and items including Cartier jewellery went missing from her £650,000 Marylebone flat. He said: 'Carole Waugh was reported missing to police on the 7th of May by some relatives who had not heard from her for some time. 'Initial enquiries made by police led them to believe she was alive and well and not in contact with her family by her own volition. 'However, subsequent activities in relation to her bank accounts gave rise for concern and the week following the 13th of July my unit undertook investigations into the circumstances. 'As a result of the investigation, numerous people were arrested in connection with fraud related offences in connection with Carole Waugh’s bank accounts and her property. Mystery: Since disappearing, thousands of pounds worth of illegal transactions have been made in her name . Despite never being married, she wore a huge diamond solitaire engagement ring and gold wedding band . Police have arrested ten people during the investigation, including arresting one man on suspicion of murder . 'We were obviously very concerned for her safety. As a result of investigations undertaken on August 2nd we went to some garages in New Malden situated in Lime Grove. 'Having forced opened the garage door we discovered a Volkswagen Golf motor vehicle, and sadly Carole Waugh was discovered within the vehicle deceased.' A post-mortem was undertaken the next day on August 3 but an exact cause of death is yet to be established. The detective said: 'I can tell you that a post mortem was undertaken but Carole was badly decomposed so the investigation into her death is still ongoing. The pathologist has identified a single stab wound but cannot give an exact cause of death at this stage. 'Carole came to be identified by her dental records.

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 03:30 EST, 2 November 2011 . People learning the English language around the world should not adopt the 'Queen's English', a linguist said today. Dr Mario Saraceni, of the University of Portsmouth, called on native English speakers to 'give up their claim to be the guardians of the purest form of the language'. He argued that the ways it has been used and changed by millions of people around the world are equally valid. A linguist thinks people learning the English language around the world should not adopt the 'Queen's English' Writing in the latest issue of the journal Changing English, he suggests the way English is taught to non-native speakers, but whose mother tongue is English, needs a dramatic change. He said: 'It's important the psychological umbilical cord linking English to its arbitrary centre in England is cut. 'The English are not the only legitimate owners of the language. 'English is the most dominant language on the planet and though it is spoken widely in the western world, westerners are in the minority of English language speakers. 'For many around the world, the ability to speak English has become as important as knowing how to use a computer. 'But the myth of the idealised native speaker needs to be abandoned. 'How it is spoken by others should not be seen as second best.' Context: The linguist said English language teachers abroad should take down posters of double-decker buses and Parliament Square and teach English in a local context . Dr Saraceni, of the School of Languages and Area Studies, said it was time English language teachers abroad took down posters of double-decker buses and Parliament Square from their classrooms and taught English in a purely local context. He said: 'Critics might feel uncomfortable with what they see as a laissez-faire attitude but language use is not about getting closer to the 'home' of English, and it is not about bowing deferentially and self-consciously to the so-called superiority of the inner circle of the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. 'Language use is fundamentally about mutual understanding.' According to Dr Saraceni, the widely-held view that English has spread around the world from its original birthplace in England can be challenged. He said: 'The idea seems natural and unquestionable, but if you examine it closer it is patently untrue. 'It is impossible to identify any point in history or geography where the English language started - one can talk only of phases of development. 'The origins of English are not to be found in the idea of it spreading from the centre to the periphery, but in multiple, simultaneous origins. 'The concept of a single version of any language is always questionable.' Dr Saraceni said that English had been 'reincarnated' throughout the world, including in Malaysia, India, China and Nigeria, and therefore England should not be seen as the linguistic 'garden of Eden' where the language was pure and perfect. The de-Anglicisation of English needs to take place primarily in classrooms and the 'whole mystique of the native speaker and mother tongue should be quietly dropped from the linguist's set of myths about the language', he said.","Mario Saraceni said the English are not the only legitimate users of the language .

July was the hottest month on record in the continental United States, even beating the most sweltering month in the devastating Dust Bowl of 1936, federal scientists have revealed. The country's average temperature was 77.6 degrees F (25.3 degrees C) which is 3.3 degrees higher than the 20th century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted. Records, which began in 1895, show that the previous warmest month was July 1936 when the average temperature across the nation was 77.4 (25.2 degrees C) degrees F. The staggering statistics come after a summer of severe weather - including devastating fires plaguing Colorado, tornadoes ravaging Washington D.C. and crops drying out across the Midwest.

'It's a pretty significant increase over the last record,' Jake Crouch from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center said. '[It] is out and beyond those Dust Bowl years. We're rivaling and beating them consistently from month to month.' Across the country, 32 states had months that were among their 10 warmest Julys, but only Virginia, had the hottest on record, which Crouch said indicated the breadth of the heat and droughts. The Midwest, the Plains and along the Eastern Seaboard were particularly sweltering, with cities including Denver, Indianapolis and St Louis all smashing records for their hottest month on record. Remarkably, record daily high temperatures up until August 5 this year have already eclipsed the number of record daily highs set during all of 2011.

Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Maine had totals among their driest ever. Heating up: Last July smashed the hottest 12-month period record for the fourth month in a row . Stark difference: This graph shows just how much warmer the average temperatures were each month since January compared to previous years . As a result, this year's corn crop yield . could be the smallest in six years and the third year of declining corn . production - sparking high prices and supply shortages. The drought triggered a surge in the . prices for home-grown corn and soybeans to record highs in July, with . values rising about 50 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, over the . past two months. Crouch said the drought and heat helped each other along to create devastating conditions. Dry soil drives up daytime temperatures, and as dry soil prevailed over so much of the country, it helped make things hotter over a wide area, Crouch told Reuters. 'The hotter it gets, the drier it gets, the hotter it gets,' he said. Baking: 63 per cent of the country suffered moderate to extreme droughts. Here, a dry pool in Kansas . Relentess: The sun beats down on a farm in Wise County, Texas. The weather is expected to push up crop prices even further in August, beating record highs last month . Struggles: Cool weather will come too late for damaged crops. Here, a corn field in Harvey County, Kansas . Record: The month was even hotter than the Dust Bowl summer of 1936. Children cover their faces as they pump water during sizzling temperatures and a windstorm in Springfield, Colorado . He said that this summer is set apart . from the Dust Bowl summer of 1936 due to warm nighttime temperatures, . whereas in 1936, records were set by daytime highs. July's sizzling heat and droughts also created the perfect conditions for wildfires; more than two million acres burned throughout the month, nearly half a million acres above average. NOAA also has a measurement called the U.S. Climate Extreme Index, which tracks indicators of unusually high and low temperatures, droughts, floods, storms and hurricanes. The index is calculated as a . percentage, which suggests how much of the country is experiencing . extreme weather. In July is was 37 per cent - beating last July. The . average is 20 per cent. And between January and July this year, the index was 46 per cent, which smashes the previous record from 1934. Out of control: Beach-goers at Coney Island. This year, 27,042 temperature records have been broken . Relief: People swim in the Brooklyn Bridge Park pop-up pool last month in an attempt to escape the heat . Hot work: A man pushes a cart of bottled water down Broadway in New York during warm weather last month . In a response to how the unprecedented heat is damaging farmers' livelihoods, President Obama called on Congress on Tuesday to pass a farm bill so disaster aid can flow to farms. 'It is a historic drought and it is having a profound impact on farmers and ranchers all across many states,' Obama said during a meeting of Obama's rural council at the White House. Crop insurance will provide a safety net for row-crop growers but ranchers have less of a federal cushion. Crop insurance indemnities could be double or triple last year's level, economists estimate. The measurements cover all states excluding Hawaii and Alaska.","Beat the previous warmest month on record of July 1936 .

"By . Arthur Martin and Chris Greenwood . UPDATED: . 01:34 EST, 12 April 2012 . Booty in hand: Thompson was photographed carrying items looted from the Iceland store in Croydon including bottles of rum . A looter who boasted 'I burned Reeves Corner' minutes after he set fire to a 150-year-old furniture store was today handed the longest jail sentence of any of last summer's rioters. Gordon Thompson, 34, used a  cigarette lighter to set fire to a sofa in the window of a 144-year-old family business during a night of anarchy. Moments before he started the blaze, Thompson had been shouting ‘Who’s got a lighter?’ and ‘Let’s torch the place’. The fire destroyed House of Reeves in Croydon, south London, and was so fierce it spread to other properties, forcing residents to leap for their lives. The career criminal’s ‘deliberate, wilful act of shocking, dangerous vandalism’ put numerous lives at risk and caused at least £3.5million worth of damage. Jailing the father of two for 11-and-a-half years, Judge Peter Thornton said that the ‘real cost’ of his reckless actions ‘was in human and emotional terms’. The judge said: ‘The Reeves family lost their historic business, something they and generations before them had lived and worked for all their lives. ‘The loss was priceless. The trauma they have suffered is inestimable. It is extreme good fortune, and no thanks to you, that nobody died or was seriously injured. But they will be scarred emotionally for a long time.’ The store had passed through five generations of the Reeves family and survived two world wars. Its charred remains have been demolished, but the company is still trading from premises across the street. Owners Trevor Reeves, 56, and his father Maurice, 81, were at the Old Bailey yesterday to see Thompson sentenced. Outside court, they said they had accepted his belated apology after ‘a very harsh eight months’. Mr Reeves senior said: ‘I personally have not a great deal of sympathy for him. He’s put great devastation on the Reeves family and it’s been very difficult. There’s a lot of anger and I think the politicians and the judiciary have a job to do to stop this happening again. It was very difficult to get through it, but we have the old wartime spirit and everybody pulled together.’ Lives at risk: One young woman was forced to jump from a burning building near to the blaze at House of Reeves . His son, who witnessed his store burn down, added: ‘My father has built that store up, that store was his baby. I lived there as a child, played there as a child, I lived there as an adult, I worked there for most of my adult life, and when you lose something like that it’s like a bereavement.’ But the Old Bailey was told in an . earlier hearing that moments before the blaze started, Thompson had been . shouting 'Who's got a lighter?' and 'Let's torch the place'. 'Lawless': Thompson joined a masked mob as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser store before he set light to Reeves . Just . two days into Thompson's trial he suddenly changed his . plea. The father-of-two had been planning . to claim he was bravely trying to stop masked rioters looting the store . when it burst into flames. Thompson, who lived half a mile from the store, went on the rampage on August 8, looting Iceland and House of Fraser before turning on Reeves. He was caught on camera clutching bottles he had stolen from the supermarket and helping others prise open the security shutters at the department store. He brazenly posed for a photographer during the crime spree which ended up on the front page of a local newspaper. And as images of the inferno he created were being shown on television later the same evening, a witness said he had boasted: ‘It was me – I did that. I burned Reeves Furniture.’ The fire infamously forced Polish shop assistant Monika Konczyk, 32, to jump for her life from her upstairs flat into the arms of rescuers – an image seen around the world. Miss Konczyk, who lived in a building opposite Reeves, was left too scared to go out and could not go to work without her sister accompanying her. Thompson pleaded guilty to arson and three counts of burglary. He had initially denied arson, but . changed his plea two days into his trial, as it became clear his numerous . criminal actions on the night had all been caught either on CCTV, in . mobile phone video footage or in photographs. Heritage destroyed: Fire crews battled desperately to save buildings nearby in London Road . Devastated: An emotional Maurice Reeves, the furniture store owner, stands outside the charred remains of the shop the day after the riots . Ruins: Such was the intensity of the heat that ravaged the local landmark that firemen had to spend the next day cooling off the smouldering embers . In mitigation, the court heard he had . been depressed about his divorce at the time of the riots, and had not . intended to cause such huge damage by setting fire to one sofa cushion. He ‘could not believe’ what he had done, and it will be something he would ‘regret for a long time’. Adam Davis, QC, defending, said: ‘He wanted me on his behalf to . apologise to all those involved and in particular the Reeves family for . what happened as a result of his reckless actions and apologise for the . loss that he has caused them, a loss that he could not have foreseen. ‘Thug life baaaabe’ – that’s how shameless crook Gordon Thompson liked to describe his days of violent crime. The 34-year-old struggled to hold down a job and by the time of his arrest for arson he had amassed 20 convictions. Confession: Gordon Thompson - branded a 'cynical coward' in court - was jailed for 11 years six months . Last night it emerged that his criminal career dates back to his teens and he has been jailed five times for a total of seven years. The most serious was for an armed robbery 12 years ago in which he joined a gang armed with machetes and was jailed for four-and-a-half years. For many, that sentence might have been a wake-up call, but for Thompson it only fuelled his lawlessness. By the spring of 2011 he had been  convicted of beating up his wife, assault, car theft, shoplifting, cocaine possession, resisting arrest, failing to surrender and carrying knives. He even openly boasted about being wanted by the police over drugs. Writing on his Facebook wall, Thompson revealed: ‘I am on the run from the cops. **** them all. Thug life baaaabe. Up one min and next ya down. **** the world we live in cos we are all dogs on the a ball [cocaine].’ One of four brothers, he first came to the attention of the authorities in 1995 when he was caught fare dodging. Over the next few years he was jailed twice as he amassed convictions for robbery, shoplifting, threatening behaviour and possessing an offensive weapon. In August 2000 he was jailed for a third time for joining three others in an armed raid at a restaurant. Comment on the riots . During the following decade, Thompson’s criminal career showed no signs of slowing with convictions for theft, assault, carrying knives and motoring offences. At the dingy Croydon town centre flat where he lived, neighbours said he was a quiet man with a taste for flashy clothes. Working occasionally as a decorator, he doted on his two children. But in the months before the riots, he had separated from his wife and was locked in a bitter battle for access. It was his bravado that finally caught him after he was photographed carrying bottles of rum and whisky from a looted store. Wearing a distinctive red hoodie, his grinning face appeared on the front page of a local newspaper under the headline: ‘Help bring these rioters to justice.’ Despite this, Thompson could not resist strutting through Croydon town centre where he was spotted by a council worker. He was arrested within minutes and brazenly told police he knew about the picture and was about to hand himself in. The council worker later said: ‘He was very casual and had a smile on his face as he was swaggering through. He was looking around and just seemed very comfortable with himself. ‘I said to him, “Do you realise you are on the front of the local paper?” He said, “Oh **** it, they know where I am, if they want me they can find me”.’","Gordon Thompson, 34, was responsible for blaze captured in iconic picture of the London riots .

Police in Jimmy Stewart's Pennsylvania hometown slapped a duplicitous duo with a robbery rap Sunday after the lying pair told two shift workers they worked for a fake reality show - You Just Got Robbed - and then stole a measly $20. One of the truth-challenged muggers put an Indiana, Pennsylvania man in a headlock about 1:20 a.m. Sunday morning, while the other recorded the incident on a cellphone. Randall Smith, 21, and Artie Goodwine, 18, were arraigned Monday before District Judge Susanne Steffee, who ordered the bungling duo jailed in lieu of a $25,000 bond, according to The Indiana Gazette. Fishtale: Duo in Jimmy Stewart's hometown lied about working for a reality show - You Just Got Robbed - before stealing measly $20 from a pair of victims . A third man, who was not arrested, reportedly accompanied Smith and Goodwine, but did not take part in the robbery, police reportedly said.

"By . Nick Fagge . UPDATED: . 20:01 EST, 25 December 2011 . Britain has been deposed by Brazil as the sixth largest economy in the world, latest figures show. In a dramatic illustration of changing global economic fortunes, the UK has fallen behind a South American nation for the first time. The figures, from the Centre for Economic and Business Research’s annual world economic league table, show Britain is now the seventh richest country in the world. New money: The economy of Brazil. Latin America's largest country, has surged because of vast reserves of natural resources and a rapidly growing - and cash-rich - middle class . Falling behind: The UK languishes in the grip of a national debt crisis and lack of bank credit . The U.S., China, Japan, Germany and France occupy the top five places. More often associated with football and dirt-poor shanty towns known as favelas, Brazil is fast becoming one of the powerhouses of the global economy. The largest country in Latin America, its economy has surged because of vast reserves of natural resources and a rapidly growing, and cash-rich, middle class. At the same time the UK languishes in the grip of a national debt crisis and lack of bank credit. Britons continue to be better off and enjoy a far higher standard of living than the vast majority of people in Brazil but the latter’s 203million population provides huge economic clout. ‘The punching power of Brazil as a whole has overtaken Britain because of the huge economic potential of people who live there,’ Peter Slowe, a former government economic policy advisor, told the Daily Mail. ‘Brazil has a variety of natural resources to rely on including gold and silver as well as oil off-shore and minerals in the Amazon. ‘By contrast the UK economy is affected by the problems of the eurozone.’ Brazil’s stable political situation also attracts investors. Its hard-won democracy also provides foreign investors with the peace of mind that the status quo is unlikely to be overturned by a popular revolution. Brazil floundered under a number of military dictatorships throughout the 20th century until civilian control was established in 1985. The rapid economic development in the huge South American state is likely to come at the expense of the Amazon – and its indigenous people, animals and extraordinary forests. Dr Slowe said: ‘Brazil, unlike China, is a democracy which is much more attractive to investors. ‘This means the country is unlikely to undergo prolonged civil unrest which is likely to occur at some time in China. ‘The country has huge potential but the vast majority of their resources are in Amazon basin. ‘And the cost of exploiting this mineral wealth is the loss of the habitat and the traditions of indigenous tribes who have lived the same way since the Stone Age.’ The relegation to sixth spot is the latest blow to the British economy. In the middle of a prolonged economic downturn and dragged into the euro crisis because of its trade relations with the Continent, the UK has also been involved in an unseemly spat with France. London has come under sustained attack from French ministers over which country has the best economic prospects. Although the latest figures from the CEBR would suggest the French are ahead, they also predict that Britain will leapfrog France by 2020. The CEBR says that by then the UK economy will be the eighth largest in the world, one ahead of France and two behind Brazil. By ALEX BRUMMER . Carnival: Brazil can celebrate . Britons have long been proud of the economic success of a nation that has punched well above its weight in the world. So news that our output has fallen below that of Brazil will come as something of a jolt. After all, the British empire – and its engineers and financiers – were behind the building of much of the infrastructure of Latin America, a legacy that endures today. But rather than viewing our decline vis-à-vis Brazil and other fast-growing economies as a blow to our prestige, we should see it as an opportunity. The tectonic plates of the global economy have shifted dramatically in the past decade with the relentless rise of Russia, India and China, as well as Brazil. Other emerging market nations from South Africa to Indonesia, from Korea to Malaysia and Singapore are pushing for places at the top table. The Group of Seven rich industrial nations, which excluded the new wealth creators, was expanded in 2009 – at the height of the financial crisis – to include many of the new powers to create the G20. That has become the world’s top economic decision-making body. The events triggering Britain’s fall down the global league table are partly predictable. Britain’s economy has failed to expand since the 2008-09 financial crisis and output remains 4 per cent below its pre-crash peak. In contrast Brazil, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of the output of Latin America, has been enjoying a boom based on soaring prices for resources including oil, agricultural products and metals such as iron and bauxite-aluminium. Unlike the economies of the Northern hemisphere, Brazil also managed to avoid being caught up in the United States sub-prime crisis of 2007-09 and the sovereign debt catastrophe that has turned much of Southern Europe into a basket case. Good news? Economist Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs believes the rise of the newly wealthy nations provides a huge break for Britain . Leading economists – notably Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs – believe the rise of the newly wealthy nations provides a huge break for Britain. With the current slow growth in the sclerotic eurozone, which is likely to persist for years, it is a chance for the Government and UK companies to direct their operations away from the over-regulated single currency area to new markets. Despite a decline in manufacturing in recent decades Britain still has leading-edge companies in aerospace and pharmaceuticals that are already making serious inroads in Asia. DIAGEO, distiller of Johnny Walker and the world’s largest spirits group, has conducted a series of lightning raids on newly wealthy countries from China to Africa and Latin America (it sponsors the Brazilian Grand Prix). Its goal is that within a few years up to 50 per cent of its earnings will come from these regions. Most importantly, however, Britain has an edge in service provision. This extends beyond banking and insurance activities where the City of London is a world leader, to other key areas of expertise including legal activities, accounting and consulting.Mr O’Neill and others believe that these technical services together with architecture and engineering consulting, as well as advice on energy, infrastructure and water projects, offer a new dawn for Britain. So instead of seeing the rise of Brazil and other emerging markets as a challenge to our national prestige we should exploit it for our own benefit. It is time to jettison our focus on the European Union, the keystone of our economic and trade policy since our entry into the Common Market in 1973, and restore Britain’s historic ties to Asia, Latin America and Africa where the growth markets are orientated. Brazil should not be regarded as a competitor for economic hegemony but a vast market to be exploited.","Figures show a dramatic illustration of changing global fortunes .

Star: Murray, second right, is seen during the combined run-shoot event . The modern pentathlon requires the athletes to be multi-talented across a range of disciples. It includes five events - pistol shooting, fencing, 200m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3 km cross-country run. Apart from the fencing competition, the athletes do not compete directly against each other. Points for each event combine to give overall total scores. For the final event - the cross-country run -  the competitors are ranked according to their score from the first four rounds. They are given different start times with the leader going first. One of the most bizarre aspects of the event is that the running and shooting elements are contested in tandem - with athletes having three bouts of shooting each followed by a 1000m run. Since 1949 an annual World Championship has taken place in non-Olympic years. In recent years there have been calls for the removal of the penthalon from the Games because of its lack of widespread popularity outside Eastern Europe. Murray started the final combined event eight seconds behind leader Laura Asadauskaite. She began the third phase of the competition, the show jumping, in third place and, although her round was not without its dramas, her score of 1140 was good enough to put her fourth overall. Spence won the world title in Rome in . May while Murray picked up the bronze, earning both their spots in . London at the end of a fierce qualification battle. Among those to miss out was Beijing silver medallist Heather Fell, so the pressure was on the British pair to perform. The . action began this morning in the Copper Box with the fencing, an event . where Spence usually excels, living up to her nickname 'Fencey Spencey'. She . was not quite on top form today, winning 19 of her 35 bouts for 856 . points, which put her tied for 11 but 100 points down on where she would . have wanted to be. Murray had the worst possible start, . losing her first seven fights, but she recovered impressively and ended . the fencing only one win behind Spence in joint 16th. That was a good result for the Lancastrian, though, as, unlike her team-mate, fencing tends to be her weakest discipline.

Almost two years on from the horrific shooting that left her fighting for her life, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is moving back to Tuscon, Arizona in a new milestone in her recovery. Her husband Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, announced on Twitter yesterday they were moving back to Tuscon, the city where the shooting occurred, after living in Houston, Texas for the past 18 months. The former Arizona Democratic representative, 42, was shot in the head by gunman Jared Lee Loughner in January last year while meeting constituents at a Tucson shopping center. She survived but was forced to resign from her political career to focus on her recovery. Moving back: Former US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is moving back to Tuscon with husband Mark Kelly 18 months after she was shot in the head by a crazed gunman . On Twitter, Mr Kelly wrote: ‘Moving back to Tucson today. Gabby has been waiting for this day for a long time.’ Loughner shot dead six people, including nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, and wounded 13 others at a Safeway supermarket, including Giffords. Tweeted the news: Mr Kelly used the microblogging site to announce the couple's move back to Tuscon from Hudson, Texas on Sunday . Then and now: Giffords, left before the shooting, is still undergoing intensive treatment and still suffers a speech impairment after she was seriously injured, right after the incident in June last year . Giffords was released from a Houston hospital in June last year but remained in Houston where her husband was based at the Johnson Space Centre. While she continues to have intensive therapy and her speech is impaired, Giffords has made several public appearances since the incident, most recently going overseas for the first time since she was shot in the head to go hiking in the French Alps.

A British engineer is hoping 21st century technology will finally uncover the multimillion pound 'loot of Lima' which has eluded generations of intrepid adventurers. Shaun Whitehead is heading up an archaeological expedition to try to uncover treasure buried on the Pacific island of Cocos worth an estimated £160million. The plunder could contain 113 gold religious statues, 200 chests of jewels, 273 swords with jewelled hilts, 1,000 diamonds, solid gold crowns, 150 chalices and hundreds of gold and silver bars. Intrepid: A painting of a pirate ship landing at Cocos Island in the Pacific. A £160million treasure trove containing gold, silver and jewels is believed to have been buried there by British seafarer Captain William Thompson . But finding it will be no easy task for Mr Whitehead and his 15 strong team of researchers from the University of Costa Rica and the Senckenberg Institute. For nearly two centuries a string of famous explorers have led failed attempts to find the hidden stash on the uninhabited island, situated about 350 miles off the coast of Costa Rica. Depression era U.S. President Franklin Roosevolt, swashbuckling Australian actor Errol Flynn and racing driver Sir Malcolm Campbell all tried and failed to locate the treasure in the 20th century. German explorer, August Gissler spent . nearly two decades living on the island attempting to hunt the treasure . but returned home with just six gold coins. However, according to The Sunday Telegraph Mr Whitehead is hopeful that hi-tech machinery will be able to pinpoint the spot where British seafarer Captain William Thompson buried the immensely valuable items in 1820. The team plan to use a small, unmanned helicopter, fitted with specialist cameras, to fly above the nine mile square island, to make a computer-generated 3D map of the landscape. A snakelike robot will be dragged across likely 'hotspots' and use radar to detect voids and cavities up to a depth of 60ft. The information will be combined with the map to identify possible submerged caves. Piracy: The treacherous Captain William Thompson, right, was entrusted to transport the £100million treasure loot from modern-day Peru to Mexico by viceroy José de la Serna, left . For nearly two centuries a string of famous explorers have led failed attempts to find the hidden stash on the uninhabited island, situated about 350 miles off the coast of Costa Rica . Once possible spots have been selected, a 'keyhole' drill will drive through up to 100ft of soil and a one-inch wide probe camera will be sent down to act as an underground treasure eye. The 10-day expedition will also involve extensive archaeological, geological and ecological research and Mr Whitehead is eager to point out that the quest is not solely for treasure, but also to carry out ecological, geological and archaeological research. Mr Whitehead said: ''Given the amount of treasure, it would . have been too heavy to carry far from sea level and stories suggest the . use of caves. We can also rule out where others have looked, dug up and . detected – like on the beaches. 'If it is there, it will be in a natural cave which was hidden by one of the many landslides that occur on the island. ""It is not a case of following a map and 'X' marking the spot. It is . about using a bit of logic to establish the likelihood of some areas . where it could be."" The nine-mile square island is the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel Treasure Island . and the modern blockbuster dinosaur film Jurassic Park. Treasure hunter: Engineer Shaun Whitehead from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire is leading a mission to try and discover lost treasure on the island of Coscos in the Pacific . Such is the beauty and wealth of wildlife on the Pacific paradise it is classified as a Unesco World Heritage status site and it took Mr Whitehead around 18 months of negotiation with Costa Rican authorities to get permission to lead the first mission there in 25 years. Mr Whitehead runs an engineering company which provides specialist electronic exploration equipment. While the team are funding the expedition themselves, they hope a television company may help to cover the overheads. The quest will begin in November after the end of the rainy season and anything discovered will be passed on to the Costa Rican Government who will be expected to pay the salvage costs. The treasure had originally been accrued by the Spaniards in Lima, now the capital of Peru, but in the face of a revolt, the city’s viceroy, José de la Serna, asked Captain Thompson to ship the valuable goods to the Spanish colony of Mexico. However, after leaving the port of Callao on the Mary Dear, Thompson killed the viceroy's six men and took a new course to the Cocos island. Once there they buried the treasure, planning to return at a later date. However they were captured by a Spanish warship and all the crew members bar Thompson and his second in command were executed for piracy. In return for their lives the pair said they would show the Spaniards the location of the loot, but after landing back on the Cocos they fled their captors. They are said to have been picked up by a passing ship a year later, but without the treasure.","Treasure on Cocos Island thought to contain gold religious statues as well as silver and jewels .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:25 EST, 13 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:25 EST, 13 August 2012 . The attorney for George Zimmerman said that the neighborhood watchman who shot an unarmed teenager would be not be using Florida’s controversial Stand Your Ground law, opting instead for a traditional self-defense. Mark O'Mara, who is defending Zimmerman against a second-degree murder charge in the fatal February shooting, said looking at the case through traditional self-defense circumstances is appropriate because the facts suggest his client couldn't retreat from a beating he was receiving from Martin. The announcement comes one week after Zimmerman's attorneys initially said they would use Florida's 'stand your ground' law, which allows people to use deadly force - rather than retreat - if they believe their lives are in danger. Out of school: Documents revealed that Zimmerman withdrew from Seminole State College about a month after the shooting . 'The facts don't seem to support a `stand your ground' defense,' O'Mara said on Monday. Still, he did say that the defense team will try to get the case dismissed during a `stand your ground' hearing. 'My concern with even calling it a `stand your ground' hearing is we need to be more realistic,' O'Mara said. 'I've said from Day 1 we need to wait until all the evidence comes out.' O'Mara said he thinks people have a perception about the law that isn't accurate. 'People look at `stand your ground' and immediately think somebody's standing there with deadly force - be it a gun or a weapon - and having the opportunity to back up but not having the need to under the statute,' he said. 'I think the evidence in this case suggests that my client was reacting to having his nose broken and reacted to that by screaming out for help. 'He wasn't in position where I think there was any suggestion where he could retreat, which he is allowed to do under the statute.' Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, center, seen walking to the Seminole County Court . If a judge were to side with Zimmerman in a pre-trial hearing under the state's self-defense statute, the murder charge would be dismissed immediately. O'Mara said that he would not have to invoke any part of the 'stand your ground' statute under the strategy he plans to use. 'I think the facts seem to support that though we have a stand-your-ground immunity hearing, what this really is, is a simple, self-defense immunity hearing,' the defense attorney said. University of Miami law professor Tamara Lave said O'Mara's shift may signal that he thinks his case for self-defense is solid even without the special provisions afforded by 'stand your ground.' `Stand your ground' makes it easier to prevail under self-defense theory than the law that existed beforehand,' Lave said. 'I think what he's saying is, his case is so strong that he doesn't need `stand your ground.'' Before O' Mara can address the `stand your ground' hearing, he is filing an appeal this week of trial Judge Kenneth Lester's recent decision to stay on the case. O'Mara said it could take several weeks for the Fifth District Court of Appeals to rule. 'It's their timeline,' O'Mara said. Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . 'They'll try to get to it quickly, but it could take several weeks. I still think he's a good judge and very fair... But there's a real question of whether Judge Lester stepped over his bounds.' Zimmerman was initially granted $150,000 bond and released in April. But the judge revoked that bond in June after prosecutors presented evidence that Zimmerman and his wife misled the court about how much money they had, including $135,000 raised by then from a website for his legal defense. He was later freed on a new $1million bond. Lester denied O'Mara's motion asking for the recusal earlier this month. O'Mara argues that language used by Lester when he set Zimmerman's $1million bond showed bias. There isn't any new evidence to present to the appeals court in regard to Lester's standing as the trial judge, O'Mara said. Instead, the writ he was hoping to file late Monday dissects everything Lester has done since the beginning of the case. The brief is around 40 pages long. He dismissed the notion that filing the writ was done to stall the case; rather, he said it is being done because that right would be lost if not invoked now. Martin's February 26 death in a gated community in the Orlando suburb of Sanford first drew national attention on March 8, the day his relatives held a news conference to lament that Zimmerman hadn't been arrested. Martin was unarmed and walking back to an apartment where he was staying with his father at the time of the shooting. Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman . Legal battle: Zimmerman, pictured right at an April 20 bond hearing, will fight the charges against him using Florida's 'stand your ground' law . Zimmerman wasn't charged with second-degree murder until 44 days after the shooting. During that time, protesters around the nation demanded Zimmerman's arrest, and the Sanford Police Department was accused of racism and incompetence. Zimmerman, 28, pleaded not guilty and was released on a $1million bond while he awaits trial. With much of the administrative aspects of the case already completed, O'Mara said that they are ready to begin setting up depositions for the state's witness list. Specific dates for those to begin are still being determined, however. O'Mara said the defense has seen about 80 to 90 percent of the state's evidence in the case and that he would start the deposition process with the first responders to the shooting. The defense witness list is still being put together, but O'Mara said he expects it to include FBI personnel, former co-workers of Zimmerman and experts. Reenactment: In a video taken a day after the attack, Zimmerman claimed Martin had pushed him to the ground and went for his gun. Zimmerman said he fired the weapon in self defense . While O'Mara said they would actually like to move the case ahead more quickly, one of the other things complicating that desire is a lack of money in Zimmerman's legal defense fund. O'Mara said the fund had about $60,000 in it, with $20,000 in bills that need to be paid. If Zimmerman's financial status doesn't improve soon, he may ask the judge to declare him indigent, and seek aid from the state to fund his defense expenses. Meanwhile, Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, continue to live in an undisclosed location somewhere in Seminole County. In setting Zimmerman's second bond, the judge mandated that he remains in the same county as the shooting, which O'Mara said 'is the most dangerous county for him to be in.' He said they are both living 'like a hermit' and are not working for fear of their safety. O'Mara didn't rule out a future motion to have the bond terms modified, and allow him to reside out of state. 'I want him safe, wherever that might be,' O'Mara said. 'If it's out of state - so be it.'","Zimmerman's lawyer thinks he can be tried on traditional self-defense case .

Hospitals in large cities act as breeding grounds for the superbug MRSA before it spreads out across the country, a study has revealed. Researchers have found evidence that variants of the potentially deadly infection found in smaller regional hospitals probably came from larger city hospitals. The University of Edinburgh study looked at the genetic make-up of around 80 variants of a major clone of MRSA found in hospitals. This electron micrograph of a deadly cluster of MRSA bacteria. Superbug infections peaked in 2003 . Scientists were able to determine the genetic code of MRSA bacteria taken from infected patients. They then identified mutations in the bug, which led to the emergence of new MRSA variants and traced their spread around the UK. Dr Ross Fitzgerald, of the Roslin Institute at the university and who led the study, said: 'The high levels of patient traffic in large hospitals means they act as a hub for transmission between patients who may then be transferred or treated in regional hospitals.' The institute's Paul McAdam, an author of the research paper, said: 'Our findings suggest that the referral of patients to different hospitals is a major cause of MRSA transmission around the country. This knowledge could help in finding ways to prevent the spread of infections.' MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) started to appear around 50 years ago following the introduction of antibiotics, to which the bacteria has become increasingly resistant. Transfer: MRSA infections travel between major city hospitals and smaller regional centres . Infections are more common in hospitals as patients often have an entry point for the bacteria to get into their body such as a wound or drip. They also tend to have weaker immune systems. Earlier this month a report in the British Medical Journal revealed that cases of MRSA have plummeted since the launch of a hand-washing campaign in 2004. Rates for the superbugs MRSA rose . significantly in the 1990s from just 100 a year to a peak of 7,700 in . 2003 to 2004. Following the launch of the hand-washing campaign rates . fell steadily each year to 1,481 cases in 2010 to 2011.

Aleppo is Syria's commercial hub and lies close to the Turkish border, where rebels have their rear bases. If the opposition were to gain control of the city it would be a major blow to the regime. It has been the scene of fierce fighting for over a fortnight, with clashes said to be much longer and crueller than the skirmishes that took place in the capital Damascus before opposition was put down there. If Assad loses the city, it is likely to become the seat of any provisional government set up in opposition to his regime, turning it into a kind of Syrian Benghazi, analysts have said. International recognition will surely follow - most probably led by the neighbouring Gulf monarchies, longtime opponents of Assad - making the position of the incumbent regime increasingly untenable.

Britain is to give an extra £10million of funding to help more than 45,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria. International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell made the pledge as he visited the Za'atri tented refugee camp in Jordan, on the Syrian border. The money represents a four fold increase in British aid for refugees which was previously £3million. Mr Mitchell said: 'In the midst of its sporting triumphs at the London Olympics, Britain has not forgotten the people of Syria. Today's extra support shows we stand alongside those who have lost everything because of the actions of this ruthless regime. 'The stories I've heard today paint a horrifying picture of everyday life for hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in Syria. I've met people left with only the clothes on their backs. I've spoken to families forced to flee their homes in the dead of night, some walking miles under the constant threat of violence and death if caught trying to escape."" It will provide emergency food rations for more than 18,000 Syrian refugees, plus safe drinking water and sanitation amid the hot conditions, including for mothers and children caught up in violence. Funding will go to three humanitarian bodies providing assistance in the region, the World Food Programme, Unicef, and UNHCR. Approximately £5.5 million of the additional funding will be used for activities in Jordan and the remainder in Syria's other neighbouring countries, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. Now . clashes have spread to the city's old town, where crooked, narrow . streets are difficult for even cars to negotiate, the effectiveness of . the military's armoured divisions has also been damaged. 'Moving . tanks and armored vehicles to that part of Aleppo would be sheer . suicide, because they will make an easy target for the insurgents, who . now have anti-tank weapons,' said Yurii Raihkel in an analysis piece for . Ukrainian newspaper The Day. Fighting has also now apparently broken out in Aleppo's Christian districts, which had hitherto remained fiercely neutral, with at least part of that community said to have taken sides with the rebels. With airpower and armoured units neutralised, the Syrian military faces deploying infantry units to fight fierce hand-to-hand clashes with rebels to clear Aleppo. However, with rebel units packed with veterans of insurgencies in Libya, Afghanistan and Russia's North Caucasus, this is exactly the kind of warfare that the rebels want to fight. Well armed and battle hardened, they outclass the regular army in close combat. The Syrian regime has suffered a series of setbacks over the past month that point to a loosening of its grip on the country. Yesterday . Assad's prime minister Riad Hijab became the highest-ranking government . official yet to defect after he fled across the border to Jordan. Although . Assad has been hit by a string of embarrassing defections of military . and political figures, they have yet to cause visible changes in the . regime's abilities on the battlefield. The . loss of high-profile government officials, however, suggests fissures . are reaching deeper into the ruling system and could force Assad to . retreat further behind a cadre of loyalists. Hijab . and an entourage of family members were expected to head next to the . Gulf state of Qatar, a key backer of the Syrian rebels, in a further . sign of the regional brinksmanship and gambits over Assad's fate. The . Gulf monarchies and Turkey have strongly backed the rebel forces while . Assad has counted on support from traditional allies such as Iran, . Russia and China. Setback: Syria's new prime minister Riad Hijab, . left, defected to Jordan yesterday, in the latest blow to the faltering . regime of President Assad, right . Hijab's defection is a humiliating . blow for Assad after a string of generals and ambassadors has peeled . away. Like nearly all prominent defectors so far, Hijab is a member of . Syria's majority Sunnis - the Muslim sect which forms the bedrock of the . more than 17-month uprising. His . break suggests that elements of the Sunni elite - long a pillar of . Assad's rule - could be growing uneasy with the relentless bloodshed and . the hardline policies of Assad's minority Alawite community, which . dominates the regime's inner circle. The Alawite sect is an offshoot of . Shiite Islam. Just hours . before word of the defection got out, Assad suffered another blow in his . attempt to portray he is in control: A bomb ripped through the third . floor of the state TV building in Damascus, wounding at least three . employees and displaying the ability of rebels to strike in the heart of . the capital. But power . remains closely held within Assad's inner circle and even posts such as . the prime minister have limited clout. Hijab's departure will not . immediately undercut the regime's ability to fight rebels.

Deaths: Men pull the body of a boy from the rubble of his family house after it was destroyed in the fierce fighting which has spread throughout the city . Injuries: Men evacuate a wounded youth during clashes between rebel fighters and Syrian government forces in the Bustan al-Qasr district . Syria's rebels have grown increasingly bold and capable in recent months. In July, the rebels and Syrian regime forces fought intense battles for a week in Damascus in what was the opposition fighters' biggest challenge so far in the capital. In a brazen daylight attack, rebels commandeered a bus and snatched 48 Iranians just outside Damascus on Saturday. Iran said those abducted were pilgrims who were visiting a shrine about 10 miles south of Damascus and were on their way to the airport to return home. But the captors claimed in a video broadcast Sunday that one of the captives was an officer of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards and that the 48 were on a 'reconnaissance mission' for Assad's close allies in Tehran. Syria has been the scene of unrest since March 2011. Damascus blames 'outlaws, saboteurs, and armed terrorist groups' for the violence, claiming that it is being orchestrated from abroad.

Christine Lagarde also criticised Greek citizens 'who are trying to escape tax,' and said the country needs to make more of an effort . The managing director of the International Monetary Fund says she has more sympathy for poor African children than Greeks suffering under the country's economic problems and austerity measures. Asked whether she worried about the economic and social impact of austerity in the Mediterranean country, Christine Lagarde told the Guardian: 'No, I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education. 'I have them in my mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens.' Her comments come as the IMF increases the pressure on the Eurozone nation and makes it clear it will not be softening the terms of the nation's austerity package that is deeply unpopular with the country's electorate. Lagarde also criticised Greek citizens 'who are trying to escape tax,' and said the country needs to club together to make more of an effort to solve its economic problems. Greece's tax revenues are currently down by a third in a year and it has been ordered to improve this to help ease the debt. At the moment, its economy is being kept afloat on international loans provided by the European Union and the IMF, along with the harsh austerity package. As part of the loan deal it has been ordered to cut everything from wages to public spending to  try and get and get the finances back on track. Lagarde agreed in the interview that in essence that it is 'payback time' for the country. The government that agreed to the loan and austerity package was voted out of office in May. The new parties, who mainly campaigned on anti-austerity platforms, have not been able to form a government and new elections are scheduled for June 17. Protesters hold a Greek flag in front of parliament marking the one year anniversary of Greece's Indignant group in Athens yesterday. IMF chief Christine Lagarde says she has more sympathy for African children . This could speed up the nation's exit from the currency club should a government intent on ripping up the country's bailout programme result, destabilising world markets. Yesterday, Belgium's foreign minister said central banks and companies risk making a grave error if they do not brace themselves for a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. Greece accounts for little more than two per cent of the euro zone economy but could pose a profound contagion threat if it quit the currency area, throwing the spotlight on Portugal, Spain and even Italy. The Stock Exchange in Athens, yesterday. Belgium's foreign minister said central banks and companies risk making a grave error if they do not brace themselves for a possible Greek exit . 'There is no organised discussion at the European level along the lines of: what do we do (if Greece leaves),' Didier Reynders, who is both Belgium's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, told the European American Press Club in Paris. 'Now, if central banks and companies are not preparing for the scenario, that would be a grave professional error.' Spain is in plenty of trouble even disregarding any backwash from Greece. Its wealthiest autonomous region, Catalonia, yesterday said it needed help from the central government because it was running out of options for refinancing debt this year. Spain's trump card had been that it had successfully issued well over half the sovereign debt it needs to in 2012. Civil disorder: As well as the targeting of homes, there has also been violence on the streets of Greece in recent months over the austerity package the previous government signed up to . But after revealing this week that its highly indebted regions faced 36 billion euros of debt refinancing bills this year, way above the previously stated 8 billion, that advantage may have been wiped out. On top of public debt, the country is hobbled by a banking sector overwhelmed by bad debts tied to a property market boom that went bust and still has some way further to fall. Bankia SA, Spain's fourth-biggest bank, on Friday asked for a bailout of 19 billion euros ($24 billion) to repair losses from a property crash - the biggest Spanish bank rescue ever. Spain is nationalising Bankia, which holds some 10 percent of the country's bank deposits. The government insists the bank is a one-off case, but economists say a wider bailout of the sector, either by Madrid or the euro zone, may become necessary. Adding to a miserable day for Spanish investors, Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings on the debt of Bankia and four other Spanish banks and said it was taking a dimmer view of Spain's economy. Markets have been buffeted by the escalating euro zone crisis in recent weeks and face more uncertainty up to the Greek election date, and maybe beyond. The euro plumbed near two-year lows against the U.S. dollar on the back of the Catalonian warning, stocks slipped, and Italian and Spanish borrowing costs rose. 'The Catalonia news was a big deal because it implies that the Spanish government may have to take on more debt and it cannot afford to do so,' said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York.","IMF unwilling to soften terms of its hated austerity package for Greece .

As Britain continues to bask in the summer sunshine most people will find time to enjoy the balmy weather. But they should spare a thought for one man who must battle against the heat at the end of a 2,500mile run. Former Navy sailor Sam Boatwright will cover the equivalent of nearly two marathons today - an astonishing feat he has completed every day for the past 49 days. 'I'm setting off earlier in the morning because of the heat,' the 29-year-old told Mail Online. 'Staying motivated throughout each day has been hard, especially when the pain sets in.' In training: Sam Boatwright has never run in a competitive race before and insists he's not a natural runner . The rugby player, pictured in Wales (left) has completed fifty 50mile runs around the UK's coastline since he started on April 6 . Starting his endurance challenge in Blackpool back on April 6th, Sam has run for nine hours burning every day. His run has taken him around the whole of Britain's coastline from the Scottish highlands to St Ives in Cornwall, with his trusty white backup van bringing up the rear. However, he reveals that he almost threw in the towel before he had barely started. 'The second day was the toughest ever, he said. 'My body ached from head to toe and was going into shock due to my stupidity on the first day. 'I hadn't eaten and ran with only one break - it nearly broke me. But a message from my brother kept me going. I also wanted to prove the doubters wrong. Even my own running coach bet against me and this pushed me forwards.' Now Mr Boatwright has a more sensible eating regime. He starts the day with poached eggs on toast and a cup of coffee and snacks on a flapjack and jelly babies mid morning. Lunch is a wrap or two bananas while dinner tends to be a high-calorie three-course Italian meal. He certainly needs the energy as he is burning up to 6,000 calories a day. 'Smile big, run hard': Sam running in Whitby on Day 21 and reaching Land's End on Day 37 . Sam with a soldier in Barnstaple on Day38 of his challenge . Mr Boatwright said he was inspired to take on the epic run because it was something that hadn't been done in Britain before and he 'wanted to see how much my body and mind could take.' What make this more surprising is he insists he is not a natural runner at all. 'Last December I was a 14.5st rugby player and I had never run a competitive race in my life,' he said. 'I only ran more than 20 miles for the first time this year.' Mr Boatwright is using his personal mission to fundraise for the military charity Help for Heroes and hopes to raise £20,000. 'There are ex service men on my rugby team and a couple who are about to go into the army,' he said. 'One thing that has been keeping me going are the messages from wounded service men and women. 'I think about my 50 days of pain then compare it to what they've been going through. 'It always makes me made for myself for moaning so I carry on.' He said social media had proved a Godsend in providing him with continuous support throughout his 50-day ordeal. The Celebrity comedian John Bishop, who completed his own endurance challenge for Sport Relief, is backing Mr Boatwright on Twitter while his Facebook page has more than 3,000 supporters. He said during his run he has been struck by the 'kindness of strangers' on the road, from the group of army lads he met in Barnstaple to the countless drivers around the UK who have pulled up and donated money. 'I'm still amazed at people's generosity everyday,' he said on his blog. 'The smiles and cheers have really kept me going.' Day one: Sam with friends and family at the start of his journey in Blackpool . Day 39: Passing by Lynmouth on the long road home . To combat the mental exhaustion he broke down the run in his mind into more manageable chunks. 'I broke the time down into smaller goals,' he said. 'First to get a week in, then 10 days, then two weeks, half way and so on. While I try to keep my overall goal in mind but look at each day like I'm going to work.' Despite undertaking extensive training for the challenge the qualified personal trainer is also experiencing the severe wear and tear of two months hard-graft. 'My feet are a mess, bruised and battered from 50 days on the road' he admitted. 'I have no toe nails and my hip has been crunched and needs ice daily. My left knee has begun to twist and my ankle swells on a daily basis.' Once he finishes today's run he only has a few more miles to go before he crosses the finish line in his hometown of Skipton in North Yorkshire tomorrow lunchtime. Remarkably though, Mr Boatwright isn't keen to finish, although he says he is looking forward to seeing his friends and family as well as his dog. 'I feel slightly sad that it's coming to an end,' he said. 'But I know my body needs to rest. If I don't stop soon I will cause long-term damage.'

Two and a Half Men co-creator Lee Aronsohn sparked outrage when he said the TV market is over-saturated with women's comedies . Lee Aronsohn, the co-creator of the CBS comedy Two and a Half Men is in hot water for saying female-oriented comedies have reached the point of saturation. Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter at the Toronto Screenwriting Conference, he said: ‘Enough, ladies, I get it. You have periods.’ He complained of the latest batch of comedy shows targeted toward women, including 2 Broke Girls and Whitney. He added: ‘But we’re approaching peak vagina on television, the point of labia saturation.’ But Aronsohn, 59, who is married and has three children, didn’t stop there. He said that the show focuses on ‘damaged men. What makes men damaged? Sorry, it’s women. I never got my heart broken by a man.’ The show has portrayed women in a less-than-flattering light from its inception, led for eight seasons by Charlie Sheen. The show has unapologetically made jokes at the expense of women since season one – for being stupid, overweight, slutty, and for having breasts that are too large or too small. The comments struck a chord, especially with female comedy writers, actors, and critics – Raising Hope actress Martha Plimpton wrote on Twitter: ‘Um, Lee, women are 51 per cent of the population & a coveted demographic for advertisers. What are you thinking?’ Manly men: Charlie Sheen, left, and Jon Cryer were leads in the comedy, which has often been called misogynistic . Over-saturated: The producer complained that shows like 2 BROKE GIRLS are saturating the market . Are there too many comedy shows geared towards women on American TV? She added: ‘The rise of female writers and performers in television is a result of demand. So we’re taking our place at the creative table.’ The Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead responded to Aronsohn’s comment with a snarky comment. ‘You realise that if we are at Peak vagina, the prices at the pump are gonna skyrocket.’ Former New Yorker television critic Nancy Franklin encouraged other Twitter users to Aronsohn’s page, writing: ‘Lee Aronsohn’s twitter handle is @bennyace if your overexposed lady parts want to send him a message.’ Lady shows: He also criticised the NBC comedy Whitney . Blerg: Other shows, like NBC's 30 Rock feature female protagonists; Tina Fey stars as the hilarious, snack-obsessed Liz Lemon . According to the New York Times’ Arts Beat blog, Aronsohn responded with his own snide remark, saying: ‘Women, please look up “irony.”’ The comment was later deleted from his feed. He replaced it instead with a seemingly flippant apology. ‘Yes, yes – it was a stupid joke. I’m sorry.’ Aside from producing Two and a Half Men, Aronsohn produced several shows with female leads, such as Grace Under Fire and Murphy Brown. He has three children, ages 23 and 20 from his first marriage, and a four-year-old from his second.","Show's co-creator Lee Aronsohn said 'we're approaching peak vagina on television,' complaining about too many comedies geared towards women .

France's new president Francois Hollande has made a thinly-veiled attack on David Cameron by claiming Britain treats Europe 'like a self-service restaurant'. The new Socialist president-elect made his aggressive position towards the UK clear while outlining plans for his first meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron. Asked by the news website Slate how he planned to deal with Mr Cameron, given the fact that the Conservative leader had snubbed him during a visit to London earlier this year, Mr Hollande also said he would meet him 'quickly'. Outspoken: French President Francois Hollande arrives at his campaign headquarters in Paris today . But Mr Hollande, who openly describes himself as an 'enemy of finance', said he would make his antipathy towards the City of London clear. Mr Hollande fired a broadside at the coalition government by criticising Britain's supposed 'obsession' with protecting the City of London from Brussels-inspired legislation. Mr Hollande said: 'Let us recognise that the British have been particularly timid about the question of financial regulation and only concerned by the interests of the City, hence their reticence on the establishment of a financial transactions tax and European fiscal harmonisation. 'And to that is added a relative indifference to the fate of the Eurozone, because Great Britain is protected against speculation since its central bank can intervene directly to finance its debt. Difference of opinion: Mr Hollande said he only plans to meet David Cameron 'quickly' 'Europe is not a cash till and less still a self-service restaurant.' As Mr Cameron warned that the single currency is in 'extreme trouble' Hollande suggested that Britain is 'indifferent to the fate of the euro area' and 'attentive only to the interests of the City'. This is despite the fact that billions of pounds of UK taxpayers' money is already being used to prop up the euro. Mr Hollande, who is against austerity measures designed to save the euro, went on to threaten the UK with new Europe-wide taxes to neuter the City of London. He signalled his support for an EU-wide transaction tax on financial deals and a fresh push for tax harmonisation - both of which are fiercely opposed by the British government. The euro fell to a three-and-a-half year low following Mr Hollande's victory, which was accompanied by political and economic turmoil in Greece. Mr Hollande will be officially sworn in as French president on May 15, replacing conservative Nicolas Sarkozy. The following day, Mr Hollande is due to travel to Germany to meet Angela Merkel in a bid to convince her to ditch her austerity programme for Europe and sign up to a growth pact.

When Dobby the corn snake disappeared without a trace last year devastated 10-year-old Max Gerrard frantically tried to hunt down his beloved foot long pet. Having finally given up hope of finding the reptile though the youngster and his family moved home shortly afterwards, making way for new homeowners. But as the somewhat startled new family stumbled across it in the garage one year on it was not so hard to spot - as it had grown to a whopping four foot. Slithering surprise: Max Gerrard has been reunited with his beloved snake Dobby after new householders discovered the reptile lurking in his old home in Northumberland . Max’s dad, Mark, a 44-year-old firefighter, got a call from the shocked new owners of his home last week. He said: 'Max was heartbroken when he lost him and it was horrible at the time. 'He was upset for weeks and people kept saying he might turn up, but he never did and we subsequently moved house. 'But I had a call from the owners of our old house saying they had found him in the garage - not surprisingly they were a little alarmed.' Two-year-old Dobby was just over a foot-long when he disappeared from the home in Ulgham, Northumberland, and it is thought the thin snake hunted mice to survive over the course of the year and hid in small crevices, unnoticed. But when the new homeowners Stephen and Adria Robinson found him hiding in the garage last week he was substantially bigger. Adria said: 'I got a phone call from my husband to say ‘we have a problem’ and he told me he’d found a snake in the garage. Corn snakes like this one can grow to around six foot in length and are usually found in North America . 'He was all right about it actually and I think I was more shocked than him. 'He got it wrapped round a stick and put it in a bucket.' Grateful Max has since paid a visit to Stephen and Adria to thank them for reuniting him with Dobby and he gave them a card, a bottle of wine and some sweets for the couple’s two-year-old son Daniel. Max said: 'I was absolutely shocked that we had found him because he had been gone for so long. 'I was really devastated that I lost him and I’m not going to let him go missing again.' Max, who lives with parents Mark and Amanda, siblings Alex, 11, and seven-year-old twins Ruby and Emma, is now enjoying introducing Dobby to his other snake, George, which he bought after Dobby’s disappearance. Andrew Douglas, part-owner of Dragons Den Exotic Pets in nearby Morpeth, where Max bought his pet, said corn snakes were placid creatures and not to be feared. He said: 'Corn snakes are an American species and with living in a house it’s  probably a similar climate to what they would get in America. They wouldn’t survive outside in this country. 'Because they are so thin, they are able to get through a lot of small holes and crevices and you would be quite surprised what food they would be able to find around the house. 'When corn snakes are young they feed on pinkie mice but as they get bigger they start on larger mice so it’s safe to say Dobby was probably doing a bit of pest control while he was missing.'",Corn snake Dobby measured four foot by the time it was found in garage .

'Final piece of the puzzle': Giving her ninth day of evidence, the sister of Shafilea Ahmed (above) told a trial that she broke her seven-year silence about her murder because she wanted justice for her sibling . The sister of Shafilea Ahmed told a court today that she broke her seven-year silence about the murder because she could not 'go back to her grave' until she got justice for the teenager. Alesha Ahmed was continuing her evidence at Chester Crown Court where parents, Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, deny murdering 17-year-old Shafilea. The teenager vanished in September 2003 and her decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in February 2004. It was not until last year that Ms Ahmed provided the 'final piece of the puzzle' about Shafilea’s death, the prosecution say, when she claimed she witnessed her parents killing Shafilea at the family home in Liverpool Road, Warrington. On her ninth day in the witness box, Ms Ahmed again denied claims by the defence that she had made up the story to try to get herself out of trouble after she admitted organising a robbery at the family home in August 2010. Asked by Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting, to describe how she felt when she made the decision to tell the police, she said she had felt 'torn', adding: 'When you grow up in that environment you become really used to it. 'Even though they have done all these things I still care about them (her parents). I have to speak for my sister. I said to myself ""I am not going to go back to her grave without saying something"".' Breaking down in tears, she added that she could not go back 'until she had done her justice'. Earlier today, Ms Ahmed, who was giving evidence behind a curtain, was cross-examined by Mukhtar Hussain QC, representing Mrs Ahmed. He said the story was made up and was her 'get-out-of-jail card'. She replied: 'There’s no such thing.' The court heard that Ms Ahmed was being blackmailed by the gang which went on to carry out the armed robbery, which led to her mother and siblings being tied up and threatened with a hammer, a gun and an iron bar. The court heard she owed them £3,900. Accused: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she had become 'Westernised' Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire . Mr Hussain said: 'You said to your . mother ""Some boys at university have given me a gun to put in my locker. Someone has taken it and now they are asking me for it and if I can’t . give it them then they are asking for money’.” Ms Ahmed replied: 'It’s a ridiculous story which is being made up. That's the first time I’ve heard of it.' But Ms Ahmed repeatedly refused to . explain why she was targeted by the gang, only saying it was 'personal' and that she was still getting help dealing with what had happened to . her. She also told the court her parents . had told the children what to say to the police when they started asking . questions about Shafilea in September 2003. Arriving at court: Shafilea's mother Farzana Ahmed (second left) and Iftikhar Ahmed (second right) deny murder . Mr Hussain asked if Ms Ahmed, who was . 15 at the time of the alleged killing, was making up her answers to the . police when they asked if they were a 'happy family'. Ms Ahmed, now 23, said: 'Before all . these interviews happened we were told to say that she had run away. Not . to say that she had been abused in any way.' She added: 'We were always told to paint a picture that we all got on well and there wasn’t any abuse.'

Sheriff's Sgt Nick Skrepenski says the man was released on Monday about 5:30pm after his $9,000 bail was paid. The man and his wife are accused of locking the girl in the basement of their Wisconsin home and denying her food until she wasted away to 68 pounds, the weight of an average nine-year-old. The girl's stepbrother is also accused of sexually assaulting her. Names are not being used to protect the girl's identity. Mugshots: The girl's mother and father were both arrested in connection with the case and the father just posted $9,000 bail . The father and stepmother each face six felonies, including child abuse and neglect. The father's defense attorney, William J. Hayes, hung up on a reporter when asked for a comment on Monday afternoon. The . Wisconsin teenager had been forced to live in the house’s basement by . her father, 40, and stepmother, 42, for six years and an alarm would . sound if she went upstairs, police said. She . was found barefoot in pyjamas near her home last week and allegedly ate . what she could find on the floor and in the rubbish, but her parents . forced her to eat her faeces and drink her own urine. Dr Barbara Knox, of American Family . Children's Hospital in Madison, also said the girl would be at high risk . for other disorders and complications that can lead to death, according . to an affidavit. Investigation: The girl's stepbrother 18, was also arrested by local police for an alleged probation violation . Someone notified police after seeing the . girl barefoot in her pyjamas last Monday. The girl claimed she fled her . home because she was afraid her stepmother was going to throw her down . the stairs. The girl told police she was let out of the basement to ‘clean some papers’ for her stepmother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs. The couple were arrested on Friday on . suspicion of child abuse and neglect, and a judge set their bail on . Tuesday at $20,000 each, reported the Wisconsin State Journal. The girl, who is not enrolled in public or private school, lived in the same house as her parents, older stepbrother and two younger stepchildren - but everyone apart from her in the home lived upstairs, reported Fox affiliate WFXS. One doctor said the girl suffered 'serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation'. If she was ever caught eating without her parents' permission, she was . allegedly forced to vomit it up. Ran away: The girl told police she was let out of the basement of the home on this Wisconsin street to 'clean some papers' for her stepmother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough . A hearing was set for Thursday to review the bail and talk to the judge about the charges, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said - adding that he can't say when charges might be filed.

Shocked: Mike Vega points to the pavement in Wisconsin, where he discovered the 15-year-old girl . The Madison Police Department is investigating a significant child abuse and neglect case involving a 15-year old girl. The amount of information being made public is limited as this case is continuing to unfold at the time of this writing. The initial contacts with law enforcement began on the afternoon of Monday, February 6th when a passerby found the girl walking outside, without shoes or socks, clad only in pajamas. The victim was a couple of blocks from her house, and in obvious need of help. The concerned citizen notified McFarland Police who in turn summoned McFarland EMS to evaluate the malnourished teen. She was transported to a Madison hospital. A passerby found the girl walking outside, without shoes or socks, clad only in pajamas . It was determined this was a Madison case. The MPD was contacted and a patrol officer responded to the hospital to gather information. From the onset, it was clear the 70-pound girl was dramatically underweight. The child’s father provided medical explanations for her physical condition. On Wednesday, February 8th, a hospital social worker provided information to the MPD indicating there was likely much more to the case, and the investigation escalated. A doctor, who specializes in child abuse, examined the teen on Friday, February 10th, and diagnosed her condition as, “serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation.” A forensic interview was conducted at . Safe Harbor Child Advocacy Center on Friday, February 10th. The Safe . Harbor interview provided probable cause to make 3 arrests. Late on . Friday the child’s 40-year old father and 42-year old stepmother were . arrested on tentative charges of Child Neglect. In addition, the 18-year . old step brother was arrested on a Probation and Parole hold. She was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, . without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat . In summary: Detectives learned she lived with her father, a stepmother, an adult step-brother, and two younger stepchildren. While the rest of the family resided upstairs, she was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat. There was an alarm that would sound if she went upstairs. A search warrant was executed on the family’s Southeast Side home Monday afternoon, February 13th. Potential evidence was seized. Interviews and evidence gathering continue. The MPD has had prior calls regarding members of the family. One case, in 2007, involved the victim. An unnamed party alleged the girl may have been molested by a family member. The girl did not corroborate the allegation during the investigation by the MPD. At the time, she appeared healthy, and her family was unwilling to cooperate with a MPD detective. The detective told other involved agencies that if the child was to make future disclosures pertaining to the allegation that the detective should be contacted so the investigation could proceed. No further information was brought to the MPD. The child is currently not enrolled in a public or private school. The MPD is working closely with many agencies on this case.

Police have arrested a man and a woman over an attack on a 94-year-old who was severely beaten in her own home. Great-grandmother Emma Winnall was found unconscious and covered in blood when carers came to check on her on Tuesday morning last week. West Midlands Police today said a woman, 56, and a man, 28, were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham just before 6.30am on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to a police station in the West Midlands. The arrests came after a £5,000 reward was offered today for information leading to a conviction in the case of the brutally beaten pensioner. Scroll down for video . Battered: Emma Winnall was assaulted as she slept at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, some time between 9pm on April 30 and 9am the next morning. She had a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger. The beating was so severe that the frail widow's palms were bruised from her attempts to protect herself, while blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed. Mrs Winnall's son John, 65, said today he was 'relieved' at the arrests. He said: 'I don't know much about it yet. I spoke to my sister this morning but she didn't know much either. 'I'm relieved there's been an arrest, it's good that they seem to be making progress.I was going to see my mother up the hospital this afternoon but I've got problems with my car. 'She's stable yes, a lot better than she was. It'd be great if they have caught who did this and got them off the streets, we will have to wait and see.' Crimestoppers offered the cash reward in a move backed by West Midlands Police. Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal said: 'I would like to thank Crimestoppers for offering this reward and say again that local people hold the key to finding who is responsible for this terrible attack. 'No-one capable of carrying out such a despicable attack deserves protecting. 'I’m asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police.' A shocking picture released by her family in the days after the attack showed the full extent of the appalling injuries Mrs Winnall suffered to her face. As her family appealed for help in finding her attacker yesterday, they revealed that Mrs Winnall, who is still ‘very poorly’ in hospital, has started to describe the awful moment she was assaulted. Her daughter said she had spoken of screaming for help in vain, while the palms of her hands are bruised from her attempts to protect herself.  The beating was so severe blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed. The family have as yet refused to allow her to look in a mirror, because she was always so proud of having healthy skin and would be horrified to see her scars. Mrs Blencoe and her brother John Winnall make their public appeal for information . Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal (left) described the level of violence as 'shocking' Mrs Winnall’s daughter Joyce Blencoe, 56, spoke last week from West Midlands Police headquarters with her brother John. She said: ‘To see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood has been the most horrific nightmare. It’s broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came.’ Joyce Blencoe has made an emotional appeal to help track down the thug who brutally attacked her mother . Mrs Winnall, who lives in Moseley, Birmingham, worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. She relies on a wheelchair to get around, and has lived alone since her husband Frank died in 2006, aged 91. She has five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, some of whom have been by her side in hospital since the assault.  Her son Peter Winnall, 65, described on Sunday how his mother had woken up in hospital after being sedated for a couple of days and asked desperately whether someone was trying to murder her. He said: ‘I spoke to Mum and she seems to be doing OK, although her speech is slurred, which is worrying. ‘The first thing she asked when she woke up was, “Was someone trying to murder me?” ‘She also asked medics if she had any scars because she has always been proud of her beautiful skin. We have not yet had the heart to give her a mirror so she can see the extent of her injuries. It’s absolutely devastating.’ He added: ‘These thugs need to be caught as soon as possible. They have no right to be walking the streets and should be jailed and the key thrown away. You couldn’t print the words I’d use to describe the maniacs who did this. ‘The problem is these monsters have no deterrent these days and they know about all the soft sentences handed out even for attacking a defenceless old woman in her bed. Not only was she virtually deaf and blind, she also had a pacemaker fitted and had undergone two hip replacements.’ Last Sunday, police officers spoke to Mrs Winnall in hospital, where she is recovering after emergency surgery. She has been sedated for much of the time since the attack and had to have metal plates inserted into her arm. Mrs Winnall described her ‘traumatic’ ordeal to officers and said she was completely at a loss as to why she would have been targeted. Detective Chief Inspector Sab Johal said: ‘She can recall the incident and explained just how frightened she was during this senseless attack. Mrs Winnall's flat in Moseley, Birmingham, where she was brutally attacked as she slept . ‘Like the rest of us, Emma is also really struggling to understand why someone would do this to her. She is not a rich woman and has lived in the area a long time. From what we can tell, she was also well liked by neighbours. ‘She was totally shocked. She can’t think of any reasons why somebody would attack her. She’s lived in the community for a long time and she’s still quite traumatised about that. We need to know who did this to her.’ Police said there were no signs of a break-in and that whoever attacked her took nothing from her home. The attacker is still on the loose and police are yet to establish any motive. Authorities are re-examining CCTV footage from the area, while slowly eliminating names put forward by members of the public. DCI Johal added: ‘It is a unique offence, it’s very rare, but the injuries suffered by Emma were quite horrific. The injuries she sustained would have been challenging for people half her age. ‘We’ve had a number of names put through to the investigation team but the appeal still goes out to the local community.’ VIDEO: Emotional.

Last week saw a Congress legislator from Assam being thrashed by a mob in Karimganj town. The fury of the men almost made you believe the woman was a murderess or a rash driver who had run over pedestrians in a drunken state. But the woman's crime was a rather tame one. In fact, going by what men have done for ages, it was no crime at all: Rumi Nath had married a man she met on Facebook without divorcing her husband. A video grab of Congress MLA Rumi Nath and her second husband Jaki Jakir who were beaten up and injured by a mob at Karimganj town in Assam . A police case by her husband was all it took for the upholders of the patriarchal order to take the law in their own vile hands and unleash themselves in a cowardly manner on a woman. The fact that she was also pregnant surely couldn't have mattered a wee bit to these lumpens. Perhaps we shouldn't be taking this incident so seriously. After all, men do such things on a regular basis within the confines of their homes. Why, they sometimes deal out worse treatment to women from the underprivileged class, parading them naked on the streets or raping them in public view. Nath thinks her political rivals are behind this dastardly incident. While this may be true, it doesn't explain the righteousness with which the mob went about the 'job'. This can be accounted for only by the chauvinistic mindset of the Indian male. He who condones a man marrying a second time but whose hackles get raised when a woman does such a thing. Nath forgot when she took the step that she was threatening the entire patriarchal order. For, if more women chose the path she has taken, where would the poor Indian males be? How would they manage to get away with their insensitivity and shortcomings? Clearly, all this talk of change is bunkum. As far as the male attitude is concerned little has altered since those centuries when women were dubbed as witches and burnt at the stakes.",Assam MLA Rumi Nath probably forgot that men and women are governed by different norms in India .

Spanish Police investigating a prostitution ring in Madrid have freed a woman who had been beaten, tied, and had a bar code tattooed on her wrist. The 19-year-old Spanish woman had been held against her will and had a tattoo on her wrist as a sign of ownership, as well as a money figure showing how much she owed her 'pimp' bosses. The woman had also been whipped, chained to a radiator and had her hair and eyebrows shaved off by the 'bar code pimps' as part of the ring in central Madrid, officials said. 'Ownerhship': The barcode tattoo on the woman's wrist was accompanied by a figure of 2000 euros, the figure she was said to owe pimps . Spanish police have since arrested 22 suspected pimps who allegedly used violence to force women into prostitution and tattooed them with barcodes. All those arrested were of Romanian nationality and had forced the women to hand over part of their earnings, the statement said. The women were tattooed on their wrists if they tried to escape, the statement said. Police also seized guns and ammunition. It was not immediately clear when the raids took place. Police seized 140,000 euros in cash, which had been hidden in a false ceiling, a large amount of gold jewelry and five vehicles, three of which were described as luxury cars. The gang was made up of two separate groups, referred to as 'clans' in the statement, each dedicated to controlling prostitution along fixed stretches of a street in downtown Madrid. Notorious: The SPanish Police probe centred on Montera Street in Madrid, a known base for the city's sex trade . Prostitutes in the ring were referred to as 'packages', 'suitcases', or 'bicycles', police said. One of the alleged ringleaders who was identified only by the initials 'I.T.' is wanted by authorities in Romania for crimes linked to prostitution, the statement said. The women were controlled at all times to ensure 'money was taken off them immediately,' the statement said. Sex is a multibillion-dollar industry in Spain, with colorfully lit brothels staffed mainly by poor immigrant women from Latin America, Africa and eastern Europe lining highways throughout the country.","'Bar code pimps' also 'beat and whipped prostitutes'

An asylum seeker has been jailed for punching a woman to the ground and raping her in a historic park - after being freed while he awaited deportation. Palestinian Ali Aboalkassem, 29, was arrested by the UK Border Agency a year ago after he entered Britain illegally in a bid to claim asylum. But immigration officials released him back into society on bail while they made arrangements for him to be deported. The attacker approached his 32-year-old victim as she walked through Parker’s Piece, in the middle of historic Cambridge, and asked her for a light for a cigarette, then offered her an alcoholic drink. When she declined he grabbed her and dragged her off the path, silencing her screams with punches before raping her on the grass. He then stole her mobile phone and fled, leaving the distressed woman to flag down a passing cyclist who called the police. Aboalkassem’s DNA was later discovered on the victim and on a bottle of absinthe, which was recovered from the crime scene. He admitted rape and was sentenced to six year in jail at Cambridge Crown Court and will be deported when he is released. Det Inspector Karryann Beeby praised the victim for her bravery in giving evidence to the police adding that her life had 'been turned upside down' by the attack. She said: 'This has been a traumatic experience for the victim and I’m pleased the offender has been brought to justice without the need for her to relive her ordeal at trial. 'She showed extreme bravery in giving a thorough account to police which helped identify her attacker. 'Aboalkassem is a dangerous man who targeted a lone woman as she was walking to work. 'Her life has been turned upside down by the attack, but I hope she will take some comfort from the fact he has been locked up and will be deported on completion of his sentence.' Police investigating Parker's Piece in Cambridge following the rape . The attack happened shortly after 6am on Tuesday, October 11, 2011 as the victim walked to work, Aboalkassem was arrested at a cafe in Mill Road just after midnight on Sunday, October 16. Gail Adams, UK Border Agency regional director, said: 'Aboalkassem has been found guilty of an appalling attack, for which he is rightly behind bars. Our sympathies are with his victim. 'We seek to deport all foreign nationals who commit serious crimes and aim to return them at the earliest opportunity. 'Aboalkassem was arrested and detained by the UK Border Agency in March last year. 'However, there was no realistic prospect of an imminent removal from the UK and he was therefore released on immigration bail while his case was dealt with. 'He subsequently absconded and was being sought by the UK Border Agency at the time of his arrest by Cambridgeshire police.' Bob Stewart criticised the Border Agency for allowing the rapist to be free - and also criticised the cost to the taxpayer for his six year sentence . Conservative MP for Beckenham, Bob Stewart, has slammed what he called the 'appalling' failure of the border agency. He said: 'I am absolutely appalled by this case. 'It is clear this man should have been deported almost immediately once his asylum plea was rejected. 'This is a classic example of why we have to sort out the matter as soon as possible. 'It makes me blooming mad because the thing going through his victim's mind must have been that he might have killed her - she shouldn't have had to cope with this trauma. 'Now of course putting him in prison for six years is just going to cost us more money. 'This is exactly the sort of thing we need to stop happening.' The politician has previously been outspoken over the Government's 'weakness' in their handling of attempts to deport hate cleric Abu Quatada.","Palestinian was arrested - but bailed by Border Agency .

A divorcee who convinced her lover, a former NFL player, to shoot dead her millionaire boyfriend to access his life insurance has been jailed for life. Nanette Ann Packard, 46, was convicted of murder earlier this year after her live-in boyfriend William McLaughlin was shot dead in his kitchen in December 1994. Packard was living with McLaughlin, 21 years her senior, while also dating former New England Patriots linebacker Eric Naposki, who worked as a bouncer at a local nightclub. Jailed: Nanette Ann Packard is led from court in handcuffs after being handed a life prison term yesterday . Theft: Packard's murder trial heard she also stole $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death . She convinced the former NFL star to murder McLaughlin, having stood to collect $1million on the medical technology boss's life insurance, along with a further $150,000 and free rent for a year in one of his properties. Naposki entered McLaughlin's lavish house in Newport Beach using a key given to him by Packard, and shot the millionaire in the chest six times. Killer: Eric Naposki, a former NFL linebacker, was the man who killed millionaire William McLaughlin by shooting him six times in the chest . Packard's murder trial earlier this year also heard she went on to steal at least $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death. She admitted grand theft in 1996 and was sentenced to a year in jail, but the murder case went cold for 13 years before new evidence in 2009 connected Packard and Naposki to the shooting. Authorities subsequently arrested Johnston, living in Ladera Ranch with her third husband, and Naposki, living in Greenwich, Connecticut. Investigators had long suspected Packard and Naposki, but it was only when new technology was used to identify the murder weapon, along with a new witness, that charges were filed. McLaughlin's family today branded Packard 'vile' as the mother-of-two was handed a life jail term without parole for the millionaire's murder, having been convicted of first degree murder in January. Naposki, 45, who played for the New England Patriots between 1988 and 1989, was convicted of first degree murder last July, and will be sentenced on August 10. The court heard during Packard's trial she met McLaughlin after he responded to an advert she had placed in a dating magazine for wealthy men. She had described herself as 'a well-educated woman who knows how to take care of her man'.

McLaughlin was shot dead in the kitchen of his waterfront California home by Naposki, who had been given a key to the property by Packard . They began dating and she later moved in with McLaughlin, who made a fortune in medical technologies after developing a blood-filtering prototype. Speaking outside Orange County Superior COurt yesterday after Packard's sentencing, Kim McLaughlin Bayless said: 'The fact that you, Nanette, destroyed so many lives, including my Dad's, is vile. ...

In 1996, Packard pleaded guilty to writing checks from McLaughlin's account without his knowledge. During Naposki's trial, his defense attorney argued that Packard was the only one who had a motive to kill McLaughlin, who had a successful medical technology business.

A life of crime: Simon Berkowitz has been jailed for five and a half years for his latest of more than 250 convictions that date back more than five decades . A prolific burglar who stole notes revealing intimate details about Paddy Ashdown's affair with his personal assistant is facing yet another term in jail. Pensioner Simon Berkowitz, 65, who has more than 250 convictions for burglary is about to start a five and a half year prison sentence after admitting a string of offences in the New Forest area of Hampshire. Berkowitz pleaded guilty to five burglaries, including one count of going equipped to burgle and two counts of fraud which earned him more than £30,000. He is now thought to be one of Britain's most prolific thieves with his convictions spanning more than 50 years. Police . said what he has been convicted of is only 'the tip of the iceberg' and . it is believed he has committed thousands of burglaries over the years. He . also has scores of other convictions to his name for handling stolen . goods, going equipped to burgle and fraud since he first appeared at . Worthing Juvenile Court aged 14 in 1961 on the charge of larceny. He is now thought to be one of Britain's most prolific thieves with his convictions spanning more than 50 years. Police said what he has been convicted of is only 'the tip of the iceberg' and it is believed he has committed thousands of burglaries over the years. He also has scores of other convictions to his name for handling stolen goods, going equipped to burgle and fraud since he first appeared at Worthing Juvenile Court aged 14 in 1961 on the charge of larceny. He was then given a two-year probation order and ordered to pay 38p in costs. Since then, his criminal record has become 10 pages long and has included sentences totalling more than 40 years from Scotland to the Channel Islands and including Nottingham, Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxford, Devon and London. Many of his offences were committed when he was released early on licence from previous jail terms. But it was the Paddy Ashdown court case in August 1992 that Berkowitz was most infamous for. Ironically, he was found not guilty at the Old Bailey of burgling the City of London offices of solicitors Bates, Wells and Braithwaite in January 1992 where an aide memoire detailing Mr Ashdown's affair with his former secretary Patricia Howard was stolen from a safe. Impact: Berkowitz stole notes revealing intimate details about Paddy Ashdown's relationship with his personal assistant Patricia Howard in 1992 . Berkowitz, who was at the time a Conservative Party member, tried to sell the document to the News Of The World for £30,000 and during his trial said a Labour Party supporter gave it to him. He was convicted of handling stolen goods and sentenced to 30 months. The jury was told afterwards he then had 230 convictions for burglary. Rumours about the contents of the stolen document spread and Mr Ashdown was forced publicly to admit his affair with Ms Howard - prompting the famous Sun headline on February 6 1992: It's Paddy Pantsdown. Berkowitz, an unemployed painter and decorator formerly from Hove in East Sussex, showed no emotion at Winchester Crown Court as the judge described him as a career burglar with no remorse for his victims, many who on this occasion were elderly. Described by police as 'cold and calculated with no conscience whatsoever', Berkowitz also goaded his probation officers with a Christmas card he sent to them just before his arrest for the latest offences in late 2011. The car depicted Santa Claus as a convict and said: 'Have a super Xmas and remember: crime does pay, ask any MP or bent copper.' But an 'eagle-eyed' policeman, Pc Dean Miller, brought Berkowtiz's latest crime spree to an end when he saw him in Milford-on-Sea in Hampshire carrying a holdall. He had been sent on patrol in plain clothes in December last year as the burglary rate in the Lymington, Brockenhurst and Milford-on-Sea areas of the New Forest soared as Berkowitz plied his trade. When asked what was in the holdall, the burglar, born in Enfield, north London, replied: 'I'd rather not say'. Police found inside two crowbars, a . gas-operated blow torch and a magnifying glass to examine the jewellery . and silverware - often of great sentimental value - Berkowitz liked to . steal from homes in affluent areas when the owners were away. He was even living in one empty home in Milford-on-Sea so he did not have to travel or spend money on hotels. Repeat offender: Berkowitz goaded his probation officers with a Christmas card he sent to them. It read 'Have a super Xmas and remember Crime does pay, ask any M.P. or bent coppper' The flat he owned outright in Hove was searched and property from three of the burglaries was found there. Berkowitz had also stolen cash cards he used at ATMs to draw cash dressed in clothes and hats to make him look much younger in an attempt to fool police. In mitigation, the court heard that Berkowitz got 'a buzz' from burglaries and he was obsessive about silverware and jewellery and he liked to value them. The court was also shown a letter to the court that said after seeing witness impact statements from his victims telling of the hurt he had caused he was now remorseful. But prosecution barrister David Reid said that Berkowitz had written exactly the same words when he was jailed for 40 months on the Isle of Wight in 2010 for a series of burglaries and ordered to pay back nearly £83,000 in a confiscation order that has forced him to sell his flat. Jailing him, Judge Jane Miller QC mentioned the fear of his victims, including one recently widowed woman who had only just moved back to England when Berkowitz stole jewellery of great sentimental value to her worth thousands of pounds. Speaking outside the court, Detective Constable Robert Cox, who led the investigation, said: 'Berkowitz is a man who is a cold and calculated burglar who has no conscience whatsoever. 'For years he has inflicted anguish and hurt by invading the homes of his countless victims and stealing from them valuables that were often of great sentimental value. 'In these latest evil offences the victims were mostly elderly and were left in fear of living in their own homes after they had been ransacked by Berkowitz.' Berkowitz was also given a two-year concurrent sentence for going equipped and a further one year each, again concurrently, for the two fraud offences.","Pensioner has been convicted of more than 250 offences .

Dress to impress: Unemployed Palmer, 26, dressed up in court on Friday after leaving her children alone as she went clubbing . She dressed like a would-be footballer’s wife, with ever-present fake tan and designer handbags – even on the school run. Yet Laura Palmer’s ostentatiously glamorous image was in sickening contrast to the squalor in which she left her children, a court heard. Her three boys, aged three, four and seven, were left unsupervised for hours in their filthy house as she went out drinking. Neighbours even found the youngsters playing naked in the street after she left them alone to go out with friends. On that occasion, the 26-year-old returned home in the morning to find police at the scene and was later discovered hiding in the garden shed, still wearing her clubbing outfit. Palmer admitted three charges of child cruelty and neglect at Hull Crown Court. Recorder Paul Miller gave her a ‘constructive’ 12-month supervision order, instead of a prison term, ‘so that nothing like this will ever happen again’. The judge told her the children were left in a ‘disgusting’ house and that ‘anything could have happened to them’ when she was out. He added: ‘In the future put your children first – not having a good time.’ The court heard that while Palmer, a former care worker, was always dressed up, she forced her children to live in ‘uninhabitable’ squalor. Her house was left in a ‘vile state’.  Decaying food and human excrement covered the floors of the semi in Hull and even the bath was full of rubbish. Appearing in court in full make-up and wearing a pink dress with matching pink shoes, Palmer listened as prosecutor Nick Adlington outlined the shocking circumstances of the case. Palmer left her three boys home alone at 11.30pm on June 13 last year after putting them to bed. The . next morning the children climbed out of a window and were seen playing . naked in the street with a scooter near fast-moving traffic at 9.30am. Numerous neighbours, motorists and passers-by rang the police, the court heard. The front of the house in Jendale, Hull, where Laura Palmer left her children.

Officers arrived and took the youngsters, who were covered in filth, back to the house, gaining access through a window. ‘It was in a terrible state, covered in excrement and dirt and the children could access dangerous areas of the house including the kitchen,’ said Mr Adlington. ‘Officers described the house as being in a vile state.’ He said there was ‘a general air of neglect’ with food all over the living room and no bedding on some of the beds. ‘The defendant was, in due course, found in the garden shed intoxicated having been out the night before and was still dressed for a night out.’ Palmer, who has two cautions for shoplifting and is now jobless, claimed she had fallen asleep on a friend’s sofa and later told police: ‘I have never done it before. I’m devastated. There’s no excuse. I just lost the plot and gave up on the house. Everything was a total tip. I was expecting to be rehoused.’ Social worker Jacqueline Feeney described the house as ‘uninhabitable for children’. She said conditions had become worse since her previous visit a month earlier. Neighbours said Palmer had been living alone with the three children after splitting up with her partner about six months earlier. He was described as a ‘good father’ and conditions inside deteriorated after he left. The young children were regularly seen ‘hanging dangerously out of first floor windows’. One neighbour said she suspected the children were being neglected as ‘I never saw washing on the line and never smelt food cooking’. ‘She told me she had a job as a care worker and I thought, “What is she doing caring for other people when she can’t care for her children?”,’ she said. ‘I believe she left them alone regularly. Certainly any money she had was spent on herself. All her clothes looked designer to me, she was always dressed up to the nines, with false tans and perfect nails. She took the kids to school glammed up.’ The neighbour said her husband had used a ladder to look inside the house after the incident and was horrified by what he saw. ‘They lived in absolute and total squalor,’ she said.","Laura Palmer spent her money on hair extensions and false nails .

A prominent retired psychiatrist is apologizing to the gay community for a decade-old study that concluded some gay people can go straight through what's called reparative therapy. Dr Robert L. Spitzer, formerly of Columbia University, now says he no longer believes his work showed that. The 'fatal flaw' is that there is no way to judge the credibility of their accounts, Dr Spitzer says in a letter he submitted last month to a journal that published his work in 2003. Mea culpa: Dr Robert Spitzer, a pioneer in psychiatry, apologised for saying therapy could make a gay person straight . For the study, Dr Spitzer had interviewed 200 people who'd claimed some degree of change. The work made headlines when he presented it at a 2001 meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. One reason for the attention was that Dr Spitzer had played a leading role 30 years before in removing homosexuality from the list of mental disorders in the association's diagnostic manual. Dr Spitzer's study was attacked by critics who questioned the reliability of the accounts from the people he interviewed. At the time, Dr Spitzer acknowledged that he had no proof their stories were accurate, but said several aspects of their accounts suggested their statements could not be dismissed out of hand. Trail blazer: Now-retired Dr Spitzer, centre, pictured with colleagues, pioneered the field of psychiatry . Under attack: Gay rights have come under siege, most recently in North Carolina, where gay marriage was banned; here, activists staged a protest in Georgia yesterday . Now he says his reasoning was wrong, and that 'there was no way to determine if the subject's accounts of change were valid,' he wrote in a letter to the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Dr Spitzer, who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, sent a copy to The Associated Press after a reporter interviewed him about his change of heart. 'I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy,' Dr Spitzer wrote in his short letter, the New York Times said. 'I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some `highly motivated' individuals.'","Columbia-trained psychiatrist Robert Spitzer offered an apology to the gay community .

Senseless: Steven Grisales died after he went over to remonstrate with three boys throwing conkers still in their spiky husks . He was walking to Silver Street station, Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked in College Close. The youth, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was remanded in custody to be sentenced next month. After the verdict, Detective Inspector Richard Beadle said: 'Steven did no more than stand up to unruly youths and for that he has lost his life. 'But for the courageous intervention of a local resident, I am convinced the attack would have continued. 'He placed himself in front of Steven whilst the youth continued to try to stab him. 'The defendant’s arrogance and contempt for others belies his age.' Steven’s mother Jasmid said in a statement: 'Steven was always loved by every person who had the privilege of knowing him.' Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, told the trial: 'This was a sudden, unnecessary killing as a response to a confrontation which took place in the street, which was about nothing very much. 'It was about throwing some conkers. Horse chestnut trees in north London shedding their conkers, people picking them up and throwing them about.' The Old Bailey had heard the boys had been throwing conkers at two female friends before Steven was nearly struck by a flying chestnut hurled by one of the men, triggering the row.

The promising student was walking along College Close when the argument escalated and he was attacked by the 15-year-old. The accused blamed another youth for the stabbing, but was identified from his distinctive clothing on CCTV. He claimed Mr Grisales had over-reacted and tried to hit him with a skateboard. Neighbour Mandy Addy said she was looking out of her window and saw one of the youths lunge at Mr Grisales. She said she had earlier seen three people sitting on a wall in front of her house and then heard the sound of shouting. 'It was a very excited, that kind of voice,' she told the Old Bailey. 'I looked out the window. The person who got stabbed was facing towards me. He was gesturing with his hands. 'He had his arms up and was trying to placate him.' She then saw the youth who was confronting Mr Grisales swing his arm at the victim. 'He seemed to make contact with the victim’s left side. The two other people who were with him seemed to be shouting,' Ms Addy said. The victim went down on one knee, but managed to lift himself up to his feet. 'There was a second blow. It landed in the same place. The victim was shouting. He went down a second time. 'He got up. He tried to make it down the road to the train station. He quickly changed his mind and ran across the road and into the garden of another house.' Ms Addy said two other neighbours ran to try and help Mr Grisales and she called the police.

Anger: Live on air Mr Paxman said Greece could be vomited out of the Euro like a bad kebab, to the anger of a guest . Jeremy Paxman has compared Greece's potential exit from the Euro to that of 'a bad kebab' being 'vomited out.' The Newsnight presenter was given a tongue-lashing by a Greek guest and criticised on Twitter after his comments, made on the show last night, were branded 'offensive' and 'disrespectful' to the country and its people. The abrasive BBC journalist was describing Greece's political and financial problems when he used the 'bad kebab' analogy to explain what the rest of the Eurozone may want to do with them. But after he was criticised Mr Paxman backed down, not defending his analogy. Greece has another election in mid-June, which could decide whether or not they stay in the Euro. But as pro and anti-bailout parties are neck and neck in the polls another stalemate is possible, which could force Euro countries like Germany and France to throw them out themselves. 'So the rest of the Eurozone now contemplates something we were being . told wasn't conceivable recently, that, like a bad kebab, Greece is . vomited out of the single European currency, ' Mr Paxman said. But former Greek finance minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou then turned on him and told him off live on air last night. Stern: Former Greek finance minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou told Mr Paxman off live on air . Uncertainty: Greece is in a state of political and social turmoil, that could hasten its exit from the single European currency . 'I take issue with your bad kebab analogy, which I find offensive,' he said. 'The Greek economy is in a crisis and the Greek people are going through a lot and they deserve some respect. I really did not find that very appropriate.' Backed: Mr Papakonstantinou won the support of Twitter users, one of whom praised him for making Mr Paxman 'look a total idiot' One tweeter backed Mr Papakonstantinou, writing: 'Paxman was made to look a total idiot by comparing the Greek economy to a bad kebab.' Another added: 'That former Greek finance minister really slapped him down.' Greece was forced to call a June 17 vote after a parliamentary . election on May 6 left parliament divided evenly between groups of . parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a 130 . billion-euro rescue package agreed with lenders in March. Greece's pro-bailout New Democracy (ND) party is only just ahead of the . anti-bailout SYRIZA party . Meanwhile Irish voters are deciding whether their government can ratify the European Union's fiscal treaty, a deficit-fighting pact designed to bind Ireland and other debt-crippled eurozone members to tighter spending limits.

"By . Richard Shears . UPDATED: . 04:18 EST, 19 October 2011 . It will be the 16th time the Queen has visited Australia, though some protests are expected . Pro-republic protesters are believed to be secretly planning to disrupt the Queen's visit to Australia after she arrives in the country tomorrow for a 10-day visit. She and the Duke of Edinburgh will be given a ceremonial welcome after touching down in the capital, Canberra, at sunset - symbolic timing for what, at the age of 85, might be her last tour Down Under. And while protesters in Melbourne are expected to demonstrate against her 16th visit, all the protest flags and shouts of 'Go Home' will be nothing new to her - she has smiled gracefully whenever anti-royalists have tried to make their voices heard. Coming quickly to the Queen's defence, Mr Matthew Archer, an official with the Australian Monarchist League, said last night any protest would be immature. 'They don't need to take to the streets - we already know that some are opposed to the Monarchy so what will they gain by telling us over and over again?' he asked. Anti-Monarchists are in the majority when it comes to support for Australia continuing its links with the Monarchy - despite dinner-table talk suggestions that the country wants to go it alone, opinion polls reveal that support for a republic has been waning.

The Queen opens the Sydney Opera House in 1973 (left) and  she is shown preparing to fly out from Heathrow to Canberra in 1980 (right) A poll conducted earlier this year among 1,200 people showed that interest in forming a republic has dropped to a 17-year low of 41 per cent, down from 45 per cent in 2007. The popularity of Prince William and his wife is also expected to provide a boost to continued links with the Monarchy. The Queen, who has had a 57-year love affair with Australia, is still well liked and the 90-year-old Duke is regarded as a jolly fellow whose witty - and sometimes foot-in-the-mouth - comments add a light presence to formal occasions. A military band will play and hundreds of school children will be on hand to greet the royal couple when they touch down in Canberra. And it will be a time for fond memories - even if some are second hand. Hugh McDonald-Crowley, who has been chosen by his school to greet the Queen at Canberra airport recalled that his mother was aged three when she saw the Queen. 'My mum told me she almost kicked the Queen in the shins because mum was so small - and my Great Uncle Peter met the Queen because he used to be the Governor of New South Wales, so he's had the Queen stay with him,' he said. The Queen and the Duke will cross a nearby lake aboard a barge that some have described as looking something like a classic vintage cruiser from a James Bond movie. A new collectable $5 coin has been struck by the Mint to celebrate the Queen's tour, which includes visits to Brisbane, where she will meet victims of this year's floods, and trips to Melbourne and Perth. A flower show, boat trips, a ride in a tram and an Aussie barbecue are among the events planned for the royal couple.","Queen Elizabeth continues 57-year love affair with Australia .

A warehouse worker has been sacked after breaking a dress code banning him from wearing Calvin Klein underpants to work. Aaron Barnard had worked at the DHL . warehouse in Sherburn, West Yorks for three months when bosses gave him . his marching orders - following a routine spot check. Managers claim he signed a contract promising not to wear Calvin Klein underwear, because it's distributed from the factory - but the 22-year-old insists he has serial numbers that prove he didn't steal the pants and is accusing his bosses of forcing him out. Fired for wearing pants: Aaron Barnard with the offending underwear that cost him his job at a DHL warehouse in Sherburn, Yorkshire . Mr Barnard had just finished his 2pm until 10pm shift when he was spot-checked and made to show his pants and socks to his supervisor. When they realised that Aaron was wearing Calvin Klein boxer shorts he was asked not to return to the factory. The company claim when Aaron was hired he agreed to the dress code. But Aaron, of Selby, North Yorkshire, claims the contract didn't say he would face instant dismissal and he insist he is not the first person to have broken the rule. Aaron Barnard believes bosses used the underpants incident as an excuse to get rid of him . He said: 'I don’t want people thinking I’m a trouble causer, I just want to work, . but I need to clear my name - I am not a thief. I know I shouldn’t have . had the boxers on and can’t think why I did - you just don’t think . about it sometimes. It’s really harsh saying I can’t return and their motives are questionable. 'I . was getting to the point where I would be getting a full contract with . more employee rights and I think they’ve got rid of me before that . point. 'They offer no uniform and it definitely did not say in my contract that I would be sacked, other people have been caught and they’ve been let off with a warning. 'I haven’t done anything wrong. It was an honest mistake other people have made in the warehouse. They treated me like I had stolen them until I emailed them a picture of the serial number but they treated me like a thief. 'You can see the boxers aren’t new. You just put your boxer shorts on in the morning and go to work.' He added: 'I’ve never even seen the boxer shorts being packed in the depot. I worked on shoes and handbags, sorting the boxes to be distributed out.” Aaron got the DHL job through recruitment agency Blue Arrow. In an attempt to clear his name he sent them a photo of his shorts label serial number to prove they hadn’t been processed at the Hurricane Way distribution park depot. Aaron recorded a phone call the day after his dismissal in which a Blue Arrow employee confirmed DHL don’t want him to return. He tells Aaron he would need to produce a receipt for his boxer shorts to prove they weren’t from the DHL depot, but assures him theft allegations won’t go on his file. Blue Arrow have told Aaron he can continue to operate for them elsewhere but not back at DHL in Sherburn. Pants: Mr Barnard has serial numbers that he claims prove his boxer shorts were shipped from a different warehouse . 'With the serial number you can prove the boxers hadn’t come through the DHL warehouse,' said Aaron. 'Calvin Klein will have all the serial numbers and release dates of those boxer shorts.' He added: “The managers got on with me. I was a good worker and I worked hard. It seems a bit of a coincidence I was coming up to getting on a permanent contract.' Aaron claims he knows of other DHL employees who’ve been caught wearing Calvin Kleins, but escaped with warnings. A Blue Arrow spokeswoman said: 'All of our employees working on the contract are made fully aware at start point of employment on the required dress code, and the consequences of not adhering to that policy.'","Staff banned from wearing the brand because it's distributed from same warehouse .

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 6 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:05 EST, 6 May 2012 . Iain Duncan Smith: The Work and Pensions Secretary said the amount being claimed on benefits was 'absurd' More than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers’ £47,000 salary, it has been revealed. The figure was disclosed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith before letters are sent to households this week explaining a new cap on benefits under which no one can claim more than the average annual working wage of £26,000. The cap comes into force next April and aims to remove the disincentive to work that leaves many of the unemployed better off on benefits. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘For more than ten years Labour let the benefits bill soar, and these figures show the scale of the problem. ‘It is absurd that people are able to claim as much on benefits as a higher rate taxpayer earns. ‘The welfare state should work as a safety net and then support people to financial independence. ‘That is why I am writing to benefit recipients, to let them know that we will be working with them over the coming year to give them every support to find work and become self-sufficient. 'Our welfare reforms will make sure a life in work always pays more than a life on benefits, and are a clear illustration that this Government is on the side of people who work hard, do the right thing and aspire to a better life.’ The 11,000 households exposed by Mr . Duncan Smith enjoy benefits of more than £34,000 a year, equating to a . gross wage of £47,000. This is enough to put most employees into the . higher rate 40p tax band. This week the Government will write to . 67,000 households that could be affected by having their benefits . reduced to the £26,000 limit, spelling out the support available to find . work. 'A basic issue of fairness': David Cameron . According to official figures, at least 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about £5,000 per month – enough to fund a £1million mortgage. Households exempt from the cap include those where there are  people in work and claiming working tax credits, and families that are deemed to be very vulnerable – including war widows and those claiming disability living allowance. People who have lost their job but were employed for 12 months or more prior to claiming benefits will have nine months’ grace before the cap applies. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. ‘The welfare system needs to provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable in society, but these figures demonstrate that the current system has got out of control and that the Government’s proposed benefits cap needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency.’ The Prime Minister has also said it is ‘time to call time’ on excessive benefits. David Cameron said in January: ‘It’s a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? ‘I don’t believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view.’ Ministers will overhaul the tax and benefits system from October next year, when a universal credit will be introduced to simplify the system and replace swathes of tax credits and benefits. They claim it will ensure that no one will be better off on benefits than in work, removing the so-called ‘cliff edge’ where those who take on part-time work end up worse off as benefits are removed. But critics have warned that families affected by the benefits cap could lose their homes, as around 44 per cent of those set to be hit are living in social housing. David Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: ‘The letters will come as a shock to many vulnerable families. The overall benefit cap is a crude measure that fails to reflect the stark differences in housing costs across the country caused by the desperate shortage of affordable housing.’ He called on councils to share information they had on who could be affected so that housing associations could offer help. ‘With under a year to go before many people start losing their homes, there’s no time to lose,’ he added.","Figure disclosed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith .

Harlie Thompson, five, has undergone life saving surgery after he was kicked in the head by an illegally tethered horse . A five-year-old boy has undergone life-saving surgery after a gypsy’s horse illegally tethered near a children’s playground kicked him in the head. Schoolboy Harlie Thomson suffered a fractured skull when the horse reared up and hoofed him as he retrieved a football. The built up area of Buttershaw, in Bradford, West Yorks, is blighted by travellers’ animals tied up on public land and grass verges.Harlie had a three hour operation to stop his skull piercing his brain. His mother, Laura Thomson, 23, of Buttershaw, was told there was only a 20 per cent chance her son would survive the procedure which was carried out at Leeds General Infirmary after her son was injured on Sunday. But Harlie returned home on Thursday to recover further. Now Miss Thomson the owners of the horse to be traced and prosecuted. Bradford Council, which is working with the police to track down the owner, has condemned ‘reckless owners’ who illegally tether horses on public land. Miss Thomson, a mum-of-three, said: ‘I didn’t see what happened, I turned around and he was on the ground, face down on the floor.‘I thought the horse had caught his face because his face had gone to the side and down but we’ve been told it was actually caused by a mild stroke. ‘He was having a seizure, he was fitting so much I tied him to me. ‘I was panicking and I didn’t know what to do, whether to keep him still or run him away from the horse who was just standing there eating the grass. ‘He looked lifeless after the fit had died down. ‘He was pouring with blood, it covered my coat from collar to bottom when I carried him. ‘It was terrifying, I honestly thought Harlie was dead. It’s disgusting someone could leave a horse in a children’s play area. My son could have been killed.’ The horse was startled after Harlie - a pupil at Holme Farm Primary School - and friend Lee Kirwan, seven, went to retrieve a football. Shocking: Harlie had a three hour operation to stop his skull piercing his brain - surgeons drilled a hole in his head to relieve pressure . Miss Thomson said: ‘The horse went up on its back legs and kicked the back of Harlie’s head. ‘Harlie was lying face down on the ground and started fitting so I rushed over to pick him up to move him away from the horse. I was in such a panic, I couldn’t believe what was happening.’ The boy was taken by ambulance to Bradford Royal Infirmary but was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for surgery to lift part of his fractured skull away from his brain. Surgeons drilled a hole in his head to relieve pressure from his brain. Miss Thomson said: ‘I was told it was entirely possible that he would be paralysed and unable to feed himself. I was also told that because he had the seizure he could be prone to epileptic fits. A horse, similar to the one that kicked Harlie, tethered in a public area very close to his home in Buttershaw . Better: Harlie has made a remarkable recovery after almost being killed when he was kicked in the head . ‘He had five fractured bones. He had a severe bleed throughout the operation and that’s why it took so long. ‘I was told not to expect him to come out of it and if he did he could be paralysed - that he might not be able to walk, talk or feed himself again. ‘Thankfully he seems to be making a good recovery so far, but he may need to have a metal plate inserted in his head. ‘I’m sure whoever’s horse this is knows this has happened and I want them to know the damage it’s done.’ Harlie, who is on antibiotics, will need to go in for regular check-ups and may need a metal plate in his head later in life. Miss Thomson, who has two other children, Deacon, seven, and Lacie, three, said: ‘He is only on antibiotics. I can’t believe how well he is. But we still have to be very careful, I have to sleep with him and go to the toilet with him. ‘I don’t think he really knows what happened, they say the fit wiped his memory which is good because he won’t have any flashbacks or dreams about it. He just thinks he had a nasty accident.’ Before the accident: Harlie is lucky to be alive after the terrible accident which could have left him paralysed .","Harlie Thomson had a three-hour operation to stop skull piercing his brain .

Michael Brown, the fraudster who donated millions to the Liberal Democrats, is to return to Britain from Spain this week to begin a seven-year prison sentence. Brown agreed not to block the extradition process at a hearing at the National Court in Madrid. He went on the run in 2008 after stealing £36 million by posing as a bond trader. Extradition: Convicted fraudster Michael Brown and his wife Sharon pictured in Mallorca in 2008 . His victims included former Manchester United chairman, Martin Edwards, who was defrauded of £8 million. Brown fled to the Dominican Republic and was convicted in his absence of fraud by Southwark Crown Court, South London. In 2005, he gave the Lib Dems the party’s biggest-ever donation of £2.4 million. British police will fly to Spain this week to collect Brown, who is being held at the Soto del Real prison outside Madrid. Glasgow-born Brown, 46, was arrested in the Dominican Republic in January where he was living under the name of Darren Nally. He was flown  to Madrid last week. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said: ‘I’m pleased he’s coming back to serve his sentence. This is a convicted fraudster.’ Speaking of the donation, he said: ‘It happened before I was an MP. 'The Electoral Commission found it was received in good faith. 'All checks that should be made were made.’ The Deputy Prime Minister has insisted his party will not repay £2.4million . of ill-gotten gains Brown gave his party in 2005. He added: ‘If we’d been shown wanting on those accounts, then of course we should pay the money back.’ And mystery continues to surround a missing £18million which police are still trying to trace. That decision has sparked fury amid claims that even Brown thinks the Lib Dems failed to scrutinise his firm properly before accepting the cash. Brown will face an extradition hearing this week that should lead to him being put on a plane to the UK to serve a seven-year prison sentence. An international manhunt was launched when he went on the run after stealing up to £60million. He was arrested in the Dominican Republic in January in the town of Punta Cana over an unrelated fraud charge. Prosecutors in the Dominican Republic said Brown was deported to Spain at the request of British police. The UK does not have a formal extradition agreement with the Dominican Republic, so in an elaborate deal it was agreed that he would be sent first to Spain. If Brown does not appeal against extradition to Britain, it will have to take place within ten days. Lavish: Brown's private gated hideaway . in the Dominican Republic. Up until recently he was renting a . property within the exclusive Arrecife estate, a resort community with its own golf courses and private . beaches . A spokesman for the City of London Police said: ‘We will be taking the appropriate steps to bring him back via a European Arrest Warrant.’ Det Supt Bob Wishart added: ‘Mr Brown is a step closer to returning to the UK to start his prison sentence. ‘We hope that him facing justice will bring some closure to the victims who suffered as a result of his frauds.’ But his victims got cold comfort from the Liberal Democrats, who have repeatedly refused to hand over money to those defrauded by Brown. An Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found the Lib Dems accepted the fraudster’s donation in good faith and cleared them of wrongdoing. Mr Clegg denied the party had a moral responsibility to hand over the money. Labour deputy chairman Tom Watson has published details of a draft letter written by Mr Brown, which . he says is with the police, and in which the fraudster alleges the Lib . Dems carried out only rudimentary checks on whether his was a legitimate . company. It says: ‘In the case of the donation made by my company, very little due diligence was undertaken. Michael Brown made a record donation to the Liberal Democrat party which is now run by Nick Clegg . ‘A . check was made in Companies House that the company was duly . incorporated but little or no due diligence was undertaken on whether . the company was trading.’ Mr . Watson said: 'It’s hard not to conclude that the money should be . repaid. Clearly, Mr Clegg’s party failed to conduct all proper checks.' Labour MP Steve McCabe called for ‘proceeds of crime legislation to be used to recover money he gave Lib Dems’. Mike Gapes, another MP, added the ‘Lib Dems surely have a moral responsibility to pay back to his victims’. The . usual route from the Dominican Republic to the UK is via Miami in . Florida. But Britain wanted to avoid a stopover there to avoid any . chance of Brown being held by the U.S. authorities, who are also probing . reports of him money laundering. He . is also wanted in Mallorca on fraud charges, opening the prospect that . he will be sent back to Spain after completing his sentence in the UK.","Michael Brown, 46, fled to Caribbean in 2008 after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court .

The lone survivor of a trio of men who were lost at sea has told how he desperately tried to flag down a passing cruise ship but watched, helplessly, as it sailed away. Adrian Vásquez, 18, said he was enraged the Star Princess did not stop to save him and his two friends despite being spotted by passengers on board. Vásquez said he and his friends had gone fishing on the tiny boat on February 24 when the engine broke down. Sighting: This photo was taken by birdwatcher Jeff Gilligan from aboard the Star Princess and claims to show the stricken fishing boat and red shirt used by the sailors to try to signal for help . Jeff Gilligan was one of the passengers who spotted the tiny fishing boat while bird watching but his messages to the captain did not get through . Incredible strength: Vasquez, bottom left, receives medical attention on a commercial fishing boat after his life was saved by a sudden rainstorm . Out of mobile phone range, they had no choice but to survive on fish they had caught and hoped they would be spotted. Since being rescued  Vásquez has told how he used a piece of red cloth to try and flag the vessel down. Vásquez said he immediately shouted to his two friends Elvis Oropeza Betancourt, 31, and Fernando Osario, 16, that he had spotted the ship. Though very weak and near death, Elvis also joined in by using a brightly coloured life jacket. The ship didn't stop, and the tiny fishing boat drifted for another two weeks before it was found. By then, Vásquez's two friends had died. '""I said, 'God will not forgive them,""' he said, 'Today, I still feel rage when I remember that.' The cruise ship, which is owned by Carnival - the same corporation behind the operators of the Cost Concordia - which capsized earlier this year, apparently passed fishing boat Fifty Cent off the coast of Panama and despite passengers raising the alarm, did not detour to pick up the three fishermen. Two birdwatchers on the deck of the . luxury cruise ship spotted the stricken men with a long-range telescope . and saw one of them waving a red cloth to attract their attention. 'Ignored sightings': Three passengers on a deck of the Star Princess claim to have reported seeing frantic signals from those aboard the stranded fishing boat, but say the liner continued to sail on . Jeff Gilligan and Judy Meredith, . both from Oregon, raised the alarm with a sales representative on the . ship, showing him through the telescope what they could see. Barred from going to the bridge . themselves, they relied on him to pass on the message to the captain, . which he assured them he had done. Probe: Captain Edward Perrin is said to have been at the helm of the ship when it is claimed to have been near the stranded fishing boat . 'You don't wave a shirt like that just to be friendly, said Ms Meredith. 'He was desperate to get our attention.' But when the ship continued on its course and nothing happened, the passengers began to worry. Ms Meredith went to her cabin and . noted their coordinates from a TV feed from the ship, emailing the . information to both the US Costa Guard and her son. 'We were kind of freaking out, thinking we don't see anything else happening,' she said. Mr Gilligan could no longer bear to watch. 'It was very disturbing,' he said. 'We asked other people, ""What do you think we should do?"" Their reaction was: ""Well, you've done what you could do."" Whether something else could have been done, that's a bit frustrating to think about.' After Elvis and Fernando died, Vásquez was eventually picked up by a fishing boat off Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, more than 600 miles from where they had set out. Vásquez said he slipped their bodies into the sea after they began to rot in the heat. Before he was rescued, a rainstorm gave him fresh water to drink, helping him survive. Throughout the ordeal, he thought about his eight brothers, and never gave up hope. Safe at home, Vásquez said he recognized their boat from the photos Mr Gilligan had taken with his 300 mm lens. 'Yes, that's it. That's it. That is us,' he said. 'You can see there, the red sweater I'm waving and, above it is the sheet that we put up to protect us from the sun.' Vásquez mentioned the ship in his first statement to Panamanian authorities when he returned to his country. Gradual recovery: The teenager poses with Ecuadorean sailors after coming close to perishing on the ocean and having to push his dead friends overboard . Back at home in Oregon, Meredith couldn't sleep, wondering what happened to the men. Doomed journey: Adrian Vasquez, left, pictured with an unidentified friend in Rio Hato, Panama, went missing on February 24 after the motor on the group's boat failed . Reading a news story about a Panamanian rescued off Ecuador after 28 days in an open boat, she figured that was the boat they had seen. She pestered Princess Cruises, the Coast Guard, and even the Panamanian embassy. 'We were all just sick about it, and just wanted to believe the ship notified someone,' she said. Meanwhile, the captain of the vessel, has said he is devastated that the message was not relayed to him. Captain Edward Perrin is one of the company's most experienced and said he would never knowingly turn his back on someone who was stranded. In a statement released by the company, it said: 'Princess Cruises deeply regrets that two Panamanian men perished at sea after their boat became disabled in early March. 'Since we became aware of this incident, we have been investigating circumstances surrounding the claim that Star Princess failed to come to the aid of the disabled boat, after a crew member was alerted by passengers. 'The preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger's concern. Neither Captain Edward Perrin nor the officer of the watch were notified. 'Understandably, Captain Perrin is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress. Had the Captain received this information, he would have had the opportunity to respond. 'We all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress, and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea. 'In fact, we have done so more than 30 times in the last ten years. We deeply regret this incident and are continuing our investigation to fully understand the circumstances.'

The explosions, said to have ripped the facade off a military intelligence building, happened at about 7:50 am local time (0500 GMT), when . employees usually arrive at work. The building is part of a . broader military compound for a feared section of the intelligence . services known as the Palestine Branch. Syrian foreign ministry spokesman . Jihad Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go . to hospitals to donate blood, saying that today's blast 'might be the . strongest' of a wave of explosions that have hit Damascus since late .

Eyewitnesses reported seeing smouldering . cars and pickup trucks after the explosions and the grisly sight of . medical workers collecting human remains. The outer wall of the military intelligence building collapsed, although the structure inside appeared intact. The Syrian government, which blamed 'terrorists', said the explosives used weighed more than 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds).

Victim: Syrian civilians help a man injured in today's explosions in Damascus . A previous explosion in the capital on April 27 occurred when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and wounding 26. Syria's conflict started in March 2011 with mass protests calling for political reform. The government swiftly cracked down, . dispatching tanks, troops, snipers and pro-government thugs to quash . dissent, and many members of the opposition took up arms to defend . themselves and attack government troops. There has not yet been any claim of . responsibility for this morning's blasts, but an al-Qaeda-inspired group . has said it was behind several past explosions; raising fears that . terrorist groups are entering the fray and exploiting the chaos. The . British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least one of . the explosions was caused by a car bomb and that the target was . buildings in the area's military intelligence complex. Opposition to al-Assad, which began . with peaceful protests in March last year, has grown increasingly . violent and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said this week he was . worried by an 'alarming upsurge' in bombings. The UN says Syrian forces have killed more than 9,000 people in their crackdown on a 14-month uprising. But . Syrian authorities blame foreign-backed Islamist militants for the . violence, saying they have killed 2,600 soldiers and police. A . UN brokered ceasefire was supposed to come into force four weeks ago . but, despite an initial drop in the level of violence, the bloodshed has . continued. Activists say government forces have . shelled several cities and rebels have maintained attacks on security . forces. Today's blasts came a day after Ban Ki-moon told the UN General . Assembly of his concerns about an increase in bomb attacks in Syria. Desperate: Civilians and security personnel try to remove a car from an explosion site . 'There is no escaping the reality that we see every day,' he said. 'Innocent civilians dying, government troops and heavy armour in city streets, growing numbers of arrests and allegations of brutal torture, an alarming upsurge in the use of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] and other explosive devices throughout the country.' Aftermath: A body is removed from a blast site . International diplomacy has failed to stop the bloodshed, but the UN has ruled out military intervention like that which helped bring down Libya's Colonel Gaddafi, partly out of fear it could increase the violence.Yesterday, a roadside bomb hit a Syrian military truck in a southern province just seconds after the head of the UN observer team was driving by in a convoy, demonstrating the fragility of the international plan to end the country's bloodshed.In Washington, meanwhile, President Barack Obama took steps to extend sanctions against al-Assad's government, saying Syria poses an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to US national security and diplomatic goals.

For suspected drug trafficker Ronaldo Silva, prison was a real drag... so he decided to escape in what he thought was the perfect disguise. When his wife came to visit, he popped on her bra, threw on a wig and poured his curves into her pretty blue dress. He even shaved his arms and legs for good measure, and squeezed into a pair of killer heels. But his plan to sashay through the prison gates went awry after he forgot one thing: it can take a woman years to master how to glide naturally in high heels. What a drag getting caught: Ronaldo Silva popped on his wife's bra, threw on a wig and poured his curves into her pretty blue dress for the daring escape... but hadn't mastered how to walk in heels . Half an hour into his daring bid for freedom, one eagle-eyed guard noticed that, despite looking like a woman, he didn't walk like one. He was followed as far as the bus station before police picked him up and dragged him back to jail. The jail's director Carlos Welber said Silva had swapped clothes with his wife during her weekly visit. She left the prison wearing his bermuda shorts and another top she had brought in her bag. Foolproof plan: Silva had been awaiting trial for drug trafficking until his escape attempt . He told Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'He left the prison shortly after her, along with other inmates' wives. He was wearing a wig, painted false nails and a long dress. He'd spent a long time shaving his legs and arms. There was a lot of preparation and premeditation involved in this.' Silva managed to get past prison guards, but a policeman patrolling the street outside became suspicious and decided to follow him. Mr Welber said: 'He noticed that the woman was walking funny and looked strange. He followed him to the bus station, where two men were waiting on motorbikes to pick him up. 'The policeman approached him and managed to arrest him and bring him back, still dressed as a woman.' Silva had been awaiting trial for drug trafficking. He was transferred to the prison last month after another escape attempt, when armed men tried to invade another jail to release him. According to Mr Welber, Silva's wife admitted changing clothes with her husband but claimed she had no idea why he wanted them. He said: 'He was the one who demanded her clothes, at least that's what she's telling us. Of course we don't believe her, but that's her story. 'At the time it was visiting hour and there were more than 150 family members inside the prison. But we're taking measures to ensure this doesn't happen again.'","Ronaldo Silva wore wig, lipstick and wife's bra and dress - he even shaved his arms and legs .

Two mothers arranged a fight via Facebook and brawled outside a school after dropping off their children, a court heard yesterday. Joanna McVey, 25, and Lorraine Couper, 30, fought near Dunblane Primary School after the online dispute. Couper warned McVey that she should bring an AK47 assault rifle with her for the fight. Yesterday, Stirling Sheriff Court heard that the vicious cat fight spilled on to a nearby road at nine o’clock in the morning. School gate brawl: Lorraine Couper, left, and Joanna McVey, right, fell out on Facebook over who should have been invited to a party . The dispute apparently started after a falling out over who should have been invited to a party McVey had hosted. Both mothers had been dropping their children off for school when the fight took place – and both were injured. McVey claimed she was left with a ‘sore face’ after being hit by a dog chain. Following the fight, both McVey and Couper were charged – but proceedings against Couper were later dropped. In court yesterday, Emma Whyte, prosecuting, said: ‘On the evening of 13 December, Miss Couper was at home using the internet to access a social networking site. ‘The accused was on the same site at her home. A text conversation took place in relation to a party the accused was having. The complainer was angry the accused didn’t invite a mutual friend and the conversation became heated. ‘The next day, the accused challenged the complainer to a fight and said, “Come on, then. We’ll sort this out now. Square go”. The complainer advised the accused she would not fight there but would elsewhere. A short time later, the accused approached Miss Couper and they engaged in a fight.’ Fight: The pair brawled close to Dunblane Primary School, Perthshire, the court was told . McVey, from Dunblane, Perthshire, admitted that, on December 14 last year she acted in a disorderly manner and challenged Couper to a fight, engaged in a fight and committed a breach of the peace. A not guilty plea was accepted to a charge of assaulting Couper, repeatedly striking her on the head and body with a dog lead and making a threatening hand gesture. Frazer McCready, defending, said: ‘This involved two women who should have known better and started with name calling over the internet on Facebook. ‘My client took her child to the school and met up with the complainer and it all spilled over. ‘When my client was interviewed by police, she said, “It was a square go, which she wanted. She was the one with the chain and I’m the one with the sore face. I don’t believe I got involved in this”.’ He read out a Facebook message from Couper to McVey on the night before the fight. It read: ‘Gie us a shout when your children are in bed. I’ll come round and we can sort this out.’ Another read: ‘You better bring your tomahawk, AK47 and a knife with you.’ Mr McCready said Couper had also been charged by police, ‘but for some reason The Crown decided not to proceed against her’. Sheriff William Gilchrist fined McVey £190.","Mothers fell out in online dispute over who should be invited to a party .

Looking back at the days leading up to the fatal July 20 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, it appears now that there were ignored warning signs that could have saved many lives. Psychiatrist Dr Lynne Fenton who counseled shooter James Holmes reportedly tried to discuss her worries about his mental condition with University of Colorado staff and at least one campus police officer in early June. On June 10, the once-promising graduate student dropped out of the school, and the university officials who were aware of Dr. Fenton's concerns apparently felt they could no longer do anything to follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction. Little did they know that Holmes bought his first assault weapon just three days before leaving the school. Concerns: Dr Lynne Fenton (left) called University of Colorado security staff about student James Holmes . Nightline reports that while Dr. Fenton- who is a member of the . campus behavior evaluation and . threat assessment team herself- notified an unspecified number of other . members, the entire group never convened to discuss the threat posed by . Holmes because he had already left the university. Said group was created to address behavioral problems as well as potential security issues involving students and was composed of faculty and staff, including campus . police. Fenton . could not be immediately reached for comment. Members of the university . did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment. The doctor has since been questioned by Colorado police as a part of the investigation into the shooting which left 12 dead and 58 injured. A lawyer was present for the meeting. Holmes' attorneys filed a motion that revealed Holmes was seeing the psychiatrist. The . revelation raised questions about Holmes' year of study at the . university's medical campus and about possible motives behind the . shooting. An online resumé listed schizophrenia as one of Dr Fenton's research interests. Who knew what: University of Colorado police chief Doug Abraham answered questions at a news conference just days after the attack but the details of the chain of command have still been kept quiet . Threats: On the same day as the press conference, police were called to the school because a suspicious package was found on the campus . The . defense motion demanded that a package allegedly sent to Dr Fenton by . Holmes, and received at the university after the shooting, be kept . sealed because of doctor-patient confidentiality. It also demanded information on who may have leaked information about . its contents to some news media outlets that reported that Holmes had . written descriptions of an attack in a notebook. The spiral-bound pad, . which sat unopened in the campus mail room, was filled with . gun-wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures, a law . enforcement source said. 'Killer': Dave said he believes the caller was James Holmes, pictured in court, but cannot prove it . Remembering the victims: He is suspected of shooting dead 12 cinema-goers and 58 more injured . Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers disputed reports that a notebook contained descriptions of an attack.

Two wives: Former Tory council leader Pervez Choudhry has escaped jail despite being convicted of bigamy . A married Tory councillor who took a second wife after convincing her he was divorced has escaped jail despite being convicted of bigamy. Pervez Choudhry, 54, was caught out when his new wife hired a private detective to investigate him after a remark from a relative aroused her suspicions. Dr Zabina Shahian, a GP, discovered that when Choudhry married her in Pakistan in December 2010 he had been legally married to his first cousin Hameda Daulat since 1986. The career politician, former leader of Slough borough council’s Conservative Party, had told Dr Shahian about his first wife, but had convinced her that he was no longer married by showing her court papers about custody hearings regarding their three children, Reading Crown Court heard. When Dr Shahian discovered the deception she ended their relationship and subsequently suffered a miscarriage. The disgraced politician was fined £750 on Friday and ordered to pay £4,000 compensation to Dr Shahian. Judge Ian Grainger told him: ‘You have served your community well, in particular as a councillor and at one stage as leader of the Conservative group. ‘This offence is a serious blemish on that character. Bigamy is in no sense a private matter. The rule . . . is a simple one – one spouse at a time. ‘Whatever cultural roots that rule may have, there’s practical wisdom in that rule.’ After the case Choudhry, who plans to appeal, claimed he had been forced to get engaged to his first wife when he was 11 and she was just a baby. The marriage went ahead, he claimed, because it was his mother’s dying wish, but he said it was unhappy despite the best efforts of his partner. He added: ‘We kept the first marriage for our children because . there’s a stigma attached to families that divorce, but we went our separate ways’. After meeting Dr Shahian, he said that within hours ‘she had made up her mind that I was the person she was waiting for.’ He added: ‘This has brought up one thing – this is always going to be a problem being a Muslim. 'I cannot sleep with anybody without getting married. I’m between a rock and a hard place.’ First wife: Conservative councillor Choudhry, 54, with Hameda Daulat, his first cousin he married in 1986 . Second wife: Pervez Choudry with GP Dr Zabina Shahihan who he married in Pakistan in December 2010. She ended their relationship when she discovered the deception . Dr Shahian called in a private detective agency following a flippant remark from one of his relatives. His first wife had already informed police, but an initial investigation stalled as he claimed their religious ceremony would not count as an official marriage. It was not until Dr Shahian reported him to the police that it emerged the religious ceremony would qualify under Pakistani law as a wedding. Outside court Dr Shahian said that the marriage had ruined her life. She added: ‘It’s really affected me. I’ve been at a standstill.

Pensioners: Robin Daykin, 74, and wife Annette, 62, from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, have sold their croft and piled their life savings into a high performance 600c superbike with sidecar . They are at an age when they could be forgiven for putting their feet up and relaxing a little. But pensioners Robin Daykin, 74, and wife Annette, 62, who live in Scotland have no plans to slow down in life. In fact, they are taking part in one of the fastest and most dangerous motorbike races on the planet. The husband-and-wife team sold their croft and threw themselves headlong into the world of high-performance superbikes. They gave up a lifetime of farming to invest in a 600cc superbike with sidecar – so they can compete in TT races. While their friends are content with a bus pass, these grandparents will soon be tearing round the track taking on riders less than half their age on the gruelling Formula Two circuit in this month’s famous Isle of Man races. The couple, from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, packed up and sold their croft eight years ago and dipped into their savings to finance a new thrill in life. Mr Daykin convinced his wife they should invest in a classic Royal Enfield motorbike and sidecar to race. Mrs Daykin said the couple’s three children – Nicola, Damian and Tree – were all grown up with their own families and so, after retiring they decided to revive an old passion for motorbikes . She said: ‘Neither of us wanted a quiet life. This is our time to go out and have fun.’ After some gentle persuasion, she agreed to join her partner in calmer Classic Club races. But they soon became bored and decided to upgrade to a super-powered 600cc Yamaha R6 and sidecar to compete in the Formula Two circuit. Performance: Robin and Annette Daykin in their leathers trialling their 'Team Past It' 600c superbike with sidecar in which they compete in TT races around the world . Thrills and spills: Annette Daykin falling from at Scotland's East Fortune track in 2008 during a race in their 600cc motorbike with sidecar . Skid: The couple on their Team Past It bike crashing during a TT race last year - luckily neither of them were hurt in the incident . They have raced under the banner of Team Past It after a young competitor told Mr Daykin he was too slow. The Daykins – who have six grandchildren – moved to Scotland from Yorkshire in 1985, and have built up a strong following, even winning the best newcomer award. Mr Daykin, who turns 75 next week, first competed in sidecar racing at the Manx Grand Prix mountain circuit in 1957, aged 20. Now, they are gearing up to battle against some of the world’s fastest drivers at next month’s races. And this won’t be the couple’s first time on the circuit. Upgrade: Team Past It at the Czech TT in 2005 before Robin and Annette Daykin found their old Royal Enfield wasn't fast enough and putting their life savings into a high performance 600c superbike with sidecar . Experience: Robin Daykin when he was 20-years-old racing at the Manx Gran Prix in 1957 on the Isle of Man where he will with wife Annette later this month . Mrs Daykin said: ‘Last time we went to the Isle of Man we had a fabulous time and we can’t wait to go back.’ Mr Daykin has already fought his way through troubles that would have finished many a track career. Three years ago he learned he had prostate cancer and then weeks later he suffered a broken neck in a horror high-speed crash. He said: ‘I had a bit of a rough time. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then I broke my neck in a racing accident in Wales. ‘But despite all the pain, it’s safe to say my fortunes really turned around. 12 weeks later, I had fully recovered from both the prostate cancer and the broken neck.’ Now, the couple can’t wait to get racing again. Mr Daykin said: ‘It will be great to get going in the Isle of Man.’ Early start: Robin Daykin at just three-years-old showing an early love for daring antics on three wheels as he balances on his bike as a child .","Former farmers who invested in 600cc superbike with sidecar started 'Team Past It'

A ruthless nephew had his uncle shot dead in a gangland-style hit after a petty family feud over a flat-pack garden shed. Stuart Horner, 32, had 44-year old Ian Taylor blasted by a masked hitman at virtually point blank range as the victim was sat in a car listening to music. The pair had originally been 'bosom buddies' but fell out after father of five Taylor was caught stealing a flat-pack shed and blamed Horner for tipping off the police. Just eight days before the killing in Baguley, near Wythenshawe, Manchester, Horner was overheard saying: 'I’ve got a gun, I’m going to get Ian.' 'Bosom buddies': Stuart Horner (left) had his uncle Ian Taylor (right) shot by a masked hitman . Horner and an accomplice Derek Cotterill, 26, were convicted of murder following a trial and were jailed for life yesterday at Manchester Crown Court. Horner was ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years whilst Cotterill will have to serve 23 years in prison. It is not known who pulled the trigger and the murder weapon has never been found. The jury was told that the feuding began in November 2010 after Horner had asked petty thief Taylor to 'steal a shed for him'. Taylor was later arrested, charged and convicted of theft - but blamed Horner for turning him in. The victim was said to have 'frequently harangued' Horner and in the days leading up to the murder there were a number of family rows. On June 5, Horner’s niece was christened. Taylor was not invited and after the ceremony he began swearing at members of the family- and on the same day, Horner complained of the victim 'coming at him with a knife'. Horner’s sister Melanie Horner told the court that later that day Mr Horner told her, ‘I have got a gun, I’m gonna get Ian'. Miss Horner described how she started crying and said ‘I hope you’re joking’. Murder scene: Police investigate after Ian Taylor was shot by a masked gunman . Ian Taylor's family home in Wythenshawe - he was a father-of-five . But she added: 'Stuart put his arm round the back of my neck, kissed my forehead and said, ""I’m only joking, it’s a bat"" - he had a rounders bat hanging on his bedroom wall.' Yet in a confrontation just hours before the shooting itself, Horner told his uncle 'my boys are coming back for you'. At 11.10pm that night Taylor was blasted in the chest with a shotgun at close range by a masked killer as he sat in his friend’s red Citroen listening to music and having a few drinks. He was pronounced dead in hospital shortly after midnight. Carl Cooper who had been in the car with the victim at the time of the killing but escaped unhurt said: 'I saw a figure at the passenger side. I heard an explosion. 'It took me a few seconds to dawn what had happened. Then Ian said ""I’ve been shot"". Ian slumped in his seat. I sat there for a few seconds, shocked.' Accomplice: Derek Cotterill was jailed for 23 years . Horner was arrested the next day and gave a false alibi and was released on bail. He later gave an interview to a newspaper protesting his innocence saying: “I am not connected to this shooting at all. 'I want the people who are blaming me to apologise and they need to let me grieve for my uncle. 'I am part of the investigation because me and my uncle had had an argument and we did have family issues but they are personal. This has really damaged my family and people think I am a murderer but I am not.' But police later received further intelligence that Horner and his cousin Cotterill were responsible for Taylor’s murder and rearrested him. Both men denied murder. After the case Det Supt Julian Ross of Greater Manchester said: 'Ian was sat with a friend in the car, listening to music, when at least one shot was fired into the vehicle, hitting him in the chest and killing him. 'Only Horner and Cotterill know exactly what happened that night or what possessed them to arm themselves with guns and kill a man. 'We know Ian was involved in a long-running family feud with his nephew Horner, but absolutely nothing can justify their murderous actions that night.' Det Ch Supt Darren Shenton, head of GMP’s Serious Crime Division, said: 'The murder weapon in this case is still outstanding, and we are continuing to try and locate it so it cannot be used to seriously harm or kill someone else.' A third man Nathan Frazer, 18, stood trial for murder after telling a pal: 'I smoked somebody' but the case against him was dropped after he claimed he made up the account to 'get attention'.","Stuart Horner jailed for 27 years for the murder of his uncle Ian Taylor .

"The tortoises were officially recognised as 'wild animals' 'Zoo' requires a £290 a year licence . Needs to pay thousands of pounds in modifications, upgrades, bi-annual Defra visits . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 27 July 2011 . Britain's only dedicated tortoise sanctuary has been served with a 35 day closure notice - after council officials reclassified it as a zoo. The Tortoise Garden in the rural village of Sticker, Cornwall caters for around 400 unwanted, abandoned or poorly tortoises, many of which would die without help. They are cared for by owner Joy Bloor, 68, who set up the facility in her back garden around 12 years ago. Can't afford to shell out: Joy Bloor, owner of Britain's only dedicated tortoise sanctuary, says the centre faces closure as it cannot afford the steep costs of upgrading it to a zoo . Last year she was informed the sanctuary was being classified as a zoo after the animals were officially recognised as 'wild animals', which, under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, requires a £290 a year licence. There is also a strict set of criteria to which Joy must adhere, which she says will cost thousands of pounds in modifications and upgrades, as well as shelling out for bi-annual Defra visits. She looks after 15 different species of tortoise at the family-run business, many of which are elderly pets that have outlived their owners or whose owners feel they cannot care for them properly. Joy, who runs the business entirely on . donations with Geoff Lean and son Terry, said: 'It is not the cost of . the zoo licence which is the problem. Wild animals: Health and safety officials have demanded Joy turn the sanctuary into a zoo . 'We have already had a zoo inspector in who says we need a food preparation area with two sinks in and a separate water supply. 'The costs would be ridiculous. If you are classified as a zoo you also have to have an inspection twice a year by a Defra appointed vet. 'You have to pay all their expenses and costs and that itself can cost over £1000 per time.' Former cardiography technician Joy set up the sanctuary 12 years ago after stepping in to house unwanted pets, before she started receiving more and more tortoises. Last year she was told she would need a licence to run the sanctuary and closed to the public for the winter from September to April. She claims that during this time she dealt with government-run agency Defra, who are not backing the councils ruling. But she re-opened in April and on July 22 received a letter from a health and safety officer at Cornwall Council telling her she has 35 days to obtain a zoo licence or shut down for good. Joy estimates that she has 12,000 visitors a year mostly made up of tourists visiting the area, and they allow the sanctuary to be self-sufficient. She said: 'The letter I was sent is ridiculous and it is the work of a bureaucratic pig-headed council. 'Every single tortoise here was, at some point, someone's domestic pet, and probably for a long, long time. 'So how can you reclassify them as a wild animal if they have never lived in the wild? 'We are not a zoo, and if we are forced to be classified as one we will have to close and therefore we won't receive any funding.' Joy even stepped in when Newquay Zoo wanted to get rid of their Russian tortoises to make way for more exotic breeds.  The sanctuary currently looks after some unusual species including one 107-year-old African spurred tortoise and eleven sulcata tortoises which each weigh a massive seven stone. Joy added: 'I will probably end up in prison because there is no way I'm closing the sanctuary. 'If the sanctuary is closed I won't be able to afford to feed them and then I don't know what will happen. It's too sad to think about.' A spokesman for Cornwall Council said: 'After an exhaustive process, it has been independently established that the Tortoise Garden meets the definition of a zoo. 'As the premises has reopened to the public and is operating without a zoo licence, the council has written to the proprietor to give 35 days' notice of a zoo closure notice being served. 'If the proprietor chooses not to apply for a zoo licence once the closure notice has been served she will have 28 days to appeal to magistrates court before it comes into force.'","The tortoises were officially recognised as 'wild animals'

Britain is launching a battle against EU plans to force the government to allow non-Europeans a benefit allowance. They have been angered by an EU proposal to sign a deal with Turkey without Britain’s agreement, which could mean Turkish citizens’ would gain access to the UK welfare system. Chris Grayling, the employment minister, has told British officials in Brussels to argue against the plans later this month, which encroach further on British sovereignty. Under fire: Brussels is planning to sign a deal with Turkey without Britain's consent that could extend its citizens' access to the UK social security system . He is concerned that the move will pave the way for welfare deals with . other countries outside the EU. Mr Grayling said: 'The government takes the very firm view there should be no opening up of our welfare system to people coming from abroad who do not intend to work and contribute to British society. 'Our arrangements are for Britain to decide, not Brussels. I’m not happy with the way that the EU is behaving. Europe should not be negotiating social security agreements on our behalf, that’s why we’re going through the courts to stop them,' reported The Sunday Times. Fight: Chris Grayling, the employment minister, is concerned that the move will pave the way for welfare deals with other countries outside the EU . The deal will not suddenly allow Turkish migrants to claim a pension - the UK already has a treaty with Turkey dating from 1961 which gives access to social security benefits. Instead Britain’s concern is the principle of the EU meddling – there are implications that once Brussels has gained power over who can receive benefits, it could be extended in the future. In theory, this could mean citizens of other countries could claim benefits in Britain without the government's consent. The move could lead to the Britain forking out millions more in welfare payments, curtailing attempts to cut the deficit. There are also concerns that  encourage it could benefit tourists to exploit Britain’s welfare system. But the European commission said the deal would simply mean migrant workers were not put at a financial disadvantage when moving between states. It stated that Turkish migrants will not suddenly be able to claim pension benefits, unless they have contributed by working in the country and the move was to 'simplify administrative arrangement.' 'It is highly misleading and irresponsible to suggest that the proposal fora Council Decision concerning the EU position on social security coordination with Turkey would create any new rights for non-EU workers – it would not. The proposal would simply facilitate the administration of existing rights,' said a Commission spokesperson. 'This proposed new decision creates new reciprocal rights for EU workers who have worked in Turkey,' he added. Some government officials see the move by the European Commission as sneaky - the Lisbon treaty, which became law in 2009, gave Britain the ability to agree or disagree on agreements between Brussels and non-EU countries. But the commission is trying to push through the deal a part of the treaty that is usually reserved to govern relations between member states. Turkey, which has a population of 75 million citizens, has been trying to join the EU for years. British Prime Minister David Cameron has previously backed the country's accession, and points to Turkey's growing economy as a reason. Turkey's EU negotiations have . previously been overshadowed by concerns about freedom of speech and . democracy in Turkey and treatment of religious minorities, women's and . children's rights. There are also issues about civilian control of the military and the Cyprus tensions.","Fears move could lead to pave the way for welfare deals with countries outside the EU .

'Bronk was by my side but he saw another dog by the river bank and suddenly jumped into the water,' said Dean, a pupil at Worksop's Portland School. 'The lead was still around his neck and he went under water.

The racism crisis engulfing Scotland Yard took a dramatic turn last night as an officer was exposed for abusing an Asian takeaway manager. In an appalling drunken outburst, PC Philip Juhasz, 31, told the Pakistani to ‘go back to your f****** country’. The disgraced officer faces the sack for gross misconduct after being convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence. But the case raises serious questions about the determination of police to stamp out all traces of racism among their ranks. Senior black officers in the Metropolitan police said warnings about growing prejudice have been falling on deaf ears for almost a decade. They claimed the lessons from the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence are yet to be learned, almost 13 years after the . Met was branded ‘institutionally racist’. Senior officers fear the crisis has overshadowed the massive boost created by the long-awaited conviction of his racist killers Gary Dobson and David Norris. The Met said 19 employees – 18 officers and one civilian member of staff – are under investigation for racism. The force is braced for a wave of fresh claims amid warnings that other forces are not immune from allegations of racism. The Police Service of Northern Ireland revealed yesterday that four officers have been suspended over racist and sectarian text messages. And new figures emerged that reveal police forces in England and Wales receive around 1,000 complaints of racism every year. Last night an investigation by Channel 4 News found that in the 12 years after the Macpherson Report, 120 Metropolitan police officers were found guilty of racist behaviour but just one was dismissed.

Takeaway manager Umer Nazir, 23, is the victim of one of ten cases referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) by the Met over the last week. In comments which raise serious questions about the determination of police to stamp out all traces of racism among their ranks, he said other Met officers tried to get Juhasz off the hook at the scene and three colleagues vouched for his good character in court. He suffered abuse from Juhasz while working late at the Delice de France snack kiosk at King’s Cross railway station last September. The shop manager said Juhasz, who was off-duty and drunk, demanded to be sold for half price food that was about to be thrown away. When he refused, the officer pulled out his warrant card saying: ‘Do you know who I am? I’m a police officer’, before asking where the worker was from. Mr Nazir said: ‘He said, “Oh, I’ll tell you where you’re from – you’re from Pakistan, and your ******g family are dying from lack of food over there. ‘You are wasting our food in this country, you f****** w*****r. Go back to your f****** country”.’ Crisis: Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey (left) has insisted - along with Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) - that there is no place for racism in the Met . Critical: Superintendent Leroy Logan, left, clammed the Met's attempts to combat racism after Mauro Demetrio, right, secretly recorded racist abuse on his mobile phone . Two uniformed police officers stopped . as they were passing by but let the suspect go when he showed them his . warrant card. Minutes later, officers from British Transport Police . responded to the 999 call and retrieved CCTV footage of the police . officer gesticulating aggressively.

A school psychologist working with deprived African Americans has sparked fury from civil rights groups after saying that black thugs should be ‘put down like the dogs they are’. Mark Traina, who works in suburban New Orleans, has posted dozens of racially-charged rants on Twitter. The married 55-year-old has even accused ‘black thugs’ of ‘declaring war on the American way of life’ and adds that ‘the real terrorist lives among us’. Offensive: Mark Traina's comments on Twitter, incuding one about how black thugs should be' put down' and how they are America's 'real terrorists' He ignited further fury when he said that 17-year-old Trayvon Martin’s killer George Zimmerman was ‘the real victim’ and the night watchman ‘held his ground’ against the unarmed intruder. Now, the civil rights organisation Southern Poverty Law Center has attacked the Jefferson Parish School Board for employing Traina. They also claim he has helped the board send ‘a disproportionate number of black and disabled students to alternative schools to languish for months’. Traina is partly responsible for placing pupils in special needs campuses. In another online post, Traina indicated he supported the segregationist policies of former Alabama governor George Wallace. In March he remarked on the Republican presidential primaries by writing: ‘I grew up in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana - I am a Wallace Man at Heart!’ Backing: Traina said he supports George Zimmerman, left, who shot black teen Trayvon Martin, and segregationist former Alabama governor George Wallace . Eden Heilman, a lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Times-Picayune: ‘It's particularly alarming to have someone who works for the school system in a position of authority be pro-segregation.’ The group’s action has prompted an investigation by the school board, superintendent James Meza revealed after learning about the Traina complaint. The U.S. Department of Education's office of civil rights will be also sending representatives to Jefferson Parish this week. Although Traina insists that he doesn’t represent Jefferson Parish - only himself. ‘I make that very clear in my comments’, he told the newspaper. His most incendiary tweet was written among a slew of offensive comments made on the social media site on January 14. Bad egg? Mark Traina's twitter account with his latest tweets . He wrote: ‘Young Black Thugs who won't follow the law need to be put down not incarcerated. Put down like the Dogs they are!’ Since then he has tempered some of his language – perhaps in response to criticism. He even went on to write recently: ‘Mark A Traina is an American Civil Rights Activist who unlike Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton represents all Americans.’ Traina has responded to the allegations in comment threads on NOLA.com. Referring to the Southern Poverty Law Center, he wrote: This is just another way to harass the Jefferson Parish Public School System. ‘One only needs to read the Times Picayune to see who the real trouble makers are. Sadly, it is disproportionately young black males. ‘Everyone knows that our jails throughout the United States are disproportionately filled with black people. Why would the rate be any different in an educational environment?’ He added, ‘Everything I said is fact-based, backed up by data. I don't have a prejudiced bone in my body. I'm not a racist. I'm a realist.’","Mark Traina, who works for school board in suburban New Orleans, also described black thugs as 'terrorists'

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 15 November 2011 . Tesco has been censured by advertising watchdogs over a price comparison campaign. The supermarket giant claimed to be so confident it was cheaper than Asda and other rivals, that it would refund double the difference on any basket of groceries. The scheme proved to be hugely popular with hard-pressed shoppers who found ways to take advantage of the deal. Misleading: The supermarket giants promised to refund double the difference if rivals were cheaper - but didn't make it clear they were capping it at £20 . They identified a range of products which were significantly cheaper at Asda under short-term promotions and shared the details across a raft of internet forums. In some cases, shoppers were claiming hundreds of pounds a week in refund shopping vouchers from Tesco. As a result, Tesco was forced into an embarrassing climbdown and announced in March that it would introduce a £20 cap on refunds. However, the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled it failed to make this cap clear. The ASA said: ‘We considered that the £20 limit was a significant restriction likely to affect the average consumer’s decision to shop at Tesco during the promotional period. ‘Because the restriction was not included in ads… we concluded that they were misleading.’ The details of the cap were written in to fair use smallprint of the . promotion on the Tesco website. However, the ASA said this appeared to . contradict the headline claim of the promotion and so was misleading. In the bag: Tesco were forced to restrict the offer when some customers exploited the double the difference refund promotion and got hundreds of pounds in vouchers . In a ruling published today, the watchdog has ordered that the advertisements should be banned. In its defence, Tesco said, in its view, none of the ads were misleading and the introduction of the cap did not represent a significant change. The supermarket claimed that only a small proportion of refunds were above £20 and, consequently, very few shoppers were affected. Tesco said the cap had been introduced to stop customers from ‘tactically shopping’ in order to take advantage of the offer in a way that disadvantaged other shoppers. It said the offer was intended for genuine shopping baskets but that tactical shoppers threatened its commercial viability.","Supermarket put £20 cap on refunds after shoppers pocketed hundreds of pounds in refund vouchers .

Behind bars: David Simpson could face the death penalty if convicted of murder after finding 18 mutilated bodies in the Central African Republic . The family of a British pilot imprisoned in Africa after discovering a massacre site have received hate mail from animal rights campaigners saying that they hope he is ‘raped and murdered’. David Simpson, 24, a manager for a big game hunter in the Central African Republic (CAR), has been in prison for two months after being charged with mass murder following his gruesome discovery of the mutilated bodies of 18 gold mine workers. He denies the charge and it is thought they were killed by troops of notorious warlord Joseph Kony. Murder still carries the death penalty in the impoverished country, although the last execution was in 1981. During his time in a cramped and squalid cell in the capital Bangui, anonymous letters have been sent to his family’s pheasant farm in Yorkshire, saying they hope Mr Simpson ‘rots in hell’ for his work with the game company, which offers wealthy clients the chance to shoot lions, leopard and buffalo. One of the letters, posted by his brother Paul, 22, on a Facebook page dedicated to securing his release, reads: ‘I hope he rots in hell and then gets hacked to pieces.’ The author adds: ‘I just hope not too much of my tax money is spent on consular assistance.’ Paul said: ‘One of the letters was addressed to my mother. ‘It’s shocking because why should David’s life matter less than that of an animal? ‘I do not understand where that kind of hatred comes from. The things they were saying were just awful, that they hoped David was raped and murdered whilst in prison.’ The letters, posted from Sheffield and Lancashire, are now being investigated by police. Mr Simpson’s family had initially hoped he would be freed within weeks, but despite meeting with the Foreign Office on Monday to try and negotiate terms for his release, they do not know how long it will be. His father Peter has also posted on the Facebook page that they have been told he will be released under house arrest this week, although he added: . ‘They have been saying this for a month now.’ Mr Simpson’s family say they are also becoming increasingly concerned at alleged corruption within the CAR, which has been widely condemned for its appalling human rights record. Their fears have been raised after a CAR newspaper apparently reported that a witness had seen Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv taking part in the massacre. Ugandan rebel army chief Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity including the abduction of thousands of children he has forced to be soldiers or sex slaves. His troops have already committed hundreds of atrocities. Kony is thought to be in hiding in the CAR. Framed?: Mr Simpson worked for a big game hunting company and may have been set-up. Since he has been arrested his family have received vile hate mail . He recently made international headlines after a video of his terrible crimes went viral. It was viewed more than 90 million times and endorsed by celebrities including Angelina Jolie. Mr Simpson moved to Africa two years ago for the chance of an exciting new life away from his rural village of Gillamoor, North Yorkshire. He says he was helping to clear a road with some colleagues through a dense bush in the south of his firm’s vast hunting reserve on March 23 when they found the mutilated bodies of dead workers near a hand-panning gold mine. The men had been tied together in groups of four and murdered by having boiling water poured over them, cut with machetes and beaten with sticks. Suspects: It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings . He told the Mail: ‘It was a terrible thing to see. They were murdered in such a methodical and brutal way, tied together in groups, face down and in circles with their heads together.’ His company Cawa offers clients the chance to hunt wild game animals at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, with the cost of shooting a lion being around £20,000. Since his arrest, his younger brother Paul, who lives with his parents, Peter, 54, and Vicky, 53, on their farm, has been campaigning for his brother’s release. He said: ‘It is incredible that my brother is being accused of this. It is all about money. ‘We are all very worried about. I just hope the police come to their senses and release him.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is taking this case extremely seriously and has pressed the CAR authorities for assurances that due legal process will be followed. We have asked that the matter will be concluded as swiftly as possible.’","David Simpson, 34, stumbled across the mutilated bodies of 18 gold mine workers and has been charged with mass murder .

After finding their dream home, Gary Humphris and his family were delighted when their £400,000 cash offer was accepted. They moved into the four-bedroom property – complete with sauna, swimming pool and games room – straight away, and Mr Humphris set about spending the remaining £70,000 of their savings on renovations. But after six months of bliss, the family were told they did not own the house after all – and that it was being repossessed. Distraught: Gary and Samantha Humphris with their sons Kallum and Mason. They lost their home after solicitors handling its sale fled with their money . Two solicitors handling the sale have fled after failing to pass on the Humphrises’ money as required. One man has been jailed for two and a half years in connection with the scam, while another man and a woman have been released on bail. The family are yet to recover any of their cash. Now penniless and homeless, Mr Humphris, 50, his wife Samantha, 36, and sons Kallum, 13, and Mason, ten, are staying with Mrs Humphris’s parents. Their savings were ‘the result of 34 years of hard work’, Mr Humphris said. ‘It has been taken away from us just like that.’ Mr Humphris, who runs his own property maintenance and commercial cleaning business, and his wife sold their previous home in August 2010, giving them enough money to buy a new house mortgage-free. They lived in a mobile home while . searching for the perfect family property, which they eventually found . last year in Sidcup, Kent. ‘It . was everything we could have dreamed of,’ Mr Humphris said. ‘It had . four bedrooms, a swimming pool, an annexe in the garden with a sauna and . a games room for the kids, and it backed on to fields with horses. We . never thought we would get it because it was on the market for offers . around £500,000 and we only had £400,000. Dream house: The four bedroom property in Sidcup, Kent, where the Humphris were forced to move out of . ‘But we had cash ready to buy it, and the estate agent came back and said: 'As long as you can complete within ten days, it’s yours.” We transferred the £400,000 for the house into our solicitors’ account, and on completion day they transferred the money into the account of the sellers’ solicitors. ‘That was in August last year. Where our money went from there, nobody knows.’Mr Humphris said the first sign that . something was wrong came in September, when his solicitor had difficulty . registering the title deeds with the Land Registry. ‘Eventually it came . to light that the money we had paid had disappeared and the two . partners of the solicitors’ firm had fled,’ Mr Humphris said. Repossessed: The notice plastered on the family home which has been left penniless after their savings were taken . Further investigations revealed that the couple selling the property owed £542,000 to mortgage firms, meaning the sale should never have been permitted. This had been concealed by the sellers’ solicitors. ‘Even when we found out what happened, we never thought we would have to give the house back,’ Mrs Humphris said. ‘We thought because we hadn’t done anything wrong there would be a way around it – but the more court hearings we attended, the more we realised that wasn’t going to happen. ‘I will never forget seeing the children sitting on the stairs crying while we were packing when the house was repossessed because they did not want to go.’ Mr and Mrs Humphris thought the £400,000 would be returned to them by the solicitors’ insurer – but a loophole meant it did not have to pay up if both of the firm’s partners were fraudulent. ‘Now our whole future is in the hands of the Solicitors Regulation Authority,’ Mr Humphris said. The SRA has closed down the offending solicitors’ firm, which cannot be named due to a court order. It is still investigating the company, which is thought to have left dozens of other victims out of pocket. A spokesman for the regulator said its compensation fund had received ‘a number of claims relating to the solicitors’, and asked for Mr Humphris’s ‘continued patience’.City of London Police are also investigating the firm. Last month, Mdmustazur Rahman pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to two counts of fraud by misrepresentation in relation to setting up a bank account in the name of the solicitors. The 28-year-old, from West Ham, East London, also pleaded guilty to money laundering. He was jailed for two and a half years and warned he could be deported to Pakistan. In addition, a man and a woman aged 32 and 30, both from Hackney, East London, have been released on bail.","Savings were transferred to seller's solicitors on day of completion .

Though the recession all but left the housing market on its knees, new home sales are being driven by an unlikely factor – the rise in demand for new, larger housing. These houses - dubbed McMansions - are being built in order to appeal to homeowners who might be hesitant to buy a new home in feeble economic times. Often over 3,000-square-feet, these homes also feature high ceilings, more space, and an overall luxury, but at the same price of other homes on the market. From the ground up: New construction of homes in jumped in April, in part due to McMansions being built . Upward mobility? Americans also bought more previously owned homes in April, a hopeful sign that the weak housing market is gradually improving . Numbers released Wednesday shows rising sales and prices provided evidence that a housing market recovery was gaining some traction. The housing sector has been the Achilles' heel of the economy ever since the home-price bubble burst. Data this week, however, has painted a relatively upbeat picture for the market and underscored the economy's resilience. 'The recent buoyancy in housing market activity has raised hopes that this beleaguered sector may finally be on the verge of a rebound,' said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York. New home sales increased 3.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 343,000-unit annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Compared with April last year, sales were up 9.9 per cent. The report came on the heels of news on Tuesday that home resales hit a two-year high, with the sector getting support from investors who are increasingly seeing value. Even more encouraging, the median price for both new and previously owned homes surged last month, a further sign of life for a market that has struggled to come back from its 2006 collapse. Promising: New home sales increased 3.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 343,000-unit annual rate . The median price of a new home rose to $235,700 last month, up 4.9 per cent from a year ago. While the data does not indicate the size of new homes built or sold, SmartMoney points out that the average square footage of any given home size has gone up – not down – in the recession, in part because developers are trying to attract potential buyers. Despite the rise in sales, the market continues to be hamstrung by an oversupply of previously owned homes - especially from foreclosures, many of which sell well below their market value. McMansions are large luxury houses that are found within subdivisions, often in suburbs. What they offer in space they lack in personality and architectural style, as many are made to blend into the ‘theme’ of the subdivision. A typical McMansion boasts more than 3,000 square feet, though construction work is often shoddy or cheap. Because the mansions are so large, developers cut corners with other things like insulation or distinguishing details. They originated in California around the 1980s as a bridge between more modest suburban homes and luxurious estates. Many homeowners chose to get rid of their large homes during the recession because they are expensive to heat and cool. New home sales account for about 7.6 per cent of the overall housing market and face stiff competition from previously owned homes, even though builders are carefully managing inventory. 'As sales pick up, we should start seeing better levels of starts and that would mean more construction jobs,' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 'Nevertheless, with the all-clear sign on foreclosures now out, the pressure on the newly built portion of the market will remain high for a long time.' While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.4 per cent to 146,000 units last month, it remained near record lows. At April's sales pace it would take 5.1 months to clear the houses from the market, down from 5.2 months in March. New home sales last month were buoyed by a 28.2 per cent jump in the Midwest. Sales in the Northeast rose 7.7 per cent, to the highest level in over a year, while in the West sales soared 27.5 per cent. Sales were down 10.6 per cent in the South. A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy houses fell for a second straight week last week, even though mortgage rates dropped to a record low. Signs of recovery in the housing market have spurred interest from some big-name investors. Oliver Chang, the head of U.S. housing strategy at Morgan Stanley, announced this week that he was departing to start a buy-to-rent housing fund. The appetite for private label residential mortgage-backed securities has strengthened among investors rattled by broader market volatility.","New home sales up 3.3 per cent in April, up 9.9 per cent from last year .

Alexander and Thomas Hunter from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, were just 16-years-old when they devised the 'elaborate' online scam from their bedroom in their parents' home which fooled around 75,000 people, U.S. officials have claimed. The brothers allegedly invented a fictitious 'stock picking robot' in 2007 and claimed on a series of websites that the highly sophisticated computer programme could identify stocks that were about the rocket in price. Court action: Alexander (left) and Thomas Hunter (right) are accused of setting up the company from their bedroom in their parents' home in Whitley Bay .
