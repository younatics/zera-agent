"London (CNN) -- Police in northern England were called to investigate this week after children who were out trick-or-treating for Halloween were given small snap-top bags of what turned out to be cocaine. The bags, containing white powder, were given to police after they were handed to the children Wednesday evening in the small town of Royton, Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. Testing confirmed that they contained cocaine, and a man was arrested. Donald Junior Green, 23, has been charged with drug possession and is due before a magistrates' court in Oldham, near Manchester, on Friday. A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of drug possession and was later released without charge, police said. Police Superintendent Catherine Hankinson said: ""The parents and police acted quickly when this report was made, in the interests of public safety. ""We understand this to be an isolated incident.""","Police were alerted after children were given small bags of white powder .

"(CNN) -- A botched gun probe that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexico's drug cartels is likely to be a lingering but not fatal controversy for the Obama administration, observers said Wednesday. Republicans in Congress have been publicly pounding Justice Department officials since June, when whistleblowers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified to a House committee about the ill-fated ""Operation Fast and Furious."" The operation, launched in 2009, was aimed at cutting off the flow of guns to Mexico's drug cartels through straw buyers, but it allowed about 2,000 weapons to reach the hands of the cartels. In December 2010, two weapons sold under the Fast and Furious program were found at the scene of the killing of a Border Patrol agent in the Arizona desert. ATF agents kept their Mexican counterparts in the dark about the probe even as rising numbers of guns crossed the border, and about 1,400 firearms remain unaccounted for, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reported in July. Congressional committees and the Justice Department's independent inspector-general are now looking into what happened, with Republicans accusing Attorney General Eric Holder of trying to stiff-arm investigators. But as embarrassing as ""Fast and Furious"" may be, it's not in the same league as administration-threatening scandals like Watergate or the Harding administration's Teapot Dome, University of Virginia analyst Larry Sabato said. ""The only scandals that matter in a presidential year are the ones that directly connect to a president,"" Sabato said. He added, ""Everybody admits it was a dumb idea,"" but similar programs were launched during the Bush administration. Nor does the controversy about ""Fast and Furious"" appear to be a mortal threat to anyone's job at this point, said Peter Toren, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official. ""It's certainly a black eye for the Justice Department,"" which oversees the ATF, Toren said. But he added, ""This is more of a botched operation rather than a scandal."" The flap has so far resulted in the ouster of acting ATF chief Kenneth Melson and the resignation of the U.S. attorney for Arizona, Dennis Burke, in August. President Barack Obama told ABC News in October, ""People who screwed up will be held accountable."" And Holder is likely to face tough questions about the matter next Tuesday, when he is slated to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee's ranking Republican, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, is a leading critic of the probe. Republicans have recently questioned whether Holder misled Congress about when he learned about the program. Holder told the House Judiciary Committee in May that he had known about the Fast and Furious program for just a few weeks; Republicans say recently released Justice Department documents show the attorney general actually knew about the program in July 2010, but a memo to Holder that referenced the operation does not appear to contain any of the controversial tactics it employed. Toren said Republicans are ""understandably"" trying to lay the blame for the fiasco on Holder. But Holder doesn't appear to have had ""intimate knowledge"" of the ATF program. ""There have been some suggestions that at least he knew something about it. He might have known the name, he might have been briefed that there was an operation,"" Toren said. ""I haven't seen anything that suggests that he should be held responsible for the program."" Holder slapped back in an October letter reaffirming his testimony and calling GOP allegations about the program ""irresponsible and inflammatory."" And he appears to have caught a break this week, when a top deputy told senators he failed to warn Holder and other Justice officials about the tactics used in ""Fast and Furious"" after a previous operation. Lanny Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, told a Judiciary subcommittee he first learned of the tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to leave gun shops in April 2010, regarding a previous operation known as ""Wide Receiver."" ""I wish that at that time that I had said clearly to the deputy attorney general and the attorney general that in this case, 'Wide Receiver,' we had determined in 2006 and 2007 guns had 'walked.' I did not do that, and I regret not doing that,"" Breuer admitted. Sabato said Breuer ""is taking one for the team"" by admitting the mistake. His testimony may not satisfy Republicans, but, ""There isn't a smoking gun here for somebody as high as Holder,"" Sabato said. Nevertheless, Toren said, it's likely that the questions are going to keep coming as the investigations continue. ""I think it would be best to get out in front of it, say what really happened and let the chips fall where they may,"" he said.","""Operation Fast and Furious"" let hundreds of guns reach Mexico, investigators say .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's plan to train and arm Syrian rebels in their battle against ISIS fighters faces deep skepticism from a large number of Democratic senators who will vote Thursday whether to approve the escalation of U.S. involvement in the deadly conflict. While Senate leaders are confident the measure will pass, misgivings raised by so many senators from the President's party speak to the difficulty the administration is having gaining traction for its ISIS policy. It also suggests an upcoming debate in November over whether to OK broader military action against ISIS could be contentious. House approves plan to assist Syrian rebels . Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party). In a floor speech Wednesday, Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, cited reports that some of the moderate Syrian rebels the United States wants to arm had sold the American journalist Steven Sotloff to ISIS, which murdered him. ""Are those people our allies?"" he asked. ""I strongly believe that if our military arms and trains Syrian rebels, we will be involving ourselves in a ground conflict we cannot resolve, where potentially everyone involved is our enemy,"" Manchin said. ""There are a lot of people struggling with this vote right now,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. ""I really have no idea what the ultimate vote will be."" Murphy, a freshman Democrat, is a leading critic of arming the rebels. He fears the weapons one day will be turned on Americans. ""I think it's very hard to sort out the moderate rebels from the extremists and I have a real worry that once we send these rebels back into the battle space there is very little we can do to prevent them from locking arms with al Qaeda or elements of ISIS,"" Murphy explained. Sen. Mark Begich, an endangered Democratic running in a tight re-election in Alaska, said he is unhappy the serious question about the Syrian rebels will be tucked inside a large government funding bill -- known as a continuing resolution, or CR -- and is not likely to face a up or down vote by itself. ""They shouldn't wedge this issue into the CR. This is an important issue to determine our role in the Mideast. For them to just throw it into the budget bill is a disservice to the American people,"" Begich said as he left a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday. Begich, like Murphy, said he supports other aspects of the President's policy to defeat ISIS -- including airstrikes -- but is concerned the weapons the United States provides the Syrians will ""end up in someone else's hands that are not our friends."" Other Democrats in tough re-election campaigns have struggled to make up their minds. ""I support the intent but I want to see the (legislative) language,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said. Asked which way he would vote, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado told CNN he was undecided and ""looking at the language right now"" as he hustled to the Senate floor for a vote. Minutes later as he left the Capitol, he told CNN he intends ""to vote for the President's plan to arm the rebels."" Even Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, couldn't say whether he would vote yes. ""There are some aspects of it I think need clarity,"" he said as he rode a subway car to a Senate office building to listen to Secretary of State John Kerry testify on ISIS before the Foreign Relations Committee. ""I want to wait and see. I think it's only fair to the people I represent and the President."" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a member of the Armed Services Committee, pushed back on critics of the President's plan. She said the U.S. intelligence community will play an important role in vetting the rebels and that training could take up to a year before arms are provided. ""All of those people criticizing this choice, I have yet to hear their better idea,"" she said. Despite the lukewarm reception the President's plan has gotten from many Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, predicted it will pass. ""I think on the ISIS bill, while everyone is worried and has concerns, the President's proposal has broad support and I think you'll probably find a majority of Republicans and majority of Democrats voting for it, which in this place at this time is a rare thing,"" he said.","House votes to approve arming and training Syrian rebels .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS inside Syria and is awaiting President Barack Obama's authorization to do so, U.S. military officials tell CNN. For weeks, intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of targets. It's expected the list will be presented to the President one more time, with some analysis of the risks of bombing inside Syria, as well as possible rewards in terms of destroying and degrading ISIS, according to the officials. It is most likely that the target list will be broadly described to the President, with some analysis about what would be accomplished. Presidents generally do not review each and every target before a strike. The broad guidance is given and then the military selects the time, date, place -- after the President makes the political decision to proceed. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday that he and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey signed off on plans to strike ISIS in Syria. He said Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of the U.S. Central Command, briefed Obama on Wednesday on the plan for striking ISIS in Syria. ""CENTCOM's plan includes targeted actions against ISIL safe havens in Syria -- including its command and control, logistics capabilities, and infrastructure,"" Hagel said. ""Our actions will not be restrained by a border that exists in name only."" Obama is ""actively"" reviewing options and has ""offered guidance"" to the Department of Defense about the target sets that he's reviewed, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said last week. But Earnest said that Obama is not signing off on each strike. ""These are very difficult operational decisions that will have to be made on a case-by-case basis. Many of them don't rise to a presidential level, to the level of the commander in chief,"" Earnest said. House approves plan to assist Syrian rebels . In the ""old days,"" there were literally target ""folders."" The military would thumb through a sheaf of classified papers detailing the target, and what aircraft and bombs would be used to strike it. Nowadays, it's all computerized, of course. The goal, if not the process, is largely the same. The United States has been flying drones over Syria, looking at areas where ISIS operates. The drones are looking for personnel, equipment depots, training camps, and the locations of the group's leaders. U.S. officials tell CNN if top leadership can be located, they will be on the target list to strike. If past strike procedures against terrorist leaders in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia are used again, the President would preauthorize strikes against the leaders, by name, and then they would be hit when located. The anatomy of ISIS: How the 'Islamic State' is run, from oil to beheadings . Intelligence is also collected by intercepting cell phone calls and monitoring social media sites that ISIS frequents. All of this is being repeatedly collected over a period of days because the Washington also wants to see any patterns of movement. Many of the targets are mobile, so they have to track them repeatedly. Intelligence also has to be collected on any regime forces, or air defenses in the area where the U.S. will fly. One important challenge: figuring out where civilians are located. Intelligence indicates ISIS has been moving into towns, hoping to blend in and keep safe from potential U.S. airstrikes. Iranian leader rips ISIS, questions U.S. willingness to 'sacrifice' in terror fight . All of this data is assembled for each target. Then the U.S. Central Command determines which type of aircraft and which type of bomb is best to strike the target. Strikes are expected to use precision-guided weapons in order to minimize collateral damage, especially in towns and villages. Those type of weapons can even be used to hit a precise part of a building rather than destroy an entire structure. Each target on the list will include an assessment of the risk of flying into that area of Syria and hitting it, but also an assessment of how the destruction could impact ISIS. The Pentagon is looking for targets to make a significant impact on ISIS, not just destroy small groups of personnel or weapons, military officials tell CNN. Kerry says Syrian President is using chlorine weapons .","Military officials are prepared to strike, waiting on President Obama's go-ahead .

"Beijing (CNN) -- At first glance, it seems like a lot of roadside construction is taking place in this residential neighborhood west of Beijing's Tsinghua University. But a closer look reveals out-of-place pipes, mysterious pools of water and long hoses that run along the walls of nearby homes. The ""construction workers"" aren't paid laborers either -- they're local residents who have simply walked out of their homes and started hacking into the road. Why? For water. They lift tiles off the pavements and dig until they hit ground water. ""Who would dig up wells if there's enough water? There's just no water,"" said one resident who would only give his surname, Yin. His family had been suffering from water shortages on and off for months until they decided to take matters into their own hands. Growing demand . The Shuimo Community in Haidian district has grown rapidly and authorities have been unable to cope with the growing demand for water. ""We started receiving complaints from residents about water shortages since the end of July,"" said Liu Zhongmin, head of the Water Resources Office in the Department of Water Affairs of Haidian District. ""We're aware of local residents digging wells to get water. These are illegal constructions and should be demolished."" But any plans to fix the water supply problem have been delayed. ""We don't plan to do anything at this point as it'll spark tensions between us and residents,"" said Liu. He explained that any work on the pipelines in the neighborhood would not be straightforward. The community has grown from 1,000 residents to more than 8,000 in recent years, and new residents have occupied roads where pipelines are buried under their houses, according to Liu. For the near future, residents see only one way out of the situation. ""Everybody knows we're not allowed to dig wells here but what else can we do? Who can solve the problem?"" asks Yin. He adds that a well costs as much as RMB 40,000 (about $6,500) to complete. Freshwater supplies in China have been increasingly strained in recent years. A growing population, industrial development and widespread pollution pushes the lack of freshwater to crisis levels, according to China Water Risk.

"(CNN) -- I was walking to my study on the campus recently when I came across the annual ritual: Rows of cars were being unloaded by parents bringing their kids to college. There was a whole beehive of young people, with special T-shirts marked ""staff,"" who helped the parents carry the computers, boxes, and other gear. A generation ago, I had to schlep that stuff myself (with the assistance of my bewildered freshman son). By the time I walked back home in the late afternoon, about half a dozen parents were lingering, chatting with each other, obviously reluctant to leave. They must have skipped the ""letting go"" event that my university, like many colleges, organizes to make the parting easier -- as one college dean put it, ""to take the gas out of the helicopters."" A couple asked me if I was a college professor. They wanted to know if my colleagues and I would notify them if their kid were to get into trouble. They assured me that they had no special concerns about their daughter. However, she had just turned 18, she had never been away from home for any long period of time, and she sometimes can be swept away by peer pressure, they allowed. The father also wondered whether the parents of other students would be notified if their children showed signs of mental distress, referring to this summer's shooting by a student at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, and to the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. I reassured the couple that if I saw a student in trouble I would help, but explained that notifying parents is a surprisingly complicated matter. Help on the campus is readily available. My university, like most others, has elaborate psychological counseling services, medical clinics, and, of course, a police department. Beyond that, it has a ""care network,"" whose staff members ""connect the dots"" of information about students from a variety of sources -- including concerned fellow students, staff, and faculty -- and when need be, reach out to troubled students. But calling the parents of a student -- like so much in our lives -- runs into laws, regulations, and, yes, lawsuits. In 1974, Congress passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act . It was enacted to protect students' records by requiring colleges to get written permission from students to share information about them with others, parents included. Most colleges understood the law as posing a blanket ban on notifying parents, although lawyers found some loopholes; they argued that maybe a professor could share ""personal observations."" The Higher Education Amendment, passed by Congress in 1998, allowed colleges to share information about students under the age of 21 with their parents in certain cases, including the violation of policies regarding drugs and alcohol. Following this amendment, many colleges started to notify parents, a change in policy that according to some research had beneficial effects. For instance, one study found that more than half (52%) of the colleges that increased parental notification saw a decrease in alcohol violations. (Critics argue that the main effect of such changes was to make the students more discreet when they abused alcohol.) The law (by some interpretations at least) limits the disclosure of information to parents who pay the bill for college. My university, for instance, will provide some information to a parent who submits a tax return in which they list the student as a dependent, a return that has to be resubmitted each year. The sociologist in me holds that family bonds do not suddenly end when a youngster goes to college, that the transition from being a kid at home to an adult on one's own should be a gradual one, and that students need their families' support. Colleges should nurture these bonds -- and benefit from them in promoting good conduct -- whether or not Mom and Pop pay. As one student told me: ""The legal firewall between universities and parents is unnecessarily strict. College life is a period of growth, and the university system does not always provide adequate guidance toward that end. Parents conintue to play a major role and should be encouraged, not dissuaded from doing so. Those students hoping to keep their affairs secret will just have to learn better discretion, which is in itself an important life skill for those hoping to hold on to their privacy in the modern world."" At the same time, I realize that some families are dysfunctional, and some students may have reasons to fear that the parents will yank them out of school (or at least stop paying) if they get less than an A average. Others may load students with so much guilt, or such heavy demands to respect the family legacy, that a student may yield to family pressures and major in law instead of, say, in music. Hence, it seems that a good way to sustain family bonds while protecting students from undue pressure is to allow the students, as my university does, to indicate from Day One which family members should be contacted. These may be grandparents, older siblings, or a stepmother or father. Families may have to hover less, but that doesn't mean students ought to be out of sight. The family's continued involvement is a major resource in helping students mature, even if they are no longer minors, as long as colleges also provide ways of protecting students from excessively intrusive parents. This is why the form that allows students to change their designated family contact is so useful. An assistant dean who is called in the middle of the night because a parent is concerned about Junior's grades, or a parent who loads a student's e-mail with endless suggestions, should be free to work out with the student a change in the approved family contact form. Colleges need to nurture family bonds but cut the hovering. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Federal laws limit colleges' ability to inform parents how their children are doing .

Etzioni says policies vary, but it makes sense to keep parents informed about their kids .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama once again finds himself in the middle of a high-stakes, tension-fraught meeting with a key leader from the Middle East. Must be Monday. Just days after a historic phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the U.S. president met with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House late Monday morning. The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been one of the more strained in the history of the two nations. Obama has come under criticism from some Israelis for what they perceive as a lack of enthusiasm toward pro-Israeli policies and interests. In March, Obama made his first visit to Israel as president, a charm offensive to reassure Israelis that the United States is committed to its security. On Monday, Obama said he has a ""good working relationship"" with Netanyahu, and he didn't mince words when talking about U.S. support of Israel. ""Our unshakeable bond with the Israel people is stronger than ever,"" he said. ""Our commitment to Israel's security is stronger than ever."" But beyond the handshakes and smiles the two leaders shared while talking to reporters about their meeting, this week will be a test of how they can work together. Poll: Most in U.S. favor negotiations with Iran over nukes . Both leaders said the new diplomatic overtures between the United States and Iran were a key topic for them on Monday. As he boarded his flight to the United States for his meeting with Obama and his appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu threw cold water on the developments. ""I will tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk and the onslaught of smiles,"" he said. ""One must talk facts, and one must tell the truth."" After his meeting with Obama, Netanyahu seemed to strike a more accepting tone while stressing that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is ""the most important challenge"" that both nations face. ""I appreciate deeply the fact that you have made clear that you remain committed to this goal. I also appreciate the statement you made that Iran's conciliatory words have to be met by real actions -- transparent, verifiable, meaningful actions,"" he said. ""Iran is committed to Israel's destruction, so for Israel, the ultimate test of a future agreement with Iran is whether or not Iran dismantles its military nuclear program. ... That's the bottom line."" Netanyahu said sanctions against Iran should continue and even strengthen if Iran continues to advance its nuclear program during negotiations. ""If diplomacy is to work, those pressures should be kept in place. And I think they should not be lessened until there's verifiable success,"" he said. Obama said that if Iran wants sanctions relief, it will have to meet ""the highest standards of verifications."" ""It is absolutely clear that words are not sufficient,"" Obama said. ""We have to have actions that give the international community confidence that, in fact, they are meeting their international obligations fully and that they are not in a position to have a nuclear weapon."" In the latest indication of Tehran's new approach to relations with Washington, Iran's Fars News Agency reported that Rouhani wants to establish direct flights between Iran and the United States. The news agency cited the head of the High Council of Iranian Affairs Abroad, Akbar Torkan, as saying that Rouhani had instructed him to look into how to establish direct flights between the two countries. Over the weekend, Israel said it arrested an Iranian-born man and accused him of spying for Tehran. According to the Israeli government, the alleged spy was carrying photos of various sites, including the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. Obama focuses foreign policy on Iran and Middle East peace talks .

"Al Ram, West Bank (CNN) -- The Faisal al Husseini football stadium was packed, two hours before kick off, with a noisy sea of Palestinian flags and white hijabs.   Football matches are always a big deal in the West Bank, but this game was more significant than most. 10,000 women had flocked to the stadium, on the outskirts of East Jerusalem and a mere few meters from the separation barrier that snakes around the West Bank, to watch a historic football match few would have believed possible just a few years ago: the Palestinian women's national team were to play Jordan in their first ever home international. Both teams gave laps of honor before the start of the game to mark an occasion that is rare in the Middle East. Football is hugely popular amongst women in the region but the development of the game has largely been held back by a social conservatism that disapproves of women playing what are deemed 'men's' sports. In Kuwait, attempts to set up a women's national team was met with outrage in the country's parliament. The move was halted after Waleed al Tabtabae, a hard line Islamist MP who chairs a committee charged with weeding out 'phenomena strange to society' decided that a women's football team was 'un-Islamic'. ""Committee members expressed their indignation...and total rejection of the idea of the women's football team on the grounds that football is not suitable for women,"" Tabtabae told the Kuwait Times. The UAE has only this year launched its own national team. A handful of teams exist in Saudi Arabia, although they are confined to the more liberal university campuses and have to be played in front of small, women-only crowds. In Iran women are banned from attending football matches and have to wear the hijab when they play, even in tournaments abroad. The Palestinian team has had its own, unique problems to deal with. Set up in 2003 at Bethlehem University, Israeli movement restrictions meant it was impossible to practice on the West Bank's sole grass pitch in Jericho. Instead, they had to train on a concrete handball court and play against local boy's teams. The only way the national team could play was to travel to nearby Jordan, but that created its own problems as it was difficult for players from Gaza to get permission to leave. Since the 2007 Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip, it became even harder for women to take part. But the hardest part was convincing the families, both Christian and Muslim, in conservative strongholds like Nablus and Jenin to allow their daughters to play football. ""At first it seemed weird, women playing football in our society because it has a male mentality,"" said Honey Thaljieh, the team's 25-year-old captain when I interviewed her in 2007. ""Some families had problems sending their daughters to play football, some still face problems."" Yet two years on they have a Futsal league (an indoor version of the game), a national stadium to play in and a string of international tournaments to attend. The team even attempted to qualify for the 2011 World Cup, but narrowly missed out on reaching the second round. ""We go to the villages now and tell them [the parents] that it is not forbidden to play. Most of the team is now Muslim,"" explained Rouqaya Takrouri, the 45-year-old national team manager, who hoped the Jordan match would spur a new recruitment drive, inspiring some of the thousands of female spectators to believe they could play football too. ""We are talking to every woman now. We send out letters that say: 'Now is your time.' Last year we had six clubs, now we have 14."" For Thaljieh the match was particularly poignant. Since captaining the team she has fought for recognition within her own community, dedicating her life to the women's game by vowing not to get married or start a family until she retires, a controversial move in Palestinian society. As the game has grown, Thaljieh has become something of a symbol for women's rights in the region and has been feted by everyone from Cristiano Ronaldo to FIFA president Sepp Blatter who presented Thaljieh with FIFA's inaugural development award at the FIFA World Player Gala earlier this year. Standing pitch side, she couldn't hide her smile when asked just how far she thought the game had come in two years.   ""It is still difficult sometimes,"" she admitted. ""But this has broken all the rules for women here. This was a big event to get both women and men together in Palestinian society. In a way, today was like a marriage between the Palestinians."" To put the match in context, as many as 16,000 people crammed in to watch Palestine and Jordan play. When the US women's team last played at home, a 1-0 victory over Canada in New York last July, just 8,433 fans turned up. But not everyone in attendance was there for football. Outside several thousand men who couldn't get in clambered on to surrounding rooftops, others scrambled up nearby wire fences, whilst some even crowded on top of a parked bus. Although a different type of union was on their minds. ""All these men are here to see the women and I'm here to see the chicks too,"" admitted Abdullah Alawad, a 20 year old architecture student. ""Maybe the girls are here to see the guys too,"" he added rather hopefully. The game itself was a surprisingly tetchy affair, with two players stretchered off after being on the receiving end of several crunching tackles, much to the anger of the Jordanian team's (male) coach. His mood wasn't helped when Palestine won two dubious penalties.   A late Jordanian equalizer secured the 2-2 draw they deserved. But for the women watching, the result was less important than the game itself. After the final whistle both sets of players hugged and embarked on another lap of honor in front of an ecstatic crowd. ""We want to prove that we are better than the men at football,"" explained Asala el Wazeer, an 18 year old student who stood with her friends in the crowd. ""It has taken us years to get to this point. We are very proud of the [Palestinian] team."" In a way, she was right. Palestine had played Jordan in the first ever men's international exactly one year previously. They only managed to score once. But for Thaljieh, held aloft on the shoulders of her team mates in front of a crowd that included the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad, the match sent a powerful message to the outside world. ""This is important and shows the world that we don't care about the barriers and the checkpoints,"" Thaljieh shouted over the noise. ""We have shown the world that we can fight, but that when we fight, we fight through peaceful play.""","Palestinian women's national football team play Jordan in historic first home match.

"London, England (CNN) -- He is behind some of the most infectious advertising campaigns of recent years, creating online sensations and forging communities of followers. Australian David Droga is the maverick adman who became an executive creative director -- the chief creative thinker at an agency -- at just 22. He now runs his own New-York-based advertising agency Droga5, following stints as executive creative director of Saatchi & Saatchi, London, and worldwide chief creative officer of Publicis. You may not recognize the man regularly called the ""guru"" of the ad world, but you will probably know his work. Some of Droga5's best-known campaigns include ""The Great Schlep,"" for which U.S. comedian Sarah Silverman made a viral plea encouraging people to visit their Jewish relatives in Florida and convince them to vote for Barack Obama. Droga5 also masterminded the spoof video of graffiti artist and entrepreneur Marc Ecko apparently breaking into an Air Force One base in 2006 and spray-painting the words ""Still Free"" onto an airplane. The video became an online smash and got so much media attention that the Pentagon issued three statements denying that the footage was real. On the back of it, Droga5 won the top digital media award at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival -- the ad world's Oscars -- in the same year. Indeed, Droga is the single most awarded creative at Cannes, with over 50 Lions under his belt and since forming Droga5 in 2006, has acquired clients Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The youthful Droga, who co-presents this month's edition of CNN's arts and culture program ""icon,"" is not resting on his laurels, though. He told CNN, ""Perhaps one of the greatest and biggest changes in the advertising industry has been the way brands sell themselves and the mediums in which they do that. ""It's as much about the communication,"" he continued, ""But also now it is the body language of a brand ... how it actually operates and exists in the real world."" Some of Droga5's clients include Method, the environmentally friendly cleaning products company, and sportswear brand PUMA, a company that prides itself on its ethical and ecological record. Droga believes that a respectable brand can wield considerable power. ""Advertising now takes on a far greater role of social responsibility and contributing to society,"" he explained. ""It seems like not a lot of the world's issues can be solved by big government,"" he said, ""But they can be solved by brands, and brands putting their best foot forward need advertising."" Droga5's prowess extends to successfully marketing charitable projects. Its campaigns include the UNICEF ""Tap Project,"" which asked restaurant-goers across New York and beyond to donate a dollar for the tap water they received for free, and the ""Million"" project for the New York City Department of Education, which awarded mobile phones and minutes to schoolchildren based on classroom performance. ""I set up Droga5 because I really believe in the power of advertising,"" Droga said, ""But I believe in the power of advertising that's in synch with what consumers want."" ""I believe in creating ideas that consumers actually want to engage in, creating movements with our thinking and not bombarding them into submission,"" he continued. That's why he thinks behaving responsibly is the best way forward. ""There is good business doing good,"" he said.","Advertising guru and founder of agency Droga5 is a giant of the business .

"(CNN) -- Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin is one of the privileged few to have walked on the moon, but he hopes space tourism will be much more of an equal-opportunity experience. More than 40 years after the historic moon landing, Aldrin is now consulting for the U.S. government about the future of the country's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday people. NASA has driven space exploration for decades, but with the rise of Virgin Galactic, Space X and other companies that focus on suborbital flights, the private sphere and government programs are appearing to intersect in the realm space travel. ""Private wants a return on investment, a profit. I think there's some profits to be made by going to the moon,"" Aldrin says. Read more: Is $250,000 a bargain for a seat into space? The bigger question may be how passengers are to be chosen. When this question was discussed 25 years ago, Aldrin says, an obvious answer was to offer the flights to the highest bidders. ""But somebody in the back of the room said, 'How about a lottery?' Man, my ears perked up at that, and I became a devotee of a lottery to select people,"" he says. A lottery system would produce the kind of return on investment Aldrin wanted to see. ""I wasn't interested in a big payoff or the profit made. I was interested in exposing space to a large number of people,"" he says. Read more: Your own private Airbus A319 jet . Nowadays, Aldrin spends most of his time on the road, with a schedule packed with scuba diving trips, international meetings on space, visiting members of Congress and developing his nonprofit organization, which aims to build interest in space and advocate for affordable space travel. Even for the man who has logged more than 280 hours in space and has literally seen the world, the inconvenience of earthly travel can still get to him -- most of all, the airport security checks. It is perhaps fitting that Aldrin continues to explore, and not on land either, instead voyaging underwater with scuba gear. He counts Micronesia as one of his favorite places and has visited multiple times. Read more: What does being weightless really feel like? ""I visited Pohnpei. I dove on Japanese war ships. And we recently dove in a further island, Palau. That was really good."" But the final frontier is still out there. Although Aldrin's mission for years has been for civilians to travel to the moon, his broader dream for space travel is for humans to land on Mars someday. ""I'm not trivializing Star Trek, because my hopes for the future is based on USS Enterprise, to boldly go where man's not been before,"" he says.","Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin wants to see space travel more accessible to the masses .

"(CNN) -- Feasting on turkey aside, brace yourself for that other Thanksgiving ritual: joining a nationwide mad dash to make it to a family gathering and back in a journey that can exasperate even the most seasoned traveler. If you're flying for the holiday, expect lots of company and few airfare deals. ""The airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and (they're) using smaller planes,"" said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com. ""So there are going to be fewer seats."" It's also a bit trickier to book flights for Thanksgiving than Christmas because so many travelers want to fly in such a small window of time: four days versus two weeks for many people who save vacation time for the big holiday in December. The sputtering economy isn't keeping Americans from making the annual trek for Thanksgiving, said Melissa Klurman, contributing editor for Travelocity. Those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $376 on average for a domestic ticket, or about 4% more than at the same time last year, according to Travelocity. Here are five tips to make your journey a smoother one. 1. Book your tickets now . Last-minute sales aren't likely for one of the most popular times of the year to fly and seat maps are filling up quickly. ""Don't delay: Prices are not going to go down between now and Thanksgiving,"" Klurman said. ""Not only do you have a better chance of getting lower airfare, but also (better) seats. You can book your seat when you book your airfare. So if you don't want to be in the middle of the last row -- the early bird gets the window seat in that case."" If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said. 2. Look into alternate airports . Sometimes, it pays to look into flying in and out of airports that may be less convenient than your closest option. So you may find a cheaper flight out of Allentown, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia, for example, Hobica said. Be especially flexible if you're in a major city like New York, where there are several airports in the area, Klurman said. Travelocity allows fliers to search alternate airports when they're pricing itineraries. 3. Consider flying on Thanksgiving Day . Travelers who choose to fly out on the Monday before Thanksgiving and fly back on the Sunday after will pay on average $213 more than travelers who fly on Thanksgiving Day and come back the next day, Travelocity calculated. Flying on the holiday also means much less crowded airports and planes. ""Have your turkey and then come back on Friday,"" Hobica advised. Lest you think it's impossible to do, Hobica assured that plenty of travelers have successfully gone this route, ""especially if they don't like their family or if they're sleeping on the sofa and the sleeping arrangements aren't comfortable,"" he said with tongue in cheek. In general, avoid a Sunday return, Travelocity advised. If you are flying on Thanksgiving Day, try to take the first flight out to make sure you make it to dinner. 4. Give yourself plenty of time . Connecting flights are often cheaper, but with the possibility of winter weather causing delays or cancellations over Thanksgiving, you risk a missed connection, Hobica said. He suggests travelers fly nonstop whenever possible, but if you do choose a multistop itinerary, allow lots of time to catch your next flight. If you miss a connection, Travelocity warns that with planes booked solid, it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight. 5. Consider paying some extra fees to make the trip more comfortable . Hobica frequently flies JetBlue and he always pays a fee for seats with extra legroom, an option that comes with access to expedited security lanes and early boarding. The choices vary by airlines, but several, including American and United, let you board early for a fee, thus helping you avoid the epic struggle for overhead bin space. It may be worth paying this extra charge during peak travel times, like Thanksgiving, to make the journey saner, Hobica said. Another, more expensive option is to splurge for an airport lounge day pass, which can cost $30-$50. ""If you only fly once a year, sometimes the day passes are worthwhile, especially if your flight is delayed,"" Hobica said. ""They have free drinks in most of the lounges, snacks and shorter lines if you have to rebook your flight. ... It just makes the whole experience a bit more pleasant when you treat yourself well and get the perks.""","Book your Thanksgiving flights as soon as possible for best fares and seats .

"(CNN) -- The most startling thing about the music video for British band Duologue's song Memex isn't the ghostly way the slow-panning camera turns human skin into a landscape. It's not how the model, actor Beryl Nesbitt, manages not to blink. And it's not how at 3:30 in, with just a change in the lighting, the tone of the video abruptly gets dark and sinister. Rather, the most startling thing about the Memex video is that none of those hyper-realistic shots are photos. It's a virtual 3-D scan of a human body, in this case, British actor Beryl Nesbitt. The knowledge that it's virtual reality makes watching the video a little like seeing a Chuck Close for the first time: Your eyes initially registered a black-and-white photograph of monolithic scale, and it takes a few beats before you can believe that it's a painting. London-based creative studio Marshmallow Laser Feast—great name!—made the video for the band (and their friends) Duologue as an deep dive experiment into filmmaking for virtual reality. Hollywood has been using various kinds of 3-D scanning technology for years—films like Avatar, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, relied on it. But for the Memex video, the creators used 94 cameras, whereas some Hollywood studios have been reported to use seven, to capture Nesbitt's glowing skin in the most microscopic detail possible. ""We were trying to push the realism of it,"" says Barney Steel of Marshmallow Laser Feast. The team is interested in the combination between photogrammetry—the science of taking 360-degree measurements from photos—and panoramic high dynamic range lighting, which is like photographs of light from all positions and in myriad settings (for example, it could be moon lighting, or desert lighting). Once they recorded both Nesbitt's skin and a range of light, they worked with London visual effects studio Analog to merge all that visual data. The result is a high resolution, immortal, portrait of the actor's skin. Of course, the Marshmallow Laser Feast team could have created a similar music video by just filming Nesbitt. ""Our ambition was to create the model at a really high resolution so we could take it to a games engine environment,"" Steel says. ""At the moment we're treating it like a sculpture. But if you spend enough time you can rig it to be exactly like a face. The software is out there to animate it like a motion capture."" That said, the Marshmallow Laser Feast team isn't trying to create a 3-D human scan that will show up in a scripted film or video game. They create large scale, mind-bending installations out of light and sensors, like Light Forest, which turned an entire room into an instrument of light and green lasers. So their objective is to find a way to loop virtual humans into their artwork. ""The exciting thing about virtual reality is it can give you a sense of presence that doesn't exist in other technology—and it feels like we're on the edge here,"" Steel says. ""The limiting factor is how realistic those little bubbles are. We're interested in powerful experiences where you're not bound by any of the restrictions of reality."" Read more from WIRED: .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's most wanted man, who is believed to have ties to the company that operated the ill-fated Sewol ferry, has eluded arrest for weeks, leaving authorities red-faced for not finding the high-profile billionaire. The Sewol ferry sank on April 16, killing 288 people on board. Through an investment vehicle and subsidiary, Yoo Byung Eun, 73, and his two sons are believed to have controlled the shipping company that operated the ferry, according to the semi-official Yonhap news agency. In late April, Yoo's representatives sent a statement denying that he had any direct or indirect connection to Chonghaejin Marine Company. Yoo is wanted for questioning in connection with an investigation into alleged funds embezzlement, tax evasion and other irregularities that prosecutors say could have contributed to the sinking. A South Korean court has issued a warrant for Yoo's arrest. Investigators are looking into why the ferry capsized, including factors such as imbalance of weight on the ship, overloaded and improperly secured cargo, and actions by the company and crew. What went wrong on Sewol . The Incheon District prosecutor's office said on Tuesday: ""The ones who are most directly responsible for the accident are officials with Cheonghaejin ... Our prosecutor's office is currently investigating Yoo Byung Eun, who is standing at the very top of it."" Yoo has defied summons to report to the prosecutor's office, and gone into hiding. The prosecutor's office has come under public criticism for waiting for Yoo to appear of his own volition, which some say gave him plenty of time to flee. Searching for Yoo . Yoo is known as the ""millionaire without a face"" because of his reluctance to appear in public. Yoo has four sons and daughters, three of their whereabouts are unknown. Four members of the religious group his father-in-law founded have been arrested, accused of aiding Yoo. South Korea's Justice Department said it requested its French counterparts to make the ""provisional arrest"" of his daughter. The younger Yoo has been detained by French authorities in connection with the Sewol investigation, said Magalie Josse, Paris court spokeswoman. French authorities will determine whether to extradite the younger Yoo, according to the South Korea's Ministry of Justice. South Korean President Park Geun-hye lashed out against the Yoo family this week. ""The Yoo Byung Eun family, who is the fundamental cause of this tragedy, is mocking the law and causing public rage instead of coming in front of the people to apologize and tell the truth,"" she said on Tuesday. ""Such an act by Yoo's family is a challenge to our society and an act of crime that cannot be protected."" This week, the reward for information for the capture of Yoo was raised to nearly $500,000 and about $100,000 for his eldest son. South Korean media showed pictures of possible disguises for Yoo and his appearance throughout the years. Yoo's religious group . Yoo is a religious figure of Gu Won Pa (which translates to ""salvation group""), also known as the Evangelical Baptist Church. Some members of the group have protested in front of the prosecutor's office in what they consider religious persecution. Last week, nearly a hundred members of the religious group stood outside its mountain compound as investigators arrived to search for Yoo. The supporters said the church had nothing to do with the allegations and likened the case to religious persecution, according to Yonhap . Investigators have also started looking into the practices of the group. ""We are also in cooperation with nationwide police forces closely investigating buildings and lands related to Gu Won Pa,"" said an official from the prosecutor's office. ""We are also not ruling out that he (Yoo) was smuggled out of the country and hence, we are collecting intelligence concentrated on ports."" Yoo's history . Yoo has had brushes with the law. He was convicted on fraud charges in the 1990s and spent four years in prison, according to South Korean media reports. In 1987, he was under investigation after more than 30 people from a religious group were found dead, bound and gagged in a factory outside of Seoul. Officials investigated the incident as a mass murder-suicide, and also looked into whether Yoo had any connection to the event, but determined he wasn't involved. Yoo is also known to have an artistic alter ego -- Ahae -- a photographer who has won international acclaim. His website appears to show Yoo taking pictures, but his face is not visible. According the website bio, Ahae was born in 1941 in Japan, where his family was during Japanese colonial rule of Korea. On April 25, a lengthy statement from his representative was released sending condolences to the victims of the Sewol accident and condemning what it called an ""undeserved attack against AHAE, his character and his credentials as an artist."" Meanwhile, off the southwestern coast of Korea, search operations continue around the sunken ferry as 16 people remain missing.

"(CNN) -- Today, we are all mourning the loss of 298 people who died in the tragic crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Ukraine and Russia have been trading blame on who is responsible for shooting down the aircraft. As more details come in, U.S. officials believe that pro-Russian rebels fired the missiles. Whatever the political repercussions are, the international community owes it to the deceased and their families to conduct an immediate, thorough, competent and, most important, independent investigation of what exactly happened and who is responsible. We cannot afford to have another aviation accident investigation that appears to stumble at its outset. The families of the 298 innocents on board deserve competence and justice. Most of those on board were Dutch, but there were also Australians, Indonesians, Germans, at least one American and a Malaysian crew. Some of the world's top AIDS researchers were among those killed. Clearly, given the political tensions between Ukraine and Russia and the disputed area in which the crash occurred, these two countries should not conduct the investigation. According to Annex 13 of the International Civil Aviation Organization, multiple parties are entitled to be involved in the investigation. While our own National Transportation Safety Board will have a say, since Boeing in the United States made the aircraft, we believe that the Dutch Safety Board should be the lead investigatory body, and it should be appointed immediately. The Dutch Safety Board was founded in 2005, is noted for its thoroughness and technical skill, and has conducted many aviation investigations. Its leader, Chairman Tjibbe Joustra, is a career politician and the national coordinator for security and counterterrorism. Given his experience in both aviation and national security, he would be an outstanding fit for the work. It is vital that investigators get to the scene of the accident immediately. With unconfirmed reports that Ukrainian rebels are combing through the wreckage and may even have possession of the black box, security at the crash site must be established to preserve evidence and allow investigators to determine how and why this aircraft was shot down. It is critical that investigators obtain possession of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, the ""black box."" As the NTSB did in the investigation of TWA 800 using black box data, a sound spectrum study can provide telling information on where on the aircraft and when the explosion occurred. The Russians, the Ukrainians and the rebels should commit immediately to full transparency and to guaranteeing the complete safety of the investigative team. Anything short of that should bring immediate world condemnation and a denial of landing rights for flights originating in their respective countries. This is more than just an investigation of an aviation accident. Our global economy is greatly dependent on aviation. People are able to access the farthest corners of the globe for business and family purposes with remarkable speed and unprecedented safety. If there is an ongoing threat that commercial airliners will be shot down, our global commerce will slow to a halt. In the United States alone, 97.5 million passengers flew internationally on U.S. airlines in 2013. The United Nations is meeting today on the MH17 tragedy, and it needs to show strong leadership to ensure that a true independent investigation is immediately launched. The world's countries must stand up for safe and secure global travel, and by demanding a transparent and unfettered international investigation, they will take the first step in bringing those responsible to justice.

"(CNN) -- Mark Zuckerberg believes that connectivity is a human right. Or at least that's how he's framing his new project, Internet.org, a partnership with leading companies in the smartphone industry to bring Internet access to the developing world. You could be generous and call this enlightened self-interest, but more likely, Internet.org is a canny business move dressed up to sound like charity. In his overly earnest manifesto about the project, Zuckerberg declares, ""For almost ten years, Facebook has been on a mission to make the world more open and connected. For us, that means the entire world â€” not just the richest, most developed countries. We've made good progress, and today we connect more than 1.15 billion people through Facebook each month. But as we started thinking about connecting the next 5 billion people, we realized something important: the vast majority of people in the world don't have any access to the internet."" In other words, how do we help these people become our customers? Companies that support Internet.org include Ericsson, Mediatek, Opera, Samsung, Nokia and Qualcomm. They make their money building smartphones or the systems and services that help them run. Internet.org has a three-part plan for achieving its goal. 1. Develop cheaper means of access, specifically low-cost smartphones. 2. Find data efficiencies that will allow services like Facebook to work with less bandwidth. 3. Create business models that will incentivize companies of all types to provide cheaper, more plentiful Internet access in the targeted regions. While this outline sounds refreshing, the fact is, Facebook and its partners have been pursuing them quite actively already. Internet.org is simply benevolent branding on what these companies were hard at work doing. Samsung and Nokia, for example, have been pushing their way into developing markets with low-cost smartphones. In terms of data efficiency, Facebook has developed two projects, Facebook Zero and Facebook on Every Phone, which allow the social network to run on feature phones with little bandwidth. These apps have propelled Facebook's recent growth in Africa and Mexico. New business models have emerged in regions like the Philippines, Mexico and Egypt, where Facebook partnered with handset makers and mobile carriers to preload its services onto phones in exchange for incentivizing upgrades and more expensive data plans. Will Zuckerberg's new initiative operate differently than these existing ventures? The name certainly implies so. The .org domain it uses in its name is one of the original top-level domains created specifically for nonprofits. Today, it is also used by academic institutions, open-source and community projects, and the philanthropic parts of for-profit corporations. A number of articles mistakenly referred to Internet.org as a nonprofit. It's easy to see how they were confused. In the opening lines of his essay about the new project, Zuckerberg writes, ""It may not actually be proï¬ .","Mark Zuckerberg is starting an initiative to bring Internet access to developing world .

"(CNN) -- ""The Deadheads had it wrong,"" says director Mike Fleiss. And to rub it in, he says it while standing next to Bob Weir, the Grateful Dead's co-founder, at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of ""The Other One: The Long Strange Trip of Bob Weir."" Fleiss' new documentary about Weir's life follows the legendary guitarist from his troubled youth to today. And while Weir says the movie means he's now ""off the hook"" in terms of ever writing a memoir, he's still not very comfortable talking about himself and the way he's seen by fans. Weir says in the film he doesn't ""trust pride"" and tells people he's more interested in looking forward than back, although he admits at his age ""there's always something to remind you of your past."" For Weir, when it comes to looking back at all of the concerts and experiences he had, what he misses most now are the moments the band spent together offstage. ""I kind of miss the laughs, the yucks, because we kept each other amused,"" Weir says. ""That's the only way we were able to stick together for all those years. People would come backstage, and they'd listen to some of the repartee, the interplay going back, and they'd just leave the room going (fanning himself) these guys are nuts! But we had a lot of fun."" That fun contributed to the improvisational style that made the band so popular. Weir says he was influenced by jazz pianists when it came to creating his signature style on the guitar. And while the band learned how to extend the rhythm of a song playing live for audiences high on LSD, their approach to writing songs was extemporaneous. ""The same song on a different day was a different song. As we were writing or arranging a tune that came to us, from whomever, we didn't have a formulaic way of approaching things,"" Weir says. ""It was pretty much will-o'-the-wisp, if you will."" Although fans are hoping for a Grateful Dead reunion, the film might be the best way for Deadheads to get some new material from the band. All Weir says about the possibility of getting back together is, ""We've got our best people on it."" Reunion show or not, Fleiss promises fans will learn something new in his film. A self-described Deadhead, Fleiss says he learned a lot during the making of this film because ""most of the things the Deadheads thought about the band -- how they related to the fans and the music and the fans and the jams -- it was all wrong."" And with that in mind, here are five things you may not have known about Bob Weir and the Grateful Dead. When Weir was a teenager he ran away with author and LSD advocate Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters after a Beatles concert. Kesey wrote ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and the ""Pranksters"" were immortalized by Tom Wolfe in ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."" Some of the Dead's first gigs were at the acid test parties Kesey would throw, where everyone was given an LSD-laced drink of Kool-Aid (the drug was legal at the time). Weir remembers shows where he would see the guitars move like ""snakes"" and the musical notes were visible. He admits sometimes the band would have to ""flee"" when it all got to be too much. But when it came to the Deadheads who would later follow the iconic band around from show to show, Weir says he wasn't entirely comfortable with that. He considers the lifestyle in the film, saying if following the band rang ""lofty bells for them, what's wrong with that? But if it takes your life down, that's another story."" He expressed particularly limited sympathy for drug dealers, but if someone had the talent to make a living following the group, he tipped his hat to them. Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia used to take scuba diving vacations together. There's a scene in the film where the pair are diving on a reef and Garcia tickles an eel on the chin under water. Weir says the pair had ""a lot of fun underwater,"" and that Garcia especially loved diving because underwater he was weightless. Drugs and partying were always associated with the Grateful Dead. Weir says there were times when the band members were worried about Jerry Garcia's drug use and considered holding an intervention for their frontman. Ultimately they decided to do what they could for him without that confrontation. Weir talks in the film about how he had to be Jerry Garcia's ""bag man"" for a time, holding Garcia's drugs. According to Weir, Garcia was doing heroin, marijuana and cocaine, and he would trust Weir to hold it because not only was the (relatively) health conscious Weir not going to use it, he would also limit how much Garcia could have at once. Weir was also more than willing to have a good time on his own. In 1994 on the night the Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Weir says he spent the night ""partying fairly heavily,"" and ""when the fog lifted"" he was under a table with the legendary Chuck Berry. ""We saw the wrong end of sunrise,"" Weir says of the morning after the ceremony. Their biggest hit ""Touch of Grey"" brought them a level of stardom they didn't really want. Weir says the band always hoped to have success and sidestep fame. But after the release of that song, the entire group, and Jerry Garcia in particular, found themselves at the center of some outrageous behavior by their fans. In the film one story told is about how a fan purposefully tried to have a van driving Jerry Garcia injure him so he would have some connection to the star. After ""Touch of Grey,"" according to Weir, they were unable to go out in public like they used to and often were forced to stay in their hotel rooms on the road. He was the ladies man of the group, and always had the most women of the band. In the documentary, the Grateful Dead is referred to in the early years as ""beautiful Bobby and the ugly brothers."" Drummer Mickey Hart says they all used to ""take Bob's runoff."" Now a happily married father of two daughters, Weir says he spent 30 years ""shopping around"" before settling down. He met his wife Natascha after a show when she was 15 years old and she sneaked backstage. They say the relationship was platonic until years later, after Jerry Garcia's death and as Weir was ""edging towards 50."" He says he looked around to see if he could be an aging ""rock and roll tomcat"" gracefully and ""it didn't look promising.""","A documentary about Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir premiered this week .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A song Michael Jackson recorded 31 years ago is out, the first single from the upcoming ""Xscape"" album. Jackson wrote, recorded and produced ""Love Never Felt So Good"" with Paul Anka in 1983, but it has been ""contemporized"" by Anka and Jackson estate co-executor John McClain, according to an Epic Records news release. The song has ""a magic combination of the new and the original production that retains the track's analog, early 80s feel, while also sounding right at home with the disco-soul inflected music of today,"" the label said. The track debuted during the iHeartRadio Music Awards on Thursday night. Online music services, including iTunes, have it for downloading starting early Friday morning, Epic said. Jackson and Anka worked on the song at about the same time they wrote and recorded ""This Is It,"" which eventually became the theme song to a documentary based on Jackson's preparations for a tour that never happened because of his death. Jackson died at age 50 on June 25, 2009, while preparing for his ""This Is It"" comeback tour. Eight previously unheard Michael Jackson songs, originally recorded between 1983 and 1999, will be released on the new album May 13, Epic Records announced in March. Epic Chairman L.A. Reid chose several producers with the ""gravitas, depth and range to creatively engage with Jackson's work"" to update the recordings for release, Epic said. New Michael Jackson album coming in May: 'Xscape' Timbaland is the lead producer, with contributions from Rodney Jerkins, Stargate, Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon and McClain, the release said. A bonus version of ""Love Never Felt So Good"" features Justin Timberlake along with Jackson. Sony's Columbia Epic Records -- Jackson's record label for three decades -- signed a longterm deal with Jackson's estate to posthumously release music from the large archives of his recordings. Reid ""was granted unlimited access to the treasures representing four decades of material on which Jackson had completed his vocals,"" the announcement said. ""New"" music is not always met with a warm reception from fans and the Jackson family. Some questioned the authenticity of the vocals on a 2010 album, although the estate and the record company said sound experts verified Jackson's voice.","Jackson wrote, recorded ""Love Never Felt So Good"" with Paul Anka in 1983 .

""I can confirm I am leaving the embassy soon, but not for the reason you might think,"" Assange said at a news conference Monday. He did not provide additional details but said he is suffering from health problems and would leave ""when conditions are right."" However, WikiLeaks said, ""his departure is not imminent."" Ecuador's foreign minister, who sat next to him, said his freedom is long overdue. ""The situation must come to an end ... two years is too long,"" Ricardo Patino said. ""It is time to free Julian Assange. It is time for his human rights to be respected."" Swedish authorities want to question him over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He denies the allegations and describes them as politically motivated. ""I've not been charged with an offense in the UK or Sweden,"" he said Monday. Patino said Swedish prosecutors have disregarded offers to get evidence from Assange via video conference or send prosecutors to the embassy. As a result, he said, the case remains unresolved years later, an injustice to both Assange and the two women. ""The end result is these requests have not been heeded,"" Patino said. Assange says he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Last month, his lawyers argued that the detention order against him should be revoked. But Stockholm District Court Judge Lena Egelin ruled that Assange is still suspected, with probable cause, of sex crimes and his detention order should remain in place. After the decision last month, prosecutor Marianne Ny said the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape. Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online. In addition to the Guantanamo procedures manual, it also published documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies. In August 2010, Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him over allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers. He turned himself in to London authorities the same year, and was remanded in custody. At the time, a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden, and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court. It denied his appeal. In June 2012, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum, which was granted in August of the same year. He's been living at the embassy in London since then.

"(CNN) -- Online photo archive Getty Images is opening 35 million images to online publishers to use free of charge, acknowledging that many of its pictures are already being copied anyway. The company will allow ""noncommercial"" users such as bloggers and tweeters to embed its images using a code similar to what's on sites such as YouTube. The image that appears will include a Getty photo credit and will be linked to the company's website, where viewers can have the opportunity to license the photo. ""This will provide people with a simple and legal way to utilize content that respects creators' rights, including the opportunity to generate licensing revenue,"" Getty said in a statement announcing the move. The decision ""opens one of the largest, deepest and most comprehensive image collections in the world for easy sharing, thereby making the world an even more visual place."" Craig Peters, Getty's senior vice president for business development, said Getty saw its content being copied online, and that ""spoke to an opportunity."" ""The use of our content in these venues points to really the fact that people are excited to be sharing their ideas, their interests, their passions with our content,"" he said. By giving users limited access to its imagery, he said, ""We're generating new brand awareness in this market."" It also clarifies Getty's insistence that any commercial use of the company's images requires a paid license, possibly bringing in paying customers, Peters said. And it opens up the door to using the embed code to post advertising -- a prospect already covered in Getty's terms of use for the new venture. ""I think it's a little premature to talk to a specific business model, but I think we can talk to specific benefits out of the gate,"" Peters said. Users will be able to choose from a universe of 35 million images out of the 150 million Getty has available for licensing to a wide variety of organizations, from advertising agencies to news outlets such as CNN. Embedded content must be used for ""editorial purposes"" -- meaning events that are ""newsworthy or of public interest"" -- and can't be used for advertising, the terms state. Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, said Getty is trying to establish ""an alternative for people who otherwise would just copy and paste photos,"" much as Apple's iTunes created a way to legitimize music sharing. But the trick for Getty will be to allow those users to access its images without making it so easy that its paying customers start using the embed service themselves, he said. ""Getty makes a lot of money off folks like The New York Times and CNN and professional publishers. They do not in any way want to endanger that,"" Benton said. ""They're trying to walk that thin line to protect that while at the same time enabling that different kind of business."" Peters said that commercial users have more rights to the images than bloggers who embed them. They're able to use the images on multiple platforms, edit them and keep them on their own servers, he said. ""It's a completely different work product than what any of our major media companies are looking for,"" he said. So far, news photos are harder to find in embeddable form ""than a stock photo of a man in a classroom,"" Benton said. But if Getty starts using the embedded image to post ads -- a possibility included in its terms of use -- ""then you have a question about how photographers get compensated,"" Benton said. Yvonne Boyd, a photographer in Atlanta, said the market for stock imagery has already declined sharply in recent years, and many photo agencies now expect photographers to pick up a larger share of their expenses. ""I can't help but think that somehow Getty will gain something from this, but not their photographers,"" Boyd said. She and other photographers who commented on Getty's Facebook page also questioned whether an ad-supported website counted as a noncommercial venture. ""When you're potentially making money, even if it's not a service or a product, that's commercial,"" she said. ""You then are benefiting from another's work, and they are not being compensated."" But Peters said the feedback he's received from photographers is ""largely positive."" ""We have over 200,000 photographers whose work we represent on a global basis. In that world, not everyone's going to always agree with the things we do,"" he said. But he said he met with a group of photographers Wednesday night, ""and they were incredibly excited about it.""","NEW: Copying of Getty photos ""spoke to an opportunity,"" VP says .

"(CNN) -- Your daughter's favorite doll is lost, and she won't stop crying. What if you could replace it in 20 minutes? Your spatula breaks in the middle of dinner prep. Why not just whip up a new one? Believe it or not, this stuff is possible. We are in the middle of a self-manufacturing revolution, thanks to innovations in 3-D printing. 3-D printers have been around for years, but only now are they finally becoming more affordable for the general public. While more popular printers such as the MakerBot Replicator 2 and the Cube have been known to cost more than $1,000, the Buccaneer is a new 3-D printer that successfully reached its goal on crowd-funding site Kickstarter this year and will be available for consumer purchase this fall for under $400. That's less than some iPhones. Not only are 3-D printers more affordable, but they are getting even better at printing, too. Many are starting to accommodate materials other than the standard plastic filament, enabling 3-D experimenters to print with wood, metals, cookie dough and more. These advancements are making it easy and fun to use 3-D printers to create everyday products, such as home decor, jewelry, toys and even running shoes. Can you envision a future Christmas where you print all your gifts instead of shop for them? It could soon be reality in even the most tech-averse household, and it might just end up saving the craftier among us lots of time and money. Why buy a $50 vase when you can print one for $2? Purchasing new cookie cutters seems silly once you realize you can customize your own online and print them in 15 minutes. You can even turn sentimental photos into 3-D printed goods, making for a personalized gift on birthdays and anniversaries. So how do these printers work? First, you'll need to install a software program onto your computer that can configure the 3-D file for whatever you are going to print. Creating 3-D files can be as easy or as complex as you like. You can either download free 3-D designs from various websites (such as Thingiverse) and send them straight to print, download a basic 3-D design that you can then tweak with slight customizations or use 3-D modeling software such as AutoCAD to create your designs from scratch. New gadgets such as the MakerBot Digitizer can even take a 360-degree scan of any product you may already have in your home, then convert it into a 3-D design so that you can clone it with your 3-D printer. This is a great way to replace objects that might be worn or slightly broken. Once your printer receives the 3-D file, it begins printing, first left to right (just like with your inkjet), then upward to build a third dimension. You have a cartridge for your plastic just like you have one for your ink on a standard home printer. If you aren't yet ready to own a 3-D printer, you can still start 3-D printing without one. New companies such as Shapeways enable you to upload 3-D designs or browse among a marketplace of products from other designers, then print the goods for you and ship them to your home. Or if you'd like to try a whole new 3-D printing concept in general, sign up to be one of the first to demo the 3Doodler, a pen that lets you draw products into reality. One of the coolest parts of this new industry is just how customizable printed products can be. A Japanese company called FabCafe can turn a quick scan of your body into a 3-D gummy bear-like version of yourself. Or you can use the same technology to create a mini-action figure of yourself. Think of all the possibilities for children to have their own toys replicated after themselves, or for brides and grooms to have the ultimate custom cake topper. The possibilities are endless. ""If you can think it, you can print it"" might just be the new saying of our time.","3-D printing has come a long way in quality, and printers are less expensive now .
Everyday household items such as cookware and vases can be replicable in-house .
Crafters might find 3-D printers useful for gift-making and decor ."
"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- At first glance, it doesn't look like much. Hidden behind an unmarked door, in a nondescript government office building in the Australian capital, it could be mistaken for a high school science classroom with work benches, slightly outdated computer monitors, and the odd microscope sitting in the corner. But what happens in this room is anything but amateur. We're inside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident investigation lab, the place where the black boxes from Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 could be brought if and when they're recovered from the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean. The place that may play a critical role in solving the mystery of what happened to the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Our guide today is Senior Transport Safety Investigator Neil Campbell. An engineer by trade, he's been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades. Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenge of accident investigation, but there's another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work. ""Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public -- that's rewarding,"" he says. Just a handful of countries have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what's inside a black box. And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here. 'Object of interest' found . Retrieving the memory board . We start by the sink. Once the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder is retrieved from more than 4500 meters below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell. When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rinse the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart. Sometimes getting the data is simple. ""A lot of our work is with undamaged recorders and it's very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,"" Campbell says, as he flips open a slot on the end of the recorder. But the process becomes much more technical if the recorders are damaged by fire or water. On the shelves of the lab's main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions. Their metal casing is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior charred black. But even with these recorders, Campbell still has options to tackle what some might consider an impossible task. That's because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU). Campbell unscrews a couple of bolts. Wearing gloves and grounded to an anti-static mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective insulation. In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand. This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live. In the case of the Boeing 777, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,000 parameters for up to 25 hours. Those include everything from altitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, even cabin temperature and pressure. Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second. The cockpit voice recorder captures four audio channels for a maximum of two hours before overwriting. One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: ""We could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,"" Campbell explains. If there's water damage, Campbell says he will rinse the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven. That process can take a couple of days. Decoding the data . When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones. Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to decode each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when. To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audio analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor. For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, tragically ending in the death of both pilots on board. Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in helping the public understand an accident: ""There's a satisfaction in working out what happened with the accident and the conclusions, and the closure that that brings."" Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370 end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. CNN's Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","Black box data from Flight 370 could be analyzed at a laboratory in Australia .

"(CNN) -- Fear is a terrible thing to waste. Yet modern Americans have squandered it as a tool for managing burgeoning populations of wildlife. A woman is in the hospital after she was mauled by a bear while walking in her central Florida neighborhood on Monday. Authorities caught a 75- to 100-pound yearling, but think the larger predator bear is still on the prowl. Tom Shupe thinks black bears have a people problem. He's a state wildlife biologist once responsible for dealing with growing bear-vs.-people conflicts in central Florida. I spent time with Shupe while researching the book ""Nature Wars."" He explained that perpetually hungry black bears need plenty of food habitat. Parents disown yearlings, forcing them to find new space. As their populations grow, they spread out, often from the Ocala National Forest south into the swampy sprawl of Greater Orlando. Trouble starts when a bear turns up in a backyard. Instead of scaring it away, too many people say: ""Oh, isn't he cute. Let's toss him a cookie. Get the camera."" Thus begins a photo collection of ""Our Bear."" But it's the beginning of the end for that bear, because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food. The bear comes back for more. Soon it's breaking into the house. The people call 911: ""Do something about your bear."" Shupe arrives, darts the bear and moves it 100 miles. But the bear has learned people equals food, and does it again. After three strikes, the bear is shot -- euthanized. But it's not the bear's fault. It's the people's fault. Deer are eating our gardens and spreading ticks that cause Lyme disease; coyotes are killing our pets; turkeys are chasing our children to school; and geese have overrun our soccer fields because they don't fear us. And we have done all sorts of things to help them lose their natural fear. People say our conflicts with wild creatures are our fault because we encroached on their habitat. True, but only half the story. Many species encroached right back. Why? Because our habitat is better than theirs. Ours can sustain many more of them than their un-peopled landscape. We put out all sorts of food for them: lawns, gardens, shrubbery, birdseed, grill grease, garbage, dumpster waste. We offer water: Air-conditioner drip pans are water fountains for raccoons. Edges and hiding places are homes: A coyote can have a litter of pups in that brush behind your garbage and you won't know it. And we offer protection from predators, mainly ourselves. The results are mounting in people-vs.-wildlife conflicts. We should be celebrating a conservation success story that is unique on the planet. Instead, we demonize elegant creatures and fight over what to do, or not to do, about too much of a good thing. How did this happen? How did we turn this story into such a mess? In a nutshell: . Over the last century and half, forests grew back on abandoned farmland; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations. Since World War II we sprawled out into suburbs and exurbs -- something early conservationists didn't imagine. The 2000 census showed that for the first time, an absolute majority of the population lived neither in cities nor on working farms but in the vast sprawl zone in between. That's where family farms were a century ago. Today, it's full of trees and filling with wildlife. We've become forest people -- yet we spend 90% of our time indoors. There we get most of our nature on digital screens, where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics. Research suggests that the white-tailed deer's biggest predator since the last Ice Age has been man. But sprawl man has largely gotten out of the predation business. He doesn't hunt and doesn't want others to hunt around him. He's peppered the landscape with hunting restrictions and enacted all sorts of laws against hunting, firearms discharges, even bow-and-arrow use in some places. What this means is that in just the last few decades, for the first time in 11,000 years, huge swaths of the whitetail's historic range -- the Eastern United States -- have been put off-limits to its biggest predators. No wonder deer have burgeoned out of control. In Massachusetts, for example, it's illegal to discharge a firearm within 150 feet of a hard-surfaced road or within 500 feet of an occupied dwelling without the occupants' written permission -- often not easy to get. Those two laws alone put almost two-thirds of the state effectively off-limits to hunting. Lots of states have similar restrictions and most were imposed in the name of safety. Guns kill 31,500 people annually in the United States, but hunters are relatively safe. Estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents, mainly in cases of mistaken identity. These days, deer kill more than twice that many, both in deer-vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle. These accidents hospitalize another 30,000 people. Don't swerve: Hit the deer. Overabundant white-tails, meanwhile, do enormous damage to the landscape, and not just gardens and shrubbery. They are ruining our forests by eating their understories so trees can't regenerate. No seedlings. No places for understory birds and the insects they feed their newborn. Black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear, but they, like deer, beavers, turkeys, waterfowl and others, were almost wiped out in the United States by the end of the 19th century. Daniel and Rebecca Boone reportedly killed 155 of them in one season in Kentucky. With protection, they slowly came back in the 20th century, to about 750,000 in 2002 and perhaps a million or more today. Between 1900 and 2009, black bears killed 63 people -- 86% were in the last 40 years. Why the increase? More bears and more denatured people living in the same habitat. Birdseed sellers now refer to wild birds as ""outdoor pets,"" helping to condition people to think that putting out food for wild animals is an act of kindness. It isn't. Food and no fear have turned many normally nocturnal wild creatures diurnal. They hang out among us in the daytime. Nuisance wildlife control people say tossing rocks at coyotes would help reinstill their fear of people. Instead, I've known people to toss them dog biscuits. Carrying a stick or a golf club is enough to deter wild turkeys, mail carriers tell me. Bear-proofing your garbage cans and taking down your birdfeeders in spring are no-brainers. Conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another. There are all sorts of ways to mitigate them, both lethal and nonlethal. Some work better than others. Reinstilling their fear will help. Feeding them won't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Sterba.","Jim Sterba: Wildlife more and more encroaching on our space, and we into theirs .

"(CNN) -- HBO execs say they have nothing to worry about with ""Game of Thrones"" -- and not just because it's the most-nominated program at the Emmys this year. The fantasy series is based on George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series, and as ""Game of Thrones"" approaches its fifth season, fans are concerned it'll soon run out of source material. But on Thursday, HBO CEO Richard Plepler and network Programming President Michael Lombardo assured reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour that ""Game of Thrones"" will get its fully story. ""George is an integral part of the creative team, so next season every move is being choreographed very closely with him,"" Lombardo said. ""Certainly after next year we'll have to figure it out with George, but we're not concerned about it."" A rumored ""Game of Thrones"" movie isn't on the radar, but Plepler wouldn't dismiss it entirely. ""In my conversations with George, he's 100% focused on the books and the show,"" the HBO CEO said. ""GOT"" is HBO's most-watched series (ever), but ""True Detective"" is its newest gem. On Thursday, the freshman anthology series earned 12 Emmy nods, including nominations for best drama, best writing and two best actor nods for Season 1 stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The show's structure presents a new cast of characters and story each season, and while Lombardo didn't have any casting news on Thursday he did drop a major tease for Season 2. ""The two scripts we have are -- I hate to jinx it -- but they are more exciting than the first season,"" he promised. ""True Detective"" creator Nic Pizzolatto was just as cryptic with The Daily Beast, saying little except that it will be set in California, and there are four central roles. ""We're not keeping any secrets, so when something concrete develops, we'll announce it to everybody,"" Pizzolatto said. ""But everything has just been empty rumors so far.""","HBO execs talked about ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective"" at the TCAs .

"(CNN) -- Security has been stepped up around a prominent Australian Muslim leader after Twitter threats from a Sydney-based militant seen in recent photos clutching severed heads in Syria. In a tweet that's since been deleted, a man believed to be Mohamed Elomar offered $1,000 for information on the whereabouts of Dr. Jamal Rifi and his five children. ""Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat area am willing to pay $1000,"" the tweet said. Rifi is a general practitioner and outspoken community leader who this week condemned shocking images posted on social media by convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf of his seven-year-old child holding a mutilated head. In 2009, Sharrouf was jailed for his role in a planned terror attack in Australia led by Mohamed Ali Elomar, the uncle of the man believed to have offered the bounty. The senior Mohamed is currently serving a minimum 21-year sentence for the plot, which involved the manufacture of explosives for a ""potentially catastrophic"" attack. Gruesome images . Australian Federal Police issued arrest warrants for the younger Elomar and Sharrouf in late July after they posted gruesome images to Twitter of themselves posing with the severed heads of Syrian fighters. It's believed the photos were taken in the Syrian city of Raqqa. The latest tweets attributed to Elomar came from the now suspended Twitter handle @abu hafs ozzie. ""Any details were he works or knows if his got kids which school they attend. Like I said I am willing to pay $1000 just for details,"" another tweet said. ""It was shocking to be honest,"" Rifi told CNN. ""I've taken it extremely seriously because they labeled me as a habashi dog -- even though I've never been a habashi and I'm not a habashi. What it means in their twisted mentally (is that) attacking me, killing me is permissible for followers of their ideology."" Security stepped up . Police are also taking the threat seriously. Rifi said the New South Wales Police Commissioner phoned him before sending officers to his house for a security audit. Patrols have been stepped up in the area and his son's school principal has suggested he stay at home. However, Rifi said he refused to be silenced. ""I'm not going into hiding. I know I'm fortunate enough to life in a country where law and order prevail and people can't take matters into their own hands, and affords me the freedom to speak. And I want to use that privilege to defend what we have in Australia and to keep it."" In a direct message to Elomar, Rifi tweeted: ""to know my address just ask your dad, we were in the same soccer team then and we still Best mates and he knows I am and never been a HABASHI."" Old family friends . Rifi is a longtime friend of Elomar's father, Mamdouh Elomar. They met as children in Lebanon before moving to Australia. Elomar fled the civil war in the 1970s and built a successful engineering business in Sydney. Rifi followed in the early 1980s and has become a respected member of the community for his efforts in breaking down religious barriers. The Elomars are a ""great"" family, Rifi said, adding that Mohamed was the ""black sheep"" who turned his back on what was a stable and supportive upbringing to follow a ""twisted ideology."" Mohamed's father would support him ""100%,"" Rifi said, though he added he hadn't spoken to him since the threats were made. On Thursday, he and Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, gave a series of interviews in Arabic and English to try to counter the recruitment campaign being waged by ISIS militants on social media. ""We're telling young people: 'Forget the rhetoric, look at the action.' And the action they are doing is totally unIslamic,"" Rifi said. ""While they're pretending to defend Islam, in reality what they're doing is hurting their family, their community and they're giving a distorted image of their religion."" Threat of 'homegrown terrorists' Extra revulsion was reserved this week for Sharrouf, who posted a picture of his young son holding a man's severed head. ""It is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,"" said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The image was used by U.S. and Australian officials to emphasize the importance of the fight against ISIS militants, who are engaged in a brutal campaign in Iraq and Syria with the aim of establishing an Islamic caliphate. Around 150 Australians are thought to be supporting their activities, while around 60 are believed to be engaged in active fighting. ""There are a significant number of Australian citizens who are taking part in activities in Iraq and parts of Syria: extremist activities, terrorist activities,"" Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. ""Our fear is that they will return home to Australia as hardened homegrown terrorists and seek to continue their work here in Australia.""","Australian tweets bounty for information on outspoken Muslim leader .

"(CNN) -- Despite the call for him to step aside after he publicly admitted Tuesday using crack cocaine, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he will not step down and will run for re-election next year. ""I was elected to do a job and that is exactly what I am going to continue doing,"" he said during a news conference Tuesday at his office. ""We live in a democracy and on October 27, 2014, I want the people of this great city to decide if they want Rob Ford to be their mayor."" Earlier Tuesday, after months of dodging allegations, Ford told reporters that he smoked crack cocaine about a year ago -- probably, he said, during a ""drunken stupor."" ""Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine. But ... do I? Am I an addict? No,"" Ford said. ""Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago,"" he said about the cocaine use. Ford said later that he knew he had embarrassed everyone in the city and ""I will be forever sorry."" He promised the people of Canada's largest city that his mistakes will ""never ever, ever happen again."" Pressure on Ford, 44, increased last week when Toronto's police chief announced investigators recovered a video of the mayor that purportedly shows him smoking a crack pipe. That followed allegations in two media reports in May that a video showed Ford using crack cocaine last winter. Toronto mayor says he won't resign despite possibly damning video . Ford, who had previously said he did not use crack and who has not been charged with a crime, made the admission to reporters earlier in the day outside his office in Toronto after they asked him about the issue. Toronto City Councillor John Filion, who had just introduced a motion to take many of the mayor's powers away from him, said shortly after the admission that Ford needs to take leave. ""Wow. I need a minute to absorb this,"" Filion said. ""I think the mayor needs to step aside and take stock of his life as this situation becomes more absurd."" Ford said no one he was close to knew of his drug use, not even his brother, Doug, a city councillor. ""I feel like a thousand pounds have been lifted off my shoulders,"" Rob Ford said during the news conference. He said that he knows he will need to regain the trust and confidence of the people of Toronto. Ford said on a radio program Sunday that he was sorry for ""a lot of stupid things."" He later clarified on the program -- ""The City"" on CFRB -- that his apology referred to two previously reported incidents where he appeared to have been drunk in public and ""a lot of stupid things, all self-inflicted"" that he didn't detail. He also said on that program that he wouldn't resign despite Thursday's announcement by police. Ford says he didn't lie . While speaking outside his office Tuesday, he said he hadn't lied -- apparently referring to his previous statements on the matter. ""You didn't ask the correct questions,"" he said Tuesday. ""No, I'm not an addict. And no, I do not do drugs. I made mistakes in the past and all I can do is apologize."" When he addressed the allegations in May, Ford denied crack cocaine use in the present tense. ""I do not use crack cocaine. Nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,"" he told reporters then, according to CNN affiliate CBC. Ford has been mayor since December 2010. The video . In May, the website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper published stories saying their reporters had seen 90 seconds of a cell-phone video showing Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted about a number of subjects. The video, which has never been released publicly, shows a ""clearly impaired mayor,"" two reporters who say they saw the video wrote in the Star. Then, police recovered video from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation, according to a 465-page report by Toronto police disclosed on Thursday. The report includes hundreds of redacted pages and states that police sources believe a photo of Ford that first surfaced in May was taken in front of a ""trap"" house used to ""chop"" crack. On Thursday, Toronto Police Chief William Blair told reporters that the video featured images ""consistent with those that have previously been reported in the press."" Blair said Ford appears in the video, but would not detail what he's shown doing. 'I want to see the tape' Ford told reporters Tuesday that he wants to see the video. ""There's been times when I've been a drunken stupor. That's why I want to see the tape. I want everyone in the city to see this tape. I'd like to see this tape. I don't even recall there being a tape and a video and I know that. I want to see the state that I was in,"" Ford said. Police documents also detail evidence used to obtain a search warrant for a man suspected of drug trafficking, Alexander (Sandro) Lisi, who police say is the mayor's friend as well as his driver. Photos collected by police show Ford and Lisi together on a number of occasions, including attending a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game, according to the documents. Lisi was arrested Thursday and charged with extortion, according to a police statement. He is accused of using extortion to retrieve a recording, it said. Blair said a digital video in police custody will be shown in court in an effort to support the charge against Lisi, who was released after a bail hearing Friday, his lawyer, Seth Weinstein, said.

"(CNN) -- The stunning news has been spreading through the city of Greenville, South Carolina, shaking residents in a way they hadn't felt in recent memory. Two families -- including five children -- were killed Sunday in a plane crash while vacationing together in Soldotna, Alaska, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage. They were all passengers in a small, single-engine plane that crashed on takeoff into the runway at the town's airport, officials said. While much of the country focuses on the intensely covered plane crash in San Francisco, many of Greenville's approximately 60,000 residents have been thinking about Soldotna. The Alaskan town sits thousands of miles away, but this crash feels much closer to home. ""Without a doubt, it's the most devastating tragedy I think we've had to experience since I've been here,"" said Scott Sanders, a 21-year Greenville resident. ""Losing two entire families -- it just doesn't happen."" Greenville was mourning Dr. Chris McManus; his wife, Stacey McManus; and their children, Meghan and Connor, said Johnathan Bragg, a spokesman for the Greenville Police Department. McManus was a radiologist who practiced at a local hospital. Also killed aboard the plane were the Antonakos family: Milton ""Melet"" Antonakos; his wife, Kimberly Antonakos; and their children Mills, Ana and Olivia, Bragg said. All the children ranged in age from grade school to high school, said Sanders. Melet Antonakos worked in medical equipment sales while Kimberly Antonakos served as a president of a parent/teacher group, according to The Greenville News. ""You name it, if you needed somebody to volunteer, you called Kim Antonakos and she was there,"" State Rep. Bruce Bannister told the newspaper. Bannister, who lives just down the street from the Antonakos home, told CNN he and Melet Antonakos had become good friends. Melet was Antonakos' traditional family Greek name. ""He was 'Melet' to his friends and 'Milton' to his business associates,"" Bannister said. The Bannister family's son was a classmate of 12-year-old Ana. Now Bannister tells his children the Antonakos family ""got to go to heaven together."" In light of the San Francisco plane crash, Bannister said that sometimes it's hard to really appreciate the significance tragedies have when they take place far away. ""You hear about a plane crash in California and you're in Greenville, South Carolina, and you think, 'that's a terrible tragedy.' And now you hear about a plane crash and you think about the Antonakoses and how those families connected to the crash out there in California are feeling. You really recognize how huge these tragedies are."" Both families were ""very involved in their community, very involved in their church and their schools,"" said Sanders, who is president of a swimming pool where some of the children went. ""Very few people here have not been touched by this tragedy."" Christ Church, where the families worshipped, has been especially striken by the news. Sunday school teacher Heather Meadors, who taught the children of both families as toddlers, told The Greenville News she felt ""like there's a big black cloud over Christ Church right now."" McManus had been named among the nation's best physicians in 2011, according to his hospital website. He had a sibling who is employed by Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN. ""Chris was one of our lead interventional radiologists, who brought a number of new and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools to the community,"" McManus' colleague, Dr. C. David Williams, told The Greenville News. ""He was an extraordinary physician but also an extraordinary human being who was known to be both compassionate and conscientious."" The Antonakoses and McManuses were bound for Bear Mountain Lodge off Alaska's Chinitna Bay, about 80 miles southwest of Soldotna, the lodge's co-owner, Mac McGahan, told CNN on Monday. In addition to the families, the pilot of the plane also died in the crash, authorities said, putting the death toll at 10. The de Havilland DHC-3 Otter ""struck the runway and burned,"" the FAA said, citing local law enforcement officials. By the time firefighters and medics arrived, the aircraft was engulfed, Soldotna police said. The plane was operated by Rediske Air, according to the FAA. The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to the crash site Tuesday and were investigating. This isn't the first NTSB case for Rediske. In August 2011, a Rediske Air Cessna got stuck in sand after a sightseeing excursion, the NTSB said, damaging its propeller. The NTSB lists a 2004 incident when a pilot taxiing a Rediske Cessna at an airport in Trading Bay hit a 55-gallon drum of soap, bending the plane's propeller. No one was reported hurt in either incident. In Greenville, the children's classmates were mourning their loss. Students from J.L. Mann High School -- where Olivia Antonakos was about to start her junior year -- had flowers delivered to the family's home, The State reported. Classmates also left a guest book for mourners to sign, according to the paper. Olivia's involvement in the school stretched from the school varsity basketball team, to student government. Her classmates had just elected her the student body secretary. That's five children lost -- whose hopeful promise of a fruitful and productive life will go unfulfilled. ""It's just a loss for the school and for the whole community,"" Charles Mayfield, the school's principal, told The State. ""They were just good people. They thought of others before they thought of themselves. To lose the whole family, it's just really shocking."" For the city as a whole, Bannister said church members, friends and neighbors of the two families will be gathering for prayer and memorials during the coming days. But the mourning seems more difficult somehow. ""This is especially hard because it's a whole family,"" he said. ""There's this void. There's nobody to console, because there's nobody at the Antonakos house. There's nobody to take a casserole to. Everybody wants to do something, but there's nobody to do anything for."" There's little else to do, Bannister said, except to lean on each other. This unforgettable tragedy, he said, ""has almost brought us closer together."" CNN's Aaron Cooper, Meridith Edwards, Rene Marsh, Cristy Lenz and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","Plane crash kills 9 people from two different South Carolina families .

"(CNN) -- The English commentator veered from disbelief to anger and then, finally, to mirth. It was the opening heat of the men's 100 meters freestyle swimming at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, but only one man was standing on his block: Eric Moussambani from Equatorial Guinea, a tiny, oil-rich state in west Africa. There had been two other swimmers to compete with -- one from Niger, the other from Tajikistan -- but both had jumped the gun, dived in to the pool and been disqualified. The crowd cheered, the gun fired and the 22-year-old dived in. Suddenly he was on his own. What followed was one of the most memorable two minutes in Olympic history, one that would embody something far away from the podiums that honor the motto of the modern Games: ""Faster, higher, stronger."" During the first 50 meters Moussambani appeared to be holding his own, but by the turn things had gone very wrong. At one point he appeared to stop, treading water to catch his breath before continuing. ""This guy,"" remarked the commentator for British TV, who was none other than Adrian Moorhouse, gold medalist in the same discipline at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, ""he's not going to make it ... I'm convinced this guy is going to have to get hold of the rope in a minute."" 'Me against the swimming pool' Looking back today, Eric Moussambani is hard pressed to disagree with him. ""It was me against the swimming pool,"" he recalls with a laugh. ""I didn't care about anything else, I just wanted to finish the race ... When I went to Australia that was the first time I had seen an Olympic swimming pool. I was scared of the dimensions."" Somehow he managed to crawl to the end, posting a time of one minute 52.72 seconds. The man who would eventually win gold in the event, Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, would finish the final in 48.30 seconds, . His swim made him an instant star of the Sydney Olympics -- dubbed ""Eric the Eel"" by the world's media -- and lampooned around the world for posting the worst time in the history of the sport. But it also reminded the world that there's far more to the Olympic spirit than just victory. A voice on the radio . Moussambani didn't start out as a swimmer. Growing up in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, he excelled at soccer and basketball. But one day, three months before the start of the Sydney Olympics, he heard an advert on the radio with an intriguing offer. ""I heard on the radio that they (the Equatorial Guinea National Olympic Committee) needed swimmers, so I went and put my name down,"" he recalls. He may not have wanted to be an Olympic swimmer but, having practiced in a local river, Moussambani decided to give it a shot. When he arrived at the hotel in Malabo where the trial was to take place, he soon discovered that the competition was nonexistent. ""We were called for the selection, and I was the only person who was there!"" he says. ""So nobody came. For two hours we were waiting. I was the only one. That was in the only hotel that had a pool, a 12-meter swimming pool. They told me to get in and asked if I could swim."" After proving that he could swim, Moussambani was told that he would be heading to Sydney after securing a place on the Equatorial Guinea Olympic team, a place that had been gifted by the International Olympic Committee's wildcard system that gave less developed nations a chance to send athletes to the Games to gain experience. ""They just told me to get my passport and a picture ready so they could send me to the Olympics. They said to me, 'Keep on training.' I asked them, 'With who? I don't have a trainer.' They said: 'Do what you can. Keep training because you are going to the Olympics.' "" Preparations were tough for Moussambani. There was no Olympic-sized pool in Equatorial Guinea and the hotel pool was only of limited use. Still, he left for Australia for the first time knowing that, if nothing else, it would be an adventure. ""The Olympic Games was something unknown for me,"" he says. ""I was just happy that I was going to travel abroad and represent my country. It was new for me. It was very far from Africa."" The terror of the pool . It wasn't until he turned up for training on the first day that he saw an Olympic-sized swimming pool for the first time. Reality quickly dawned on him. ""When I arrived I just went to the swimming pool to see how it is. I was very surprised, I did not imagine that it would be so big,"" he says. ""My training schedule there was with the American swimmers. I was going to the pool and watching them, how they trained and how they dived because I didn't have any idea. I copied them. I had to know how to dive, how to move my legs, how to move my hands. ""I learned everything in Sydney. I didn't know how to dive, anything. While they (the U.S. swim team) were training I was watching them. I was alone. I didn't have a coach."" When the day of the race arrived, Moussambani sat in his seat with his goggles on, going through everything he had learned from the American swimmers. ""I was just thinking, 'Do whatever you think you can do.' I was thinking how the American swimmers were training,"" he explains. But when his two competitors were disqualified for two false starts, Moussambani suddenly felt very alone. ""At first I was thinking that I was the one who was disqualified!"" he laughs. ""They told me I was the only one that was going to swim, so I was very nervous. Everybody was screaming: 'Go go go!' "" Out on a limb . Most athletes can only a recall a blur of memories when remembering their time at the Olympics, but Moussambani remembers every second of that race: the pain, the fear, the exhaustion and finally the relief. ""The first 50 meters I did very well. I did it with a lot of energy. When I was coming back to complete the 100 meters I was exhausted. If you watch the video, I couldn't feel my legs. I was feeling like I wasn't going to go any further. I was moving in just one place. ""The crowd was singing, 'Go go go go!' So I did my best to complete it. But once I completed it I was exhausted. I thought, 'Phew, my god!' All my muscles were tired. So when I went in to the changing room I just collapsed on the floor and lay there. I couldn't even breathe."" The anti-hero . It is unlikely that any swimmer will ever get close to Moussambani's time, which is more than a minute slower than the women's 100m record and not even as quick as the best men's 200m effort. But once he picked himself up off the changing room floor he had become a worldwide celebrity. ""The media attention was, phew..."" he remembers. ""Everyone in the media was asking about me. Oh, where's Eric the Eel? I didn't know how to speak English back then. People were saying I was a star. But I didn't know what to do. A lot of people were making fun of me, others were congratulating me. ""But what they didn't understand was that it was my first time in a swimming pool. People were making fun of me. But some said you are a good example of the Olympic spirit."" While most people saw the true values of the Olympic movement in Moussambani's Quixotic swim at Sydney -- heart, determination, a never-say-die spirit -- his performance sparked much hand-wringing elsewhere. Elite athletes were offended that more talented swimmers were denied a place at the Olympics to accommodate developmental athletes. As Moorhouse said in a later interview: ""It was quite a defining moment for the Olympic Games as to whether that level of performance should be in Olympic competition."" The end of Eric the Eel? Sure enough the International Olympic Committee tightened up the rules on wildcard entries to prevent other ""Eric the Eels"" from turning up. But they still slip through the net. Only this week Hamadou Djibo Issaka, a rower from Niger, was hailed as the ""new Eric the Eel"" after finishing 100 seconds behind his nearest rival in the men's single sculls repechage. Britain's five-time Olympic gold medalist Steve Redgrave criticized the decision to allow Issaka to compete. ""There are better scullers from different countries who are not allowed to compete because of the different countries you've got,"" he said. Yet it was Issaka, and not the winner, who was roared across the finishing line. Likewise with Moussambani. Few outside of the swimming world will remember Sydney champion Van den Hoogenband, but ""Eric the Eel"" has become an Olympic euphemism. ""They even took my trunks to display in an Olympic museum in Sydney,"" he happily boasts. An outside bet for Rio 2016? But if swimming development was a key aim of the IOC's decision to give Equatorial Guinea a wildcard at the Sydney Games, then the move can be seen as a roaring success. After the cameras left, Moussambani continued to swim. His last competition was the World Championships in Japan in 2002 and his times have steadily improved. And although he didn't make it to Athens four years later, nor Beijing, he is now the national swimming coach of Equatorial Guinea and hopes to still have one last shot at next Olympics in Rio in 2016 before he retires. ""My last time was 55 seconds, that was only last year,"" the 34-year-old explains hopefully. ""Right now I'm the coach of the country but I've asked my Olympic federation if I can swim at the next Olympics. ""I still have a dream. I want to show people that my times have improved, that we have swimming pools in my country now and that I can now swim a hundred meters.""","CNN talks to Eric Moussambani, better known as ""Eric the Eel""

"(CNN) -- What harm does it do? That's the challenge the casino industry puts to its critics. A new report by the Institute for American Values presents the answer. Until the late 1980s, casino gambling was illegal almost everywhere in the country. Today, casinos are allowed in 23 states. These newly authorized casinos are not Las Vegas-style grand hotels. Their customers come from nearby. They don't stay overnight. They don't watch a show or eat in a fine restaurant. Perhaps most surprisingly: they don't play cards. Modern casino gambling is computer gambling. The typical casino gambler sits at a computer screen, enters a credit card and enters a digital environment carefully constructed to keep them playing until all their available money has been extracted. Small ""wins"" are administered at the most psychologically effective intervals, but the math is remorseless: the longer you play, the more you lose. The industry as a whole targets precisely those who can least afford to lose and earns most of its living from people for whom gambling has become an addiction. The IAV report cites a Canadian study that finds that the 75% of casino customers who play only occasionally provide only 4% of casino revenues. It's the problem gambler who keeps the casino in business. Slot machine payouts vary state by state. Some states set a required minimum: 83% in Arkansas, for example. Others leave that decision up to the casino, as in Georgia and California. Some states require casinos to disclose their payouts. In others, that information is kept confidential. Based on what is published, however, it's a fair generalization that a player can expect to lose 10% to 15% of his or her stake at every session. The cheaper the game, the lower the payout: slots that charge $5 per round pay better than slots that charge a penny. When New Jersey allowed casinos into Atlantic City back in 1977, casino advocates promised that gambling would revive the town's fading economy. The casinos did create jobs as promised. But merchants who expected foot traffic to return to the city's main street, Atlantic Avenue, were sorely disappointed. The money that comes to the casinos, stays in the casinos. Liquor stores and cash-for-gold outlets now line the city's once-premier retail strip. The impact of casinos on local property values is ""unambiguously"" negative, according to the National Association of Realtors. Casinos do not revive local economies. They act as parasites upon them. Communities located within 10 miles of a casino exhibit double the rate of problem gambling. Unsurprisingly, such communities also suffer higher rates of home foreclosure and other forms of economic distress and domestic violence. The Institute for American Values is sometimes described as a socially conservative group, but with important caveats. Its president, David Blankenhorn, has publicly endorsed same-sex marriage, and its board of directors is chaired by Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton. The IAV is as worried that casinos aggravate income inequality as by their negative impact on family stability. Before the spread of casino gambling, the IAV comments, the typical gambler was more affluent than average: it cost money to travel to Las Vegas. That's no longer true. Low-income workers and retirees provide the bulk of the customers for the modern casino industry. And because that industry becomes an important source of government revenue, the decision to allow casino gambling is a decision to shift the cost of government from the richer to the poorer, and, within the poor, to a subset of vulnerable people with addiction problems. From the IAV study: . ""Modern slot machines are highly addictive because they get into people's heads as well as their wallets. They engineer the psychological experience of being in the 'zone' - a trance-like state that numbs feeling and blots out time/space. For some heavy players, the goals is not winning money. It's staying in the zone. To maintain this intensely desirable state, players prolong their time on the machine until they run out of money - a phenomenon that people in the industry call 'playing to extinction.'"" How heavily does gambling weigh upon the poor, the elderly, the less educated, and the psychologically vulnerable? It's difficult to answer exactly, because U.S. governments have shirked the job of studying the effects of gambling. Most research on the public health effects of gambling in the United States is funded by the industry itself, with a careful eye to exonerating itself from blame. To obtain independent results, the Institute for American Values was obliged, ironically, to rely on studies funded by governments in Britain and Canada. But here's what we can conclude, in the words of the Institute: . ""[S]tate-sponsored casino gambling ... parallels the separate and unequal life patterns in education, marriage, work, and play that increasingly divide America into haves and have-nots. Those in the upper ranks of the income distribution rarely, if ever, make it a weekly habit to gamble at the local casino. Those in the lower ranks of the income distribution often do. Those in the upper ranks rarely, if ever, contribute a large share of their income to the state's take of casino revenues. Those in the lower ranks do."" Is this really OK? Are Americans content to allow the growth of an industry that consciously exploits the predictable weakness of the most vulnerable people? 27 states still say ""no."" If yours is one such state, fight to keep it that way. If not, it's never too late to find a better way. Read the full Institute for American Values study for yourself and see how much is, quite literally, at sake. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says a new report makes clear the damage casinos do .
He says they extract earnings from Americans least able to afford it .

"(CNN) -- Babies are unpredictable, messy and constantly changing. Sleep-deprived parents struggling to make sense of their tiny humans' behaviors are starting to take a scientific approach, collecting data in the hopes of solving problems like not sleeping through the night. Ankle monitors are typically associated with criminals on house arrest, but the latest gadget for this generation of tech-saturated parents mimics the shackles of old -- in much friendlier colors. Sproutling's baby ankle monitor tracks vitals such as heart rate and body temperature, and can tell if a baby is moving or in a dangerous face-down sleeping position. The environmental sensor picks up on the humidity, noise levels and temperature of the baby's room. Best of all, it learns about each child's behaviors over time and adjusts accordingly. For example, it might deduce the optimal room temperature for sleeping based on a child's nap patterns and point out that lowering the temperature two degrees will help the baby sleep 20 minutes longer. Or if it senses elevated noise levels, it could warn parents that their child is going to wake up unless it's quieter. But are there are concerns about introducing yet another gadget into parenting. Children are already glued to their iPads, parents to their smartphones. Instead of relying on first-person observations or their own instincts, parents could use devices as a crutch. The promise of solving problems with enough data can also be misleading. For some babies, all the quantifying in the world won't make them sleep better. Knowing too much about an infant's status and vitals could put a naturally anxious parent at ease. Or having more information could inflame worries. Instead of sneaking in to make sure a baby is breathing, a father might spend the evening staring uneasily at an app, or compare his kid's measurements and behaviors to other children and wonder if it's normal. Parents should read aloud to infants every day, pediatricians say . To avoid overwhelming parents, Sproutling isn't handing over raw data about individual children. ""That detailed information in the hands of a parent without any context will actually create fear and anxiety,"" said Sproutling CEO Chris Bruce. ""On its own, data really is meaningless to people until they have the means to understand it."" While not ideal, physically attaching a device to a child is currently most efficent way to collect data. Sproutling's adjustable ankle bracelet is made from a soft fabric (which is machine washable), and the sensor, which charges wirelessly, is medical-grade silicon. The white charging dish doubles as the environmental sensor, and the mobile app serves up advice and warnings. Parents can pre-order the kit for $250 now and it will ship in March 2015. It's not the first wearable baby monitor on the market. Mimo makes a $200 onesie with a detachable monitor that also tracks heart rate, skin temperature, movement and sleeping positions. Owlet is another baby wearable still in production that straps to the ankle and sends text alerts. The most popular baby names are... Sproutling sets itself apart by returning insights instead of just data, and by looping in information about the surrounding environment like light and noise levels. It also uses machine learning to give tips, insight and advice based on data collected from a specific child. The team behind Sproutling has a lot of experience with design and integrating data with people's everyday lives. The company's early employees come from medical companies, Apple, Google and General Electric. Sproutling received $2.5 million in venture capital funding in 2013. Bruce is confident Sproutling's baby monitor will stand out when it's released. (He even tested the product on his kids). The company already has four more products in the pipeline to cover older kids and the rest of the family. Even so, he knows attaching a device to a baby isn't going to appeal to all parents. ""It's not for everybody. I think there's a lot of parents who will never put technology on their kids.""

"(RollingStone.com ) -- Country fans are dancing on the streets of Chicago... and crying into their Guinness glasses in Dublin. Garth Brooks confirms new album, world tour . The Windy City will be the first stop on Garth Brooks' world tour â€” his first in 13 years â€” as revealed Monday by a fan named Andy Roberts in Atlanta. The facility maintenance company owner announced the news on Twitter after a personal phone call from Brooks with the Chicago revelation. It seems Roberts was in the audience at one of the country superstar's Las Vegas concerts and asked during a Q-and-A portion of the show where the first tour stop will be. Brooks' answer was that he'd be the first to know and could do whatever he wanted with the information. As for the Chicago date and venue, the ""Good Ride Cowboy"" will announce that himself on Tuesday. RS: 100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time . This news comes on the heels of defeat in Ireland. After a last-ditch effort last week to save his five comeback shows at Dublin's Croke Park, Brooks found out today that negotiations with the city's government are officially over. ""The Irish council cannot change their earlier ruling to not allow the licenses for all five shows,"" he writes in a statement. ""To say I'm crushed is an understatement. All I see is my mother's face and I hear her voice. She always said things happen for a reason and for the right reason. As hard as I try, I cannot see the light on this one.""

"Editors Note: Harvard human trafficking fellow Siddharth Kara is undertaking a research trip around South Asia, looking at issues of forced labor, trafficking and child bondage. He will be getting access to the heart of the problem, and telling CNN.com readers what he has discovered every week over the next ten weeks. This is his first submission. New Delhi, India  -- After a long journey from Los Angeles, I have been in New Delhi for several days now easing into a full ten weeks that I will spend researching child labor, bonded labor, and human trafficking throughout South Asia. It is not the best time of year to be trudging through the rural reaches of the region, but as Indians love to say, ""What to do?"" At least the monsoons have arrived and temperatures have dropped a few degrees -- though the air is so moist it is hard to tell the difference between rainfall and humidity! It is hard to imagine that I first started my research into human trafficking and modern slavery more than ten years ago. While I had little idea what I was doing then, I have a far more efficient rhythm to my research now. I have taken eight research trips of greater than one month during the last decade, and many more quick hits here and there gathering data and learning how and why human trafficking and forced labor take place around the world. Of course, slave exploitation takes place everywhere -- in the middle of major cities and in the deepest rural reaches of the globe. I have seen more than my share of human cruelty -- from forced prostitution of minors to organ harvesting and everything in between. At the other end of the spectrum, I intend to explore child labor in fishing industries in parts of South Asia that require two day hikes to reach, but that does not stop the shrimp from ending up at your cocktail parties. Overall, this research trip is the first of three that I will take across the next twelve months, covering South Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with short jaunts to Europe and North America, all of which will allow me to complete my next two books on human trafficking and modern slavery. I am excited to contribute this blog to CNN.com during this first trip, and I hope it proves interesting to those who read it. In a way, we will be undertaking this trip together, as I share my latest learning's, triumphs, and frustrations each week. We will search out slave labor hand-in-hand, and we will interview those who have suffered intense cruelty in a region of the world that is home to more slaves than any other on Earth. There is much I am proud of as a man of Indian descent, but some have argued that India's record on protecting the weak, poor, and downtrodden is far from pride-worthy. I hope my approach to the issue of forced labor -- predicated on documenting the human pain of this exploitation while also understanding the business and economic forces that drive it -- will lead us to a more effective response. As I commence this trip in an extraordinary nation that simultaneously invokes the deepest love and frustration in me, I am reminded of the words of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, uttered in the nascent moments of freedom from the British Empire: . ""The future beckons to us... to bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease... and to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman."" This is the future that beckoned all of South Asia more than sixty years ago, on those first days of freedom from tyranny and exploitation. Yet this promise remains deeply elusive for hundreds of millions of poor who scrape by on one dollar per day in income, and even more so for the millions of slaves in this region, who remain oppressed by tyranny and bondage, praying each night to break free of exploitation and achieve the ""fullness of life,"" that is their human birthright.","Siddharth Kara begins 10 week journey into South Asia.

"(CNN) -- Scoobers, hammers and laying out - it's the ""ultimate"" flying saucer attack. And if Mark Poole is right, his sport could soon be coming to an Olympics near you. Poole is one of an estimated five million people who are taking to green spaces across the United States to play a game that is particularly booming at college level. But forget outdated notions of dogs scurrying after flying discs in the park, ultimate is a frenetic pursuit that blends aspects of football and rugby into a dynamic ""frisbee"" package. And Poole firmly believes a movement that began with the idle toss of a cake pan lid on a Santa Monica beach some 76 years ago is destined for a slot at the greatest sporting show on earth. ""I think that ultimate will become an Olympic sport,"" Poole, who plays for Atlanta-based team Chain Lightning, told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The sport has got better on the whole. There are more players that are picking it up in high school and in middle school, and the level of talent is continuing to get younger. ""So we have young kids who are coming out and being stars at the highest level because they're starting so early. ""There's a bunch of amateurs already doing it, and I think it's an international sport, so we can easily play against other teams and we're already doing it -- it's just being part of the Olympics."" According to the USA Ultimate website, membership of college clubs has doubled in the past 10 years, while participation internationally is also growing. More than 42 countries play the game, with teams from Japan, Sweden, Great Britain and Australia also thriving. But how do you play it? Ultimate is contested between two teams, each consisting of seven players. The aim is to pass your way into the opposition's end zone, just like in American Football, but once in possession players aren't allowed to run with the disc. The concept was born in California back in the late 1930s when a teenage Fred Morrison and his girlfriend started throwing a popcorn lid back and forth on the beach. Through various incarnations this led to Morrison manufacturing his own plastic discs, which were then bought in the 1950s and patented as ""Frisbees"" by the Wham-O company. Millions were sold worldwide and by the 1970s the origins of Ultimate had been born. Poole and his Chain Lightning gang are chief exponents of the sport, winning the USA national championships in 2009. The 29-year-old was also selected in the U.S. ultimate beach team back in 2011, his proudest achievement in the game to date. Players are constantly harrying round the field of play creating space, executing a variety of throws -- including the ""hammer"" and the ""scoober"" -- and flinging themselves around attempting to catch the disc. Poole says any budding players must be equipped with the three pillars of ultimate: to run hard, jump high and throw far. But while the game moves at a fast pace, respect is a key component, because ultimate is ultimately self-policed. ""Competition is great, but you want to have good spirit,"" Poole explained. ""I am a proponent of it. I think it's great. ""We don't have any referees in the game, and so people have to make calls against each other and they have to be respectful. We do have observers, though, and they've been very helpful I think. ""They help speed up the game, they keep the clock between points, they keep discussions between two players to a minimum. They let you discuss what you saw, what the other player saw, but then they'll try to come to an agreement or a decision quicker than if they weren't there. ""I think there are still bad calls made -- sometimes observers miss calls just like referees, and they're human. I mean, we're all human, we're going to make the wrong call sometimes, but I think on the whole they have a very positive effect on the game."" If the sport can be classified as quirky, so can some of the names of the teams who compete in the Triple Crown tour alongside Poole's Lightning. Furious George, Neon Yellow Panda Dragons (NYPD), Seattle Sockeye and Revolver are just some of the clubs involved. Poole has friends from various teams and says that even though they are spread far and wide, the overriding theme of the league is community. ""I love ultimate because of the players, the people that are involved with it -- they're just very inviting, very welcoming,"" he said. ""I think that's the best part of ultimate. ""It's a situation where you can play competitively and then go out for a drink, go out for food afterwards, even though you're playing against those players you can still be friends off the field."" It might only be a small disc weighing just 175 grams but there are many ways to manipulate it around the playing field. As Poole explains, the two most common throws are backhand and forehand, just like in tennis, and the best players complete pinpoint passes with a simple flick of the wrist. The more complicated maneuvers include the hammer, an overhead throw that travels far faster than either the forehand or backhand, used to quickly switch play from one side of the field to the other. Then there's the scoober, a short flick used to loop the disc over a defender, typically no more than 15 or 20 yards. But despite the variations of throw, Poole's favorite aspect of the game is attempting to catch. ""My favorite thing to do is lay out,"" he said. ""I dive for the disc, leave my feet and catch the disc as it's going to the ground. ""It means that I can't run it out, I need to extend as far as possible to catch the disc. The disc is the most important thing in ultimate. ""You have to maintain possession, so laying out if you have to do it, you've got to do it."" Ultimate now has two pro leagues in the United States and interest is growing, but for now the Chain and their players are doing it purely for the love of the game. As Poole says with a smile: ""I make zero dollars playing ultimate, but I spend way more than that.""","'Ultimate' is a largely recreational sport that is growing in popularity .

"(CNN) -- MasterCard built a 15-year advertising campaign around the idea that the best things in life are ""priceless."" Much as I hate to give ad execs their due, these folks got it right. Today, we live in an era when what's truly valuable is the intangible. A quarter century ago, 80 percent of the cost of value of a computer was in the tangible hardware. Today, in a time when ""knowledge workers"" predominate, the opposite is true -- 80 percent of the value of a personal computer is in the software. The most neglected fact in business is that we're all human. Ask CEOs about what's the competitive advantage they have in their industry, and they'll tell you it's their corporate culture, their customer loyalty, their brand reputation or their ability to innovate and create intellectual property. None of these assets appears on a balance sheet. The balance sheet -- a 400-year-old relic -- doesn't truly capture the value of the hearts and minds that define what makes a sustainable, successful company today. Learn more about Chip Conley at TED.com . Look at Apple, the most admired company in America (according to a Fortune survey), and analysts tell us that 80 percent of Apple's value appears off its balance sheet in intangibles that our 20th century version of leadership can't even fathom or calculate. I went to Stanford Business School in the early 1980s, and I was taught to ""manage what I could measure."" And I was also taught in kindergarten how to count. Maybe as adults, it's time for us to reconsider what to count. As a founder and CEO of a company for two dozen years, I know how to count profitability and cash flow. These are the lifeblood of any business, especially in hard economic times. But here's the reality that most CEOs aren't talking about: Profitability is a lagging indicator of success, at least in the long-term. Three Harvard Business School professors three decades ago proved that a ""service profit chain"" exists such that a great corporate culture (an intangible) creates employee engagement (an intangible) that leads to customer loyalty (an intangible) that ultimately creates a profitable and sustainable business (a tangible). Leadership in the 21st century is all about learning how to measure and value the intangibles in our lives since this is truly where value is created. Are you focused on the intangible inputs in your life or company, or are you purely focused on the tangible outputs? As I suggested in my talk at TED2010, it was a question about ""what counts in life and business"" that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks, to Bhutan. The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man, but this was back in 1972, when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away. At 17, he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. On a trip through India, early in his reign as king, he was asked by an Indian journalist about the size of the Bhutanese Gross Domestic Product (GDP). And the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. He said the following: He said, ""Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? Why don't we care more about gross national happiness?"" Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success, what has come to be known as GNH, or gross national happiness. Most world leaders didn't take notice, and those that did thought this was just ""Buddhist economics."" But the king was serious. This was a notable moment, because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that the intangible of happiness is something we should measure, and it's something we should actually value in government. For more on happiness and how we experience it, watch this talk . For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. Bhutan is the newest democracy in the world. So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement, I got to understand what they're doing. And I got to spend some time with the prime minister. Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question: ""How can you create and measure something which evaporates, in other words, happiness?"" And he's a very wise man, and he said, ""Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness. We create the conditions for happiness to occur. In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."" And he said that they have a science behind that art. They've created four essential pillars, nine key indicators and 72 metrics that help to measure their GNH. In fact, one of those key indicators is: How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day? It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day? Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world. And yet, of course, that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. What's true for a nation is also true for a company. My boutique hotel company makes a practice of counting intangibles in evaluating how the business is progressing. It recently sold a majority share to a well-regarded player in the hospitality business (Geolo Capital, the private equity investment arm of the John A. Pritzker family), which made the investment because of our intangibles. I understand a company is a magnet for people -- whether they be employees, customers or investors -- and that a reputation lasts a lifetime and a company's reputation can last more than a human lifetime. Admired firms such as Apple, Harley-Davidson, Whole Foods Markets, Southwest Airlines and Google have created the kind of intangible-driven companies that are helping to transform the world. At the end of the day, it's all about human needs. The best business executives in the world are those who truly understand psychology and the nature of that complex beast that's at the heart of all business transactions: you and me. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chip Conley.","Chip Conley: Key factors in making business successful are intangibles .

"(CNN) -- Mark Sanford is another step closer to political redemption, but the real headline out of his Tuesday victory in a Republican primary runoff for his old congressional seat was a rare public appearance by his former mistress -- who's now his fiancée. And while the former South Carolina governor is considered the favorite in next month's general election showdown with Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, his past infidelity remains front and center in the race and could continue to hurt him with crucial female voters. Democrats wasted no time in attacking Sanford over the affair. ""This is the same Mark Sanford who, as governor, disappeared from office and used taxpayer money to visit his mistress. With all the issues we are working on, we do not need him in Congress,"" wrote Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in a fundraising e-mail for Colbert Busch sent in the hours after Sanford's victory. ""Fortunately, there is a strong independent woman running to give us a better alternative named Elizabeth Colbert Busch."" Sanford addressed his ""incredibly long journey"" at his victory celebration over former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic. ""In that journey, I am humbled."" He added that while God forgives, ""sometimes the voters aren't so forgiving."" Sanford thanked supporters, family, and his fiancée, Maria Belen Chapur of Argentina. The former governor said Wednesday on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that he was surprised by her appearance at the victory celebration. ""She completely surprised me,"" Sanford told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. ""It was an awfully, awfully nice surprise."" Sanford wins GOP nomination for House seat . ""I didn't know she was coming, but I'm excited to see her,"" he said. The affair came to light in 2009, after Sanford disappeared from public view for several days and re-emerged, claiming he'd been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing his lover. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and then-wife Jenny were divorced in 2010 and he finished his second term as governor in January 2011, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity. Sanford is touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for Congress, but he's also asking the public for a second chance, telling CNN that he was seeking ""redemption"" by running for office again. He came in first in a 16-candidate primary two weeks ago, but only with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. He topped Bostic in Tuesday's runoff by a 57%-43% margin. Bostic appeared to try to make infidelity a key issue in the runoff campaign. ""Trust is a crucial issue. In fact, it has become a crucial issue in this race,"" the candidate said at a debate with Sanford last week. Bostic added that the former governor was a ""compromised candidate"" because of the affair. Now Sanford faces off May 7 with Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility. She is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily Republican. The 1st District has been in GOP hands for more than three decades. Rep. Tim Scott won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last November's election. But when Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation, GOP Gov. Nikki Haley named Scott to fill the seat, triggering the special election to fill the seat that Sanford held for three terms before becoming governor. Mark Sanford: Shamed politician fights for comeback . Colbert Busch's famous brother has campaigned on his sister's behalf. ""She's my sister, and I'm willing to, you know, break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her,"" Colbert told Jake Tapper, CNN's chief Washington correspondent and anchor of CNN's ""The Lead."" Colbert will team up again with his sister for fundraisers later this month in the nation's capital and in New York. But Democrats are focusing on Sanford's affair. ""The families of this district need a representative who they can trust,"" Colbert Busch campaign spokesman James Smith said Tuesday night. ""Mark Sanford simply has the wrong values for our community. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee press secretary Emily Bittner tried to put Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a senior House Republican, on the spot. ""Even Republicans acknowledge that Congressman Sanford's behavior was a disgrace and that he betrayed the public trust, so will Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers support Mark Sanford in his quest to return to Washington?"" Sanford disagrees, saying his runoff victory shows he doesn't have a problem with female voters, at least those in his party. There were a lot of Republican conservative women that voted last night. And what they did was decided to send me in as the Republican standard-bearer in this congressional seat,"" Sanford told Tapper. But some South Carolina Republicans disagree, saying that the female vote could be an issue for Sanford. ""Surveys show Sanford has a problem with women, and some may never forgive him,"" said Republican strategist Bruce Haynes, a partner in the consulting firm Purple Strategies. ""Acknowledgment of perceptions is the first step in rebuilding any reputation, and his choice to bring his fianceé forward is smart."" ""His past and his present relationship with her is an unavoidable issue in this race. It's best that he acknowledge it, deal with it on his terms rather than let others define it for him. Otherwise, silence is hiding, and hiding is guilt, and guilt is losing,"" added Haynes, who served as chief of staff for former Republican Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina, and as a staff member for former GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell. Haynes thinks Sanford can win a race that focuses on policy, but says a race on personality will be much harder to win. Republican strategist Hogan Gidley, who served as executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, agreed. ""It's going to be virtually impossible for Mark Sanford to attack Colbert Busch,"" said Gidley, who worked for Sanford rival state Sen. Larry Grooms in the primary. ""It's extremely tricky political territory for several reasons: One, Sanford can't effectively execute an apology tour and consistently be on the attack; two, any political attack on Colbert Busch would be used against Sanford and the party as proof of a perceived 'war on women;' three, we have a huge problem right now with the women vote -- so any candidate perceived to be one who disregards women -- is going to face issues getting votes."" But the geography of the district may be in Sanford's favor. ""The new 1st District is a coastal area, so it's generally the most socially liberal of South Carolina's GOP-held districts,"" Haynes said. ""This is because coastal communities are historically more diverse and concerned about issues like the environment that carry less importance inland.""","Disgraced former Gov.

"(CNN) -- The Islamist terror group Boko Haram kidnapped at least 97 men and boys and killed 28 people this week in a raid on villages in Borno State in northeast Nigeria, a local leader and residents said Friday. Boko Haram gunmen also injured 25 others during the raid in which scores of homes were burned, the sources said. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . The gunmen raided the farming and fishing village of Doron Baga and surrounding villages on the shores of Lake Chad, about 110 miles north of the state capital, Maiduguri. The raid and kidnappings occurred on Monday, but the news did not emerge sooner due to lack of communication and because cell phone towers were destroyed in previous Boko Haram attacks. Boko Haram has been active as a violent group since 2009 and has killed Nigerians, both Christian and Muslim, at rates frequently exceeding 100 people weekly. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. In late July, suspected Boko Haram gunmen abducted the wife of Cameroon's deputy prime minister in a dawn attack on his home village of Kolofata, north of the area where they also kidnapped a local chief and his family, residents and security sources said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Growing up, Austin Chapman was mystified by people's reaction to music. He would poke fun at those around him who abandoned their composure to sing their favorite song or twirl around a dance floor. When someone wept at the tune of a ballad, he was bewildered. To him, music sounded ""like trash."" Until this summer, Chapman, a 23-year-old filmmaker, was able to hear only a distorted version of music in the form of bass and mid-tones through his old hearing aids. When he was just 9 months old, his parents learned that he was born ""profoundly deaf,"" and he was immediately fitted with his first listening device. It helped, but he was unable to hear anything clearly. Until now. It was nearly midnight July 6 when he was able to hear his first song in its entirety: Mozart's ""Lacrimosa."" Fitted with a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years, Chapman was sitting in a car with his close friends and remembers the moment vividly: ""I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing, and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face, and I tried to hide it. But when I looked over, I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car."" Chapman just acquired the newest technology in hearing aids because his health coverage under his parents' insurance plan was about to expire. He had been skeptical and reluctant to update his devices, but his parents urged him to investigate any improvements in the technology. ""I decided to give it a shot because a lot can happen in four years. It was one of the best decisions of my life,"" Chapman said. ""I can hear much higher tones than before. It is also much louder and clearer. I actually have to keep my hearing aids at about 70% power-volume most of the time."" Now Chapman is blogging about his experience on his film website, ArtoftheStory.com, and on the social news site Reddit in a post entitled ""I can hear music for the first time ever, what should I listen to?"" More than 14,000 responses came, with people sharing their favorite songs and recommending all kinds of melodies for Chapman to experience for the first time. Some readers posted links to YouTube videos of their favorite tunes. Others provided long lists of tracks and artists. And some just left messages letting him know they were touched or inspired by his story. ""I am blown away by all the feedback,"" Chapman said. ""I'm currently organizing the most popular comments and suggestions and will be posting them soon."" Among them: ""Three Little Birds"" by Bob Marley, ""Paranoid Android"" by Radiohead and ""Brain Damage"" by Pink Floyd, some of his current top songs. Chapman's favorite songs . The most-suggested track was ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen, which he described as a masterpiece. ""I was nervous that the hype would ruin it for me,"" Chapman said of the 1975 hit. ""I was wrong."" Chapman, who studied creative writing and film at Pepperdine University, is a lifelong movie buff who even learned how to lip-read by matching up actors' lips with the subtitles. Being able to add music to his arsenal as a filmmaker is the most exciting part of the discovery, he said. He even started working with a composer on a short he shot several months ago. ""It's ironic, because when I shot this short, I never in a million years thought I would be able to work on the soundtrack. Now, a few months later, I'm sitting next to my friends, layering different tracks,"" Chapman said. Now, when he sees someone singing along or dancing to the rhythm of a beat, he smiles in sympathy. ""I understand how it could have such an impact on the listener,"" he said. But on his personal blog, he pointed out that he still enjoys the absence of sound. ""When I turn my aids off, my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful,"" he wrote. ""I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence.""

"(CNN) -- While the Zintan militia leads the battle for control of Tripoli's airport, another set of militia and radicalized Islamist insurgents in the east are threatening a fragile Libya. The increasingly unstable political and social climate in the country is indicative of a weak and ineffective government that is failing to answer internal security concerns as well as the basic aspirations of its citizens. For these reasons primarily do the Zintan militia and renegade General Khalifa Haftar feel they have a mark to make in the security and political vacuum left by a corrupt and inept national government. While politicians in the highest echelons continue to siphon the country's oil wealth, the armed militias in response are taking over oil terminals in the east, including Marsa al Hariga. Haftar, a Libyan exile since 1987, returned to his home city of Benghazi from the United States, and was frequently seen in the city's old courthouse, the headquarters of the revolution in the east. Along with the former NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil, Haftar directed and advised in the crucial months of the revolution. As a retired General, many Libyans are unsure of the longer-term motives and personal ambitions of a man who once attempted to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi. It is no small irony that Haftar, like the rebel militias that are still fighting for control of strategic bases in the country, is directly contributing to the instability of the country and undermining what little authority the government possesses. From Sirte to Tobruk, and down to the border with Chad, there is no effective government influence. While elders in Benghazi want to negotiate with the Islamist fundamentalists, Haftar will not. His imposed policy is for these insurgents to surrender or be killed. Recently, a car bomb was detonated outside Haftar's house, killing and injuring many. Like the brutal murder of Salwa Bugaighis on June 25, 2014, it is a further sign of the dangerous pitch of instability that the country has reached. Ordinary Libyans are now owning and bringing guns into their homes. Friends in Libya tell me the feeling of insecurity has permeated every household and shows no signs of abating. Meanwhile, the government is continuing to fail to live up to its promises and has not provided security or jobs to ordinary citizens. At the same time, the quest for a secular society also continues, albeit whilst people purchase guns for their households and politicians steal the country's revenues. The United States, Britain and Europe cannot afford Libya to become a failed state like Somalia. The division of Libya into east and west is not a viable option and is not in the long-term interests of Libyans or wider regional security. This debate does however highlight the old argument that the majority of the country's oil revenues still continue to go to Tripoli and surrounding areas. Libya can be pulled back from the brink, but, the West must not leave Libya to its own (current) inept devices. The government and the military need continued specialist training, advice and resources to fight the Islamist insurgents and the disparate rebel militias across the country, and to face the new security threats coming from the south and the Middle East. This process has already begun, with the United States' capture of the leader of the attack on the American Embassy in Benghazi in September 2012, which killed Ambassador Stevens. The international community also needs to put pressure on the Libyan government to weed out endemic corruption. The Libyan leadership need to maintain democratic credibility, unlike the last prime ministerial run that necessitated the intervention of the Supreme Court to rule the appointment of Ahmed Mitig as Prime Minister as illegal, to order that a new election be held, this time with a full Parliament in session. The struggle to tackle armed groups in Libya continues, and it simply cannot be left to one renegade general to remove Islamic insurgents and keep armed militia groups in check. The views expressed in this commentary are soley those of Sara ElGaddart.","Libya's instability is indicative of an ineffective government, says Sara ElGaddari .

"(CNN) -- Before this week, the last time the Chicago Teachers Union went on strike was September 8, 1987. It lasted until October 3, during which officials, teachers and parents clashed in the city's longest teachers strike ever. After it ended, I called the Chicago school system the worst in the country. ""I'm not sure there's a system as bad as the Chicago system"" were my exact words as U.S. secretary of education. The Chicago school system was a failure. Half of Chicago's 64 public high schools scored in the bottom 1% of schools on the ACT, an old metric used by many colleges for admissions. ''Forty-six percent of Chicago teachers send their children to private schools,'' I noted then, too. ''The people who know the product best send their children elsewhere.'' In spite of this, the teachers union had the gall to demand a 10% raise with a 5% raise to follow the next year. After a month of jawing, they eventually wrangled a 4% raise the first year, with the second year determined by funding from elsewhere. Twenty-five years later, and in the midst of another teachers strike, it doesn't look like much has improved in Chicago. Today, the 26,000 members of the Chicago Teachers Union are on strike because they can't accept a 16% raise over four years, tougher testing and accountability standards, and non-automatic rehiring. Once again, the Chicago Teachers Union is showing its true colors: self-serving public sector bullies more interested in their well-being than the well-being of students. Consider that public school teachers in Chicago make an average of $71,000 a year, while a majority of the roughly 350,000 public school students, overwhelmingly minority students, receive free or discounted school meals, meaning they are at or near the poverty line. What do these well-paid teachers bestow on the poor children and families of Chicago? Nearly 80% of eighth-graders in Chicago public schools are not proficient in reading or math, according to the U.S. Department of Education. In fact, little has improved in Chicago since the 1987 strike. Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times points out that ""In 1987, 43% of incoming Chicago freshmen would drop out of high school without graduating. Today's drop-out rate is 39.4%, the lowest it has ever been."" A dropout rate of nearly four students in 10 is a national disgrace. For 25 years, Chicago's teachers' unions have held the city's parents and students hostage while morally and financially bankrupting the city. Chicago public schools are $665 million in debt, and that debt is expected to exceed $1 billion next year. For 25 years, the union has blocked and impeded educational progress. The time for change is long overdue. For decades, conservative education reformers like myself have been pushing for performance pay, strict accountability, flexible rehiring practices for school principals and longer school days to improve our public schools. Now, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, through the Race to the Top grant requirements, are trying to implement similar measures in Chicago's public schools. Duncan, whom I sometimes agree with, and Emanuel, whom I almost never agree with, both seem to be taking the traditionally conservative side of this issue. We have in Chicago a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. Will Emanuel and Duncan succeed in curtailing the long-term ally and bulwark of the Democratic Party, the teachers union, or will the Chicago Teachers Union and its leader, Karen Lewis, once again strong-arm their own party for their own interests? A teacher's view from the picket lines . President Obama has been noticeably silent. He shouldn't be. The nation deserves to know whether his allegiances lie with his political allies in the public sector unions or with Emanuel and Duncan. This power struggle will reveal much about the constitution of the modern Democratic Party. If Emanuel wins, the effects would be felt throughout the large, predominantly Democratic inner-city school districts across the country. For one of the first times in recent history, Democrats would stand up to their own entrenched inner-city public sector teachers unions. Should Emanuel lose, teachers unions will grow only stronger and more brazen, and the city of Chicago and its children and families may be set back for another 25 years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: Chicago teachers last went on strike in 1987, and schools were a mess .

"(CNN) -- Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who is accused of trying to detonate an explosive on an international flight into Michigan on Christmas Day last year, was not radicalized while he was a college student, according to a report released Friday. The study was conducted by a panel set up by the University College London (UCL), where AbdulMutallab was enrolled in the mechanical engineering department between September 2005 and June 2008. But, said the school, the review was done by an independent panel. ""The inquiry panel has found no evidence to suggest that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was radicalised while at UCL,"" the report said. ""There is evidence that UCL was, well in advance of the Christmas Day 2009 incident, taking steps to strengthen its student support processes."" The report, however, recommended that the school better monitor invitations to visiting speakers, scrutinize student events, and consider whether there is a need for training staff so they can better deal with students who are cause for concern. A former friend of Abdulmutallab told CNN in December that the Nigerian national became more devout about his Muslim faith while attending the university in London. ""In London he isolated himself from some of his former friends,"" Kwesi Brako told CNN. ""He became much more serious about his religion."" Brako, a Christian, was in the same year as AbdulMutallab at the English boarding school they attended in the western African nation of Togo and said they were close friends. In the fall of 2005, he moved to England at the same time as AbdulMutallab to start university. But the two friends, who attended different schools, lost touch while in London. AbdulMutallab became increasingly involved in the Islamic Society of UCL -- one of Britain's premier universities -- quickly becoming its vice president and threw all his energies into this new role, Brako said. Brako kept up with AbdulMutallab through mutual friends in the British capital. In June 2006, AbdulMutallab became president of the UCL Islamic Society, CNN learned. ""He started wearing traditional Muslim robes with trousers rolled up around the ankles,"" said Brako, ""Even in the winter he wore sandals."" In Britain, this style of dress is often associated with Muslims espousing a hardline-fundamentalist form of Islam. At high school in Togo, Brako recalls that AbdulMutallab usually wore jeans and a T-shirt. The Nigerian is the fourth president of a London Islamic Society to face terrorist charges in three years. One of them is awaiting retrial, having escaped conviction for involvement in the 2006 liquid bomb plot to blow up airliners bound for the U.S., a precursor to the Christmas plot. AbdulMutallab is accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a plane from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on December 25, 2009. He faces six federal charges, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and willful attempt to destroy an aircraft. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of trying to blow up the Northwest Airlines plane. During a hearing in September, he asked the judge: ""If I want to plead guilty to some counts, basically, how would that go?"" He also said he wanted to represent himself. The next court date in AbdulMutallab's case is expected later this month.","AbdulMutallab attended University College London between September 2005 and June 2008 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein called Wednesday for President Obama to reverse a policy established last year that kept the suspect in the Christmas Day botched jetliner bombing from having been placed on a no-fly list. The failed bombing ""is a reminder that attempts to attack the U.S. homeland continue and that al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups are searching for new ways to use explosive devices and operatives that will not arouse suspicion in order to carry out attacks in this country,"" the California Democrat wrote Wednesday in a letter to the president posted on her Web site. ""We must therefore adjust to meet these developments and stay ahead of them."" The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said that the U.S. government was warned about the radicalization of suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, of Nigeria, more than a month before he flew from Nigeria to the Netherlands and then to Detroit, Michigan. ""Yet apparently no action was taken other than to put Mr. AbdulMutallab in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment. He was not placed on a No-Fly or Selectee List for additional scrutiny and screening, nor was action taken to revoke his visa,"" Feinstein said. A U.S. government official said the United States had intelligence more than a month before the attack -- between August and October -- that extremists in Yemen were discussing operations; that someone known as ""the Nigerian"" was mentioned; and that U.S. intelligence had a partial name, Umar Farouk. Federal authorities have charged AbdulMutallab with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach to Detroit. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at his seat. Feinstein said she understood that AbdulMutallab wasn't put on a no-fly list because of a policy established last year during the administration of George W. Bush, ""that limits the circumstances under which the government adds an individual to the watch list."" She called the standard ""too restrictive"" and urged that it be changed. ""The U.S. Government should watchlist, and deny visas, to anyone who is reasonably believed to be affiliated with, part of, or acting on behalf of a terrorist organization,"" she said. A U.S. counterterrorism official who asked not to be identified said the change to which Feinstein was referring was ""designed to provide a clear, government-wide standard"" for putting an individual on a terrorist watch list. Before the change, law enforcement, intelligence and homeland security agencies and departments involved with the list ""applied moderately different standards,"" the official said. The 2008 change ""made it a universal standard."" But the official said the change did not make it more difficult to get a name on the watch list and represented the collective thinking of the nation's intelligence agencies. It was not clear who had sought the change, said the official, who would not comment on Feinstein's letter. On December 9, Timothy Healy, director of the Terrorist Screening Center at the FBI, submitted testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee explaining the policy: . ""TSC accepts nominations into the Terrorist Watchlist when they satisfy two requirements,"" he said. ""First, the biographic information associated with a nomination must contain sufficient identifying data so that a person being screened can be matched to or disassociated from a watchlisted terrorist. ""Second, the facts and circumstances pertaining to the nomination must meet the 'reasonable suspicion' standard of review established by terrorist screening presidential directives. Reasonable suspicion requires 'articulable' facts which, taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities, and is based on the totality of the circumstances. ""Due weight must be given to the reasonable inferences that a person can draw from the facts. Mere guesses or inarticulate 'hunches' are not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion."" The recommendation came as the administration briefed congressional staffers in private meetings on the matter. But several who attended told CNN Correspondent Candy Crowley that they learned little. Congressional hearings are slated for next month. Complaints also emerged Wednesday over how federal authorities handled the matter once it had occurred on Christmas Day. The Department of Homeland Security alerted 128 flights that were then en route to the United States from Europe and told them to take security precautions, CNN's Jeanne Meserve reported. But more than 3,000 other flights that were in the air at that point were not alerted, which drew criticism from some who asked why the department had concluded that they, too, were not at risk. Though it was not clear whether al Qaeda was involved in the failed Christmas Day attack, the terrorist organization's hallmark is to launch nearly simultaneous attacks, as occurred during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under the Bush administration, urged caution in apportioning blame. ""I don't think we have the full picture,"" he told CNN. ""I don't want to rush to judgment."" He said security officials cannot count on perfection and therefore have created a layered security strategy ""so that even if one fails, another one gets picked up."" Chertoff, who works as a security consultant for companies that make screening devices that can identify explosives hidden under clothing, urged that such machines be deployed more widely. The devices are opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union and privacy advocates. And, noting that British authorities revoked AbdulMutallab's visa this year but did not inform their U.S. counterparts, Chertoff urged that information-sharing between countries be made more open. ""We've got to go back to the European Union and fight this fight all over again and tell them that their exalting privacy over security could very well have resulted in tragedy for Europeans as well as Americans,"" he said. CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Sen. Feinstein: Failed December 25 airline attack shows U.S. must adapt .

"(CNN) -- We are now five days away from the attempted terrorist attack to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, Michigan. We are learning more each day about the multiple failures in our security and intelligence system that preceded that attack. It is worth discussing the most egregious thus far and the way forward to building a better system. The facts suggest that an al Qaeda plot was hatched in Yemen and involved the same radical cleric who communicated with the man accused in the Fort Hood shootings before the deaths of 13 U.S. soldiers. And the attempt to blow up a U.S. plane on Christmas Day used a bomb technique similar to the one to that was used in August to try to assassinate the chief of Saudi Arabia's counterterror police. Having survived this assassination attempt, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef flew to Washington, where he personally briefed U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and national security officials both about the assassination attempt and on his concerns about the growing terrorism problem in Yemen. The CIA passed some information about Flight 253 suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to the federal interagency channel, but they appear not to have passed along all the relevant information that they may have possessed. The National Counterterrorism Center, which was created post-9/11 to ""connect the dots,"" failed to do that and to ask the intelligence community for additional dots. Furthermore, we understand that there was an intercept of Yemeni cleric Anwar Al Aulaqi advocating al Qaeda's use of Nigerians as operatives, but this was never put together with the information about AbdulMutallab. Al Aulaqi is the radical cleric who was in contact with suspect Nidal Hasan before the November 5 shooting of 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood, but it appears that no one connected those dots either. Our British allies revoked AbdulMutallab's British visa for fraud because he lied on his visa application, but they did not inform the U.S. because it was, in their judgment, not related to a national security issue. As President Obama said, there are both systemic and individual failures here. The president is understandably frustrated and under pressure to act. AbdulMutallab should not have been able to get high explosives on a plane, the watch list system should have prevented him from boarding the plane at all, and the U.S. intelligence community writ large should have been able to collect, analyze and disseminate critical intelligence. We will never encourage the risk-taking and creativity necessary to fix these problems if we indulge in the usual Washington bloodsport of the blame game. I have conducted more than my share of reviews, from the Silberman-Robb WMD Commission recommendations to the Katrina lessons learned. Obama needs people outside those directly responsible to look at what happened and provide him with an objective view. He now has the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (of which I was formerly a member), which can undertake such a review. It has been more than eight years since the tragedy of September 11. While we all wish we could forget the pain of that tragedy, our enemies relish remembering it and planning for what they hope will be their next success. We need to confront the growing sense of complacency in the bureaucracy and among the American people. We can only prevent a repeated success for the terrorists if the American people get the facts and the solutions to fix the problems that this incident has brought to light. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frances Townsend.","Former National Security Adviser Frances Townsend: It's crucial to review what went wrong .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is poised to make his case to the country on the next steps for tackling the threat posed by ISIS. Certainly, ISIS' advances this summer -- including the seizure of territories in Iraq and Syria, declaration of a new ""caliphate,"" and its killings of thousands in Iraq and Syria, including two American journalists -- have been a wake-up call. What should the President keep in mind as he prepares to deliver his speech Wednesday? Here are five key questions he should answer in his speech and as he follows up in the coming weeks: . What metrics will the United States use to gauge the success of airstrikes in Iraq and possible additional strikes in Syria? Since early August, the United States has conducted targeted airstrikes inside Iraqi territory -- all with the aims of deterring further advances by ISIS, protecting U.S. personnel in Iraq, preventing instances of genocide and preventing ISIS' control of key assets, including dams. In recent days, the United States has widened the geographic areas where it has conducted strikes in Iraq. With some steps forward on forming a new Iraqi government in Baghdad, the United States may be positioned to conduct even more strikes inside Iraq, because the Obama administration has made the formation of a more inclusive government a condition for additional security assistance. Furthermore, the Obama administration is reportedly contemplating strikes inside Syrian territory -- where al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front, as well as ISIS, poses a threat to regional stability. At some point soon, the United States needs to develop a clearly defined set of objectives linked to the ongoing and possible additional airstrikes to allow it to measure the impact of its strikes. How will President Obama manage the international and regional coalitions he seeks to build against ISIS? During the past week, the Obama administration has talked a lot about the need to build a broad international and regional coalition against ISIS. It took some steps at the NATO summit. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel went to Turkey this week to talk next steps, and Secretary of State John Kerry is in the Middle East trying to build a regional coalition. These ministerial-level meetings are important to set a framework, but if the Obama administration is serious about building a coalition, it will need multiple levels of coordination and engagement with partners beneath the level of the secretaries of state and defense. It needs to be an intense, ongoing effort. As we've seen in places like Libya recently, coalitions wrought with major internal divisions tend to fall apart -- with sometimes disastrous results -- as outlined in a recent report. There isn't just a Shia-Sunni divide between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but also a new Arab Cold War between leading Sunni states in the region. What are the contingency plans if Iraq does not make additional progress in forming an inclusive, cross-sectarian response to ISIS? Iraq's leaders took an important step this week in forming a more inclusive government, but this government still lacks leaders for two key security ministries: defense and interior. And even if the government formation process is completed soon, it may be unclear for years whether the government in Baghdad will rule inclusively and accommodate the interests of the country's Sunni minority and the Kurds, who have increased their autonomy in recent months. U.S. policy is wisely conditioned on trying to use the leverage of U.S. assistance to Iraq as an incentive to bring Iraq's diverse political factions together, but there is always the possibility that this might come apart. Incidents like the massacre of Sunnis last month by Shia militias could happen at any moment, and the question for U.S. policymakers is what the fallback plan should be if Iraq's leaders do not bring together a cohesive government. What is the new plan for supporting Syria's third way opposition forces to counter ISIS and the al-Assad regime? It looks like President Obama is poised to redouble U.S. efforts to support Syrian opposition forces fighting ISIS, the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as well as the al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front. Obama proposed an additional $500 million of assistance in June, and any strategy to deal with ISIS in Syria is going to need some forces on the ground willing to work as part of an expanded campaign there. The key question the administration will need to answer is whether it has learned from the past few years of failed efforts to strengthen the Syrian opposition; multiple actors in the region have offered many forms of assistance to different factions of the Syrian opposition, and yet it is today weak and beleaguered. Additional money and weapons might help, but could also be squandered without a broader coordination strategy. How can the international and regional coalition more effectively address the massive humanitarian crisis in Syria, Iraq and neighboring countries? An estimated 3 million Syrians are now refugees in neighboring countries, and an additional 6.5 million are displaced inside Syria. Inside of Iraq, millions have been displaced by the multiple waves of conflict inside the country, including the most recent conflict in northern Iraq with ISIS. Additional military actions by actors in the region and possible expanded U.S. strikes would have an impact on this already disastrous humanitarian situation. President Obama appears ready to engage in a more expansive strategy to deal with the problem posed by ISIS, and his speech will try to outline the multifaceted nature of his approach. But as we have learned from other speeches by President Obama, the key test will come in how well his administration actually follows up on the implementation of its stated policy.

"(CNN) -- Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was seconds away from landing when the passengers sensed something horribly amiss. The plane was approaching San Francisco International Airport under a beautifully clear sky, but it was flying low. Dangerously low. Benjamin Levy looked out the window from seat 30K and said he could see the water of the San Francisco Bay about 10 feet below. Even for an airport where landing strips run close to the water, the descent seemed alarming to the San Francisco man. ""I don't see any runway, I just see water,"" Levy recalled. Further back in the Boeing 777, Xu Das had the same realization. ""Looking through window, it looked on level of the (sea)wall along the runway,"" he posted on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Latest developments on the crash . Then, with no warning from the cockpit, the plane slammed onto the edge of the runway. The impact severed the plane's tail and sent the rest of it spinning on its belly. A massive fireball and clouds of smoke shot skyward. First responders rushed to the scene as horrified onlookers at the airport terminal feared the worst. Medics found the bodies of two Chinese girls on the runway, next to the burning wreckage. The airline identified the girls as students Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, both 16. Remarkably, 305 others on the plane survived the crash Saturday morning. A total of 70 Chinese students and teachers were headed to summer camp in the United States, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""We're lucky there hasn't been a greater loss of life,"" San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. When rescuers arrived, they found some passengers coming out of the water. ""There was a fire on the plane, so the assumption might be that they went near the water's edge, which is very shallow, to maybe douse themselves with water,"" Hayes-White said. Why this flight was survivable . While 182 of them were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from spinal fractures to bruises, another 123 managed to escape unharmed. Some jumped out or slid down emergency chutes with luggage in hand. Harrowing flight . The crash ended an otherwise mundane flight that originated in Shanghai, China. It made a connection in Seoul, South Korea, before flying 10 hours to San Francisco. Among the 291 passengers were 141 Chinese, 77 South Koreans, 61 Americans and one Japanese, Asiana Airlines said. The airline is one of two major airlines in South Korea; the other is Korean Air. At the helm of the plane was one of Asiana's veteran pilots who had been flying for 17 years, the airline said Sunday. Three other pilots were also on board, working in shifts. Once the plane fell short of the runway, passengers found themselves on a roller coaster. ""I thought as the plane was landing, it looked like the pilot was trying to take off again,"" passenger Noni Singh said. The airplane dipped sharply. Expert: Flight shouldn't have been close to seawall . ""And then just boom, the back end just hit and flies up in the air, "" Elliott Stone, another passenger, said, ""and everybody's head goes up to the ceiling."" Dark gray smoke rose from the plane as it lay on its belly, with no landing gear evident. Its roof was charred and, in spots, gone. The back of the plane had been lopped off entirely. Flames and smoke burst out of its windows. ""Honestly, I was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down, in which case I think a lot of people would have not made it,"" Levy said. ""If we flipped, none of us would be here to talk about it."" Xu and his wife were among the fortunate. ""We quickly slung on luggage and grabbed our child and walked toward the back,"" Xu said on Weibo. ""Saw the kitchen at back mostly disappeared. A huge hole -- very round. We quickly rushed out. Only after coming out did we see three of us had slight bruises."" The big question . Exactly what caused the crash could take up to two years to determine, said Choi Jeong-ho, head of South Korea's Aviation Policy Bureau. 'I just crash landed. I'm OK. Surreal' South Korean investigators will work alongside officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The flight recorders from the plane have been recovered and are on the way to Washington, the NTSB said Sunday. The airline purchased the plane, a Boeing 777-200, in March 2006. Asiana CEO and President Yoon Young-doo said there was no engine failure, to his knowledge. ""The company will conduct an accurate analysis on the cause of this accident and take strong countermeasures for safe operation in the future with the lesson learned from this accident,"" Yoon said. The survivors . Many of those who survived the crash chalked it to divine intervention. ""I think it's miraculous that we have survived because things could have been much worse,"" said passenger Vedpal Singh. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and author of the book ""Lean In,"" was supposed to be on Flight 214. But she switched to a United flight, arriving about 20 minutes before the Asiana flight crashed. ""Serious moment to give thanks,"" she wrote on her Facebook page . Not the first time . Prior to Saturday's disaster, Asiana Airlines endured two deadly crashes over the past 20 years. In 1993, a crash near South Korea's Mokpo Airport killed 68 of the 116 people on board. The Boeing 737-500 went down in poor weather as the plane was attempting its third landing, the Aviation Safety Network said. And in 2011, a cargo plane headed from Seoul to Shanghai slammed into the East China Sea, killing the only two people on board. Perhaps one of the reasons so many people survived Saturday's crash was because the Boeing 777 is built so that everybody can get off the plane within 90 seconds, even if half the doors are inoperable. Still, many questions linger. Yoon, Asiana's president and CEO, told reporters he could not confirm many details of the crash, pending the investigation. But he started the press conference by bowing his head in apology. New details from cockpit voice recorder . CNN's Diana Magnay, Mike Ahlers, K.J.

"(CNN) -- It is as if the air suddenly disappears from the room. That is how it feels to lose a big job, one that offers a chance to make a real difference. Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned Friday as the leader of our nation's Department of Veteran's Affairs amid a scandal about wait times at VA hospitals. I would never presume to know or imagine his personal frame of mind or feelings right now, but I know a bit about such experiences. In 2012, I abruptly resigned as the administrator of the General Services Administration in the swirl of a scandal around excessive spending at the ""Western Regions"" training conference, as well as dealings with contractors. The ensuing uproar was textbook: anxious White House meetings, a scornful media, a pouncing Congress and bad optics fueled by silly YouTube videos. It is not an experience that anyone would want to experience ... or repeat. I was personally caught in a web of emotions. My seven-year relationship with the people of GSA was suddenly severed and that saddened me deeply. I was troubled by the crude and, yes, bullying politics. Anxiety swept over me about my finances and prospects. My elderly father was deeply upset and needed attention. Mostly, however, I grieved for the work that I had not completed. I believe in the efficacy of work, its ability to give meaning and to offer a central vitality to life. To lose my work was utterly painful. Being a part of a presidential administration was not just an honor to me, it was a real chance to change the world. The resources are huge; the reach and possibilities are vast. My hope had been to impact and improve how the government performed -- how it used technology, saved energy, collaborated, improved the work environment for public servants, rebuilt trust, and more. Instead, I found myself suddenly sitting in my house looking at the dust on the furniture. However, it was not quiet for long. A lot comes into play in those first weeks after leaving a big job in Washington. My networks went into hyper gear. Supportive messages, flowers and wine started arriving. The Banana Bread Brigade was in action. Other friends were outraged. Their calls were such rants that I found myself relinquishing my anger to them. They were much better at it. Others offered me weary wisdom. ""It's Washington. Everyone gets what happened. You'll be fine."" While I was not ready to hear that prognosis at the time, it turned out to be more than true. Ultimately, a huge space opened up. I had been running at 500 mph while in office, and suddenly I could have a life. Importantly, I came to the realization that I had been robbed of neither my creativity nor my ability to work. The clincher was that I had a partial manuscript for a novel in the bottom of the drawer. I pulled it out and set to work. Within a couple months I published my first novel. Within a year a second book took shape. Loss creates an airless vacuum. But natural law requires that vacuum to fill again. I know that lesson personally. From everything I know of General Shinseki, he thoroughly understands that law as well. May he prosper and thrive in the days and years ahead.

"Washington (CNN)  -- The U.S. government has lowered the threshold for information deemed important enough to put suspicious individuals on a watch list or no-fly list, or have their visa revoked, senior State Department officials tell CNN. The government overhauled criteria it uses for putting possible terrorists on such lists as a result of the failed Christmas Day attack, officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material . Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian who allegedly launched the failed attack, was not put on a no-fly list. That's because the information his father provided a U.S. embassy about his son becoming radicalized and possibly going to Yemen did not meet then-applicable standards to put him on such a list or to cancel his visa. ""Based on the criteria, he fell below the line and went into our database, but not a watch list or no-fly list, and his visa wasn't revoked based on the analysis of the threat,"" one senior official said. ""We have a new standard now, which will allow us to capture more people."" Under the new standard, officials said, AbdulMutallab would have been put on a no-fly list and his visa likely would have been revoked. Another official said that if all relevant agencies had the entire intelligence picture, including National Security Agency (NSA) intercepts about a ""Nigerian"" possibly planning an attack against the U.S., AbdulMutallab ""would have absolutely been no-fly listed and his visa would have been revoked."" Since the attempted attack, the intelligence community has scrubbed the entire Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) database of more than 500,000 suspects with the new criteria, adding additional individuals to the U.S. watch lists and no-fly lists as a result. Several visas have also been revoked. ""Rest assured that in light of what happened on December 25, we've gone back over these databases and there have been additional actions taken,"" Assistant Secretary Philip J. Crowley told reporters. He declined to provide statistics, saying the numbers were constantly changing. When discussing the new threshold, officials suggested it is more an art than science. ""The threshold might be how much information do you have? What kid of confidence do you have in the information that is available,"" the first senior official said. ""It will involve an assessment of risk, the perception of risk and our tolerance of risk."" But the officials suggested the new standard is much lower than before December 25. For example, decisions could be taken to put someone on a no-fly list or a watch list based on one credible source, instead of the previous standard of using multiple sources. ""We had a new threat, and we are going to, for a period of time, tilt back to a more conservative approach,"" the official said. Officials recognize the costs for grounding more people and providing extra screening for passengers from specific countries, pointing to blowback from several countries who are protesting their inclusion on the list. Cuba called in the head of the U.S. Interest Section, and Nigeria called in the U.S. ambassador to formally protest the move.","Government overhauls criteria it uses because of failed Christmas Day attack .

"(CNN)  -- Moments after President Obama said a ""mix of human and systemic failures"" allowed a man to try to bomb a passenger jet on Christmas Day, federal agencies said they had done all they could. ""A systemic failure has occurred, and I consider that totally unacceptable,"" Obama told reporters Tuesday during his vacation in Hawaii, referring to what authorities allege was Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab's failed attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane preparing to land in Detroit, Michigan. The president said information on AbdulMutallab should have sufficed to alert authorities to prevent him from getting on the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands. ""What already is apparent is that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security,"" Obama said. ""We need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake."" Federal authorities have charged AbdulMutallab, 23, of Nigeria, with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at his seat. Obama has ordered preliminary results of an investigation into what went wrong by Thursday. However, the president said U.S. intelligence officials had received information signaling AbdulMutallab might be a terrorism threat but failed to take steps to prevent the man from boarding the flight. ""It's been widely reported that the father of the suspect in the Christmas incident warned U.S. officials in Africa about his son's extremist views,"" Obama said. ""It now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect's name on a no-fly list."" Obama cited ""other deficiencies,"" saying ""there were bits of information available within the intelligence community that could have and should have been pieced together."" The airport security system created after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States was ""not sufficiently up to date to take full advantage of the information we collect and knowledge we have,"" Obama said. ""Had this critical information been shared, it could have been compiled with other intelligence, and a fuller, clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged,"" Obama said. ""The warning signs would have triggered red flags, and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America."" Obama said that the inability to take proper action on ""information on a known extremist"" showed the system had failed. Soon after Obama delivered his remarks, a reliable source told CNN's Jeanne Meserve that AbdulMutallab's father talked twice about his son's extremist views with at least one CIA representative at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and a report was prepared, but the report was not circulated outside the agency. U.S. officials said the father, a former Nigerian banker, expressed his concerns about his son's radicalization during two meetings and more than one telephone call with embassy officials. The information was sent to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, but sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated until after the Christmas Day incident, the source said. Had that information been shared, the man might have been denied passage on the flight, the source said. An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that, meshed with other information, ""would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack"" before the suspect boarded the jet at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. ""What we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual, organizational, systemic and technological,"" the official said. ""We ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk, where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we cannot allow to continue."" But a U.S. intelligence official said that the son's name, passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated. The official said AbdulMutallab's father never said his son was a planning an attack. ""The old man wanted help finding his kid,"" the intelligence official said. ""If he thought he was a bona fide terrorist, and he wanted him back, the embassy in Nigeria would have been the last place to go. The U.S. doesn't send terrorists home, no questions asked. I'm not aware of anything that suddenly would have lit up the board and flagged AbdulMutallab ... as a terrorist on his way to America. But it's the season for second-guessing, so anything goes."" The official added, ""I'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put AbdulMutallab on the no-fly list."" CIA spokesman George Little defended the agency's actions regarding AbdulMutallab. ""We learned of him in November, when his father came to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and sought help in finding him,"" Little said. ""We did not have his name before then. Also in November, we worked with the embassy to ensure he was in the government's terrorist database -- including mention of his possible extremist connections in Yemen. We also forwarded key biographical information about him to the National Counterterrorism Center."" Little said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter. Kelly said any decision to have revoked the suspect's visa would have been an interagency decision. But a U.S. government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily. Meanwhile, in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, authorities were questioning congregants at a mosque and students and faculty at a school attended by AbdulMutallab, the spokesman for Yemen's Embassy to the United States said Tuesday. Mohammed al-Basha told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that an assertion by the local al Qaeda group that AbdulMutallab's action was in retaliation for airstrikes against them was ""unfounded"" and ""most likely"" propaganda, but left open the possibility links could emerge. ""I think the al Qaeda statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of December is unfounded, because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that,"" al-Basha said. AbdulMutallab bought his ticket from Lagos, Nigeria, to Detroit, Michigan, via Amsterdam on the day before the December 17 airstrike, Nigerian officials said. Conversations with the suspect's former acquaintances have turned up no link to al Qaeda, al-Basha said. ""Umar, according to the questionings carried on today by his classmates and administrative officials of the school, he was a friendly person and did not ring any alarm bells,"" he said. But senior Obama administration officials said Tuesday they are starting to see a link to the terrorist group. ""Some of the new information that we developed overnight does suggest that there was some linkage there,"" one of the senior administration officials said. The senior administration official was referring to intelligence that White House officials obtained late Monday and then briefed Obama about on Tuesday in a secure conference call. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the failed bombing, calling it retaliation for what it said were U.S. airstrikes on Yemeni soil. Al-Basha said airstrikes launched against AQAP on December 17 and December 24 were launched solely by the Yemeni government, but acknowledged the United States has provided assistance since the September 11, 2001, attacks. U.S. officials say they have provided intelligence on AQAP targets to Yemen's government, but won't say whether U.S. aircraft or drones have taken part in strikes.","NEW: Source: CIA had report on AbdulMutallab weeks before bombing attempt .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Navy warship USS Donald Cook is scheduled to enter the Black Sea no later than Thursday as part of the latest U.S. military effort to demonstrate support for Eastern European allies concerned about Russia's troop buildup along its border with Ukraine. The movement of the guided missile destroyer was confirmed to CNN by two U.S. military officials who declined to be identified because a formal announcement has not been made. The ship will conduct exercises and port visits while in the Black Sea. The guided missile destroyer USS Truxtun took part in scheduled exercises in the Black Sea last month and departed March 21. NATO members Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have Black Sea coastlines, as do non-members Ukraine, Russia and Georgia. The movement of the Navy warship into the Black Sea comes ahead of an April 15 meeting of top NATO political representatives to discuss and potentially approve a series of recommendations for additional military measures, including shortening the ""response time"" of NATO forces if there were a crisis. Other options on the table include more military exercises with member nations including the United States and potentially providing military advisers to Ukraine. Using classified and commercial satellite imagery, the United States estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops on the border with eastern Ukraine. Those troops remain positioned so close, and are so heavily armed, that the U.S. and NATO calculate they could ""roll across"" eastern Ukraine in three to five days, one official said. That's an estimate previously made by Gen. Philip Breedlove, the military chief of NATO. There has been no withdrawal of Russian forces; other than perhaps small numbers, so the estimate remains in place, the official said. Washington also believes that the recent unrest in eastern Ukraine around the city of Donetsk is the work of ""paid or compelled persons, heavily influenced by Russia,"" the official said. The U.S. assessment is that the Russians are looking for a provocation to move into Ukraine. But the Ukrainian military response of moving in methodically and arresting troublemakers worked in this case, the official said.

"(CNN) -- Following the attempt to bomb a passenger jet on Christmas Day, President Obama said that ""once the suspect attempted to take down Flight 253, it's clear Homeland Security and Aviation Security took all appropriate actions."" I am a commercial airline pilot who was deep over the Atlantic flying from St. Kitts and Nevis for nearly six hours on Christmas Day following the attempted bombing on Flight 253. I only learned about the incident after landing when I looked at the CNN Web site on my iPhone. I'm justifiably furious that I was not notified while airborne. Our government clearly dropped the ball. President Obama has ordered a review into the intelligence failures leading up to the attempted Christmas Day bombing by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, but an equally important review needs to be made into how events were handled once AbdulMutallab attempted to carry out his plan. Specifically, why weren't the actions the Transportation Safety Administration outlines in our aviation manuals initiated, and what took place inside the federal Domestic Events Network in the immediate aftermath of the terror attempt? Following the 9/11 review, the DEN was given the task of instituting new procedures for controllers on how to communicate information about suspicious aircraft throughout the system. The Washington-based DEN Operations Center is supposed to allow federal agencies with jurisdiction over the security of U.S. airspace to communicate information in real time. So why, after eight years and billions of dollars, was the information concerning the incident available to me only on my iPhone? Like many commercial pilots, I flew in the military. There, each squadron maintains something called a pre-mishap plan. Basically, it's a three-ring binder with a series of actions the watch officer is supposed to take when a mishap happens. It's a very useful tool -- but only if the officer who is assigned to carry out the plan is familiar with the binder's contents. Good commanding officers run simulated mishap drills within their squadrons to ensure their junior officers effectively execute the plan. I'm left with the sickening sense that after 9/11, the government spent horrific amounts of money to create the ""mother of all"" pre-mishap plans, but never effectively tested it. Why? Because unlike the military, where commanding officers rise up through the ranks based on professional competency, our government operates on a different model. How else does one explain the failed governmental response to natural disasters like Katrina, or man-made disasters like the Christmas Day bombing attempt? The silver lining is that AbdulMutallab's failed attempt gave us that test of the response system. It can only be attributed to luck that unlike 9/11, this was not a coordinated attack involving multiple aircraft. Now that the gaping holes in our response have been exposed, let's do a thorough review of what took place  on Flight 253 and ensure we have professionals in decision-making positions who will execute the plan if this happens again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Danyluk.","Airline pilot Steve Danyluk was flying over Atlantic during bomb attempt but wasn't notified .

"Detroit (CNN) -- The man accused of trying to blow up a commercial flight with a bomb hidden in his underwear entered court Tuesday shouting anti-American statements and claiming that Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen and accused terrorist who was killed in a drone attack in Yemen, is still alive. ""Anwar is alive!"" he yelled. ""The mujahideen will wipe out the U.S., the cancer!"" Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of Umar Farouq AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man who is accused of trying to detonate an explosive device aboard a Christmas Day 2009 flight to Detroit. AbdulMutallab has said he will represent himself in the trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, expected to begin October 11. Wearing a white prison T-shirt and a black cap, AbdulMutallab said he had instead wanted to wear ""a Yemeni belt with a dagger"" when asked by U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds why he wasn't dressed more appropriately. AbdulMutallab has been indicted on charges that include attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. According to an indictment, he went to the bathroom shortly before the plane was to land. When he returned to his seat, he said his stomach was upset and pulled a blanket over himself. Prosecutors allege he then tried to ignite an explosive device that was hidden in his underwear. Passengers and flight crew members subdued him. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt. During a pre-trial hearing last month meant to introduce him to 250 prospective jurors, AbdulMutallab said ""Osama's alive."" Osama bin Laden, the former al Qaeda leader, was killed in May during a U.S. raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.","NEW:  AbdulMutallab shouts, ""The mujahideen will wipe out the U.S., the cancer!""

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts judge granted a defense request Monday to transfer ex-New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez to a jail closer to his lawyers in Boston as he awaits trial on murder charges. Judge Susan Garsh approved the move after Hernandez's lawyers asked to make the commute shorter between their law offices in Boston and the jail in Bristol County where Hernandez has been held for more than a year. Hernandez's lawyers have said the trip, about 60 miles, can take up to two hours in traffic. Since his arrest in June 2013, Hernandez has been held at the Bristol House of Corrections in a 10-feet-by-7-feet cell. Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez . Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN that Hernandez likely will be transferred to another jail on Tuesday. Watching the proceedings Monday were Hernandez's mother and older brother, DJ, who is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa. Both have remained silent on the charges. Also in attendance was Ursula Ward, mother of murder victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez is charged with ""orchestrating the execution"" of Lloyd on June 17, 2013. In a separate case, the former tight end also is charged in the drive-by shootings of Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu in Boston in 2012. That trial is set for May 2015. He has pleaded not guilty to all three murder charges. Judge Garsh did not finalize a trial date in the Lloyd case, unsure whether the defense could be ready by October as she had suggested. On Monday, defense lawyers suggested they might file a change of venue motion, which could delay the trial. The judge also did not rule on previous defense motions to dismiss a first-degree murder charge or throw out a June 18, 2013 search warrant of Hernandez's home in relation to the Lloyd case. Hernandez's lawyers have argued the state has failed to meet minimum probable-cause standards to make that first-degree murder charge stick. In a June hearing, defense lawyer Jamie Sultan told a judge all he's heard is ""a lot of smoke"" but few specifics. ""Who killed Mr. Lloyd? Why? Whether it was part of a plan and if so, whose plan? What happened to the car, and what happened at the scene?"" Sultan argued in that hearing. The search warrant in question turned up evidence including surveillance video from interior cameras as well as cellphones, an iPad and other items. The images include a still allegedly taken shortly after Lloyd's slaying that shows Hernandez holding what prosecutors believe is the murder weapon, according to a law enforcement source. A .45-caliber gun allegedly used to fire eight shots has never been found. The case against Hernandez: Where's the weapon? Defense attorneys argue investigators did not have the legally required search warrant paperwork with them. In a motion, Hernandez' lawyers state a Massachusetts state trooper entering the house ""clearly has no file folder in his hand,"" with documents. If the defense successfully quashes the search warrant, the pictures from that search could become inadmissible. Prosecutors maintain the search was carried out by the book. On Wednesday, in a second court appearance this week, Hernandez's defense team hopes to get a court-approved subpoena to demand the New England Patriots turn over all medical records and psychological tests involving their former star tight end. So far, Hernandez' lawyers said there has been ""no agreement"" with the team over their request for documents. A motion calls the records potential evidence that may bear upon Hernandez's state of mind and ""physical and mental state"" prior to Lloyd's murder. The move indicates his attorneys might be considering a diminished capacity defense -- being less capable of knowing right from wrong -- legal experts said, if there is credible evidence. ""My instinct is they try to argue he wasn't mentally capable of planning or intending any murder, and thus, first degree murder should be off the table,"" University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann told CNN.

"(CNN) -- In 2013, events such as the U.S. government shutdown, hot-button issues such as marriage equality and ramped-up debates about privacy and surveillance made headlines and caught readers' attention. Many of the perspectives published by CNN Opinion were shared widely on social media. Here are some of the most shared op-eds from the year. Dan Riffle: Marijuana is safer than alcohol . For more than 80 years, our government has spent tens of billions of taxpayer dollars fighting a war against marijuana. We arrest three-quarters of a million adults every year, 87% for simple possession rather than production or sales of marijuana. Courtrooms turn into assembly lines churning out probationers -- mostly minorities -- with convictions that will make it almost impossible to find employment. The result? Marijuana is universally available, used by almost half of Americans at some point in their lives, and we've enriched murderous drug cartels fueling violence in Mexico that has claimed more than 60,000 lives.

(Note: On the subject of marijuana, Dr. Sanjay Gupta's opinion piece in the CNN Health section was hugely popular:) Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis. Instead, I lumped them with the high-visibility malingerers, just looking to get high. I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof. Surely, they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have ""no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse."" They didn't have the science to support that claim, and I now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true. It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. Read more...

America has tried to create systems that are designed to ferry people from one side of the lake to the other, or to at least stop them from sinking further. Government programs help pay for health insurance and day care. Food stamps have kept families from going hungry. And public schools have proved to be one of the best routes out of poverty.

"London, England (CNN)  -- London's Heathrow Airport will introduce more body scanners within weeks, and all British airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year, British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Tuesday. Johnson -- whose responsibilities include domestic security -- was speaking in response to the failed effort to blow up a plane en route to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. The suspect in the thwarted attack, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, had studied in Britain. The British government had no evidence AbdulMutallab, 23, of Nigeria, had been planning an attack, and believes he was ""radicalized"" after he left Britain, Johnson said. British security services investigated AbdulMutallab's communications with UK-based individuals they had under observation while he was living in London, but judged that he did not then pose a danger. Those individuals were among 2,000 terror suspects British security agencies currently keep watch over, according to a senior British counter-terrorism source. Johnson said the government was directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors cannot spot explosives without metal parts. British airports will also use more sniffer dogs to try to find explosives, Johnson said in a speech to the House of Commons. ""It is an issue of grave concern that the explosive device was not detected by airport security in either Lagos (Nigeria) or Amsterdam (Netherlands),"" which AbdulMutallab passed through en route to Detroit, Johnson said. The government is also considering ""additional targeted passenger profiling,"" Johnson said. Heathrow's operator said Sunday it would begin subjecting passengers to full body scans ""as soon as practical."" ""A combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling will help build a more robust defense against the unpredictable and changing nature of the terrorist threat to aviation,"" BAA, which runs Britain's largest airport, announced in a statement. The move follows the British government's approval of electronic body scanners, which Prime Minister Gordon Brown said was necessary to combat ""a new type of threat."" Speaking on the BBC, Brown said the devices will be put into place gradually, as will checks of carry-on luggage for traces of explosives for passengers boarding flights at British airports. U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with his top security officials Tuesday in Washington to receive an update on the inquiry into security lapses that allowed the suspect to board a U.S.-bound flight. Obama will meet with FBI Director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, CIA Director Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, administration officials told CNN. Obama will get an update from Mueller on the FBI's investigation and receive information from Holder on the prosecution of the suspect in the botched Christmas Day airline bombing. Napolitano will give him an update on her review of detection capabilities, an official said. Officials in the Netherlands and Nigeria said last week they would begin using the body scanners on airline passengers in the wake of the bombing attempt. Body scanners are currently in use at 19 U.S. airports, and U.S. officials said Thursday that 150 new ones are set to be placed in airports across the country. Authorities say the Nigerian man tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its final approach to Detroit. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at the man's seat. The suspect was arrested on charges of attempting to destroy an aircraft. He will face his first court hearings on Friday. AbdulMutallab had a multiple-entry U.S. visa. His father, a leading banker in Nigeria, had warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists, but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa.","Heathrow's operator said it would begin subjecting passengers to full body scans ""as soon as practical""

"(CNN) -- It's called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, and weeks before authorities say he got on a plane with a bomb, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was in it. The vast government databank, known as TIDE, is administered by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. It contains information about hundreds of thousands of people, the majority of them foreign nationals, who are suspected of having terrorist leanings. An FBI official said AbdulMutallab was included in TIDE after his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria of his son's hard-line beliefs and possible ties to militant Islamists. To understand how he could have been under the government's scrutiny and still make it onto a U.S.-bound plane with an explosive, you have to understand the way the government's watch list system works. TIDE is just the start. The FBI uses the raw information contained in the TIDE databank to determine whether to put the subject onto the government's terror watch list, known as the Terrorism Screening Data Base. That list contains the names and aliases of about 400,000 people, but AbdulMutallab didn't make the cut. According to Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the FBI's Terror Screening Center, there wasn't enough hard evidence to back up AbdulMutallab's father's fears, and so he wasn't placed on the terror list. The bureau's own Web site spells out the criteria for inclusion in the screening database, saying that ""only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism are included."" The determination not to put AbdulMutallab on the screening list had far-reaching consequences. In May, the U.S. Justice Department's inspector general issued a report on the watch-list process, including a flow chart describing how anyone suspected of terrorist ties passes through a series of lists, the most serious of which includes the Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list. Making it from the TIDE database to the FBI's screening list is the key. Because AbdulMutallab didn't make the screening database, his name could not then be sent onto the watch lists maintained by the TSA: the ""selectee list,"" which law enforcement sources say includes about 14,000 names, and the ""no-fly"" list, which those sources say bans some 4,000 people from boarding any commercial flight destined for the United States.","Father's warning prompted man's inclusion in FBI database .

"Washington (CNN) -- Authorities in Yemen questioned people at a mosque and a school in the capital of Sanaa because the facilities were attended by attempted bombing suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the spokesman for Yemen's Embassy to the United States said Tuesday. Mohammed al-Basha told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that conversations with AbdulMutallab's former acquaintances have not yet turned up links to the local al Qaeda group, which has claimed responsibility for AbdulMutallab's attempt to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas Day. ""According to the questionings carried on today by his classmates and administrative officials of the school, [Umar] was a friendly person and did not ring any alarm bells,"" he said. ""We knew he attended school in Yemen, and one of the mosques he was visiting in Sanaa we've been surveilling and questioning some of the people there to see whether he has links or not,"" he said. Al-Basha also said a claim by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that the attempt was in retaliation for airstrikes against them was ""most likely"" propaganda, but left open the possibility links could be found later. ""I think the al Qaeda statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of December is unfounded, because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that, so there's no link for the time being,"" al-Basha said. See key dates in the failed bombing attempt . AbdulMutallab bought his ticket to travel from Lagos, Nigeria, to Detroit, Michigan, via Amsterdam the day before the first attack, according to Nigerian officials. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula issued an Internet statement claiming responsibility for AbdulMuttalab's failed attempt to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253, calling it retaliation for what it said were U.S. airstrikes on Yemeni soil. Al-Basha said airstrikes against AQAP on December 17 and December 24 were launched entirely by the Yemeni government, but acknowledged that the United States has provided the country with some assistance since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""The United States has been supporting Yemen since 9/11, training our forces,"" he said. ""We have a strong intelligence cooperation, but again the last operations and all the operations this year were carried out by Yemeni forces."" U.S. officials privately acknowledge they have provided secret intelligence on several al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula targets to Yemen's government, but won't say whether U.S. aircraft or drones took part in the strikes. Al Basha rejected suggestions that Yemen has not been strong enough in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but noted the nation has ""a serious problem."" ""We've been addressing this problem way before it became a global issue,"" he said. ""Since 1992, we've been fighting. I call it the long war. Al Qaeda, we've been conducting strikes against them since that day.""","Talks with acquaintances have not yet revealed links to local al Qaeda group .

"(CNN) -- We live in an era of airline fees. Where once ticket prices included checked baggage, inflight meals and seat selection, increasingly, those items are add-ons geared towards generating extra income for carriers. According to a recent survey by Fly.com, there are actually some luxuries passengers are willing to shell out for -- they're just not always in line with what airlines actually charge. ""Overall, fees are here to stay, and as we continue to see a debundling of fares, passengers will increasingly be asked to pay for various services that previously they didn't,"" says Warren Chang, vice president and general manager of Fly.com. ""There's an overall perception that consumers feel they're being nickel and dimed, and it's important for airlines to express what value they are presenting."" Give passengers what they want . According to Fly.com's survey, the most widespread fees are also some of the least popular. While U.S. airlines collected $2.5 billion from checked baggage fees between January and September 2013, 89% of respondent said it's important for them to be able to check their bag for free. Also, with the exception of Hawaiian Airlines, all U.S. carriers now charge for in-flight meals on domestic flights, even though nearly half of those surveyed classified free food as an important perk. If airlines dropped these fees, they could recoup in other areas. Fly.com also found that 20% of respondents would pay for a first class meal in coach class, a service that few carriers offer. ""In my view, that's something that would be a real win-win for the airlines. It doesn't devalue first class, as people aren't just paying for the meal, but for the exclusivity, for more space, for better service and amenities. First-class meals would enhance the flying experience in coach without detracting from the experience in first,"" he adds. Put it in the bin . Cramped storage space is not only a headache for passengers, it's poses a financial loss for carriers as well. While customers malaise through the aisles, holding up boarding in an attempt to fit their carry-ons on the plane, airlines are losing money (slow boarding costs them approximately $10 million yearly). Increasingly, airlines have started charging for carry-on luggage, a fee that is, understandably, not popular with passengers. Frequent flyers have another solution in mind. Rather than pay to bring luggage on-board, they'd rather spend extra for roomier overhead bins. Of those surveyed, 42% said this is a service they would happily splurge on. ""No airline allows you to buy designated overhead bin space, but based on our findings, it's definitely something they should consider,"" says Chang. Why wi-fi? While airlines are investing heavily in upgrading their systems to offer passengers wi-fi, many of those surveyed expressed it's not really a feature that matters to them. Only 30% said they would pay extra for wi-fi, a number that surprised Chang. ""With large populations having their own smart phones, I would have thought they'd want to bring their own entertainment systems on board, but that wasn't something our survey found,"" he says. A little extra for comfort . As plane seats continue to shrink, it's probably no surprise that most fliers are willing to pay for a little extra room. Nearly 90% of passengers said they wanted more comfortable seats, and 45% said they'd pay for extra legroom. A good chunk were willing to go even further; 34% of travelers would pay to prevent the seat in front of them from reclining and 26% would pay to have an empty middle seat next to them. Some of the perks respondents wanted would be a challenge for airlines to implement: 13% of those polled said they'd pay to have control of their armrests, 4% said they'd shell out for the right to control the window shade, and 4% said they'd pay to be first in line for the restrooms.","A Fly.com survey reveals which airline fees passengers are willing to pay for .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration on Thursday extended through at least the weekend heightened security measures in the aftermath of a failed attempt to blow up a U.S. jetliner, the agency said. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the [TSA] is extending the current security measures through the busy holiday weekend,"" the agency said in a statement. ""TSA will review and update these measures to keep the traveling public safe."" The current security directive requires airlines to physically pat down all passengers boarding planes bound for the United States and inspect their carry-on bags. It also gives airlines the discretion to take other measures to prevent people from secretly assembling or igniting bombs on aircraft. Those measures include prohibiting people from keeping pillows or blankets on their laps during the final hour of a flight. The added security measures were implemented after Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, allegedly tried to set off a bomb aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","TSA will review and update measures ""to keep the traveling public safe,"" agency says .

"(Health.com) -- Have you ever reached into your medicine cabinet and pulled out a bottle with a faded label, only to discover that the aspirin or prescription drugs inside were past their date? Did you play it safe and toss the bottle into the trash? If so, you might have been overly cautious. A new laboratory analysis of eight prescription drugs that expired between 28 and 40 years ago has found that most have remained just as potent as they were on the day they were made. Overall, the eight drugs included 14 different active ingredients, including aspirin, codeine and hydrocodone. In 86% of cases, the study found, the amount of active ingredient present in the drugs was at least 90% of the amount indicated on the label. That falls within the range deemed acceptable by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency allows ""reasonable variation"" in the strength of any given batch of prescription drugs, generally requiring that drugs contain between 90% and 110% of the stated active ingredient. Health.com: Tips for saving money on prescription drugs . It's impossible to say from the study results alone whether the eight drugs would be effective if used today, but ""there's no reason to think that they're not,"" says Lee Cantrell, the lead author of the study and a professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco. Two of the tested ingredients, aspirin and amphetamine, consistently fell below the 90% threshold, as did one sample of the painkiller phenacetin. On the other hand, three ingredients were found in amounts greater than 110% of label strength -- perhaps because those drugs predate quality-control regulations introduced by the FDA in 1963, the researchers say. Most drugs are dated to expire after one to five years, but as the results show, that time frame doesn't necessarily correlate to a drug's potency, Cantrell says. ""All [the expiration date] means from the manufacturers' standpoint is that they're willing to guarantee the potency and efficacy for the drug for that long,"" he says. ""It has nothing to do with the actual shelf life."" Health.com: What belongs in your medicine cabinet? The fact that expiration dates appear to be somewhat arbitrary may mean that consumers and pharmacies alike are throwing away perfectly good medicine. And this has important implications for drug shortages and especially health care costs, the researchers say. ""We're spending billions and billions on medications and medication turnover,"" Cantrell says. ""If a drug has expired, you've got to throw it away, it goes into a landfill, and you have to get a new prescription. This could potentially have a significant impact on cost."" Although consistently taking depleted prescription drugs could certainly cause complications, expired drugs are generally safe. In the medical literature there is only one example of an expired drug that became toxic, and that was an isolated incident, says Cantrell, the director of the San Diego division of the California Poison Control System. Health.com: 13 drugs that can make you gain weight . The new findings, which were published today in a research letter in the Archives of Internal Medicine, don't mean you should go digging through the trash for your expired meds just yet, however. For starters, some of the drugs tested are no longer widely used, and it's not clear that the results would be the same for different drugs, or for similar drugs stored in different conditions, says Mohammad Nutan, an associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville. The drugs in this study were unopened and still in their original containers, Nutan points out. Medications that are already opened or those stored in less than optimal conditions might be a different story altogether, since humidity, temperature, and even exposure to light can all affect how well a drug stands the test of time, Nutan says. Still, Cantrell and his colleagues say, the findings suggest that the expiration dates of some drugs could be safely extended. The FDA, in fact, has already done so for certain medications in short supply, including anti-venoms for the Eastern Coral snake and the Black Widow spider, Cantrell notes. ""Perhaps expiration dating of medications needs to be revisited,"" he says. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Study finds many ""expired"" drugs are just as potent as they were originally made .

"(CNN) -- Whatever the motive behind the event, it made for some powerful images of some China residents' desperation for better air. Making the media rounds this week are photographs of residents of Zhengzhou, the capital of China's Henan Province, lining up for a chance to breathe fresh mountain air via sealed bags. Some of the more heart-tugging photos were of parents and grandparents fixing the masks on children's faces so they can have a few rare sniffs of the fresh O2. Zhengzhou is one of China's worst cities for air pollution, ranking 10th in a Greenpeace list of the country's most polluted cities in 2013, which used official data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. At the time of writing, Zhengzhou's AQI (Air Quality Index) recorded an ""unhealthy"" 157. Even Beijing, often the subject of bad pollution headlines, recorded a ""moderate"" AQI of 55 (the capital made headlines with its off-the-chart AQI reading of 755 last January). New York recorded an AQI of 62. The late-March series of events were part clever travel marketing gimmick, part public awareness campaign for China's air pollution crisis, put on by Laojun Mountain Natural Reserve Development Co. The company brought in 2,000 cans and 40 bags of air that had been packed in Laojun Mountain, also located in Henan Province. ""A TV crew came to Laojun Mountain to test the air and found it unbelievably good and we had the idea of doing this to promote tourism to the area,"" sales and marketing officer for the park Khurram Zhang told CNN. Known for its fresh air, the mountain was designated a national nature reserve in 1997, and sits 120 kilometers away from the nearest city of Luoyang. ""We collected 2,000 cans of air from She Shen Ya (a cliff on Laojun Mountain) early last month and we gave them out in multiple locations as a marketing campaign. It was gone in 20 minutes,"" said Zhang. ""We've launched two more events giving away air from the mountain. There will be more free fresh air coming in the future.""","Zhengzhou residents lined up to try bags of mountain air .

"(CNN) -- The Champions League is back and we can't wait to get started. Ahead of Tuesday's opening group games in Europe's biggest club competition, we take you through everything you need to know. Can Real Madrid retain its title? Will Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi break the goalscoring record? Can Jose Mourinho win it with a third different club? All will be revealed on June 6 in Berlin, but here's the guide to who, what, where and when -- it's the Champions League and it's back. Can Real do it again? No club has ever successfully defended the Champions League title since the competition was revamped in 1992. And Real, which won ""la decima"" last season, it's 10th European Cup, will face a struggle to handle the challenge despite its star-studded squad. Carlo Ancelotti, the manager, can call upon the mercurial talents of Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and the latest ""Galactico"" to arrive in the Spanish capital -- James Rodriguez. Toni Kroos, part of the Bayern Munich team which lifted the trophy in 2013, has also made the move to Santiago Bernabeu and slots into midfield alongside Luka Modric. But while there have been plenty of arrivals, Real has lost key players with the departures of Xabi Alonso to Bayern and Angel di Maria to Manchester United. Results have been sketchy too -- a defeat by rival Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup was disappointing but nowhere near as embarrassing as the 4-2 loss against Real Sociedad. On Saturday It was also beaten at home in the league -- by rivals Atletico again. Real will start its Champions League campaign at home against Swiss side Basel before facing Bulgarian minnow Ludogorets and Liverpool. Barcelona's biting point? After the disappointment of losing out to Diego Simeone's Atletico in last year's semifinal and failing to win the league title, Barcelona has turned to one of football's bad boys to reinvigorate its squad. Luis Suarez, the man banned for biting, will miss the club's first three Champions League matches as he serves a four-month suspension following his transgression at the World Cup. He will return to action in ""El Clasico"" against Real Madrid on October 25 and will then be available for selection in all forms of football. Suarez's goals helped propel Liverpool into the Champions League following a successful season on Merseyside. He will now link up with Messi and Neymar in one of the most frightening front threes in the game but can he keep his cool at Camp Nou? Ronaldo vs. Messi . Another season, another showdown. Ronaldo and Messi are both aiming to become the competition's record scorer and surpass Raul's total of 71. Both Real's Ronaldo and Barcelona's Messi have scored 67 each and are on the brink of moving ahead of Raul, who has led the scoring charts since February 2001. Ronaldo has scored at least 10 goals in each of his past three Champions League campaigns and last year he set a single-season record with an astonishing 17. Messi has managed at least eight in his past six Champions League seasons but can he stop Real from defending its title? Dare to Zlatan? Are referees scared of Zlatan Ibrahimovic? That's one view being espoused by Austrian captain Aleksandar Dragovic, whose side drew 1-1 with Ibrahimovic's Sweden last week. Ibrahimovic appeared to elbow David Alaba during the European Championship qualifier but somehow escaped any disciplinary action. ""It was a red card for me. The referee was scared of Zlatan,"" said Dragovic. But Zlatan is Zlatan and the forward who will spearhead Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League challenge, had a different version of events. ""The referee has everything under control,"" he told reporters. ""He [Alaba] goes into me twice and the third time I try to shield the ball and he [Alaba] is 1.50m or 1.60m tall and then he obviously reaches up to my elbow."" Ibrahimovic will be on his own personal tour of former clubs with PSG set to face both Barcelona and Ajax. Cypriot side APOEL complete the group. Bayern Pepped up? After winning the trophy against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in 2013, last year's competition was a real disappointment for Bayern. Under new manager Pep Guardiola, it reached the semifinals where it imploded by losing 4-0 at home to Real Madrid in the second leg. A 5-0 aggregate defeat was an embarrassing end to a campaign which had begun with much promise. This time though, Bayern is back and looking even stronger. It has added Robert Lewandowski, the former Borussia Dortmund striker, while Sebastian Rode has joined from Eintracht Frankfurt. Kroos and Mario Mandzukic have both moved on but Bayern retain a formidable look. Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery pose a threat on the wings, Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze both enjoyed an excellent World Cup campaign with Germany, while Xherdan Shaqiri has enjoyed a strong start to the season. Why is Manchester City so unlucky? Manchester City has had a raw deal in the Champions League so far. It might be the best team in England but because of the way the seeding system works, it has often been given the toughest possible group draws. This time around it faces Bayern, Roma and Russian side CSKA Moscow in what has been labeled as the ""Group of Death."" In 2011, City had a similar experience after being paired with Bayern, Napoli and Villarreal -- a group from which it failed to escape. A year later, it got worse. City failed to win a single group game after being lumped in with eventual finalist Dortmund, Real and Ajax. Last season, City finally got over the first hurdle along with Bayern, though it was then beaten in the round of 16 by Barcelona. This time around, Manuel Pellegrini's team will open its campaign at the Allianz Arena against Bayern -- its never easy for City. Shakhtar security . Shakhtar Donetsk faces a real challenge to progress from its group after being forced to play its games 600 miles away in Lviv. The Ukrainian-Russian conflict has already meant the club has switched its league fixtures to Kiev but now it faces playing at another of the country's stadiums. Shakhtar is in Group H along with Athletic Bilbao, BATE Borisov and 2004 champion Porto. Money, money, money . Real was the big winner both on and off the field last season. The champion earned $74.3 million from its run to the final which includes the $13.5 million it pocketed for winning the competition. According to figures provided by UEFA, teams in the Champions League and Europa League shared more than $1.4 billion in prize money last season. Even Belgian side Anderlecht, which failed to win a single game in last season's group stage, went home with over $15.5 million. The 32 clubs in this season's group stage could earn a minimum of $11 million, while there is a $1.3 million on offer for each victory and $650,000 for a draw. Teams which reach the round of 16 will earn $4.5 million each, the quarterfinalists $5 million and the semifinalists $6.3 million. The champion will collect a cool $13.5 million with the second placed side picking up $8.4 million. Who's not coming to the party? While some of the world's top players will be in action there are plenty who will be missing from the Champions League. Manchester United, which last failed to qualify for the Champions League in 1995, is the biggest loser along with Italian duo AC Milan and Napoli. United's absence means the likes of Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Di Maria will all have to watch the action from their sofas. While United and Milan both failed to qualify for the Europa League, Napoli will be involved. Gonzalo Higuian, Lorenzo Insigne and Marek Hamsik will be the three to watch for Rafa Benitez's side.","The 2014 Champions League starts Tuesday September 16 .

"Gaborone, Botswana (CNN) -- While Botswana is perhaps best known for its wildlife reserves, a burgeoning counter-culture is painting a very different image of the small south African country. Clad in leather, adorned in spikes and topped off with cowboy hats, these are Botswana's heavy metal heads. CNN got up close to the hardcore rockers and discovered a passionate retro scene proudly celebrating its African heritage. While Western head bangers are most commonly associated with sneakers and band t-shirts, Botswana's fans have carved a unique image reminiscent of the 1970s New Wave British heavy metal scene. Watch: Fighting for Botswana's traditions . Photographer Frank Marshall captured the rockers in all their Hell's Angels-style glory as part of his Renegades exhibition, on display at the Rooke Gallery in Johannesburg. ""Metal was seeded here by a classic rock band that started in the early 70s. Since then, it's evolved and grown,"" he said. ""In the last 10 to 20 years, it's come to be visually composed of what it looks like now -- the guys dressed in leather. It started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metals were introduced."" Marshall described a macho scene with unique rituals, adding: ""There's a strong sense of camaraderie amongst them. That's the first thing you'll notice about them as an outsider coming in. They've got a very strong bond and friendship with each other. ""They're very physical. At the shows, you don't just shake their hands. They'll grab your hand and shake you around. ""They embody the very aggressive elements of metal. It's an expression of power. Everything is an expression of power for them, from the clothes to the way they speak to the way they walk. They walk with very deliberate lurching strides. ""To them, it's perfectly normal. Maybe for an outside observer, from the west it might seem bizarre or comical but not here. They're respected and revered in some ways as well."" Watch: Gabon's hip-hop culture . With names like Demon and Gunsmoke it would be easy to dismiss the rockers as thugs. But in fact, the titles come with a strong awareness of social responsibility. ""We try to portray a good figure. We're trying to be role models. I know rock used to be a hardcore thing but actually it's something in our heart too,"" heavy metal head Gunsmoke said. ""It's all about brothers in arms. Brothers in metal -- we're there for each other. That's the way we identify ourselves."" The leather-clad rockers share a similar aesthetic to notorious motorcycle gang the Hell's Angels. But that's where the likeness ends. According to Gunsmoke, the African head bangers are seen as a type of guardian angel, rather than the Hell's variety. ""Kids follow us around. Parents approach us. We're there for a good cause actually. We help people on the streets at night,"" he said. And for the hardcore fans, heavy metal is more than just a scene -- it's part of the national identity. Even the Botswana president Ian Khama is a fan. Or at least that's according to Gunsmoke. ""We want to make him proud. He made us proud with one man like him leading the nation. Why should we be scared when our president is a rocker?"" Gunsmoke argued. ""Bots is known as a small country. People used to think it was a province of south Africa. ""But if we can stand tall on this family then we can be known as much as the country was unknown."" Watch: Building music schools in townships . It's a uniquely African movement, and one that celebrates a special spiritual connection to the land. Gunsmoke pointed to the use of animal horns in fashion, as a representation of Africa. ""Most of us are in a tribe. The totems are animals. We've got the crocodile, lion, hare, rabbit. You name it. It's part of your culture,"" he added. African mythology and folklore loom large in the lyrics of Botswana band Skinflint. CNN caught up with lead singer Giuseppe at a gig just outside the capital Gaborone. ""We have a lot of ancestral beliefs - back in the day they used to believe that if someone dies and you touch the dead person then Gauna will come and take your soul,"" he said. ""Gauna was created on a 7-inch vinyl and it was distributed by Legion of Death Records in France. We're the first ever African heavy metal band to release something on vinyl."" The white singer also pointed to the unifying powers of heavy metal, saying: ""The metal nation knows no racial boundaries. We're all one. We all speak one common language and it's called heavy metal. ""Metal is a music about power, independence and freedom. That's what I believe in --fighting for what you believe in no matter the consequences. Standing up for what you believe in and showing individuality.""

"(CNN) -- Recently, investors celebrated the birthday of the current bull market, which turned five years old. On this anniversary, it's worth reflecting on how valuations, particularly of technology companies, are being calculated. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb, a travel rental company, which has not released information about its revenue or profitability, may be approaching a valuation of $10 billion. Other startups in the IPO pipeline include a number of unprofitable companies like Box and Square, with rumored valuations in the billions. Have billion-dollar or multibillion-dollar valuations become the norm? Is it all about hype and greed nowadays? Whatever happened to the wisdom of investors like Warren Buffet who evaluated companies based on their profits and fundamental performances? The value of any company is a function of the cash flow it will generate in the future. A healthy cash flow allows a company to repay its shareholders and initial investors who, understandably, expect their investment to be eventually reimbursed. Ordinary investors who rely on the hype surrounding a company rather than the company's fundamentals may make decisions that they regret later on. Just ask anyone who invested in the Pets.com IPO about the danger of falling for overvalued companies. Granted, everyone in the tech industry -- from startup founders to venture capitalists -- is eager to find and bet on the next big thing. Still, the money being thrown around is mind-boggling. Even a decent business model and the potential for growth do not justify a multibillion-dollar valuation. Yet, Facebook recently offered an astounding $19 billion to buy WhatsApp, a popular messaging service. Though WhatsApp has reportedly been able to turn a small profit, this overblown acquisition price is higher than the market cap of 275 companies in the S&P 500. Some market watchers have argued, as Michael Wolf did on CNN.com, that the WhatsApp acquisition is indicative of a fundamental shift, and that traditional ""old world"" methods of determining valuation have been replaced by ""new world"" metrics. For example, Wolf cited Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp at $42 per user, which is in line with price-per-user acquisitions of companies like YouTube, Tumblr and Instagram. This is one way of looking at things, but it's severely flawed. The value of a customer is in the revenue the customer provides, not in his or her mere existence. If we look at the price-per-user metric without evaluating revenue per customer, the analysis becomes eerily similar to the late 1990s, during the dotcom boom when, for example, number of ""eyeballs"" was a metric used to evaluate technology companies. Counting ""eyeballs"" or ""user base"" or ""potential"" only works in a bull market when market momentum can make poor decisions seem wise. Perhaps we remember the NASDAQ's high of 5048.62, during the height of the tech boom, and not when it fell to 1114.11 in 2002 when the tech bubble burst. But bull markets do not last forever, and it's important to make sure we're evaluating companies based on their long-term value, regardless of market cycle. Of course, not all overvalued companies are ""bad"" companies. Twitter, for example, has a sizable user base, solid revenue growth and an undeniably disruptive and innovative technology. It's safe to say that Twitter has a lot of potential. However, the company's valuation is simply not justified by its fundamental performance. Twitter's stock is trading at nearly 45 times its 2013 revenue, and its profit multiple (a company's market value expressed in terms of its earnings) is nonexistent, given that it has yet to establish a profitable business model. Sure, there are some companies, like Amazon, that don't meet traditional metrics of financial strength that end up performing incredibly well in the stock market. But they are the exception, not the rule. Consider the example of Vonage, one of the hottest IPOs of 2006. Despite losing 97 cents of every dollar in sales, the company had a $2.6 billion valuation. The company's fundamentals did not match its valuation. The results speak for themselves, with Vonage shares currently trading at $4.53, down from their $17.00 IPO price. We are forced to accede to the most logical and rational valuation methods; otherwise, there is no structure to making investment decisions. For every Amazon, there are several Vonages. Despite what some market watchers say, the ""old world"" method of valuing companies is still the best way of valuing companies. I suppose it's true that Christopher Columbus made a great discovery by sailing the wrong way around the earth trying to find India. Here is a case where somebody happened upon great success based on incorrect data and methods. However, investors placing their bets on tech companies without basic fundamentals are more likely to resemble Ponce de Leon: map-less and looking hopelessly for the Fountain of Youth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Hamilton.","Brian Hamilton: Have billion-dollar valuations of companies become the norm?
Hamilton: Even a decent business model does not justify such high numbers .

"(CNN) -- Russia will begin the construction of a new naval base this year in Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region of Abkhazia, according to a Russian media report Monday. Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine that expires in 2017. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted an unnamed official at Russian naval headquarters as saying it wanted to station vessels at the Abkhaz port of Ochamchire on the Black Sea, Reuters.com reported. ""The fundamental decision on creating a Black Sea Fleet base in Ochamchire has been taken,"" the official told Tass, in quotes carried by Reuters.com. ""This year we will begin practical work, including dredging, along Abkhazia's coast. ""It will take more than a year to implement all works."" The official added that the deployment was to protect the breakaway region from Georgian attacks. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7 last year. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have made accusations of ethnic cleansing. Moscow has since recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent regions -- a move which angered many Western governments who suspect Russia of acting to thwart Georgia's ambitions of joining NATO. This latest development comes despite comments made last year by Abkhazia's leader that his territory would not be hosting Russian military bases. ""There will be no new bases,"" Sergei Bagapsh told Russia's Novosti news agency, adding that Russia's Black Sea Fleet will not be based in the republic either. ""Only units of Russia's ground forces that have always been based here will continue to be stationed in Abkhazia,"" he said. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is currently based in the port of Sevastopol which belongs to Ukraine -- another former Soviet state which, like Georgia, aspires to NATO membership. The fleet is due to leave Ukraine for good in 2017, in line with a 20-year lease deal signed in 1997. However, Russia's diplomats and military have said they want the fleet to stay at its traditional home base after the expiry of the deadline, Reuters.com reported.","Official: Russia to station vessels at Abkhaz port of Ochamchire on Black Sea .

"(CNN) -- Forget sitting by a roaring fire as snow falls outside -- for many there's no better place to celebrate the festive season than by the water's edge on a warm summer's evening. But if you can't escape the cold to hit the ocean this year, these songs will help you to forget the chill and take you to the sea, wherever you may be. We've got your seaside playlist covered. But what's your favorite sea-inspired tune? Let us know in the comments below. ""Beyond the Sea,"" Bobby Darin . No sea-inspired playlist would be complete without this song. ""Beyond the Sea"" has been sung by many artists over the past six decades, but Bobby Darin's version is undoubtedly the most famous. Despite the performer recording the song in the late 1950s, it's been used in many recent films from ""Austin Powers"" to ""Finding Nemo."" Fellow actors Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz sung ""Beyond the Sea"" in the film ""A Life Less Ordinary,"" while Kevin Spacey lent his vocal chords to it in a biopic about Darrin named after his most famous song. ""Sail on Sailor,"" The Beach Boys . It's hard to go past The Beach Boys when compiling a list of seaside classics. The group -- made up of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, along with Mike Love and Al Jardine -- are synonymous with beach tunes and surfing hits. ""Sail on Sailor"" was released on the 1973 album ""Holland,"" one of the last albums the Californian pop group released. ""Under the Sea,"" from Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" While perhaps not a traditional party song, it is a childhood favorite for many. In the movie, mermaid princess Aerial longs to join the human world above the water's surface. However, the king's advisor, a lobster called Sebastian, tries to convince her otherwise, singing to her about the joys of ocean life, telling her ""darling it's better, down where it's wetter."" ""Octopus's Garden,"" The Beatles . The fab four recorded this song for their 1969 album ""Abbey Road."" Unusually for The Beatles, this song was written by drummer Ringo Starr, who was also the lead vocalist on the track. The upbeat tune tells of the carefree nature of an octopus's life below the surface, featuring lyrics such as ""in our little hideaway beneath the waves, resting our head on the sea bed."" ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,"" Otis Redding . This was the last song recorded by Redding before he was killed in a plane crash in 1967. It was released after his death and was the first posthumous song to reach the number-one spot on the U.S charts. Redding was also posthumously awarded a Grammy for the song in 1968. He was inspired to write the soulful masterpiece after staying on a houseboat in California. ""The Ocean,"" Led Zeppelin . British rock band Led Zeppelin penned this tune in the early 1970s at the height of their success. It's believed the band were referring to their ""ocean of fans"" when they wrote this song, with lyrics such as ""singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar."" But it's just as easy for a keen seafarer to imagine dramatic ocean waves when listening to this tune. ""Girl and the Sea,"" The Presets . For a change of pace, this tune could be perfect to get your party started. By electro-pop act The Presets, ""Girl and the Sea"" is guaranteed to get people on the dance floor. It's said the duo recorded this song, their debut, in the bathroom of their home. ""Mermaid in the Night,"" Jimmy Buffett . For those who appreciate country music, Jimmy Buffet's ""Mermaid in the Night"" is the perfect ocean-inspired song. It appears on the 1989 album ""Off to see the Lizard,"" just one of the more than 30 albums Buffet has released. This fun tune tells of the singer falling in love with a mermaid while fishing one evening, with lyrics like ""I'm in love with a creature from the sea, she brings out the crustacean in me"".","MainSail looks at what could feature on your seaside playlist .

"(CNN) -- A California Republican group censured one of its own Thursday, saying her words and actions since sending an e-mail last month depicting President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee have been potentially offensive, damaging and insincere. Capping a meeting Thursday, the Orange County Republican Party's executive committee voted 12-2 Thursday to issue an ethics censure against Marilyn Davenport. GOP official sorry for racist e-mail . ""The Republican Party of Orange County condemns racism in any form, and this censure is consistent with that position,"" the group said in a statement. A phone call Thursday night to Davenport, for her comment on the censure, was not immediately returned. Last month, she found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an e-mail she says she received from a friend. It contained a doctored photo styled like a family portrait, showing two adult chimpanzees and a baby. The younger chimpanzee had a photo of Obama's face superimposed over the animal's face. The caption that ran with the photo read, ""Now you know why no birth certificate."" Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the e-mail was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. It referred to debate over whether or not Obama was born in the United States. Soon after it came out, the county's GOP chairman, Scott Baugh, called for Davenport's resignation in a Twitter message posted on the group's website. California's Democratic Party has also demanded that Davenport step down. In an apology that included two Bible passages, Davenport initially said she would not repeat her error. ""I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life,"" the statement said. ""I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry."" Later, on April 20, she told reporters she wanted to ""humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness for my unwise behavior."" Davenport admitted that, ""unintentionally, I have offended many"" -- though she insisted that she was not racist. She has refused to resign, citing what she called an overwhelming number of appeals she has gotten from her constituency asking her not to do so. She represents the state's 72nd Assembly District for the Republican Central Committee. In its statement Thursday, the Orange County Republican committee called out Davenport and said that she was aware the e-mail ""could be viewed as offensive."" ""Then instead of owning up to her mistake and putting an end to the story, Mrs. Davenport immediately sought to blame others and downplay the matter as a joke,"" the GOP committee said, calling the first apology she'd made in a statement ""not contrite"" and ""conditional."" The committee viewed her second apology as more sincere, while noting that the ""three-day delay in issuing that apology resulted in a torrential barrage of unnecessary media attention."" ""Finally, the committee found that much of the good that was accomplished by Mrs. Davenport's second apology was undone by going on a media tour that continued to blame others for her actions,"" the statement said. During her press conference, Davenport referred to the e-mail as ""political satire"" -- insisting she had no intention of doing anything that would be racist. Obama and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate indicating he was born in Hawaii when he was running for president in 2008. On April 27, after months of further speculation amid claims he was born in another country, he released the long-form of the same certificate in hopes of finally quelling the controversy. ""We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We've got better stuff to do,"" the president said afterward.","An Orange County's Republican committee censures Marilyn Davenport .

"(CNN) -- On a breezy spring day in 1835, a 13-year-old boy from the Jura region of eastern France set out for the glittering metropolis of Paris to seek his fortune. He traveled the 292 mile road on foot, sleeping wherever he could find shelter and taking odd jobs to survive. It took him two years to reach the city, where he promptly became an apprentice to a box maker, and ultimately opened his own chest-making workshop. His name was Louis Vuitton. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault tells CNN's Isa Soares what's the secret of Louis Vuitton's longevity. A century and a half later, the eponymous company he founded is among the most recognizable luxury brands in the world and, according to Forbes, is worth nearly $30 billion. It's part of the LVMH consortium whose CEO (and France's richest man), Bernard Arnault, spoke exclusively to CNN about the firm's heritage, and the spirit of adventure which, he says, defined it from the start: ""The history of Louis Vuitton is linked to travel. We created luggage for explorers, and during the 20th century our products gradually evolved to reflect the lifestyle of the customer."" Louis Vuitton was one of the first luxury retailers to open boutiques in China and Mongolia and now the label is seeking new frontiers -- looking towards unexplored markets in Indonesia and South America. ""When I went to China in 1991 for the opening of the first Louis Vuitton shop, you hardly saw any cars on the streets of Beijing, only bicycles. In spite of that we opened a luxury boutique, and now we have more than 20 across the country"" says Arnault. The company is ever keen to trumpet its craftsmanship ethos. Indeed, many items are still hand-made in its French factories - with some workers being trained between 18 months and two years. Mr Arnault credits this attention to detail with Louis Vuitton's longevity on the luxury market. Paris vs New York: Who wins in clash of the culture capitals? The brand's well-known LV monogram was introduced in 1896 in an effort to combat counterfeits, but Arnault says that it doesn't take a logo to recognize the company's signature handicraft: ""What made Louis Vuitton famous was the quality. We don't do marketing, we just create products which are exceptional in their design and craftsmanship."" Flamboyant flair . In 1997 the company hired Marc Jacobs as the creative director, initiating a long-standing and successful partnership that come to an end in 2013. Jacobs designed Louis Vuitton's first ready-to-wear clothing line which premiered at Paris Fashion Week to both critical and commercial success, and the brand has since become known for its theatrical and flamboyant fashion shows. ""It's very important that when you have a designer like Marc Jacobs, who is a genius, you give him complete freedom. So what you see as theatrical scenery is in fact his creativity poured into the fashion show"" says Arnault. Staging a runway presentation remains crucial when it comes to capturing the imagination of customers and the media, even if some of the more outlandish designs don't make it from the catwalk to the stores: ""Fashion week is a moment in which designers can show their ideas to the world. On the catwalk you see pieces which are innovative and trigger the desire of the customer. From these ideas you can then create products which follow that direction, but in a more accessible way."" Spirit of entrepreneurship . Louis Vuitton's parent company LVMH also owns French luxury giants Christian Dior, Givenchy and Dom Perignon, and Arnault travels the world at the helm of the consortium much like an ambassador of Gallic style. Is Paris still cool? Hell yeah! (But not for the reasons you think) However, he also looks beyond the world of traditional, large companies, and is eager to apply the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley to fashion establishments in Paris and London. ""Today everybody, including myself, is interested in internet start-ups. But you also have start-ups in the designer world, and it's fascinating to see how we can transform a small company into something very successful on a global scale"" he says. And when it comes to his goals for the future? ""We want Louis Vuitton to still be the number one brand in ten years. In our business, the most important word is desire, so we want to continue creating desire."" Watch: Why is Paris Fashion Week so important?","Louis Vuitton started as a trunk maker for the French elite, including Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III .
The company has always had a spirit of adventure at its core .
Today, it is one of the most valuable luxury brands in the world ."
"(CNN) -- As ""True Blood"" nears its series finale, it's taking some of its best characters down with it. The series' seventh and final season opened with a major death, and the third episode, Sunday's ""Fire in the Hole,"" served up another shocker. Joe Manganiello's werewolf, Alcide, who's been running with the ""True Blood"" pack since season three, was unceremoniously killed off with bullets to the chest and the head. ""Alcide's character deserved so much more than what he got in this series,"" tweeted one fan. ""I'm just...devastated."" ""HOW COULD THEY DO THIS,"" wailed another distraught viewer. One fan may even have to rethink Sunday night's TV lineup: "" 'Alcide' couldn't have died in this episode of True Blood... He's the reason why I watch this show."" But according to the actor who portrayed the incredibly buff Alcide, it was time for the wolfy guy to die. In several interviews, Manganiello has said that he wasn't surprised that his character was killed off, and in fact, he understands why his death was necessary. ""Honestly, I called it as soon as I read the finale last season,"" Manganiello told TVLine with a laugh. ""There was no way they could keep him around. ... On a show like this, where you're looking for vital characters to kill off, you've got to take out Alcide."" Besides, the main star of the show is still Anna Paquin's Sookie, whose dance card has been filled with one too many supernatural paramours. With ""True Blood"" having only so many episodes left to tell its tale, Manganiello believes it makes sense to remove Alcide from Sookie's romantic circle so she could deal with her vampire issues. It may be hard for fans to let him go, but, he argues, Sookie needs to. ""Storytelling-wise, you have to get Sookie with (Stephen Moyer's) Bill; that's the beginning of this whole story,"" the actor explained to BuzzFeed. ""That's the A plot of the show. The B plot is (Alexander Skardsgard's) Eric. ... I'm not even the C plot. ... I'm like indigo on the rainbow if Bill is the red. Alcide would be a smart choice for her inevitably, but you can't have me wind up with her at the end. So, what? They're going to have her break up with me? They're going to have her break the heart of the best guy she knows? The guy who would do anything for her? They can't do that because then the audience is going to hate her for breaking his heart. That's why they had to kill him."" At the very least, Manganiello seems OK with his exit from the show. ""I die naked in the woods with nothing but my sock on,"" the actor told The Hollywood Reporter. ""Given Alcide's track record on the show, I was like, 'that's about right.' ""","""True Blood"" has killed off another favorite character .

"(CNN) -- Few things are ever certain in the murky world of post-Soviet politics, but the balance of evidence as it stands points overwhelmingly towards pro-Russian separatists as the perpetrators of Thursday's missile attack that caused the death of 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. If this becomes the settled conclusion of the governments around the world once all the facts are known, the consequences for Vladimir Putin are likely to be severe. Throughout his time as Russian leader, Putin has been adept at exploiting divisions within the international community; playing governments off against each other and sensing when the reluctance of certain countries to act would provide him with greater freedom of maneuver. So far he has just about managed to get away with annexing Crimea and destabilizing eastern Ukraine. Germany, unwilling to disrupt economic ties, has played a crucial role in limiting the scope of Western sanctions and Putin has been able to draw on reserves of good will in the developing world to overcome the threat of full international isolation. MH17 puts all of that in jeopardy. The thing that will worry Putin most is that so many of the victims were from the European Union, including more than half from the Netherlands alone. The Dutch are relentless at using EU channels to challenge those deemed to have harmed their interests -- just ask the Serbs. The start of Serbia's EU accession negotiations was single-handedly blocked by the Dutch until Belgrade finally handed over General Ratko Mladic to the Hague war crimes tribunal in 2011. Mladic was held responsible for humiliating Dutch peacekeepers during the Srebrenica massacre sixteen years earlier. Jet downing a 'game-changer' in world relations with Russia . With 193 of its own citizens among the dead, we can expect the Netherlands to demand European solidarity in the form of a much tougher response to the crisis. This will make it increasingly difficult for Germany to hold the line against the extension of sanctions. The overwhelming view among EU leaders will be that the fighting in eastern Ukraine must now be brought to a definitive end and that Russia bears primary responsibility for the fact that it has continued so long. This narrows dramatically the gap between European and American perspectives on the situation and creates the potential for a much more united Western policy towards Russia. A second troubling factor for Putin is that the Ukraine crisis has now touched the developing world in a serious way for the first time. Until yesterday it had been seen as a struggle between Russia and the West, with latent suspicion of the West among many emerging nations creating sympathy for Russian actions, if not actual approval. A major objective of Putin's post-Crimea diplomacy has been to capitalize on that sympathy in order to increase his options and reduce Russia's reliance on the West. He hastily concluded a gas deal with China and made a big play of his involvement in the recent BRICS summit. The death of so many Malaysian and Indonesians on MH17 leaves him with a lot of explaining to do. Sensing that he was losing the military initiative to a newly emboldened Ukrainian government, Putin had spent much of the last week preparing the way for a major escalation of Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces had become much more directly involved in the fighting and allegations that Ukrainian forces had fired missiles across the Russian border were intended to create a pretext for intervention. Because of this disaster he now finds himself on the back foot once again. Instead of being able to claim that he has been dragged reluctantly into the fighting, he now looks like the aggressor. America's Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, could not have been clearer in apportioning blame in her speech at the Security Council Friday: ""Russia can end this war. Russia must end this war."" The result is likely to be a Western ultimatum to Russia to comply with its previous commitments to rein in the separatists and deliver them to the negotiating table. If Putin refuses, the consequences could be twofold. The first is that the Ukrainian government would be given a much freer hand to continue and complete its ""anti-terror"" operations against pro-Russian forces. The second would be a further tightening of Western sanctions. If these included a shift to the long threatened ""sector sanctions"" covering whole industries, the impact could be severe at a time when the Russian economy is already looking extremely vulnerable. Having maintained the tactical initiative for most of the last four months, Putin suddenly faces an uncomfortable dilemma. Failure to co-operate in de-escalating the crisis invites the risk of deeper international isolation and real economic pain. But abandoning the separatists mean a loss of political leverage over Ukraine and an even bigger loss of face at home. On a purely domestic level, Putin has done well out of the crisis so far. Popularity ratings that were collapsing two years ago are once more at near record levels. But he has achieved this by unleashing nationalist passions he doesn't entirely control. Whatever course he chooses, it is unlikely that his leadership will emerge unscathed. READ MORE: Families grieve for victims . READ MORE: Who should investigate crash?

"(CNN) -- More than 55,000 cases of dengue, a sometimes deadly mosquito-borne disease, have been reported in a southeastern Brazilian state in the past four months, authorities said Thursday. The disease has killed 67 people this year in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, the state's ministry of health reported. Slightly less than half of the deaths were children under the age of 13, the ministry said. Brazilian authorities are calling the situation an epidemic. The ministry of health did not identify whether the deaths were attributed to the more severe form of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever, which ""can be fatal if unrecognized and not properly treated,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC said that with treatment, fatalities due to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by abnormal internal or external bleeding, can be less than 1 percent. Dengue fever, the more common form of dengue, is caused by four closely related viruses. All of them are carried by infected mosquitoes, mainly the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the CDC said.  Watch a report on the outbreak » . It cannot be spread from person to person. The Rio de Janeiro health ministry said 513 of its 57,010 cases of dengue were that of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

The newspaper said the average hospital waits ranged from eight to 28 hours in some places. One father told O Globo, ""I am just watching my son die slowly as we knock on different hospital doors."" The state's secretary of health, Sergio Luiz Cortes da Silveira, acknowledged, ""We don't have enough hospitals for these patients.""

Earlier this week, the country's health minister, Jose Gomes Temporao, said that 2,000 people, including members of the Ministry of Health and the military, were working to combat the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the government reported on its Web site. At least part of this work, he said, included going door-to-door to inform people of where the mosquitos live. ""Without the mosquito, dengue does not exist,"" he said, according to the government. The CDC estimates that there are 10 million cases of dengue around the world each year. ""It actually is quite common,"" said Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC.

"(CNN) -- Brad Pitt has a warning for his accused attacker, Vitalii Sediuk: ""If he tries to look up a woman's dress again, he's going to get stomped."" That's what the actor said on Monday in a statement released to People magazine, referring to the former Ukrainian TV reporter who has had two recent run-ins with actors at red carpet events. On May 28, Sediuk jumped the rope on the red carpet at the ""Maleficent"" movie premiere and attacked Pitt. Earlier that month, Sediuk went after actress America Ferrera, jumping under her dress on the Cannes Film Festival red carpet. That incident resulted in his being fired from his position with Ukrainian television channel 1+1, and Sediuk was later charged with one count of battery, one count of assault and two violations of the Los Angeles municipal code following his altercation with Pitt. In his statement, Pitt gave his version of what happened between him and Sediuk as the actor strolled the red carpet in support of the film starring his partner, Angelina Jolie. ""I was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me,"" Pitt said in his statement. ""I took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked him twice in the back of the head -- not too hard -- but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses."" The ""Benjamin Button"" star went on to say that Sediuk's actions might influence how celebrities interact with the public in the future. ""I don't mind an exhibitionist,"" Pitt said, ""but if this guy keeps it up he's going to spoil it for the fans who have waited up all night for an autograph or a selfie, because it will make (celebrities) more wary to approach a crowd.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Hurricanes are rare in Hawaii. It's even rarer when an incumbent governor or senator loses a primary election in the state. It had never happened before Saturday. Hurricanes Iselle and Julio left the state intact this week, but a Democratic primary election washed Gov. Neil Abercrombie from office. State Sen. David Ige defeated him and will face Republican Duke Aiona November's general elections. Hawaii's incumbent U.S. senator, Brian Schatz, might also get doused. His primary race against Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is too close to call. Just 11 votes separate them. President Obama, in a rare move, chose sides in a Democratic primary, supporting Schatz's bid earlier this year. But the President's decision is at odds with the dying wish of the senator whom Schatz succeeded. Days before his death in 2012, Daniel Inouye made clear he wanted Hanabusa to succeed him. Abercrombie defied that request, instead appointing Schatz, who was then the lieutenant governor. Obama had also supported Abercrombie's reelection. Hawaii has long rewarded political incumbents. Since its statehood, no governor had ever lost in a primary in Hawaii.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ben Affleck's children are ""freaked out"" by photographers who camp near their home and follow them in public, the actor said. Affleck and his wife, Jennifer Garner, hope a beefed-up California law with keep the paparazzi at a distance when it takes effect on New Year's Day. ""My kids aren't celebrities,"" Affleck said in a wide-ranging Playboy interview. ""They never made that bargain."" The law, which Garner joined Halle Berry to lobby for, doubles to a year the jail time a photographer can get for harassment that ""seriously alarms, annoys, torments, or terrorizes"" children. The law applies to children under 16 who are photographed because of their parent's occupation. ""The tragic thing is, people who see those pictures naturally think it's sweet,"" Affleck said. ""They don't see the gigantic former gang member with a huge lens standing over a 4-year-old and screaming to get the kid's attention."" Affleck and Garner have three children: Violet, 8, Serafina, 5 next month, and Samuel, who turns 2 in February. ""The kids are always looking down because they're freaked out and scared of these people,"" Affleck said. ""And so they yell. Which is fine if you're Lindsay Lohan coming out of a club, or me, or any adult. With kids, it's tasteless at best."" Affleck recounted a case five years ago when a man was charged with stalking his family after hiding among the pack of paparazzi that followed his children to nursery school. The stalker ""who had threatened to kill me, my wife and our kids showed up at the school and got arrested,"" he said. ""I mean, there are real practical dangers to this."" A Los Angeles judge ruled the man was mentally incompetent to stand trial. He was committed to a mental health institution and ordered to stay away from the family for 10 years. The California law does not punish websites, newspapers or magazines for publishing photos of children taken in violation of the law. ""A lot of these photographs are being bought by legitimate magazines,"" Affleck said. ""In the UK, they have a good system: If you take a kid's picture, you have to blur out the face. It protects the privacy of children, any child. I wish we would do that here, though I don't expect it."" He wants a ""bubble of safety"" around his children, with cameras staying at least 100 feet away, he said. ""They all have 300-millimeter lenses.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen attacked a Saudi Embassy convoy in Paris on Sunday, stealing 250,000 euros ($334,000) and diplomatic documents, French police say. According to a police union spokesman, a Saudi prince was traveling with the motorcade, but the gunmen appeared to be most interested in the contents of one of the vehicles, forcing it to a stop by brandishing automatic weapons, but without firing a shot. The spokesman described the stolen documents as ""sensitive."" The gunmen's car was later found burned out and with the license plates removed. There was no sign of the gunmen, and police are investigating. Le Parisien said that the attack took place near Porte de la Chapelle in the city's 18th administrative district and that the gunmen were armed with Kalashnikov rifles. The website said Monday that the convoy of 12 vehicles was traveling from a hotel on the Champs-Elysees in central Paris to the Paris-Le Bourget Airport -- northeast of the city -- when two cars stopped it, seizing a minivan containing three people. Le Monde said five to eight robbers were involved. The newspaper quoted an investigator as saying the crime would be more complex if the diplomatic documents had been its target. Frederic Lagache, from the Alliance police union, described the offenders as ""a heavily armed and determined group of individuals,"" French news agency AFP reported. Saudi Arabia denied the car was an embassy vehicle. Its embassy said the car was a rental and the driver was a Saudi citizen who was headed to the airport. ""On the way, the driver was forced to get out the car. The luggage and car were stolen,"" it said. CNN's Marion Lory contributed to this report from Paris, and Susannah Cullinane reported from London.","NEW: Saudi Arabia denies it was an embassy car .

"(CNN) -- If you plan a stroll along the lanes of the Iowa State Fair, you'll be able to see the usual Butter Cow, the famous Double Ferris Wheel and have more than ""60 delectable items on a stick"" from 200-plus food vendors. You might even take a selfie with ""God Bless America,"" a 25-foot traveling sculpture depicting Grant Wood's famous ""American Gothic."" But because of a restrictive ruling from a federal judge on Tuesday, one thing you won't see is Jason Powell on the sidewalk bordering the fairgrounds. On August 15 and 16 of last year, Powell was ejected from a public sidewalk surrounding the fairgrounds as he tried to preach to attendees while holding up a sign proclaiming the Gospel. Powell filed a lawsuit in June of this year, in which he claimed his First and 14th Amendment rights were violated. He says officers removed him from a public sidewalk outside the fairgrounds while he ""expressed his Christian beliefs."" It's a sidewalk even the defendants admitted was public. In the lawsuit, Powell said officers and troopers with batons and handcuffs surrounded him, demanding that he leave the spot outside a ticket gate. Powell said he chose the spot to make sure his message reached as many people as possible. Powell said he did not solicit money, harass anyone or encourage membership to any organization. He only wanted people to hear and see his message. Powell's attorney is Nate Kellum, president of the Center for Religious Expression. In an e-mail to CNN, Kellum said, ""Jason only represents himself and his understanding of Christianity. He tries not to focus on denominational issues. He does not receive support from any group."" Powell was issued an ejection notice and was told not to return for the remainder of the fair. Powell said the message he received from authorities at the fair was clear: Powell and his preaching were not welcome at the fair or on the sidewalks surrounding the ""greatest state fair in our fair state"" of Iowa. ""Jason was shocked and dismayed,"" Kellum said. ""He was doing what he believes he is obliged to do according to his faith and has a fundamental right to do according to U.S. Constitution. Being escorted away and told to never come back was demeaning."" After Powell received no response to a December 2013 letter asking the commissioner of the Iowa State Patrol and the state's attorney general for assurance that he be allowed to return to the public sidewalks outside the fairgrounds, he filed the federal lawsuit. Judge Robert W. Pratt for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa ruled that Powell can return only to two areas away from the main gate -- where Kellum said Powell's message won't reach anyone. ""We're disappointed and believe the court got it wrong. As it stands, Mr. Powell has no discernible relief,"" Kellum said. ""The only places where he can go on the fairgrounds and share his message are the two spots mentioned by fair officials where there is absolutely no foot traffic. The right to speak encompasses a corresponding right to be heard, and Mr. Powell is being deprived of that fundamental right."" Assistant Attorney General David Dorff said Tuesday, ""We are pleased that the court recognized the importance of maintaining the safety of people traveling into, out of and around the fair. We look forward to a fun, safe and well-attended fair.""","Jason Powell was ejected from Iowa State Fair for preaching on public sidewalk .

"(CNN) -- It was a beating, a thrashing, a rout, a waxing, a debacle. Sport is well-equipped with words to describe what took place in the semifinal match between Germany and Brazil on Tuesday, but none of them, at least not yet, can capture what really went down. One of the oft-cited reasons Americans give for not embracing the most popular sport in the world is the low-scoring action that generally personifies the so-called beautiful game. Excuse me? In this semifinal's first half, Germany scored five goals in 18 minutes, goals that came so fast and so furious one could hardly keep track: minute 11, minute 23, minute 24, minute 26, minute 29. The final score of 7-1, which propelled Germany into the final and Brazil into a game for third place, is historic in and of itself. And never before had five goals been scored in the first half of a World Cup match. Never before had four goals been scored in a six-minute stretch. And that it took place in Brazil is no small matter. Despite the uproar over the money the nation spent building soccer cathedrals, most Brazilians were not only ready to celebrate victory, they expected it. Their national team had not lost an official game on home soil since 1975, making the dream of winning the country's sixth World Cup title seem not just obtainable, but a sure thing. The most brutal (and funny) Germany vs. Brazil tweets . Without question, excuses can be made. Brazil played without its captain and central defender, Thiago Silva, who had been suspended after the match against Colombia for the accumulation of yellow cards. Without him, the Brazilian defense appeared powerless and confused against the likes of Thomas Mueller and company. Also missing, of course, was Brazil's star, forward Neymar, who had been kneed in the back by Colombian Juan Zuniga, fracturing a vertebra in his spine. But it is unlikely even a healthy Neymar could have created balance against such offense. Germany was relentless perfection, taking advantage of every opportunity Brazil offered while simultaneously creating its own prospects. Tears, puns and a Twitter record . Some now worry that the disenchantment on display before the tournament started -- the fury of protests against the billions Brazil spent on the tournament marked by ""Go Home FIFA"" signs throughout the country -- will reignite in force, now that the home team can only hope for a third-place finish at best. Indeed within seconds of the end, Twitter feeds wrongly assumed images of rioting Brazilians demonstrated postgame fury when, it turns out, people were posting older photos of the protests that had taken place throughout the spring. And as the inevitable finger-pointing against coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and his players begins, we can hope that sanity will prevail, taking to heart Scolari's wisdom in his wrenching postgame press conference that ""life goes on,"" rather than the criminal soccer passion that apparently led to the killing of Colombian Andres Escobar, who scored the own-goal that led to his team's loss against the United States in 1994. There are signs to give hope that the love for the game in soccer-crazed Brazil, a country that truly epitomizes what it means to live and breathe a sport, will transcend the devastation of the historic 7-1 score. At the conclusion of the semifinal match, weeping Brazilians stood in tribute to the German team, which had just handed them their most humiliating moment since their loss in 1950 to Uruguay, considered by many to be one of the most shocking results in World Cup history. 5 things about the beat down in Brazil . Without question, this game, and on home turf, trumps that earlier one. But the act of respect shown to Germany by the Brazilian ovation in Belo Horizonte stadium demonstrates how sometimes it is more important to love the game than to win a game. Because it's the beautiful game, indeed.","Amy Bass: Brazil trashed by Germany at World Cup, but it was more: It was historic .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya's finance minister has resigned after being named in a corruption scandal that threatened to damage the nation's fragile new unity government, Prime Minister Raila Odinga announced. Kenya's finance minister Amos Kimunya has resigned after being named in a corruption scandal. Amos Kimunya stepped down Tuesday, only days after he was quoted in local media reports saying that he ""would rather die than resign."" Kimunya had been embroiled in a scandal involving the controversial sale of the government-owned Grand Regency Hotel in Nairobi, which was reportedly purchased by a business group at a below-market price. Local watchdog groups criticized the sale, calling it secretive. Kimunya is widely regarded as an ally to President Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki recently entered into a power-sharing agreement with opposition leader Odinga after a dispute over December's elections that led to widespread violence. In the agreement signed in February, Kibaki remained president and Odinga became prime minister, the first time Kenya's government had both positions. Under the power-sharing agreement the parliament was seated equally with supporters of both men. Odinga told parliament Tuesday he was ""pleased that the minister of finance has deemed it important to step aside."" ""This government, as I said a few times last week, will not condone any kind of corruption. I say this on the authority of the government, that from the president to the prime minister, down to the assistant clerks in the government, nobody is indispensable."" An editorial Tuesday in the Kenyan newspaper The East African Standard said the scandal had damaged the already ""unhappy marriage"" between the factions.","Kenya's finance minister resigns after being named in a corruption scandal .

"Washington (CNN) -- With Congress mired in dysfunction over immigration, President Barack Obama says he'll do what he can to sidestep the legislative logjam. One possibility: using presidential authority to remove the threat of possible deportation for a few million immigrants living illegally in the country, a step that conservatives decry as amnesty. Here is a look at how we got here and steps Obama could take in coming months to address what all parties agree is a broken immigration system and boost the Democratic brand, though not necessarily in this year's congressional elections. What is the problem? An estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the United States, many of them for years or even decades. They work, go to school and otherwise participate in American society even though they broke the law coming here and lack papers allowing them to stay. An increase in tougher enforcement laws and resources without any corresponding legal remedies for undocumented immigrants led to the huge illegal population. White House mulls steps on immigration it can take on its own . While Obama's administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people, it shifted the priority from working immigrants targeted under predecessor George W. Bush to criminals, more recent border crosses and those who keep re-entering illegally. Obama had promised to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his first term, but wound up focusing on economic recovery and health care reform. Now he wants to deliver to the Hispanic American community, the nation's largest minority demographic that strongly backed him in both election victories and is demanding an end to the deportations that it says split up families and tear the social fabric. What are we doing about it? Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security. The legislation supported by all Senate Democrats and 14 Republicans would require immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government, pay a penalty, learn English and begin the process of applying for legal status. It also had the backing of the business community, organized labor and religious organizations. However, House Republicans have refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote. Conservatives say the Senate plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers, arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with U.S. citizens for jobs. Democrats want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible, allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship. Didn't Obama already stop deporting some children of immigrants? In 2012, the Obama administration changed its policy by halting deportations of some immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. The move came after GOP Senators in 2010 blocked a Democratic bill known as the DREAM Act that would have done much the same thing. Republicans argue the step meant Obama stopped fully enforcing immigration laws, saying they now mistrust him to carry out provisions for stronger border security that they demand in any new legislation. Before going home for this year's summer recess, the GOP-led House voted to reverse Obama's previous executive actions on immigration and prevent future similar steps. The provision pushed by conservatives has zero chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate. What about the current immigrant surge in Texas? Tens of thousands of new arrivals from Central America, many of them unaccompanied children, have overwhelmed immigration facilities and services in Texas in recent months. Republicans, particularly conservatives, say two policy changes led to the surge -- a 2008 anti-trafficking law that requires immigration hearings for most children arriving at the border, and Obama's 2012 decision to stop deporting some minors. Rick Perry says youths crossing the border is a 'side issue' Combined, the changes created a perception that children who make it into the United States won't get sent back, the critics argue. For now, the U.S. government considers the influx from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras a separate issue from the longstanding problem involving undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for years. House passes $694 million border bill . Obama has asked for more money to speed the processing and care of the new arrivals, but said most of the Central Americans arriving now will be returned to their home countries. So now Obama is going to take more actions on his own? Yes. When it became clear this year that the House wouldn't take up the Senate immigration bill, Obama asked the Justice and Homeland Security departments to come up with steps he could take on his own. Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that one potential option would expand the deferred deportation program of 2012 for so-called DREAMers -- children brought to America illegally by their families. Other possible steps include granting some kind of legal status to the foreign parents of U.S. citizens, and allowing some undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits, the sources said. Border crisis: GOP falls into a trap . The total number of immigrants affected could reach 5 million or more, some analysts say. ""There are so many ways they could cut this pie and define and protect a class"" of undocumented immigrants, one source told CNN, adding that the decisions expected next month would examine ""what's possible from a legal perspective, a policy perspective and also what's possible from a political perspective."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that ""the review of what the President is able to do is still ongoing,"" and whatever options emerge will not be as enduring or as strong as what Congress could do under the Senate legislation. What is the response? The Hispanic American community wants to see the details, but supports Obama acting on his own. However, it would protest if it considers the steps too timid. As expected, conservatives react with alarm and outrage. GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, perhaps the most vocal opponent on immigration reform, said last week that Obama ""wants to issue another 5-6 million work permits to illegal immigrants of any age."" That would violate existing law and be ""a direct affront to every single unemployed American, particularly those in our poorest most vulnerable American communities,"" Sessions said. House Republicans who recently authorized a lawsuit against Obama for changing how the health care reform law gets enforced warn of another legal challenge over further executive action on immigration. Why is this so hard? The long-term political stakes are huge. If reforms allow millions of immigrants now facing potential deportation to get eventual citizenship, Democrats would get the credit and the likely political loyalty of generations of Hispanic American voters. Republicans, meanwhile, are deeply divided over how to proceed. Conservatives warn that approving the Senate reforms or something similar would ensure that a Democrat occupies the White House for years to come. Rubio plunges into immigration debate head first . More moderate Republicans argue that failing to do so would bring the same result. ""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" the Republican National Committee concluded in its post-mortem of the 2012 presidential election, in which GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to Obama. ""If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only."" Despite that conclusion, House Republicans have blocked the comprehensive reforms passed by the Senate. Obama said last week such division leaves him no recourse but to act on his own. If he does before the November election, as expected, it could hurt some Democrats running in traditionally conservative states. That would amount to short-term pain for potential long-term gain. CNN's Athena Jones, Deirdre Walsh and Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report.","President Obama looks at what he can do without Congress .

"Long Beach, New York (CNN) -- Some New Yorkers mark the anniversary of the September 11 attacks by going to a memorial service or observing a moment of silence. For the past 10 years, Jeff Parness has been helping others. Every September, Parness brings hundreds of volunteers from New York to help another disaster-stricken community in the United States. ""It was our way of saying, you know, New Yorkers will never forget what people from around the country and the world did for us in our time of need after 9/11,"" said Parness, a 2011 CNN Hero. ""So that's how the mission started. It was just to pay forward the kindness that we experienced."" Over the past decade, Parness' nonprofit, New York Says Thank You, has assisted victims of wildfires in San Diego, tornadoes in the Midwest and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. Many of those who receive help are so inspired that they travel across the country the next year -- often at their own expense -- to volunteer with Parness' group and help someone else. The result is a unique disaster-response organization. ""All of our volunteers are survivors. They survived, whether it was 9/11 or Katrina or tornadoes. So they all share that common bond,"" said Parness, who quit his job as a venture capitalist to work on his nonprofit full-time. This year, Parness' mission has come full circle. Last weekend, more than 300 volunteers -- at least half of whom were from outside the New York area -- helped rebuild 13 homes damaged by Superstorm Sandy in October. For Parness, a native New Yorker, the work carried extra significance. Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11 . ""Being able to travel to other disaster sites and help people is one thing. When it happens in your own backyard, you go into shock,"" he said. ""I woke up and realized this was (like) Hurricane Katrina."" He pointed out around 650,000 families in New York and New Jersey had damaged or destroyed homes. More than 2,000 members of New York City's police and fire departments were severely impacted by the storm. And because first responders are a core part of his group's volunteer base, Parness decided to help them. With the support of corporations, foundations and private donors, his group is planning to rebuild 200 homes in all for active-duty first responders in the New York area. Police officer Charlie Sadler and his wife, Gina, had been married for less than three months when Sandy destroyed their Long Beach home. ""The damage to our home ... sea foam, seaweed, shells and starfish,"" Charlie Sadler said, ""there's no way to understand the sheer devastation that was in the house. The mold, the breathing problems ... our home was completely unlivable."" All of the couple's wedding gifts were under water as well. Ultimately, the house had to be razed, and they didn't have the resources to rebuild. Their challenges intensified when Gina had a cancer scare in the spring. But on the day of her exploratory surgery, they got the news that Parness' group would rebuild their home. ""We couldn't believe it,"" Charlie Sadler said. ""From sitting in that hospital room and wondering what was going to happen ... to building a brand new home from the ground up. ""It's a feeling of elation. It was unbelievable."" More than 100 volunteers worked on the Sadlers' home last weekend, including Mark Ford, who came from Slidell, Louisiana, to lend a hand. Ford, a former police officer, lost his home in Katrina. This is his third volunteer trip with Parness' group. ""(After the storm), I had a lot of people help me. The Sadlers needed our help, and so here we are, "" Ford said. ""Being here gives the Sadlers the confidence to know that they're not alone in this adventure."" For Parness, bringing people together is the most important part of his work. ""We want to lift up spirits and remember not just the tragedy of (9/11), but also the humanity of 9/12. ""We tell people it's never about the buildings. It's always about the people. At the end of the day, it's about giving them hope."" Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting .

"(CNN) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency will accept Iran's invitation to send inspectors to visit its Arak heavy-water production plant on December 8, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said Thursday. ""We have not yet answered, but it is for sure that we'll do this activity,"" he told reporters in Vienna, Austria. ""We will visit the site, we will do our necessary activities and we will report the facts to the Board of Governors,"" he said. But, he added, ""I'm not in a position to share the details of the activities -- this is a part of the safeguard activities, verification activities."" Over the weekend, Iran and six world powers, including the United States, reached an interim deal under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions. As part of the six-month deal, Iran is required to dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, halt all enrichment above 5% and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that enrichment. It also agreed to freeze essential work on the heavy-water reactor under construction at Arak, southwest of Tehran. But Amano noted that the invitation applies only to the heavy-water production plant, not the heavy-water reactor. Though the IAEA does not have inspectors stationed permanently in Iran, it has at minimum a team of two inspectors at any given time, and usually has two teams of two inspectors, he said. He added that his agency would probably need help to complete its task. ""I don't think we can cover everything by our own budget,"" he said. The heavy-water reactor has been of concern to international powers because that facility could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a potential nuclear bomb. Questions about the Arak reactor's fate had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations. Asked about the agreement that Iran will provide daily access to inspectors from the IAEA, Amano said, ""We would like to understand the objective and we would like to make it meaningful and useful."" The inspectors will be expected to visit centrifuge assembly and storage facilities and uranium mills, as well as the Arak site. Iran insists it's enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs. 'Welcome step' The IAEA has been following a parallel but separate track to the six world powers in negotiations with Iran. This month, the nuclear watchdog and Tehran agreed on a framework for further cooperation, and the IAEA said then that its inspectors would carry out a technical visit to the Arak plant ""in the near future."" Iran has previously allowed IAEA inspectors access to the heavy-water reactor at Arak, said Shashank Joshi, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, so the latest visit is a ""welcome step"" in terms of increased transparency but may not reveal much that's new. The big question isn't about inspection of the heavy-water reactor, which is not yet operational, but rather what might happen to it in the longer term, Joshi said. What concerns many in the international community is that the reactor is a type that some other countries have used to make nuclear weapons, he said. For that to happen, the spent fuel must be reprocessed to extract the plutonium. Iran's agreement to freeze work at the Arak plant is more significant than it allowing the inspectors in, Joshi said. Tehran has said the plant could be operational next year, although most analysts believe its activation would be a lot further off, he said. The United States and other world powers do not want to see it ever switched on and would prefer Iran to turn it into a safer, light-water reactor, which produces less plutonium, he said. For its part, Iran has said it won't build a reprocessing plant next to the reactor. The inspectors' work in visiting the centrifuges used to enrich uranium may ultimately prove more important than monitoring the Arak plant, Joshi said. ""The issue at the end of the day is going to be whether Iran allows the IAEA more transparency in exploring alleged military aspects, its alleged nuclear weapons program,"" he said. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Inspectors will visit Iran's Arak heavy-water production plant next month, IAEA says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. anti-terrorism officials are pushing to get more air marshals on American jetliners and beef up efforts to screen visa applicants overseas after some stinging criticism from President Obama. Internal notices issued Tuesday and Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security ask employees to step up to train as air marshals and to serve at U.S. diplomatic posts abroad. Both moves follow Obama's call for immediate reforms to prevent the kind of ""potentially disastrous"" failure involved in the unsuccessful attempt to bomb a U.S. jetliner on Christmas Day. In particular, agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division are being sought out for air marshal posts, since they already receive some of the necessary training in their regular jobs. In 2008, CNN reported that fewer than 1 percent of the average of 28,000 daily commercial flights carried air marshals. Nor was an air marshal aboard Northwest 253 on its Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan . And DHS employees are being asked to volunteer for assignments at U.S. diplomatic missions to help State Department officials review applications for visas. The assignments, ""some of which are located in high-threat areas,"" would last at least 30 days, the notice states. ICE agents already are posted in a dozen countries to weed out applications from potential terrorists or criminals, but the new notice seeks people to conduct in-depth background checks and write intelligence reports. Federal officials told CNN they would back up State Department officials who lack law-enforcement experience to look for security threats. After meeting with his homeland security and counterterrorism team Tuesday, Obama told reporters that the government ""has to do better"" to stop attacks like the December 25 attempt to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253. The suspect in that attack, 23-year-old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was indicted Wednesday on six criminal counts, including attempting to blow up an airplane and attempting to murder the other 289 people aboard. An unclassified version of the administration's preliminary report on the plot will be released Thursday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. But privately, Obama told his national security team that the incident represented ""a screw-up that could have been disastrous,"" according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.","Homeland Security asks employees to step up to train as air marshals .

"(CNN) -- After almost two years in captivity, Peter Theo Curtis is finally home. The American released Sunday after being held in Syria briefly addressed a gaggle of reporters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Wednesday. ""I had no idea when I was in prison so much effort was being expended on my behalf,"" he said, explaining that he was grateful for those who tried to secure his release from Islamist militants. ""Total strangers have been coming up to me (saying), 'Hey, we're just glad you're home,' said Curtis, who was dressed in jeans, sandals and a T-shirt. ""I suddenly remember how good the American people are and what kindness they have in their hearts,"" he added. ""I'm overwhelmed by emotion."" The 45-year-old professional writer thanked journalists for expressing such great interest in him, but he said he had to bond with his mother and he just couldn't bring himself to give an interview now. ""That's all I can say to you,"" he said, promising to give interviews later and ""help you guys do your job."" ""I will respond,"" he said, ""but I can't do it now."" He then stepped away from the cameras. An end to a traumatic ordeal . Curtis flew Tuesday from Tel Aviv, Israel, to the United States, stopping in Newark, New Jersey, before reuniting with his mother in Boston, his family said earlier in a news release. ""I have been so touched and moved, beyond all words, by the people who have come up to me today -- strangers on the airplane, the flight attendants and, most of all, my family to say welcome home,"" Curtis said. Curtis' mother Nancy, said she was ""overwhelmed with relief"" that he had returned. But given the recent death of American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded by militants with ISIS, she couldn't bring herself to celebrate. Curtis was believed to have been captured in October 2012 and held by al-Nusra Front, a rebel group with ties to al Qaeda. Al-Nusra is a different rebel group than ISIS. ""I don't think anybody's in the mood of celebration. You know, we're relieved,"" Curtis earlier told CNN outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""But after the events of the last week and knowing those other children of my friends are in danger, you know, I have very conflicted emotions. I've come to know the other families as well, and these kids have a lot in common."" Matt Wormser, a Vermont resident and Peter Theo Curtis' former high school roommate, said it was a ""very bittersweet time"" for friends and relatives of the freed hostage. ""It's been tremendously difficult for Nancy,"" he said. The first person Curtis contacted after confirming that her son had been released was Foley's mother, Diane, she told ""ABC World News Tonight."" ""You learn to get over the panic,"" Nancy Curtis told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""You learn to just take each hour as it comes."" Handing over a prisoner . The United Nations said Peter Theo Curtis was handed over Sunday to U.N. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, which is under Israeli government control, and was given a medical checkup. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Curtis was brought to Tel Aviv, for medical evaluations. Harf said he appeared to be in good health. Curtis made a brief call to his mother Sunday, Nancy Curtis said. ""He said, 'Mom, they're just being so nice to me. They put me in this wonderful hotel, and I'm drinking a beer, and there are women out there,' "" she recalled. ""Because he's been in a cellar for two years, and he hasn't seen anything, no street life or obviously no women to be seen, and so he was really excited, and he was thrilled to be in Tel Aviv and frustrated that he can't go out because the place apparently is surrounded by paparazzi."" Curtis expressed gratitude to many for helping secure her son's release, including the FBI, Secretary of State John Kerry, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Atlantic Media Chairman and owner David Bradley, U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and, especially, the government of Qatar. ""Here's this extraordinary woman, and she said, 'We are going to get Theo free,' and after we made those contacts, things moved rapidly,"" Curtis said of Alia Al Thani, Qatar's permanent representative to the United Nations. Qatar recently helped arrange the exchange of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only U.S. service member held by militants in Afghanistan, for five Taliban detainees held in the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The United States was not involved in negotiations for Peter Theo Curtis' release but was aware of private efforts to secure the release, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. Harf said Qatari officials ""told the family very clearly that they did not pay ransom"" -- something the United States government, as a policy, doesn't do when dealing with kidnappers and terrorists.

"(EW.com) -- The girl on fire is still burning bright! Lionsgate's hotly anticipated sequel ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" trounced the competition over its first weekend at the box office, pulling in an estimated $161.1 million. That gross handily beats the $152.5 million opening of ""The Hunger Games,"" which opened in March 2012, and it stands as the best November debut of all time ahead of ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"" which bowed with $142.9 million in 2009. Only three films have ever opened higher than ""Catching Fire"": ""The Avengers"" ($207.4 million), ""Iron Man 3"" ($174.1 million), and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" ($169.2 million). 'Hunger Games: Catching Fire': Test your smarts! Many prognosticators (this one included) thought ""Catching Fire"" might surpass ""Iron Man 3's"" opening earlier this year, but the superhero sequel had the notable advantage of 3-D ticket sales, and ""Catching Fire"" fell short. Still, if estimates hold up when final grosses are released tomorrow, ""Catching Fire"" will have bested ""The Dark Knight Rises"" as the highest 2-D opener of all time. (""Rises"" pulled in $160.9 million during its opening weekend in 2012.) Even without 3-D appeal, ""Catching Fire"" played very well on IMAX screens. The large-screen format accounted for $12.6 million of its domestic debut. ""Catching Fire"" played to audiences in all four quadrants. Crowds over 25 and under 25 were evenly split, and although the film had more female viewers than males (59 percent vs. 41 percent), more men turned out on opening weekend than for the original ""Hunger Games."" Females made up 61 percent of that film's opening weekend audience. The passionate moviegoers who saw the film this weekend awarded the film an enthusiastic ""A"" CinemaScore grade, which will yield great word-of-mouth as the film enters the lucrative Thanksgiving period next weekend. It seems likely that holiday business will help ""Catching Fire"" surpass ""The Hunger Games'"" $408 million domestic total, but we'll have to wait and see whether that actually happens. Review: 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' Internationally, ""Catching Fire"" is already doing double the numbers of ""The Hunger Games,"" which pulled in $283.2 million overseas for a $691.2 million worldwide total. ""Catching Fire"" grossed $146.6 million overseas in its first weekend from 63 territories, giving it a dazzling $307.7 million worldwide opening weekend. That's up 45 percent from ""The Hunger Games'"" $211.8 million global debut — a whopping $152.5 million of which came from the U.S. and Canada. ""Catching Fire,"" which stars current It girl (and Oscar winner for last year's ""Silver Linings Playbook"") Jennifer Lawrence, boasts a relatively slim budget compared to most mega-blockbusters. Lionsgate spent $130 million on the film — a major increase from the original ""Hunger Games'"" $78 million budget. For context, here are the budgets for untested franchise launchpads that tried to get off the ground earlier this year: ""The Lone Ranger"" ($215 million), ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" ($195 million), ""Pacific Rim"" ($190 million), ""White House Down"" ($150 million), ""Turbo"" ($135 million). None of those films earned, in their entire domestic runs, what ""Catching Fire"" earned in its first two days. ""Thor: The Dark World"" spent its third weekend in second place, but fell 61 percent to $14.1 million, giving the $170 million Marvel film a $167.8 million total after three weekends. ""The Dark World"" will probably surpass ""Thor's"" $181 million domestic total next weekend, but it now appears unlikely to endure much past the $200 million mark, which is somewhat disappointing given the Norse character's ""Avengers"" exposure. Fortunately, the superhero film is thriving overseas, where it's earned $381 million after four weekends. Worldwide, the film has now earned $548.8 million. 10 swoon-inducing YA couples . In third place, Malcolm D. Lee's comedic sequel ""The Best Man Holiday"" fell by a hefty 58 percent in its second weekend to $12.5 million. Though the film, which stars Taye Diggs, Regina Hall and Terrence Howard, dropped harder than expected — especially given its exemplary ""A+"" CinemaScore grade — in its second weekend, ""Holiday"" has already earned $50.4 million total, a great number considering it cost Universal just $17 million to produce. The studio has already ordered another ""Best Man"" entry. Disney attempted to counter-program against ""Catching Fire"" with the Vince Vaughn comedy ""Delivery Man"" this weekend, but the plan didn't work out. ""Delivery Man"" delivered just $8.2 million worth of ticket sales. Vaughn, who enjoyed a hot streak from 2005-2009 with films like ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""The Break Up"" and ""Couples Retreat,"" has struggled at the box office as of late. ""Delivery Man"" will join ""The Dilemma"" ($48.5 million total), ""The Watch"" ($35.4 million) and ""The Internship"" ($44.7 million) as under-performers on his filmography. Audiences, which were evenly split between men and women, gave the film a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. 'SNL' recap: The odds aren't really in Josh Hutcherson's favor . Fifth place belonged to ""Free Birds,"" which dipped 35 percent to $5.3 million in its fourth weekend. After an under-cooked opening weekend, Relativity's Thanksgiving-themed animation has held up well as the holiday approaches, though it has still earned only $48.6 million against a $55 million budget. 1. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" -- $161.1 million . 2. ""Thor: The Dark World"" -- $14.1 million . 3. ""The Best Man Holiday"" -- $12.5 million . 4. ""Delivery Man"" -- $8.2 million . 5. ""Free Birds"" -- $5.3 million . Two new openers made a splash in limited release. Disney's animated princess movie ""Frozen"" scored a cool $238,000 from one theater in Los Angeles, while the Judi Dench Oscar-contender ""Philomena"" drew $133,700 from four locations. On Wednesday, ""Frozen"" will move into about 3,600 locations (and provide the only real competition for ""Catching Fire"" over the Thanksgiving frame), while ""Philomena"" will expand to about 500 venues.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed in flooding in northern and eastern India, while the death toll in Nepal has passed 100, government officials in the two countries told CNN. At least 56 people have died in flooding and rain-related incidents in northern and eastern India over the weekend, with 28 deaths reported in Uttar Pradesh state, another 22 in the neighboring Himalayan region of Uttarakhand and six in Bihar state in eastern India. The heavy rains have hit thousands of villages along the border with Nepal, Kishan Singh Atoria, a regional disaster-management commissioner, told CNN Monday. India's water resources ministry warned that the Rapti river in Uttar Pradesh had risen to ""unprecedented"" levels in the state's Balrampur district. Nepal . Meanwhile, the death toll from floods and landslides in western Nepal since Thursday has reached 101 with another 126 people missing. More than 17,000 families have been displaced, according to government data. The biggest challenge for the government of this impoverished Himalayan country now is to provide relief to the people displaced since their homes have been washed away by the rivers, said Jhankanath Dhakal of the National Emergency Operations Center on Monday. Flooding was caused by incessant rain from Wednesday night to Friday night in some districts in western Nepal. ""Since the rainfall was unusually high the water could not flow in the rivers causing flash floods,"" said Dhakal. ""This was unexpected.""

"(CNN) -- Dockworkers at a major London port discovered 35 people inside a shipping container Saturday morning. One of them, an adult male, was declared dead at the scene, according to Essex police Superintendent Trevor Roe. Several others -- including children -- were said to have ""significant health problems,"" according to a police statement. Daniel Gore of England Ambulance Service said the patients -- all of whom were conscious when they were found -- are being treated for dehydration and hypothermia at three London-area hospitals. None of their conditions are believed to be life-threatening, he said. What caused the one death was not yet known. A homicide investigation is under way, according to Roe. 'Screaming and Banging' Workers at Tilbury Docks made the discovery after ""screaming and banging was heard from inside the container,"" Roe said. The stowaways are from the Indian subcontinent, said Roe, but it was not immediately clear if that is where their maritime journey originated, or when it did. What is known is that the container they were in arrived to Tilbury -- located on the River Thames about 30 miles east of London -- aboard a ship owned by P&O Ferries at 6 a.m. (1 a.m. ET) from the Belgian port city of Zeebrugge after a nearly nine-hour trip. Company spokeswoman Natalie Hardy told CNN that P&O Ferries operates two such trips a day between London and Zeebrugge. She said P&O Ferries does not inspect the contents of the containers it transports as a matter of company policy. Such checks, according to Hardy, are the responsibility of the UK Border Agency. There were 50 containers on the ship, according to Roe. He said they would all be thoroughly searched. British authorities blasted the ""criminal networks"" engaged in human trafficking. ""Today's tragic incident at Tilbury is a reminder of the often devastating human consequences of illegal migration,"" Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said in a statement. ""This incident is now a criminal investigation. Border Force officers are fully engaged with Essex police and the Tilbury port authorities as the necessary steps are taken towards bringing those responsible to justice.""

"(CNN) -- Crafting has come a long way since your grandmother's orange crocheted afghan throw. Today, handmade is big business. Perhaps this is nowhere more evident that on Etsy.com, a U.S.-based website that describes itself as an ""online crafts fair,"" where you can buy and sell just about anything you can dream of that's handmade. Etsy made its sellers a combined $314.3 million last year in gross merchandise sales and more than $146 million so far this year. The site has grown from about 200,000 active sellers in 2008 to 800,000 sellers, today, in 150 countries around the world. ""There is an added value for the buyer that comes from having a real interaction with the real human being that created each object,"" Etsy spokesman Adam Brown said. ""You won't find this at a shopping mall."" Etsy makes money by charging sellers a listing fee of 20 cents for each item and receiving a 3.5% commission on the price of each sale. It is free to become a member and sell items on Etsy. It's even spawned its own spoof blog, regretsy.com, that is described as ""the fail blog of handcrafts."" And more than a few folks have chucked their day jobs and started crafting full time. Husband-and-wife team Stephen and Betsy Carr of Asheville, North Carolina, have done just that to sell their handmade jewelry on Etsy and say they've made the right choice. ""We're creative people, and it feels incredibly satisfying to have made this creative life for ourselves,"" Betsy said. In the United States alone, crafting is a $29.2 billion-a-year industry with its own trends and niches, according to craftster.org. Conan O'Brien, the Smurfs, homemade cases for high-tech gadgets and one-of-a-kind clothes are among the hottest items right now in this creative universe. And if you're searching for something different or that's not mainstream, you probably won't have problems finding that, either. Conan as muse . Conan O'Brien is more than a late-night talk show host, he's a crafting muse. Fans of the comedian have been inspired to create illustrations, paintings, mixed media, digital art and edibles that look like the late-night star, and this work is sometimes showcased on his TBS television show and on his website. ""While we had never actively solicited artwork or crafts from fans, we were seeing so much incredible stuff posted across the Web, and were inspired to build 'Coco MoCA - The Museum Of Conan Art', an Internet gallery to celebrate these fantastic artists' talent,"" said John A. Wooden, general manager and executive producer of Team Coco Digital. The team has been very happy with the new museum of art and routinely display pieces of  its work on Conan's TV show, Wooden says. It may not be the Smithsonian or The Metropolitan Museum of Art, but this growing collection of art is creating a new avenue for artists to show off their work and building a lot of excitement in the arts community. No need to be a rock star or an ""A"" list celebrity to appear on Conan's show anymore. Fandom gets crafty . Coming soon from a crafter near you: Harry Potter shoes, Smurf-themed clothing and so much more. Pop culture is always trendy in the arts and crafts world and constantly changes with the times. Throughout this year, indie crafters are expected to be influenced by film releases like ""The Smurfs,"" and ""Red Riding Hood"" and fan favorites ""Twilight"" and ""Harry Potter,"" according to data and trends collected from the 1.3 million visitors a month who go to the craftster.org website. Consumers who can't get enough of these pop culture icons have plenty of artistic options to choose from this year, both online and at art and craft shows. So if you're in the mood to dress up like Red Riding Hood or decorate your home with candles that look like ""Twilight"" characters, you won't be hard-pressed to find what you need. ""Fantasy of any sort is perfect for inspiration and getting creative juices flowing,"" said Talia Roselli, a spokeswoman for craftster.org. ""When crafters can't find products in the marketplace that represent their love for their favorite characters and fantasy film narratives, they make them."" Art as iPhone accessories . Say goodbye to a bland-looking iPod charger and hello to one that best fits your personality and style. Blending traditional crafts with modern technology is hot in 2011. Artists will be inspired throughout the year, according to Roselli, to make cases for items like smartphones, iPads and Kindles, to name a few. ""We attribute this demand for unique tech accessories in large part to the highly personalized experience of using today's mobile technology,"" Roselli said. ""People want their devices to have a look and feel that reflects their personality."" So if an iPod charger that looks like your favorite novel is what you've been craving, then you're in luck. Rich and Brenna Neeley of Orange County, California, are among the artists on Etsy.com that cater to this niche of craft items. They sell iPhone and iPod chargers that look like new and vintage books. Brenna says her personal iPhone charger is a small book of poems that has sentimental value. ""Every time I plug in my device, it makes me smile,"" she said. ""It's more about how it makes me feel than what it does; the charging function is just a necessity of life these days."" And if books aren't your passion, then no need to worry. There are many other craft items you can buy for your favorite gadget, and if you can't find what you are looking for, many artists advertise the option of customizing a design for you. Fashion throwbacks . Retail and thrift stores are not the only game in town when it comes to clothing purchases. If you're looking for a new way to dress to impress, then a one-of-a-kind creation may be for you. Pleating, smocking and detailed embellishments in a style that mixes the 1940s and 1970s will be trendy throughout 2011 for crafters. ""It's a beautiful blend of old and new that we're seeing,"" Roselli said. Dressmaker Amanda Archer of Chicago sells her collection on Etsy and says she has always been drawn to vintage clothes and is pleased this style is popular. ""My designs always have a feel of retro and whimsy, but I also try to modernize my designs and think about what I would feel comfortable wearing without feeling like I'm in a costume,"" she said. Color choices reflect this mix of old and new, too, so if you're a fan of bright colors, then this is the year for you. Roselli says what's trending with indie clothes makers is an aged, natural color like a dusty brown or gray, complemented by a bold, rich color like honeysuckle, plum or yellow to brighten and modernize a garment or accessory.","Conan O'Brien, Etsy.com part of hottest trends in crafting right now .

"Editor's note: This article was originally published on August 29, 2013. (HLNtv.com) -- For most people it starts with a telltale, bulls-eye rash and flu-like symptoms. It then develops into neurological problems, such as numbness in the limbs or facial paralysis, leaving the patient in excruciating pain. About 300,000 Americans each year are infected with Lyme disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number, the CDC reported last week, is about 10 times higher than they had previously estimated. But what if you never get the rash? What if you blow off your symptoms as a bad case of the flu? I spent the first 30 years of my life in New England, where talk about Lyme disease was prevalent. When I was little my mother would have us slather on the DEET before we went outside made sure we had long pants and socks on, especially when we'd play in the woods. She'd check us for ticks and remove any she found with a match and tweezers. Problem solved -- no rash, good to go. Buzz off, bugs! How to stay safe during insect season . Then in 2006 I moved to Atlanta, and Lyme disease faded from my mind. Common in the Northeast, Lyme disease is found less often in the South. The year I arrived, eight cases were reported in Georgia, compared to 1,788 in my home state of Connecticut. I am now one of the cases for 2013. At least once a week, my muscles start to twitch uncontrollably; they tighten so much my fingers turn into fists. I can feel my fingernails digging through my skin. My heart races out of control and my blood pressure skyrockets. My doctor holds me down, consoling me, telling me to breathe because he has no idea what's going on. My face is numb, and it feels like I have the flu. I have trouble breathing. The pain is so bad I start to cry. A few years ago I noticed a pain radiating down my leg, starting from the small of my back. I had had artificial disc surgery in my spine a couple years prior and thought this new pain was due to scar tissue from the surgery. Then I went to work one day and lost all feeling in my legs. My arms were tingling and it felt like I had pins and needles everywhere in my body. I went to the ER, and that night, I became a medical mystery. I had a full body MRI (the first of many) and by the end of the night I had seen at least five neurologists. They chalked it up to my previously damaged spine, gave me some painkillers and sent me on my way. This sequence of events would continue for another two years. Each time the diagnosis would change, but the end result would stay the same. I saw a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, a urologist, a neuro-urologist, a kidney specialist, three different pain doctors and a pain psychologist. My diagnoses varied from heart disease to polycystic kidney disease to Lupus. I had many different neurologic disorders -- fibromyalgia, psychosomatic disorder and my personal favorite, neurosyphilis -- according to these doctors. I had multiple brain MRIs that revealed lesions in my brain; these were due to my high blood pressure, the doctors told me. I continued to get little headaches that would come, last for a minute and disappear. My legs would lose feeling and everyday it seemed like I was getting weaker. I would get Bell's palsy -- a syndrome where part of my face would be paralyzed and slump to one side. My body would twitch uncontrollably, and then tighten up to the point where I thought my bones would break. I was told my pain was all in my head, that it wasn't real. Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease . I should have been thinking about Lyme disease. I know several friends and family members who have contracted the disease. But I had moved to South. I didn't think I had been bitten by a tick. I had no rash. Still, research about my symptoms online showed late stage Lyme disease made sense. During an appointment with my neurologist last month, after another trip to the emergency room, I asked: What about Lyme disease? They tested my blood, and three days later the results came back positive. I was devastated. Had I only thought of it earlier, or had my doctors only thought of it earlier, the bacteria that manifests itself as the disease could have been eradicated. In the medical community, chronic Lyme disease is a controversial diagnosis. Lyme disease is usually treated with medication for no longer than 28 days. But for some, even when the bacteria that causes the disease is gone, the symptoms still remain. The CDC calls it post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. ""Approximately 10 to 20% of patients treated for Lyme disease with a recommended 2-4 week course of antibiotics will have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches,"" its website states. ""Most medical experts believe that the lingering symptoms are the result of residual damage to tissues and the immune system that occurred during the infection."" The CDC goes on to say that no studies have proven antibiotic treatment past three to four weeks leads to any improvement in the patient. Some doctors disagree. Since there is still so much we don't know about the disease, the controversy ensues. In the next few months, I will see what relief my treatment will bring. My only hope is that by sharing my story, others won't suffer the same fate as me.","About 300,000 Americans each year are infected with Lyme disease .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed and six injured in an attack on a refugee convoy in the eastern Luhansk region, Ukrainian authorities said Tuesday. Fighting continues around the town of Lutuhyne, near where the convoy was attacked, the website of Ukraine's counterterrorism operation said. The injured are hospitalized there, but the perimeter of the area is under fire, so no investigators or journalists can reach the scene. A spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council earlier said that the bodies of 15 civilians had been recovered as of Monday night. Col. Andriy Lysenko told a press briefing in Kiev that Ukrainian forces were being prevented from recovering other casualties by ""fighting in the area which is still controlled by the separatists."" The Ukrainian military said Monday that women and children were among those killed in the attack on the caravan of refugees. The civilians were trying to escape fighting between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military but were not in an established humanitarian safety corridor when they came under fire, a military representative said. Lysenko said Tuesday that the convoy was traveling from Luhansk to Lutuhyne when it was attacked. Militants are now blocking access to the area around the destroyed convoy and are shooting at all vehicles in the area, he said. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues for control of the city of Luhansk, a stronghold for pro-Russian rebels. The Ukrainian military has retaken one district, Lysenko said, and there is street fighting in the city center. Aid convoy halted . Humanitarian agencies say thousands of people in the Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk regions don't have access to water, electricity and proper medical aid. Ukrainian officials acknowledged Sunday that a convoy of more than 260 Russian vehicles on the border is, in fact, carrying humanitarian aid. But Lysenko said the aid had not started to move as of Tuesday morning, since the rebel Donetsk People's Republic has not given the necessary safety guarantees to the International Committee of the Red Cross. A small group from the ICRC has been sent to Luhansk to evaluate the situation there and assess how to proceed with the cargo delivery, he said. As of Tuesday, 77 cities and villages in Donetsk region are without electricity. The convoy initially sparked fears that Russia was trying to use a humanitarian convoy as a cover for sending in more aid and weapons for pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, which Russia and the rebels denied. The ongoing fighting -- sparked by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. Diplomatic moves . Efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine continue. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko spoke by phone Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, his office said. That conversation followed a meeting in Berlin on Sunday of the foreign ministers of Germany, Ukraine, France and Russia. ""We discussed the question of how we can find ways to reach an urgently needed ceasefire in eastern Ukraine,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. ""We discussed the question of how we can improve and optimize controls at the Russian-Ukrainian border."" Russia's Foreign Ministry said ""some progress"" had been made on issues including ending the hostilities, border control, the delivery of humanitarian aid and creating the conditions for a political settlement. Poroshenko also spoke Monday and Tuesday with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, when the Ukrainian leader slammed the attack on the refugee convoy and pointed to ""continuing provocations of the Russian Federation aimed at escalation of the security situation in the region."" Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to meet in Belarus next week at a summit also involving EU officials and the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan, the Kremlin said. Those two nations are members, with Russia, of the Eurasian Customs Union, a trade bloc. Ukraine signed a trade agreement with Europe this year in defiance of Moscow's wishes. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Will Ripley contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 17 dead and six injured after attack on refugee convoy, Ukrainian officials say .

"(CNN) -- Many Americans, including President Obama, have become fans of the Netflix series ""House of Cards."" The show, starting Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, is the story of the House majority whip who, through many devious machinations, becomes vice president of the United States. The show presents a devastating portrait of the nation's capital in which the major players care only about advancing their careers. Public policy and the democratic process are just vehicles for the fulfillment of Spacey's career ambitions. He is willing to resort to any tactic -- even murder -- to achieve his goals. Without question, the show is riveting. The writing is impressive, and the acting is phenomenal. It is difficult to avoid binge-watching one of the most compelling pieces of television in years. Yet the portrait of politics that ""House of Cards"" provides viewers is extremely skewed, a vision so devious and so cynical that it neglects the great things that our democratic process and our leaders have produced over time. ""Even in a landscape newly populated with cynical-to-downright-nihilistic political shows,"" wrote an editor for The New York Times, the show ""stands out for its unblinking commitment to a singularly dark vision of politics."" To be sure, politicians can be extraordinarily cold and calculating, ruthless in their pursuit of power, and some do spend almost all of their time figuring up how to move up the political ladder. But American politics has been much more than the world depicted in ""House of Cards."" Many politicians are ruthless and calculating but use those traits for bigger objectives and sometimes will risk sacrificing their career for principle. While serving as Senate majority leader, Lyndon Johnson famously relied on his ambition and thirst for power to produce some rather notable legislative accomplishments, such as the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 and the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Johnson did things that would make New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie cringe, but the results were often impressive. President Franklin Roosevelt could be ruthless with his opponents, isolating them from his inner circle and castigating them in public, but his terms in office produced a New Deal and won a world war against fascism. (Even Spacey's character was responsible for education reform in season one and entitlement reform in season two.) Our political system, with these kinds of power brokers at their helm, has produced great legislation. During the 1930s, the New Deal offered a federal blanket of security to America's workers -- by insuring bank accounts, providing old age pensions, regulating financial markets, legitimating industrial unions, enacting a minimum wage and more -- that have remained integral to the nation's landscape and were a foundation for the middle class. During the mid-1960s, LBJ and the 89th Congress used the government to help tackle many of the big problems that faced the nation, such as providing health insurance to the elderly through Medicare and Medicaid and guaranteeing that African-Americans would not have to live in racially segregated societies through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. American politics is also filled with examples of great leaders. Not everyone is as despicable as Frank Underwood. In the White House, the nation's first president, George Washington, set the bar when he voluntarily stepped down from power and demonstrated that the United States would not become a monarchy. Abraham Lincoln guided the nation through the brutal Civil War and brought end to the horrendous institution of slavery. Franklin Roosevelt led Americans through the Great Depression and a major world war, and Dwight Eisenhower, as Evan Thomas showed in his recent book, worked hard to calm the tension of the Cold War and find peaceful solutions to diplomatic challenges. John F. Kennedy carefully negotiated with the Soviets through the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, avoiding a catastrophic nuclear war, while President Ronald Reagan seized an opportunity for peace over an arms agreement in 1987 after the emergence of Mikhail Gorbachev, who wanted to change the course of world history. There have also been great legislative leaders whose ambitions made important contributions to Congress. Henry Clay set the bar in the 19th century for how a legislative leader could forge compromise. New York's Robert Wagner promoted many of the ideas that ultimately became the New Deal. His colleague Emanuel Celler spent much of the 20th century fighting from his seat in the House of Representatives to champion the cause of immigrants, workers and African-Americans. Michigan Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, a one-time isolationist, changed his tune and worked with President Harry Truman to design America's Cold War policies in the late 1940s. In 1964, Illinois Sen. Everett Dirksen, a staunch conservative, convinced a large bloc of fellow Republicans to come around to vote in favor of ending the filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rep. John Conyers brought the energy he developed during the civil rights movement to the halls of Congress, defending the Voting Rights Act during the 1980s and 1990s. Great ideas have also come out of Washington rather than the private sector. During the 19th century, the belief in public investment, the idea that the federal government should help create a national infrastructure to connect communities, took hold as public funds were used to build roads and create a mail system. Between the 1940s and 1960s, the federal government championed the cause of computing technology and space exploration at a time when neither seemed very profitable to most in the private sector. A number of politicians, such as Minnesota Sen. (and future Vice President) Hubert Humphrey, were central to promoting the idea of racial equality. So although ""House of Cards"" is a great show, viewers need to remember that politics is much more than that. We have become so cynical in this day and age that we can no longer see what is good about our democratic system. The history of our country reveals that this democratic process can also produce great things. Washington is more than a power game: It is a town where those in power have the potential to make important changes and contributions to our history. And sometimes, they have done just that.

"(CNN) -- Chinese fans will have a new reason to cheer when the 101st Tour de France kicks off on Saturday: 26-year-old Ji Cheng will become the first rider from China to compete for competitive cycling's highest honor. Ji, who will be riding with the Netherlands-based Giant-Shimano team, has competed in professional European cycling since 2007 and has already completed other top races. ""I am just really happy to race for my country in the Tour de France, I'm really excited,"" Ji, who comes from the northern Chinese city of Harbin, told CNN. He's dreamed of competing in the Tour since he began racing. ""When I started cycling in China, the Tour de France was the only race they showed on the TV,"" Ji said from Leeds, England, where the tour will begin. He's happy that his friends and family will get to watch him compete. As Ji qualifies for one of the most famous races in the world, his example could help kickstart China's nascent competitive cycling scene. 'Breakaway killer' Ji started his athletic career as a runner in school, but shifted to cycling soon after in part because of the cold weather in Harbin, where winter temperatures get below -4°F (-20°C) and cycling gave him the opportunity to train indoors. He started with track cycling -- in which racers do laps around a velodrome track on specialized bikes -- and then moved to longer distance road cycling. After training with a Hong Kong team for a year, he was signed by Shimano and moved to Europe in 2007. The Tour de France won't be the first milestone Ji has passed. He's also competed in the other two highest profile races in competitive cycling: the Vuelta a Espana, in which he raced in 2012 and the Giro d'Italia the following year. The three races collectively are known as Grand Tours, and he is the first Chinese cyclist to participate in each of them. Ji is known as a ""breakaway killer,"" which means he catches up with cyclists who try to get away from the pack of riders. It's not the flashiest role, but it helps position his teammates on the nine-man squad to win races. He says he doesn't have a strategy going into the Tour. ""My goal is to try my hardest for my team, and I hope I finish the whole three weeks."" Giant-Shimano coach Rudi Kemna said in a statement that Ji played an important factor in the team's formations. His participation in the Tour ""will be huge for him and his country and we look forward to seeing the impact this has on the globalization of the sport,"" Kemna said. Kingdom of Bicycles? Advocates hope that Ji's participation in the Tour could help competitive cycling gain attention in China. ""The fact that there is a Chinese racer in the race means the media and the public will focus on it much more,"" said Alain Rumpf, the director of Global Cycling Promotions, an organization affiliated with cycling's governing body, that promotes the sport around the world. ""Ji Cheng is a pioneer."" International teams currently compete in events like the Tour of Beijing, a top-level annual race that will have its fourth edition in October. Ji and several of his Shimano teammates competed in the race in 2013. But overall, international road cycling hasn't gained much traction in the country. China won three medals in women's track cycling at the 2012 London Olympics -- two silvers and a bronze -- but has lagged behind in road cycling. Some cyclists aim instead for China's National Games, where athletes represent their regions or cities. Cycling in general is also not as prevalent as it once was. China was known as the ""Kingdom of Bicycles"" in the 70's and 80's, when a bike was the main form of transportation for many. Now, as more people have moved into the middle class, mopeds and automobiles have started to replace bikes on the streets of Beijing and other cities, although there are still more than 8 million bikes in the capital city. Poor air quality is also an obstacle for cyclists, who can face health problems from riding in smoggy urban centers. READ MORE: Nine things that make air pollution bearable . Cycling renaissance . Recently, however, members of a growing middle class are picking up their bikes again. For these people, cycling is recreation, not a way to get to work. ""There's now more and more people who will strap an expensive road bike to the top of their BMW and head to the hills around Beijing,"" said David Culbert, a spokesperson for the Tour of Beijing. In the suburbs, the roads are smooth and the air is clean. ""You will see literally hundreds, if not thousands, of people out there on the weekends riding their bikes,"" said Shannon Bufton, the co-founder of Serk Cycling, a Beijing NGO promoting cycling culture. This cycling renaissance has even gotten support from the headline-grabbing billionaire Chen Guangbiao, who celebrated China's ""National Urban Car-Free Day"" in 2011 by smashing a Mercedes-Benz and giving his employees free bicycles. It's also attracting the attention of professional cycling teams eager to find untapped talent, and cycling sponsors eying China's potential as a lucrative market. And Beijing is looking to build a more competitive road cycling program for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Ji's example could give more people a reason to get back in the saddle. ""What Chinese cycling needs is a national hero who performs well at an international level,"" Bufton said -- and that could be Ji. For now, Ji is focused on the Tour, in which 198 cyclists, divided among 22 teams, will ride a total of 2,272 miles before the July 27 finish line. But he's already thinking ahead. ""I hope for the future we will send more and more riders to European pro races,"" Ji said. ""I hope they can use my experience to see that European cycling is possible.""","26-year-old Ji Cheng will become the first rider from China to compete in cycling's most prestigious race .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, angry residents of West Point, one of the poorest slums of Liberia, clashed with police when they discovered that the government has quarantined the entire area in an effort to contain the spread of Ebola. This comes on the heels of another incident at West Point a few days ago, when people attacked an Ebola clinic, releasing patients and taking bedding and other items. When the international community heard about the incident, it could not understand such reckless behavior in the face of a deadly outbreak. But living here in Liberia, we understand. Through my work as a peace activist during the wars of the 1990s and early 2000s, and now as an organizer with communities throughout Liberia, I know how skeptical Liberians feel toward the government and international aid, given prior bad experiences. The majority of citizens do not trust the government, which they view as corrupt, so they could not believe the whole story about Ebola when it started being told. A friend of mine said, for example, ""Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (president of Liberia) and her minister of health want to pocket money, so they have come up with a new tactics to collect money and share."" As the months went by, many radio talk show hosts led discussions about Ebola. People from all walks of life in Liberia still denied the existence of Ebola, including many at the waterside, one of the biggest markets in Monrovia, the capital. When I spoke about Ebola, people accused me of working for the government, which was bad enough. But when I showed them my work ID, I made the matter even worse. They said that I work for an American non-governmental organization, and we all are supporters of Ma Ellen and can't see the wrong she is doing. Now, too late, everyone is talking about the invisible enemy -- the one you cannot see. I remember during the war days in Liberia, you could get news of where the enemies were coming from and take cover either in the bushes or some other hiding place. But the Ebola virus is different. I have extended family members who have died from the virus or been quarantined for observation and testing. It is overwhelming to hear of people whom you have spoken to in the past six weeks, who are now dead from a disease that could have been prevented. 9 things to know about Ebola . Liberians are social and community-oriented. We greet people with handshakes and hugs, eat together using one bowl, sleep together in one bed and bathe dead bodies to honor them. Some people are trying to put aside these cultural practices to save lives. I have noticed that a few people have started to wear gloves and long-sleeve shirts. Many businesses and homes have buckets with water and bleach for people entering and coming out to wash their hands. A colleague of mine called and told me about a health administrator whose mother had contracted the Ebola virus. The administrator took his mother to the hospital in Tubmanburg, capital of Bomi County, where my colleague works as a nurse and social worker for people living with HIV/AIDS. My colleague told me that the administrator was in complete denial that his mother had contracted the virus. He broke all the rules that the hospital had put in place: no visitors for people who have shown signs and symptoms of Ebola. Every day, he brought a new family member to visit his sick mother. In the end, his mother died, he died, and so did all seven family members he brought to the hospital to visit. Another day has come, and I got a call from a friend who is a social worker in one of the closed government hospitals in western Liberia. She said families that have been quarantined in some communities do not have basic food supplies and other items they need. Even though they are not showing symptoms at the moment, they go out to fetch water and food. They go to faraway markets and hand-pump water and do not tell others that they have been quarantined for fear of stigma. Another colleague says she took food and water to an Ebola quarantine, but she was turned down and told that no food or drinks were allowed. Ebola facility in Liberia attacked; patients flee . People are scared for a reason: Liberia's infrastructure cannot cope with Ebola. With poor health facilities and a low number of health workers, it's obvious that the government needed help months ago. Heath centers are filled with suspected and actual Ebola cases. But the call centers, set up for people wanting help treating Ebola victims, do not answer. This has led to people dumping dead bodies on the streets. Some patients who showed symptoms were abandoned or fled to unknown locations. Tracing people who have come in contact with sick Ebola patients is a huge task for the Ministry of Health. It has become very difficult to trace people who have moved from one community to another, making it tougher to contain the spread of the virus. The Ebola crisis is making many people think about what kind of health policies we have in place. Do we need to develop new ones? Every part of Liberia has been affected: the economy, politics, social and religious life. The economy seems to be dying slowly. Employees from large companies have left Liberia, as have staff members of international non-governmental organizations. The biggest iron ore company in Liberia has sent its experts out of the country. After a decade of international aid to Liberia and the emergence of a democratic government, what are we left with? Liberia is not strong as it could be. Liberia is suffering during this terrible Ebola outbreak. We need help.","On Wednesday, protesters clashed with police over mass quarantine in Liberia .

"(CNN) -- Strikes and counterstrikes between Israel and Hamas resumed as talks aimed at agreeing to a longer-term truce fell apart. Since the temporary ceasefire crumbled Tuesday, at least 137 rockets have been launched from Gaza, the Israeli military said. Of those, 94 hit Israel and 24 were intercepted. Sirens warning of rocket fire repeatedly wailed above the Eshkol region, Ashdod and other Israeli communities on Wednesday. One rocket struck a home in the Ashkelon area but no injuries were reported. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, attacking some 80 suspected militant sites. The attacks have killed 23 people and injured more than 130, the Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday. Hamas said one such strike targeted Mohammed Deif, the head of its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. It killed Deif's wife and 7-month-old son instead, the Gaza Health Ministry said. But Mousa Marzhouk, deputy head of Hamas' politburo, said Wednesday that Deif was not killed and is ""in a safe place."" The Israeli military said it was looking into the claim. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior spokesman for Hamas, posted on Twitter that Israel would ""pay a heavy price"" for its ""crimes against Palestinian civilians."" He said the conflict around Gaza would not end unless Deif decided it should and unless Israel committed to halting violence and lifting its siege of the territory. The Qassam Brigades warned international airlines to refrain from landing at or taking off from Ben Gurion Airport in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv starting 6 a.m. local time Thursday (11 p.m. ET Wednesday). The statement was aired Wednesday by the Palestinian outlet Al Aqsa TV. The blame game . As has been the case throughout the conflict, each side blamed the other for the collapse of the ceasefire and failure of peace talks. Israel's military resumed airstrikes Tuesday afternoon after it said three rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza. Hamas denied involvement in firing the rockets. The truce had been due to last until midnight Tuesday. The talks in Cairo were bound to be difficult because of what they tried to achieve. Israel wanted Gaza to be demilitarized, demanding that Hamas, which controls the territory, and other militant groups lay down their arms. Palestinians wanted Israel's blockade to end, saying it is strangling the economy of the small, impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants. Senior Hamas official Izzat Risheq, who was involved in the negotiations in Cairo, said Wednesday that the Israelis negotiated in bad faith and never intended to a make a deal. ""The Israeli delegation was not serious enough to achieve a deal, and was evasive and did not respond to any of our demands, and, therefore, they are the ones who are responsible for the failure of these negotiations,"" he said. The Palestinians called for the easing of the blockade while postponing their demands to reopen an airport and a seaport for the territory, but the Israelis never responded to the proposal, he said. Instead, the Israeli side continued to insist on the demilitarization of Gaza, something the Palestinians have long said they will never agree too, Risheq said. The Israeli authorities -- who retain control of Gaza's airspace, Mediterranean waters and their shared border -- say releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory isn't feasible while Hamas and other groups are still building up their arsenals of weapons. Israel blamed Gaza militants for breaking the truce. But it was unclear exactly what happened. In one interpretation, the Israelis left Cairo after they gave up on negotiations. In another interpretation, the Israelis took the newest proposal home with them to share with their government. ""We did not seek this war. Israel imposed this war on us and Israel resumed this war, and our people have no other choice but to remain steadfast and defend their families,"" said Risheq. 'Worse to come' Saeb Erekat, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Voice of Palestine Radio on Wednesday that the Israeli government alone was responsible for the breakdown of the ceasefire. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of ""sabotaging every effort as he did always"" in the search for peace. Appealing for an international effort to protect Gaza, provide aid to its beleaguered citizens and establish a Palestinian state, Erekat said he feared that ""worse is still to come."" Netanyahu fired back in comments to Hamas, also on Wednesday. ""Our policy is simple: If you shoot, you will get attacked,"" he warned. ""If you try more, you will get double. If Hamas does not understand that today, (it) will tomorrow. And if not tomorrow, the day after."" Israel will not stop its efforts against Hamas ""until we can ensure full safety and security"" for people in Israel's south, the prime minister said. If Hamas thinks otherwise, Netanyahu said, it is mistaken. The latest conflict, which began in early July, has killed more than 2,000 Palestinians, leaving entire Gaza neighborhoods in rubble. The violence has killed 67 people on the Israeli side, with militants in Gaza firing roughly 3,500 rockets toward Israel. CNN's Reza Sayah, Ali Younes, Amir Tal, Andrew Carey and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","23 people have been killed in renewed Israeli strikes, Gaza Health Ministry says .

"(CNN)  -- Tennis and fashion have been inextricably linked since the sport's early years of organized competition just before the turn of the 20th century. When French legend Suzanne Lenglen had to audacity to wear a knee-length skirt at the 1919 Wimbledon Championships, the ripples were felt in wider society. Fast forward to 2010, and her modern equivalent as the queen of style, Maria Sharapova, has just signed a record $70 million endorsement deal with sportswear giants Nike. Integral to the deal was the introduction of a special tennis clothing line, designed by the Russia-born, U.S.-based player, for which she will get a share of the profits. ""It's really incredible to be able to bring these looks that I love to so many women,"" the 23-year-old said at its subsequent launch. The highs and lows of the Williams sisters' wardrobe . Sharapova, who is the hottest property in women's sport, has always been a dedicated follower of fashion -- and wowed audiences at the 2007 U.S. Open with a stunning red dress, encrusted with no less than 600 Swarovski crystals. She suffered a shock loss in the third round, but was certainly the winner in the style stakes. Federer's fashion faux-pas? However, tennis fashion sense is not confined to the female elite, and men's world number one Roger Federer has certainly provoked a reaction with his Wimbledon collection. Last year, on the way to his fifth crown at England's famous SW19 courts,  the Swiss superstar sported a special clothing line which brought much comment if not universal admiration. ""His tennis may be nearly faultless but Roger Federer proved once again that his fashion sense often lands wide of the mark,"" quipped Britain's Daily Telegraph. But with respect to Federer and Sharapova, they still have some way to go before matching the sartorial successes of the legendary Fred Perry, and Rene Lacoste, one of the famous ""Four Musketeers"" from France. After his successful playing career, Perry -- Britain's last grand slam winner back in 1936 -- was credited with inventing the sweatband. Inspired by his success, he then designed a sports shirt with the distinct self-titled logo. It proved an commercial and style success as its influence spread to the area of modern cultural arena, with British ""Mods"" wearing it as a trademark item as they faced up to their ""Rocker"" rivals. The brand is now owned by a Japanese corporation, and enjoyed a revival when sported by British ace Andy Murray, although he subsequently signed with Adidas for 2010. Lacoste 'the crocodile' Perhaps Perry was copying Lacoste, who forged his reputation in the 1920s with a flamboyant playing style which brought him seven grand slam singles titles. In 1933, the player nicknamed ""the crocodile""  founded a sports clothing company with Andrew Gillier, called La Societe Chemise Lacoste. Naturally, they produced a tennis shirt which had an alligator-type figure embroidered on the chest. Like Perry's brand, it has moved into the wider world of fashion, and for a spell during the early 1980s a Lacoste polo shirt was an absolute-must item in the wardrobe of every young man. According to Forbes magazine, in this period, the Lacoste business was worth $400 million in the United States alone. Beware the 'Burberry disease' But both Fred Perry and Lacoste have suffered from what branding expert Jez Frampton called the ""Burberry disease"" -- namely being solely associated with a certain group of people, who were not highly regarded. Burberry became a must-have fashion accessory of British football hooligans, but in recent years has re-branded itself and profits have flowed. Frampton, the Global CEO of Interbrand Group, believes the continued success of Fred Perry and Lacoste owes much to their legendary status in the game but also to their brand positioning. ""They transcended the sport itself and have come to stand for things in their own right,"" he told CNN. And the key to future success ? ""They have to position themselves as 'premium brands' with more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship,"" he said. A career after tennis . Where Perry and Lacoste forged the brand trail, others have followed, with Bjorn Borg the best example. In the 1980s, not only did the Swede set a record with five straight Wimbledon titles, but his tight-fitting sportswear and trademark headband immediately singled him out as a style icon. Like Sharapova, his endorsement of other brands such as Diadora trainers and Fila sportswear massively boosted their profits and helped establish the companies as major industry players. Retiring at the tender age of 26, Borg had some well-documented difficulties, but the fashion line he launched in 1987 has proved a commercial winner, promoting a daring range of underwear plus general sports and casual clothes and accessories. When Federer and Sharapova eventually call time on their illustrious careers, it remains to be seen if they turn their talents to forging their own brands or stay within the Nike family. But should they venture down this route, their predecessors as champions on the court and in the field of fashion will take some beating.","Tennis fashion has broadened its base to become part of the high street offering .

"(CNN) -- For customers who purchased Reebok EasyTone and RunTone shoes that were part of a Federal Trade Commission settlement, your refund check is in the mail. The refund is part of a settlement reached between the federal government and the popular shoe maker over allegations of deceptive advertising claims that their shoes were better than regular shoes at strengthening and toning leg and buttock muscles. Reebok already coughed up $25 million to settle the fitness claims the FTC disputed. Approximately 315,000 checks are being sent to customers beginning Wednesday, but if you haven't already filed a claim, the FTC says you're out of luck. The deadline for customers to ask for a refund ended in April according to the FTC's Cheryl Hackley. The amount of money each customer will get back is based on what they paid for the shoes. On average, the FTC estimates the checks will cover 87% of the cost customers doled out when they bought the sneakers. Customers receiving a check need to cash it before November 6, 2012. The FTC is warning customers to be careful when shopping for fitness products and workout gear, and Reebok isn't the only shoemaker to come under fire for over-hyping the fitness benefits of their products. In May, Skechers agreed to pay a hefty $40 million fine to settle charges they allegedly deceived consumers by making ""unfounded claims that Shape-ups would help people lose weight, and strengthen and tone their buttocks, legs and abdominal muscles,"" according to the FTC. Besides Shape-ups, Skechers also made deceptive claims about other products including Resistance Runner, Toners and Tone-up shoes, the FTC alleged.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Zhang Xin grew up in poverty and at the age of 14 began a laboring job in a factory. Today, she is richer than Donald Trump, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. Zhang, a Chinese real estate developer, is the seventh richest self-made woman in the world, worth $3.6 billion, according to Forbes. She's worth $800 million more than Oprah Winfrey, the world's best known self-made female billionaire. Not only does Zhang's rags-to-riches story mirror that of China itself, but it is Zhang who has shaped much of the country's modern urban landscape, with the logo of her company SOHO China on the side of buildings wherever you turn in Beijing. SOHO China has 18 developments in Beijing, many of them landmark buildings, and has recently expanded to Shanghai, where it has bought or built 11 properties. Two of her Beijing projects -- one completed last year and another under construction -- are designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. Zhang, 47, was born in Beijing just before Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, when educated people like her parents were sent to the fields for ""re-education."" She returned to Beijing with her mother, but they endured poverty and hardship. ""I was born and grew up when the city was very quiet: no cars, no shops, no lights, no machines. People were just on bicycles,"" she said. At 14, she and her mother moved to Hong Kong, where she spent five years in low-paid factory jobs, manufacturing toys, clothes and electronics, trying to save enough to go to England for an education. ""As a new immigrant to Hong Kong with no education, no background, didn't even speak the local language or dialect, Cantonese, and it was just a hard way to live in Hong Kong,"" said Zhang. It took Zhang five years to save enough for a plane ticket to London and an English language course. She won a scholarship to university, studied for a master's degree in economics at Cambridge University and landed her first job at Goldman Sachs in New York. Instead of remaining in her comfortable life in Wall Street, Zhang returned to Beijing, where she met her husband, and together they started SOHO China. ""There was excitement of people talking about how to change China, and it was a very intellectually vibrant time,"" she said. ""I felt that this country was really making a transition, and I wanted to be a part of that."" Since Zhang and her husband, Pan Shiyi, formed SOHO China in 1995, it has become China's largest commercial real estate developer, with 56 million square feet in prime developments in Beijing and Shanghai. While Zhang's story is incredible -- giving her celebrity status in China -- it is not unique. Of Forbes' 2013 list of 24 self-made female billionaires, six are from China (including one from Hong Kong), more than any other country outside the United States. ""I think women of our generation went through Cultural Revolution, went through hardship, coming from nowhere, and suddenly see China's amazing opportunity,"" said Zhang. ""So women just seized the opportunity."" Zhang has a following of more than 5 million on Weibo, the Chinese social media site often compared with Twitter, where she shares her views on business, current affairs and architecture. But despite her financial success, Zhang, who practices the Baha'i faith, avoids excessive trappings of wealth, even suggesting her 14-year-old son find a job in McDonald's or KFC. He tried, but was too young to be accepted. ""It's not easy to be my sons because we're very high profile. We try so hard to give them a normal life,"" she said. ""I'm very, very tight with them about money. I don't give that money until they ask, 'I need 100 yuan for my lunch card,' and so on. So they never have extra money. But I think that still cannot compare to how we came, where we came (from).""","Zhang Xin runs China's largest real estate developer with her husband .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, three lucky diners nibbled a $325,000 burger -- not in the name of luxury but in the name of science, animal rights and sustainability. The meat was grown in a lab. This in-vitro hamburger is ""cultured"" in many different ways: It's the product of human ingenuity, it's considerate of humans, animals and the planet, and it's produced through growing cells. Tasters declared the hamburger a little dry, and you won't be able to buy one any time soon. But that's not the point: It's a proof of concept prototype -- evidence that it is physically possible to produce meat through cell culture. It's a step toward a day when meat can be produced in a cost-effective, time-efficient and completely animal-free manner. By collecting cells from healthy animals and culturing them in a sterile environment, we can grow animal muscle and bypass slaughter and inhumane treatment. We can establish a safer food supply by avoiding conditions that promote the spread of disease. And we can take a major step toward improving our impact on the environment, including a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. But perhaps the most radical aspect of cultured meat is that its development has been nearly entirely philanthropic, funded largely by individual donors and foundations. The funding behind the creation of this cultured hamburger did not come from a private company or a government but from the forward-thinking co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin. He donated dollars to seek a novel and transformative solution to the world's meat problem. This hamburger was developed by Mark Post, a Dutch researcher at the University of Maastricht. The nonprofit organization New Harvest also has been instrumental in advancing cultured meat. By funding scientific research directly, using donations from individuals and advising both the Dutch government and Brin's foundation to support cultured meat research, New Harvest has been a key player in keeping development of this new technology cooperative and a concerted worldwide effort. All of this research remains in the public domain. The implications of it being available to all are very promising. At first glance, cultured meat might seem to be a homogenizing of our food choices. But beer is a biotech product with many tastes and types. How it is produced is public information. And that makes the business of beer vastly different from the business of, say, transgenic crops. The production of beer requires living organisms -- yeast -- and nourishment for those organisms -- grain. How these elements come together with others to make beer is straightforward in theory, and nuanced in practice. The products are varied and distinct. Cultured meat production is extremely similar. Explained simply, all that is required is a cell line and nourishment for those cells. How the cells are grown, and under what conditions, are adjustable. The potential variety of materials and processes will allow cultured meat to take on many distinctly unique forms, flavors and textures. Any intellectual property protection in beer production is negligible. Nothing holds back the home brewer or the craft brewer from creating one-of-a-kind offerings. Perhaps it is the lack of clear intellectual property protection opportunities for cultured meat that has kept Big Food companies at arm's length to date. To extend the analogy further, consider the visuals of brewing: stainless steel bioreactors containing living organisms and biological reactions, and controlled aseptic environments. Not only do we tour these facilities as a casual weekend activity, we are also pleased to eat or drink in their presence at a microbrewery or brew pub. Imagine that within those stainless steel walls, meat was brewing. Contrast this with the facilities that produce meat today, and you can appreciate just how much cultured meat is a concept that can shake up current systems. As Einstein said, we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. It's a new way of thinking because this is food science by the public, for the public. It prompts a widespread conversation about a food technology years in advance of its market release rather than years afterward. It's a new way of thinking because it's a technology largely driven by societal demand and people have pushed this forward, as donors to a cause. The biggest reasons why cultured meat hasn't progressed further is a lack of funding and a lack of creative understanding. We're not used to food technology being a positive solution. We're not used to food development being nonprofit. And we're not used to a nonprofit group generally categorized as an animal rights/environmentalist group requiring a cancer research-scale budget. But we're learning. Some people might think the meat has a ""yuck"" factor. We should all get over it. We've embraced all kinds of technologies that first seemed like science fiction -- think in-vitro fertilization and Google Glass. The yuck factor associated with modern-day factory farming is undeniable. And meat seems to be recalled for bacterial contamination every other month, and we still buy it. It makes no sense. In many ways the hamburger as we know it is a symbol of the meat problem: the globalization of food, overconsumption, illogical food pricing and fast-food culture. The cultured hamburger symbolizes something else: our opportunity to take back food technology. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isha Datar.","A hamburger that cost $325,000 to create in a lab was served this week .

"(CNN) -- Proving there are still millions to be made off that magical little boy with the lighting bolt scar on his forehead, Universal Studios Japan on Tuesday unveiled its long-awaited Wizarding World of Harry Potter to thousands of delighted muggles. (Muggles being non-magic folk, for those of you who haven't seen the films or read the books.) Based on the phenomenally popular book series by British author J.K. Rowling and subsequent films produced by Warner Bros, the new Osaka attraction is Universal Studios' second Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park. The original opened at Universal Studios Florida in 2010 -- which just last week launched Diagon Alley, a second area of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- while Universal Studios Hollywood is said to be getting its own version in 2016. Two stars from the films, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) were on hand for the Universal Studios Japan opening ceremony on July 15, wearing their obligatory Slytherin and Ravenclaw scarves. Early Tuesday morning, Lynch and Felton performed a mock ""Revelio"" spell -- a charm used to reveal concealed objects -- after which the archway entrance filled with smoke. As it cleared, Hogsmeade village was revealed to the masses of fans waiting to access the new attraction. While we can only assume Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were too busy for the honorable task, Rowling herself reportedly visited the park prior to its opening. ""The craft and attention to detail across The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Japan is incredible and I will take away the memory of Hogwarts castle reflected on the Black Lake in particular,"" said the author in a statement. ""I'm delighted that Harry fans in Japan and around Asia can experience a physical incarnation that is so close to what I imagined when writing the books."" Butterbeer and magic wands . The Osaka version of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter has many of the same attractions found in its Orlando counterpart. This includes Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where visitors will find the signature ""Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey"" ride, an amazing flight simulator filled with special effects. Getting there is half the fun as guests get to tour the castle, which is filled with a few of Hogwarts' most famous spaces, such as the portrait room with its talking photos, Dumbledore's office, the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, Gryffindor common room and the Room of Requirement. There's also a ""Flight of the Hippogriff"" mini coaster, in which guests pass by Hagrid's Hut before climbing into a wicker Hippogriff -- a winged horse with an eagle head. In Hogsmeade, a recreation of the village Hogwarts students visited to get their fill of Butterbeer, there are a few shops that appear in the books/films. These include: wand maker Ollivanders, where visitors can choose their own magic wand; Honeydukes, which sells popular wizarding world sweets such as Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans and Chocolate Frogs; and The Three Broomsticks, a tavern serving traditional British fare. Universal Studios Japan says there are a few park features not found in Orlando such as Hogwarts' Black Lake -- as mentioned by Rowling above -- and live owls. Trying to compete with Disney? The Wizarding World of Harry Potter cost Universal Studios Japan Â¥45 billion ($442.2 million) to construct. Universal says it's hoping to earn the park Â¥5.6 trillion ($55 billion) over 10 years. According to an earlier report in Japan's Asahi Shimbun, the park's main competitor is Tokyo Disney Resort, which attracted 31.3 million visitors in fiscal 2013. Universal Studios Japan only saw 10.5 million visitors during the same period, though it was the first time the number of visitors exceeded 10 million since fiscal 2001, its first year of operation says the report. Universal Studios Japan is located in the city of Osaka and can be accessed by train. The nearest station is JR Universal City. Park hours vary according to day/season, visit the official website for more info.

"Islamabad (CNN) -- So what kind of new political system do I want for Pakistan? I want to change the governmental and administrative structure into a ""participatory democracy"" and devolve the political, financial and administrative powers to the grass-roots level. I have developed a model of modern systems and true democracy for the future prosperity of Pakistan. After this ""green revolution,"" the current governmental and administrative structure will be changed into a system compatible with international standards -- particularly those that already exist in the United States, Turkey, Japan and South Korea. I know we are a hundred years away right now, so we want to shape the Pakistani model according to our circumstances. My vision is that the head of the federal government should not be the leader of the house but the leader of the nation and will be directly elected by the people. This will put an end to political bargaining and horse-trading that dictates our current system. Devolution of power . I want to implement true participatory democracy by involving a million people to share power by delegating authority to the grass-roots level. Article 140 (a) of our constitution prescribes to put in place a system of local government -- developing power at the grass-roots level. To make clear this concept of democracy, I've used the United States and Turkey as examples. The U.S. has a population of 320 million with 50 states, 3,024 county governments, 16,405 township governments, 19,429 municipal governments and more than 35,000 special purpose governments. Turkey has a population of 76 million, has 81 provinces, has developed 957 districts governments, 3,216 municipal governments and has set up 34,495 rural governments. I also want to limit the number of ministries at the center of government in Islamabad. Power and authority will be devolved from the center to the grass-roots level. The center will only keep key ministries to deal with currency, defense, inland security and counter-terrorism, foreign policy, higher education and energy. All other ministries will be transferred to the provinces and districts. I want to see 35 provinces in Pakistan instead of just four for a population of 180 million. Under the new system, every division of Pakistan will be awarded the status of a province to ascertain that power, authority and resources are devolved down to the district levels and do not remain centralized. Similarly, I want to see 150 districts and 800 sub-division governments consisting of 400 city governments and 400 rural governments. I also want to see 6,000 union council's governments. Social-economic package . Pakistan's green revolution will implement the following 10-point revolutionary charter for the people of Pakistan that have been living below poverty line. 1. Every low-paid lower class will be provided daily necessities (food items etc) at half price; . 2. Every low-paid lower class will be exempt for paying taxes on utility bills & will offered at half price; . 3. Every homeless will be given a house; middle class family will be provided interest-free loans; . 4. Every unemployed person will be given adequate employment; . 5. Women to be provided employment; . 6. State health insurance system will be developed for free medical treatment; . 7. Free and compulsory education and modernization of education system; . 8. Free 5-10 acres of agriculture land for poor farmers; . 9. Disparity between pay structures of public and private employees to be minimized; . 10. Revolutionary policy to eliminate terrorism, extremism and sectarianism and establishment of peace training centers across Pakistan.","Tahir ul Qadri joined an anti-government march on Pakistan's capital .

"(CNN) -- Step lively Watson, there's a mystery afoot at the Supreme Court -- and the estate of Sherlock Holmes' creator says only the nine justices can ultimately solve the Case of the Contested Copyright. The estate of the late British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has asked the high court to block a California writer from moving ahead with plans to publish a new series of stories featuring the celebrated fictional detective and his friend Dr. Watson. A federal appeals court in Chicago last month ruled in favor of California-based editor and lawyer Leslie Klinger, saying he did not have to pay royalty fees to the Conan Doyle estate, over his plans to publish a new volume of Holmes stories penned by contemporary authors. The estate then asked the high court to delay enforcement of the appeals court ruling, at least temporarily, until its legal team could prepare a more detailed petition for the justices to hear their case. There was no indication when the court would rule. The nine-member bench is on a three-month recess, but is available to handle these time-sensitive matters. Conan Doyle created one of the most famous and enduring characters in fiction, with four novels and 56 short stories published from 1887 to 1927. The final 10 stories remain under copyright protection in the United States until 2022, while the rest are in the public domain. In their high court claim, the estate asserts Holmes and Watson ""were not static but are dynamic literary characters who changed and developed throughout the Sherlock Holmes canon."" Their lawyers say that means the adventures of the fictional friends from decades ago cannot be appropriated today, based on older Conan Doyle works that are in the public domain. ""Many aspects of these characters' natures are not revealed until the final 10 stories, which are still under copyright protection"" say the estate's lawyers. ""The 10 stories are not set exclusively in the characters' old age but at various points throughout the characters' lives."" The financial stakes remain lucrative. The estate says the Holmes character has been portrayed in more than 200 films, and that it has a financial and creative interest in ensuring the detective ""is not despoiled in a way that would irreparably damage the value of the Sherlock Holmes copyright."" Klinger had earlier paid a $5,000 licensing fee to the estate in 2011 for an initial work of re-imagined Holmes stories called ""A Study in Sherlock."" But he refused to pay a fee for a planned November sequel, ""In the Company of Sherlock Holmes."" Klinger's publisher, Pegasus Books, is supporting him in court. Klinger's website describes him as ""one of the world's foremost authorities on Sherlock Holmes and Dracula."" In his blog, he dismisses the appeal to the Supreme Court. ""The 7th Circuit [federal appeals court] ruled on June 22 in our favor, finding that creators were free to use the characters of Holmes, Watson, etc., so long as the creators did not infringe on the 'protected elements' in the remaining 10 copyrighted stories,"" said Klinger. ""Clearly, the characters' names and most of their characteristics are not such 'protected elements.' Thus, to put it very loosely, Sherlock Holmes is 'free.'"" The case is Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. v. Klinger (14a47). 'To Kill a Mockingbird' novelist sues over trademark .","Sherlock Holmes was fictional, but he lives on in novels and short stories .

"(CNN) -- Norwegian officials say they think Islamist terrorists could strike the country within a few days, but they do not know what the plot is. The Police Security Service ""recently received information that individuals affiliated with an extreme Islamist group in Syria may have the intention of carrying out a terrorist action in Norway,"" the service said in a statement Thursday. A preliminary investigation strengthened the credibility of the information, the statement said. ""We also have information indicating that a terrorist action against Norway is planned to be carried out shortly -- probably in a few days. ""We have no information about who is behind such an attack, how it will be carried out, the target or in what way such an attack will be carried out. ... As the information is not specific and not very concrete but at the same time credible, it is difficult to give advice to the citizens of this country on how to act in this situation."" Security has been increased at airports, train stations, ports and major intersections, according to The Nordic Page, a Norwegian English-language news site. Norway has long been threatened by Muslim extremists. Al Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri mentioned Norway in a recording released back in 2003 -- when he was Osama bin Laden's top deputy, -- that urged Muslims to take a lesson from the 9/11 hijackers and ""light a fire under the feet"" of the United States, Britain, Australia and Norway by attacking embassies and corporations. At the time, Norwegian media speculated that al-Zawahiri may have confused Norway with neighboring Denmark. But while Norway did not support the war in Iraq, it did send special forces and fighter planes to Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led war. In 2004, Norwegian officials arrested the former leader of an Iraqi Islamic militant group. In 2006, Norwegian embassies were among the targets of violent protests after newspapers in several countries including Norway published depictions of Islam's Prophet Mohammed. In 2011, Norway suffered a terrorist attack carried out by Anders Behring Breivik, a right-wing extremist with a hatred of Muslims. Eight people died in a bombing in Oslo, and 69 young people on nearby Utoya island were gunned down. The following year, the Muslim extremist group Ansar al-Sunna threatened Norway with a 9/11-style attack unless part of the capital, Oslo, was turned into a Muslim nation, the International Business Times reported. ""We do not wish to live together with dirty beasts like you,"" the group wrote in a letter to Norwegian lawmakers and newspaper editors, according to the report. In its statement Thursday, Norway's Police Security Service said ""Extreme Islamism is still the most serious terror threat against Norway. Also, we state that it has for a long time been a strategy to recruit extreme Islamists in war and conflict zones to carry out terrorist actions in Europe, and that Syria at the time being is considered to be the one of the leading arenas for this recruitment."" The threat from Islamist extremists is increasing, police said. While ""a great amount of threats"" come in each year, most are not commented on openly, the statement said. But ""in the current situation,"" police said, informing the public ""is the right thing to do.""","Norwegian police say terrorists could strike ""in a few days""

"(CNN) -- A few days after my little brother received death threats, he and I jumped on top of la Bestia -- the Beast -- the train heading north, to escape El Salvador. The country that financed the armed forces seeking to kill our friends and family would be our destination for safety. And like the millions of people forced into migration, I was compelled to leave my home for the uncertainty and waiting unwelcome of the United States. I left on my last day of college before graduation and dedicated myself to guaranteeing the safety of my brother, still a teen not much older than the unaccompanied minors currently arriving en masse at the U.S.-Mexico border. Although I cannot pretend to know their situation, I can see the faces of those we traveled with in the photos of those children crowded into detention centers. A family secret that changed his life . Right-wing conservatives have fully seized upon this latest turn in the immigration debate to harp upon border security and scoff at troops unable to stop little children. President Barack Obama, who seems to have made it his mission to appease them in his first six years, would now do better to ignore them completely than to continue to step on the gas of his deportation apparatus. In a debate that has centered on criminalizing migrants and the act of migration, the faces of children, huddled and scared, hoping and vulnerable, defy vilification. Instead, they demonstrate what the President has declared but not yet acted on: Immigration is a humanitarian crisis. It is not to be met with soldiers, jails and handcuffs but with relief and aid. Opinion: How we can help kids crossing the border . Intractable nativists, unable when confronted by these children to demonize people crossing the border, will turn to their equally favorite target -- demonizing the administration. One of the mouthpieces of anti-immigrant initiatives in the House, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, insists on repeating the rumor that it was actually the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the misunderstanding of the prospect of immigration reform that caused the youths' arrival. He would want us to believe that this Congress has made legalization look so promising that children who would have otherwise stayed put are making the journey across a continent to be one of its rumored beneficiaries. But like any magnet theory, it misses the primary factor of displacement. The push is stronger than any pull. The White House initially tried to dispel the bluster from the right. But the debate has reverted to the most common pattern in immigration policy: hyperbolic denunciations from the right, appeasement from the administration and near silence from the rest of the Beltway. To have a real conversation about children at the border requires understanding the humanitarian crisis, but it also requires addressing the dynamic among the United States and its neighbors. We must examine the reason people are being pushed to the north. Exactly what is happening in their home countries? And what hand does the United States play in creating those problems? Opinion: The right fate for immigrant kids . My brother and I did not leave our parents behind, only to be assaulted on a monthlong journey north and witness the worst, including people dying, because we simply wanted to. We did not leave the work we had and the life we had started to build because we would be happier looking for jobs on the street and paying what we could to sleep in a living room. We came because it was our opportunity to survive, because counterinsurgency forces, known now to have been financed by the Reagan administration, fought a dirty war in El Salvador. It claimed the lives of 70,000 people and displaced 1 million more. I hope the plight of the children who have taken center stage in the immigration debate can shatter the myth that we can continue the conversation without considering our neighbors. The children have shown that proposals and issues of the debate have been inadequate. When I return to El Salvador, as a citizen of the United States, and I interview those who were deported for a soon-to-be-released study, the most common refrain people share is ""What choice do I have but to go north?"" The walls erected and the troops deployed and even the legislation that has been introduced do not answer that question and do not address people who desire to survive, harbor the hope for something better and see the possibility of neither.","Pablo Alvarado and little brother escaped El Salvador and death threats to go north .
Alvarado: Scared children at border show immigration is a humanitarian crisis .
He asks: What problems are pushing people north? What hand does U.S. play?
Barriers, soldiers not the answer, he says; we must address underlying problems ."
"(CNN) -- Shady cock-fighting farms are common enough in the Philippines, but a raid on a small operation in Lipa City south of Manila late last year revealed a much larger problem. Alongside the cock-fighting spurs and breeding paraphernalia, the raid netted 84 kilograms of ""shabu"" -- the Filipino street name for methamphetamine or ""ice"" -- and three affiliates of the deadly Mexican drug cartel Sinaloa were arrested. For police, the presence in Asia of one of Mexico's most powerful organized crime groups was a worrying development. Not only did it point to growing transnational links between crime groups, it also displayed an increased professionalism in ""ice"" production as it moves away from its 'Breaking Bad' image of cellar drug kitchens and backyard meth labs. ""We have previously received reports that the Mexicans are in the country, but this is the first time we have confirmed that the Mexicans are already here,"" Senior Superintendent Bartolome Tobias, chief of the Philippines National Police (PNP) Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force told a news conference. PNP Director General Alan Purisima said going after the group would ""entail more hard work."" ""We know that they are just starting -- that's why we have to act immediately to stop them before they can expand their presence,"" Purisima told the news conference. Notorious syndicate . Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel is one of the most powerful and notorious drug syndicates in the world. Named after the state on Mexico's Pacific Coast where it was formed in 1989, the cartel's heartland extends from Sinaloa to Mexico's Durango and Chihuahua states. But it is known to operate in locations as diverse as Russia, Australia and Sierra Leone. The group's leader, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 and was only just captured on Saturday during a pre-dawn operation in the Mexican Pacific resort town of Mazatlan. Formerly America's most wanted drug trafficker -- rated by Forbes as the most powerful criminal on the planet -- Guzman played a key role in a drug war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives since it was launched in 2006. Hong Kong's Triads . The Mexican attorney general's office last year released a report that named Hong Kong triad groups 14K and Sun Yee On as the main suspects in the supply of ephedrine and ethyl phenylacetate -- precursor chemicals in the manufacture of ""ice"" -- to Mexican cartels feeding into the lucrative American market for methamphetamine. According to the U.S. Justice Department, Hong Kong's triads already maintain close contact with their Asian gang counterparts -- Wah Ching, Black Dragons, Tiny Rascal Gangsters, and Black Star -- whose members operate in Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. The raid in the Philippines, meanwhile, came within days of a major drug raid in China. In late December, some 3,000 Chinese police, equipped with helicopters, sniffer dogs and speedboats, descended on the village of Boshe in Guangdong province, uncovering China's largest methamphetamine operation to date. Three tons of methamphetamine worth an estimated $234 million were seized from 77 clandestine meth laboratories, and 182 arrests were made -- including the town's Communist Party boss Cai Dongjia and 13 other party officials. The raid was further evidence of a growing industrialization of crystal meth production. Industrial scale . Before 2012, Chinese police mostly dismantled small-scale operators, but in September of that year, police raided their first industrial-scale facility in Hunan, seizing 660kg of crystal meth and 19.8 metric tons of unidentified materials used in the manufacture of the drug. Among the 14 people arrested in the raid, one was a Mexican national, a development which analysts say was the first indication that Mexican transnational syndicates were working closely with the Chinese to produce crystal meth. Professor Karen Laidler, an analyst in illegal drug trends at the University of Hong Kong, said China's meth labs were increasingly internationalizing their illegal drugs operations. ""The manufacturing in Guangdong? I suspect that much of that was for export,"" she told CNN. She said the United Nations and the U.S. State Department had long identified China as a country where the precursor chemical ephedrine was being exported to other countries for the manufacturing of various amphetamine drugs. The huge scale of China's chemical industry, with an estimated 80,000 individual chemical companies in 2009, presents widespread opportunities for chemical diversion, according to the U.S. State Department. Hong Kong, once the bottleneck through which Chinese contraband was forced to pass -- and on a U.S. blacklist for the transit of heroin throughout the 1970s and 1980s before being removed in the 1990s -- is no longer the only gateway for drugs manufactured in China, Laidler said. ""There are many large ports in China where drugs can be imported and exported quite easily,"" she said.","Philippines meth raid leads to arrests of Mexican drug cartel affiliates .

She said some police and lawmakers in Arizona are worried about how the new law will be implemented. ""The mayor is very, very worried, as well as the chief of police here,"" Shakira said. ""They're both very worried about the impact that implementation of this law will have on Latino families, the level of abuse that will be inflicted on Latinos, with or without papers."" The new measure requires Arizona police to determine whether people are in the United States legally if there is a reason to suspect they aren't. The law, scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state's legislative session, would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times. Supporters claim it is needed to control illegal immigration. Critics counter, saying it will create government-sanctioned racial profiling. Shakira said she talked to women in Arizona who said they were scared about how the law would affect them. ""I just met with some families and women who have been subjected to domestic violence, and they are so concerned,"" the singer said. ""They're going to live in fear to call the police or to report a crime that has been inflicted to them.

"(CNN) -- Christina Hendricks' decision to star in ""Mad Men"" was a risk that paid off. When the 39-year-old actress first spotted the script for Matthew Weiner's '60s-era drama, her interest was piqued. But while she was all in to play Joan Holloway, the sharp and curvacious secretary who would rise to become an integral member of ""Mad Men's"" world, Hendricks' agency wasn't so sure. ""They said, 'It's a period piece, it's never going to go anywhere,"" the actress told U.K. paper The Guardian. ""'We need you to make money and this isn't going to make money.'"" The agency, she continued, ""ended up dropping me."" But to Hendricks, the promise of ""Mad Men"" outweighed the potential for failure. ""I had been on several shows that were meant to be the big ones, that would go on for ever, and they didn't,"" she pointed out. ""So there was no sure bet and I'd already taken a chance on them and I felt, why not do the one you're in love with and take a chance on that?"" Taking that chance has led to a breakthrough role for the actress, who until ""Mad Men"" had done a few appearances on TV series ""ER,"" ""Beggars and Choosers"" and ""Angel."" But after stepping into Joan's shoes, and earning five Emmy nominations along the way, Hendricks' popularity has soared. The treatment she receives now from the public is a far cry from what she suffered in high school, where Hendricks said she was bullied. ""We had a locker bay, and every time I went down there to get books out of my locker people would sit on top and spit at me,"" Hendricks told The Guardian. ""So I had to have my locker moved because I couldn't go in there ... I felt scared in high school. It was like 'Lord of the Flies.' There was always some kid getting pummeled and people cheering."" At this point, she could attend her high school reunion just to have the last laugh, but Hendricks said that she hasn't held on to any bitterness about those days. ""You know, I had so much anger about that time, that experience, for so long and I don't know what dissipated it, but now it's gone,"" Hendricks said. ""I feel some sadness about it, about how cruel kids can be to each other, but that's it. ... I haven't gone to any reunions. I'm sure, if I did, they would have no idea I went there.

Yet in Sri Lanka, home to some 7,000 wild Asian elephants, a different, more hopeful story is playing out. It's a story that's attracting truckloads of tourists from around the world to witness a stunning wildlife spectacle, simultaneously raising concerns among conservationists about how increasing numbers of visitors may be impacting the large mammals. In north-central Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park, hundreds of elephants travel each year to the shores of an ancient reservoir built by a king more than 1,700 years ago. They've made the trip for centuries, coming from across the region to bathe, mate, socialize and, most importantly, to feed as part of an annual event known as ""The Gathering."" During the dry season (July through early November), the water in the reservoir recedes. In its place, lush green grasses grow, providing a veritable feast for the hungry pachyderms. Between meals, the elephants head into the reservoir, spraying themselves with the shallow, muddy waters to create one of the world's biggest pool parties. ""Where else you can get so close to so many wild elephants at once?"" asks James Thomas, a lawyer visiting The Gathering from Melbourne. ""Watching massive herds of elephants bathe as the sun sets over the nearby mountains is an experience I'll never forget."" Would you pay US$50 for a cup of elephant dung coffee? Conservation concerns . If you haven't heard of The Gathering or ever seriously considered visiting Sri Lanka, you're not alone. The island nation's prolonged civil war, which ended in May 2009, kept the country off most people's itineraries. Since then, however, word of Sri Lanka's diverse wildlife, spectacular beaches and myriad cultural activities has spread: in 2012, tourist arrivals grew 17.5 percent over 2011, hitting 1,055,605, according to government officials. While the growth has boosted tourism-related revenue, the volume of visitors to Minneriya -- and the 4WDs required to transport them through the park -- has caught the attention of wildlife conservationists. They worry added traffic is negatively impacting not only the fragile reserve, but also the health and behavior of the animals the visitors are traveling to see. ""The increasing number of vehicles in the park and the unruly behavior of most are cause for much concern,"" says Ravi Corea, president of the Sri Lankan Wildlife Conservation Society (SLWCS). ""Vehicles approach elephants too closely and disrupt them from feeding, mating, nursing and socializing. In addition, they are habituating elephants to charge vehicles, which they will continue to do once they leave the national park with the beginning of the rains."" On a safari I joined earlier this year, I experienced these issues firsthand. During our trip, the tour driver inadvertently parked in the path of a mother and baby elephant, obstructing their way to a watering hole. When a nearby bull elephant took notice, he quickly moved in to protect them, charging our vehicle in the process. Our driver reacted quickly and moved us to safety. Corea and others fear it's only a matter of time before someone's luck runs out and an elephant or tourists are seriously injured. Conservationists are pushing government and park officials to ensure animals, humans and the local environment are better protected. Recommendations include implementing stringent policies to govern how visitors and guides behave in the park, as well as providing training for rangers and drivers on how to conduct themselves while in the presence of wild elephants. Drivers would need certification to take visitors to the park, and they could face fines if caught violating park regulations. Tracking the elephants . Additional proposals include documenting the movement of the elephants beyond Minneriya's unfenced borders. Environmental organizations also hope to map the entire ecological cycle of the animals as part of efforts to ensure the slaughters occurring in places like Africa and Vietnam don't happen in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Tourism Development Authority is pinning its hopes on the continued success of The Gathering, even building specific marketing activities around the annual event in an effort to attract more visitors to Minneriya. In 2011, officials christened September ""Wildlife Month,"" distributing full-color brochures that proclaimed The Gathering ""one of the most unforgettable and fantastic events in the international wildlife calendar."" As word about Minneriya's main attraction spreads, the hope is that massive herds of elephants will continue migrating to the park each dry season, as they have for hundreds of years. As long as they do, it's a safe bet that more and more tourists will travel to Sri Lanka to experience what truly is one of the world's greatest wildlife events. Minneriya National Park is about 180 kilometers from Colombo International Airport, a four-hour drive. The best time to see The Gathering is during the dry season, from June to September. A number of local operators offer day trips to the area, which can be arranged from your hotel. Accommodation options include resorts and bungalows just a few kilometers outside the national park. At the high end of the price stick is luxury tented camp Mahoora. For those who would rather have the whole trip arranged for them, tour companies like Asialuxe offer multi-day packages including airfare.Residents of Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom are required to apply for a tourist visa before arrival in Sri Lanka. Applications can be made online.","Each year, hundreds of elephants travel to an ancient reservoir .

"(CNN) -- Turkish troops backed by air support attacked Kurdish rebels Friday in northern Iraq, the Turkish military said. Turkish tanks on the move near the border town of Silopi in Sirnak province, southeastern Turkey. At least 24 suspected Kurd militants were killed, the Turkish military reported, adding it suffered 5 casualties. The incursion against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Iraq began around 7 p.m. Thursday. In a statement, the Turkish military said it would act with ""utmost sensitivity in order to avoid negative impact on local elements"" -- a reference to keeping civilians out of the conflict. ""The Turkish Armed Forces, which values Iraq's territorial integrity and its stability, will return as soon as planned goals are achieved,"" the military said. ""The executed operation will prevent the region from being a permanent and safe base for the terrorists and will contribute to Iraq's stability and internal peace."" Turkey has been taking cross-border military action, including airstrikes and artillery shelling, against the PKK in retaliation to attacks by the group on targets in Turkey from bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey. Turkey has also been carrying out small ground operations into Iraq, forays characterized as ""hot pursuit"" incursions with a few hundred commandos responding to a particular threat. Citing Turkish media reports estimating that as many as 10,000 Turkish troops had been involved, Fadi Hakura, an analyst with UK military thinktank Chatham House, said the operation was the first major incursion by Turkey into Iraq since Hussein was toppled in 2003. Hakura said the Turkish military wanted to conduct a surprise attack against the PKK prior to the springtime, when violent attacks tend to escalate, and when the snow in the mountainous border region leaves the fighters' footprints. ""Normally during the 1980s and the 1990s, the incursions involved 35,000 50,000 troops and they tended to be somewhat open-ended over weeks. This one is expected to be limited to a matter of days and targeted attacks against the PKK,"" he said. U.S. officials were downplaying the scope of the operation Friday. Tom Casey, deputy State Department spokesman, said Iraqi Foreign Ministry Hoshyar Zebari called the incursion ""limited in nature"" and not ""major."" ""The PKK is a common enemy of the U.S., Turkey and Iraq. We need to work together to resolve it,"" Casey said. ""We are pleased that Turks have stressed that they will do everything possible to avoid acts that would harm civilians."" Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq, told CNN the military is ""aware"" of a Turkish ""operation of limited duration to specifically target PKK terrorists in that region."" ""Turkey has given its assurances it will do everything possible to avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians or Kurdish infrastructure,"" Smith said. The ground troops' deployment followed cross-border shelling early Thursday by Turkish soldiers into abandoned villages north of Irbil -- the capital of Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government. The shelling, which struck abandoned villages in the Khwar-Kork area north of Irbil, lasted two hours and was followed by heavy gunfire, a KRG official told CNN. There were no reports of casualties. Border tensions have been a source of diplomatic disagreement between the U,S. and its Iraqi and Turkish allies. U.S. and Iraqi authorities have been concerned that any large-scale operation by Turkey into Iraq to chase down Kurdish rebels could destabilize the region. At the same time, the U.S. backs Turkey's efforts to battle the PKK, which both countries regard as a terrorist group and has been providing intelligence to the Turks. ""The United States continues to support Turkey's right to defend itself from the terrorist activities of the PKK and has encouraged Turkey to use all available means, to include diplomacy and close coordination with the Government of Iraq to ultimately resolve this issue,"" Smith said.

"(CNN) -- Jay Z and Beyonce continue to be full of surprises. In the midst of all of the hoopla surrounding the now well-known elevator incident involving the couple and Beyonce's younger sister, Solange Knowles, the superstar pair have released a ""trailer"" for their upcoming tour. The star-studded short features cameos from actors Jake Gyllenhaal (who is now part of meme history thanks to a recent courtside photo with the superstar couple), Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, ""Scandal"" actor Guillermo DÃ¬az, Blake Lively, Emmy Rossum, and sisters Rashida and Kidada Jones. Directed by Melina Matsoukas, who has worked with Beyonce on music videos, the minimovie is meant to promote the 16-city ""On The Run"" tour, which will mark the first time the singer and her rapper husband have toured jointly. In the trailer, the couple portray a pair of outlaw lovers seen making deals, executing a heist, running from the authorities and sharing tender moments in a hotel room. One scene shows them emerging from an elevator wearing masks -- which could be seen as a bit of irony, given the recent headlines following the release of a surveillance video showing Solange Knowles punching and kicking Jay Z in a hotel elevator while Beyonce stood nearby on the night of the Met Gala in New York City. The trio have since released a statement which says in part, ""We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same."" Music featuring the rap mogul and his wife play in the almost four-minute video, which hit the Web on Saturday.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea launched two short-range rockets off the east coast of the Korean peninsula on Wednesday, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The projectiles flew for about 180 kilometers (110 miles) before falling into the sea, officials said. North Korea has carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea in recent months, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations. The latest launch comes the day after South Korea dismissed a North Korean ""special proposal"" to improve ties and reduce military tensions. Seoul said the North's request was based on irrelevant and inaccurate claims. Opposing views . The proposal asked South Korea to halt intrusions at sea and firing drills near islands close to the two countries' disputed maritime border. North Korea also wanted South Korea to stop ""attracting"" U.S. military hardware, including strategic bombers and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, into the region. It asked that South Korea cancel its planned joint military drills with the United States in August. ""Our people and the international community clearly know that the fundamental threats to the peace in the Korean peninsula and the future of our people are North Korea's nuclear and missile development,"" the South Korean Unification Ministry said. ""If North Korea truly wishes for peace in the Korean peninsula, not only should it stop its slander and threats of provocation, it should also show its sincerity in resolving nuclear issue,"" the ministry said. Tensions over drills . Park Soo-geun, a former South Korean military official, said Pyongyang might have fired the rockets Wednesday because of Seoul's refusal to accept the proposal. ""North Korea has been continuously been pressuring the South to halt its joint military drills with the U.S.,"" he said. Seoul and Washington have rejected previous demands from North Korea for joint U.S.-South Korean drills to be called off. Tensions have flared periodically between the two Koreas in recent months, notably along their maritime boundary, known as the Northern Limit Line. In late March, the two sides both fired hundreds of shells across their western sea border. Last month, the South Korean Navy fired warning shots after three North Korean patrol boats crossed the line. And a few days later, North Korea fired at least two shells near a South Korean patrol boat in the Yellow Sea. North and South Korea remain technically at war since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, in 1953. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.","North Korea fires two rockets into the sea, says South Korea's defense ministry .

"London (CNN) -- The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with the Islamic State terror group to release her husband, describing him as a ""peaceful, selfless man"" who was only in Syria to help people in need. ""I cannot see how it could assist any State's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying,"" according to a message from Barbara Henning released by the UK Foreign Office. ""I have been trying to communicate with the Islamic State and the people holding Alan. I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to."" In a videotaped execution of aid worker David Haines, made public last week, ISIS threatened to kill Henning next if the United States continued its airstrikes targeting the group's fighters in Iraq. ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State? Henning, a taxi driver from Bolton in northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling to Syria to deliver food and water to people in need when he was abducted in December 2013. ""Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need,"" Henning's wife said in the statement. ""When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need."" She said his actions were an act of compassion. ""I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late. ""When they hear this message I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband Alan Henning."" How many more Western captives? The plea comes weeks after the mother of American freelance journalist James Foley called on ISIS to release her son. Days after that plea, ISIS released a video of Foley's beheading. American journalist Steven Sotloff also was executed by ISIS. Henning, a father of two, was making his fourth trip to Syria with an aid convoy when he was abducted. While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party. In video shot on that day, he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help. ""It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go,"" he said, before hugging a colleague. Statement from family of David Haines, killed by ISIS jihadists . Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made. Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the Turkish border, said they got a phone call saying Henning had been taken by masked gunmen. ""We thought it was just a temporary measure, him being a non-Muslim and being visibly English,"" she said. ""We thought they'd question him and let him go.""

"(CNN) -- From designer John Galliano's anti-Semitic tirade to Vogue Italia's recent reference to ""slave earrings"" -- the fashion world is often, it seems, at the sharp end of the race debate. In 2007, several of the world's black supermodels, including Naomi Campbell, Somalian-born Iman, and male model Tyson Beckford launched a campaign against race discrimination in the fashion industry. Former model Bethann Hardison organized the campaign. A model in the 1970s, she later formed her own agency and helped launch the careers of both Campbell and Beckford. She was quoted in the New York Times as saying, ""Modeling is probably the one industry where you have the freedom to refer to people by their color and reject them in their work."" The following year, Vogue Italia published the ""Black Issue"" -- celebrating models of color from the past and present. The magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain within 72 hours. So how far has the industry changed since then? As Paris Fashion Week comes to a close, CNN spoke to two black women with two different experiences of the industry. Sosheba Griffiths, 22, is a model from Kingston, Jamaica who was discovered on her way home from school, aged 16. She moved to New York to launch her international career and has since worked with a long list of top designers including Roberto Cavalli, Vivienne Westwood and Diane von Furstenberg. She says things are looking good for models of all ethnicity. Constance C.R. White is Editor-in-Chief of Essence magazine, a monthly title aimed at African-American women focusing on fashion, lifestyle and beauty. White acknowledges progress has been made, but says there's still a long way to go. How far have things changed in the fashion industry since 2008? Griffiths: There has definitely been a big improvement since 2008 ... After the all-black edition of Vogue Italia, we have seen the numbers of black models go up on catwalks, magazine shoots, adverts, everything. Everyone is much more aware of it now. I think that in the last couple of years people feel OK to talk about race, to say there has been a problem and to try and change that. White: Yes, there has been progress. Remember, there were no black models at all in the 30s and 40s and it was only as recently as the 1970s that we had the first black face on the cover of Vogue.But the change has not been anywhere near fast or dramatic enough. Unfortunately, there a still hurdles to overcome. Even this year there were some shows in Milan that didn't have a single black model. More generally, there are fewer jobs for black and Asian women ... and even though there are and have been a number of big name black supermodels like Naomi Cambell, Tyra Banks and Iman -- you rarely see them together in the same shoot. Are you concerned that the increased use of ethnically diverse models is just a fashion trend? White: There is a tendency to see black models as part of a trend rather than as a blank canvass. Designers and editors will say a certain style ""looks good"" on a black person -- generally something bright and colorful -- but you'd never hear the same discussions around white models. On top of this, the ""black look"" is defined narrowly within the fashion system. When an agency or designer says they want say, an ""all American"" look -- what does that mean? Do black models get sent on call for shoots like that? Mostly not. Griffiths: Ethnic looks are much more fashionable now than they used to be ... You see a lot more really lovely African fabrics, traditional tribal colors, Indian jewelery and stuff like that. But even if it started as a trend, I'm sure it's now something that is here to stay. The high-end designer clothes are getting more popular all over the world, not just Europe and America, so the designers will have to have models for all the different customers. How does life differ for black models on a day-to-day basis? White: Most white models are groomed for life in the fashion industry from a young age. An agent will invest resources so that they know how to dress, how to speak and how to behave on shoot. This type of thing doesn't often happen for black models, so they have a steeper learning curve and are more likely to feel like outsiders from the start. Griffiths: I think maybe I was one of the lucky ones. When I started in 2006, I moved from Jamaica to New York and it was amazing -- but everything was new to me. My agency took me to Topshop to buy a new wardrobe, and they told me the kind of thing I should say in castings and everything I needed to know to do well. From day-to-day there are some things that are different. When we do shoots, some of the makeup artists don't know what colors to use on our face or how to style our hair, and they maybe get a bit frustrated. But I don't get mad at them, I just try to help, I bring my own foundation and let them use that.","How far has fashion industry tackled racism since Vogue Italia ""All Black"" issue?

"(CNN) -- After 17 years as Chicago's archbishop, the ailing Cardinal Francis George welcomed his pending retirement Saturday with praise for his successor -- and words of relief. The Vatican on Saturday announced that Pope Francis had accepted George's resignation as archbishop and chosen Blase Cupich, bishop of Spokane, Washington, as the man who will succeed George in leading the Chicago area's 2.3 million Catholics in November. The 77-year-old George, who has been battling kidney cancer, told reporters that he'll look forward to advising the Pope as cardinal through various committees, as health permits. But leaving the archbishop post will be a relief, partly because health problems have made it difficult for him to focus fully on his duties. ""This is a full-time job, so I am relieved and grateful that somebody who can do it full time will be in charge,"" George said at a news conference in Chicago on Saturday morning. George, the first Chicago native to lead the archdiocese, submitted his resignation when he turned 75 in 2012. Church law requires bishops to offer to quit at 75, though it is not uncommon for the Pope to let them continue in their posts. Yet his required resignation offer also came in a year he was diagnosed with cancer. The cancer was dormant for a year after chemotherapy in 2012, but it showed new signs of activity this year, the Chicago archdiocese said. After more chemotherapy, the archdiocese said in August that George agreed to participate in a University of Chicago trial of a new drug aimed at boosting his immune system to fight the disease, according to the archdiocese. Pope to visit Philadelphia next year for conference . Cupich, talking to reporters with George, said one of this top priorities was to get to know his new flock. He currently serves 100,000 Catholics in his Spokane post, which he began in 2010. ""This is an enormous upgrade, so to speak,"" said Cupich, who also was bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, from 1998 to 2010. ""I want to get to know each and every one of you, so I hope that you'll be patient with me."" He said he would know which priorities to stress after he spends more time in the area. But when asked what his priorities were for Hispanics, who are a significant portion of Chicago's Catholics, he offered what he thought politicians should be doing. ""We need comprehensive immigration reform,"" Cupich said. ""... Every day we delay it is a day too long, and we should move on it today."" Cupich, like many archbishops settling into their new jobs in recent years, also will spend time assessing where his archdiocese is with priesthood sex abuse allegations. The church has been hit by many accusations of child abuse from across the United States and Europe, stretching back decades. In 2011, plantiffs' attorneys announced the Chicago archdiocese agreed to pay $3.2 million to settle a 2007 lawsuit that alleged church leaders failed to remove a priest that they knew had sexually abused minors. In January 2014, the archdiocese said it would release to a plaintiffs' lawyer documents related to 30 priests who'd been accused of abusing minors during the last 50 years. The archdiocese said 95% of those cases happened before 1988, and no priest with a substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor currently served in the archdiocese. ""(Cupich will) be fully briefed,"" George said Saturday. ""When I (became archbishop), I sat down for half a day and went through every single case, and that will happen here, too."" George praised Cupich as a man of ""deep faith, a quick intelligence, personal commitment and varied pastoral experience."" George and Cupich, a Nebraska native, will remain in their current posts until Cupich is installed as Chicago archbishop November 18. Pope John Paul II named George as Chicago archbishop in 1997. A year later, the Pontiff elevated George to cardinal, enabling him to participate in the conclaves that selected the next two Popes, Benedict XVI and Francis.","Cardinal Francis George stepping down after 17 years as Chicago archbishop .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The Oscar-nominated film ""Gravity"" traces the harrowing tale of astronaut Ryan Stone after a mission goes horribly wrong. She's lost in space and struggles to try to make her way back to Earth. ""Gravity"" is just a film. Imagine a similar real-life scenario: Would there be any chance of survival? That's a concern for the General Authority of Islamic Affairs & Endowments, or GAIAE, the United Arab Emirates' religious watchdog, for anyone who wishes to travel to Mars. The GAIAE has issued a fatwa, or an official Islamic ruling, to warn Muslims against a Mars mission. So far, the UAE has supported space travel. Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments teamed up with Richard Branson's Virgin group to create Virgin Galactic to provide spaceflights for tourists, starting this year. But a mission to Mars, it seems, is one step too far. Tourist trips to the Moon by 2043? The mission is being planned by the Dutch nonprofit foundation Mars One. In April 2013, it announced its ambitions to establish a human settlement on the Red Planet by 2025. But the GAIAE likens the journey to a suicide mission. On the authority's free 24-hour hotline, the issue was deliberated by the center's specialized muftis, or scholars, who released the following statement: ""It is not permissible to travel to Mars and never to return if there is no life on Mars. The chances of dying are higher than living."" Taking one's life willingly is against Islamic principles. In response, Mars One issued a statement asking the UAE's Islamic authorities to cancel the fatwa, saying every precaution would be taken to reduce the risk to life. ""If we may be so bold: the GAIAE should not analyze the risk as they perceive it today,"" the statement says. ""The GAIAE should assess the potential risk for humans as if an unmanned habitable outpost is ready and waiting on Mars. Only when that outpost is established will human lives be risked in Mars One's plan."" The statement includes a verse from the Quran that ""encourages Muslims to go out and see the signs of God's creation in the 'heavens and the earth.' "" It goes on to say the first Martian settlers would walk in the footsteps of great Muslim explorers like Ibn Battuta, the 14th century Moroccan journeyman whose travels took him across North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Indeed, space travel isn't alien to Muslim culture. There have been Muslim space explorers in the past. 200,000 people apply to live on Mars . The first ever Muslim space tourist was Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan bin Salman Al-Saud, when he joined the crew of American space shuttle Discovery in 1985. In 2006, Anousheh Ansari became the first Iranian-born woman in space. And to help Muslims observe religious obligations in space, the Malaysian government has been instrumental in setting up guidelines. In 2006, Malaysia's national space agency Angkasa convened a conference of Islamic scientists and scholars to address the religious obligations of Muslim astronauts. The result was a detailed set of rules called ""A Guideline of Performing Ibadah (worship) at the International Space Station (ISS)."" It tackles a number of issues, like the number of times a Muslim should observe daily prayers, when a day lasts just 90 minutes in orbit. Mars One says 1,058 candidates have been shortlisted for the mission, from pool of more than 200,000 applicants around the world. It's not clear how many Muslims are among the candidates, but Mars One says applications came from 107 countries. Since its inception in 2008, the GAIAE has released nearly 2 million fatwas. The fatwa on the Mars mission is now among them. Opinion: Why I signed up for a one-way trip to Mars .","The United Arab Emirates' religious watchdog warns Muslims against a Mars mission .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Summer 2013 was blurry for Robin Thicke, according to what the ""Blurred Lines"" singer told lawyers in April. ""Every day I woke up, I would take a Vicodin to start the day and then I would fill up a water bottle with vodka and drink it before and during my interviews,"" Thicke said in a deposition transcript made public Monday. Being high and drunk appears to be Thicke's defense in a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Marvin Gaye's family against Thicke, producer Pharrell Williams and hip-hop artist ""T.I."" Clifford Harris Jr. The lawsuit filed last fall contends Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" is an illegal rip-off of Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up."" ""It is a musical impossibility,"" he said in in the April 23, 2014 deposition. ""They're two complete different syncopations and note choices and different keys. One's a minor key and one's a major key."" Fans, journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between Gaye's 1977 hit and the 2013's summertime smash, Gaye's heirs contend. New York Times writer Rob Hoerburger wrote that the ""Blurred Lines"" bass line ""came right from"" Gaye's song. Musicologist Judith Finell, an expert hired by the Gaye family lawyers, said she identified a ""constellation of at least eight substantially similar compositional features between the two works. ... The signature phrase, vocal hook, backup vocal hook, their variations, and the keyboard and bass lines"" are substantially similar and they share ""departures from convention such as the unusual cowbell instrumentation, omission of guitar and use of male falsetto,"" she said. If it was stolen, Thicke was too high and drunk to do it, his testimony suggested. ""I was high on Vicodin and alcohol when I showed up at the studio,"" Thicke said. ""I walked in and he [Pharrell Williams] started singing me some ideas he had and the song happened very quickly,"" he said. ""I jumped right into the booth and started singing whatever he said."" Thicke does claim creation of the melody and four-part harmonies in the second verse, but otherwise Pharrell Williams ""geniused the whole thing."" Several print and video interviews Thicke gave last summer tell a different story of Thicke being thickly involved in creating writing and producing the hit. ""Pharrell and I were in the studio making a couple records, and then on the third day, I told him I wanted to do something kinda like Marvin Gaye's 'Got To Give It Up,' that kind of feel 'cause it's one of my favorite songs of all time,"" Thicke told Billboard Magazine for a story published in July. ""So he started messing with some drums and then he started going 'hey, hey, hey' and about an hour and a half later we had the whole record finished.""Â . Thicke now says he was lying to interviewers, partly blaming drugs and alcohol. ""With all due respect, I was high and drunk every time I did an interview last year,"" he said in the deposition. ""So there are some quotes I don't remember saying, but I do generally remember trying to sell the public on the fact that 'Blurred Lines' was my idea in some way."" His lies were elaborations he ""thought it would help sell records,"" he said. ""I thought that it being my song -- my idea would make it more personal because my music has always been so personal, that this was the first time I had a song out that wasn't personal and had nothing to do with me, and yet it was my biggest successful, which, you know, was very tough for me.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't often Boris Becker was caught out by a barrage of volleys on the court -- but the tennis great says he was stunned by the level of criticism he received after being appointed as Novak Djokovic's coach. Eyebrows were raised when Becker, a six-time grand slam winner, swapped his seat in the television commentary box to take up a role with the Serbian star in December 2013. Becker, who won 64 ATP titles and three Wimbledon crowns during a stellar 15-year career, is one of the most popular faces in the sport. But he says the level of negative attention the move attracted from both inside and outside of the game was ""all part of being Boris Becker."" ""It was a little bit strange and I was a little bit surprised,"" the German told CNN's Open Court ahead of the U.S. Open starting on Monday. ""I wasn't aware I had that many doubters. I must have stepped on many toes in my life for all of them to beat the bushes and raise their opinion. ""We live in a free world and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I was a little bit surprised."" Becker, who ended his playing days in 1999, had never coached a top player on tour before joining forces with Djokovic. ""I like to think that I'm very comfortable within the tennis community so I was surprised by some of the doubters, but this is sometimes a part of being Boris Becker,"" the 46-year-old said. ""You're in the front row of life and in the headlines all the time, so a lot of people feel they're entitled to their opinion, even though they don't know anything about me."" Becker took on the challenge of restoring Djokovic to the top of the game, having lost his edge in the big matches. He had started 2013 in confident mood by winning a third consecutive Australian Open, but the rest of the year was disappointing, losing to Rafael Nadal in the semis of the French Open and the final of the U.S. Open either side of defeat in the Wimbledon final against Andy Murray. Becker was introduced to the Djokovic camp ahead of the 2014 Australian Open but could only watch from the sidelines as his man relinquished his grip on the title at Melbourne Park, losing to eventual champion Stan Wawrinka 9-7 in the fifth set of their quarterfinal clash. That setback brought about fresh criticism of Djokovic's relationship with Becker -- though the German says that defeat provided the springboard which culminated in the 27-year-old winning his second Wimbledon title in July and reclaiming the No. 1 ranking. A five-set victory over Roger Federer gave Djokovic a seventh grand slam and went a long way to vindicating Becker's decision. ""I think it made our relationship stronger,"" said Becker of January's Australian Open defeat, after which Djokovic reached the final at Roland Garros but again lost to Nadal. ""It made us realize that the only way out was up. The only way to quiet everybody down was to start winning again and that's what he did. ""If you coach a player like Djokovic, you expect perfection. ""You expect the best. Obviously, the locker room was full of skepticism and critics who don't want this relationship to work, so we had to move up a gear. ""Fortunately, after his Wimbledon triumph, the discussion was ended."" Djokovic and world No. 3 Federer will be the top two seeds in New York, with second-ranked Nadal having withdrawn due to wrist problems. Djokovic has reached the final at Flushing Meadow four years in a row, but his only victory was in 2011. Federer, meanwhile, will be seeking to extend his record of 17 grand slam titles -- but he has not triumphed in the U.S. since the fifth of his consecutive wins in 2008.

"(CNN) -- Kyoto, Japan's capital from 794 to 1868, is one of the biggest stars on the Japan tourism trail, recently voted ""world's best city"" by Travel + Leisure magazine readers. Is it deserving of the title? Definitely. Unless you're a traveler under the age of 12 and don't give a hoot about learning the correct way to whisk a bowl of matcha green tea, exploring ancient UNESCO World Heritage sites or counting how many torii gates there are at the Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine (10,000, for the record). When traveling to Kyoto with kids, the mutinous cries of ""Not another zen garden, dad!"" will inevitably ring out, threatening to derail that dream family vacation. This is when you need to hit the Toei Kyoto Studio Park -- or Toei Uzumasa Eigamura -- and spend an afternoon geeking out on some of the most familiar icons of Japanese pop culture, from samurais and geisha to ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Sailor Moon."" 'The Hollywood of Japan' First, you'll need to toss your Universal Studios fantasies out the sliding shoji screen door. There are no rides here. This theme park celebrates the best of Japanese film-making, filled with huge Edo-period (1600-1867) sets you can explore on foot -- preferably decked out in a funny samurai-style wig you rented in the costume shop near the entrance. Often overshadowed by its traditional cultural allures, Kyoto was called the ""Hollywood of Japan"" between the 1920s and 1960s, until its thriving film industry went into decline. In response, film-making leader Toei Studios Kyoto opened up parts of its sets to the public in 1975. Further development followed and the theme park grew in popularity among tourists. Today, many of Japan's ""jidaigeki"" period dramas are still filmed on these sets. On my recent weekday visit to the Toei Kyoto Studio Park, crowds were light and no TV shoots were taking place, but I was able to get a behind-the-scenes sample of what happens on a typical Japanese historical drama shoot at the park's Jidaigeki Show. More relevant to most foreign visitors, however, is the Anime Museum, filled with impressive displays, pictures and cells from shows produced by the Toei film company's animation arm, including ""Kamen Rider,"" ""Sailor Moon,"" ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Super Sentai,"" on which the U.S. based its popular ""Power Rangers"" series. In addition to Toei's dozens of film-related displays, the park has live ninja and samurai shows, a Haunted House, Ninja Mystery House, Trick Art Museum, 3D theater, maze of illusions, science museum, indoor kids play areas and a lovely Japanese ""ukiyo-e"" woodcut print gallery. Haunting, but not horrifying . Given that the Toei film company is behind some pretty terrifying horror flicks, as well as the controversial cult classic ""Battle Royale,"" I expect something a bit more grotesque than what awaited in the Haunted House. Still, it's pretty darn scary, in a slightly cheesy way. The sound effects alone left me fighting an urge to seek out an emergency ""chicken"" exit as I hissed aloud, ""Why did I come in here?"" (Expletive deleted.) An actor, playing the role of a bloodied ""dead"" body, popped up in silent reply. Next, bearing in mind the words of author Jarius Raphel -- ""Ninjas don't wish upon a star, they throw them"" -- I eagerly hit the Ninja Mystery House, where staff conducted a quick primer on the history of the cloaked assassins' residences before setting me free to get out of a fun maze of false walls and doors. Alas, no ninja stars were thrown. Over in the Trick Art Museum, quirky 3D anamorphic art and props made for a perfectly Instagrammable experience. As I was traveling solo, a staff member was kind enough to accompany me through the space and take photos with my camera, doing a fine job of stifling her cringes as I struck awkward, unconvincing poses. Though few would likely make a special trip to Kyoto to see the Toei Studio Park, it's definitely a kitschy and fun way to spend a few hours. Buy the kids a souvenir ninja costume with their own set of throwing stars and you might even earn yourself an extra day of zen garden exploration. Additional Toei Kyoto Studio Pak information . Many of the shows are presented in Japanese only, but inasmuch as they're highly visual, they're still worth watching. Park displays include English text, while staff give out English-language maps at the entrance. Toei Kyoto Studio Park has multiple restaurants throughout, which serve Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine. Admission is 2,200 yen ($21) for adults. Some attractions require an additional charge.

"TUUSULA, Finland (CNN) -- Flags in Finland were flying at half-staff Thursday and government workers observed three minutes of silence a day after a teenager opened fire at his high school, killing eight people before fatally turning the gun on himself. Police probing Finland's first known school shooting said Thursday that a picture was emerging of the gunman as a lonely, antisocial 18-year-old who acted alone and left a suicide note saying good-bye to his family, but that his motive was unclear. Police said the victims -- all of whom were from the school -- were apparently picked at random. Six were students, one was the 61-year-old school headmistress and one was the 42-year-old school nurse. Ten other people were wounded in the attack. Jokela High School was closed for the rest of the week, but some of the 460 students gathered there overnight and into Thursday, crying and lighting candles for the victims. Police identified the gunman as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, a senior at the high school in the southern Finnish town of Tuusula, about 30 miles north of Helsinki. Auvinen died at a Helsinki hospital late Wednesday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Police said all of his victims had multiple gunshot wounds, most to the upper body and head. Police said they found 69 shells and more than 320 unused bullets at the scene. Chief Inspector Tero Haapala told Finnish news agency STT that Auvinen was determined to kill as many people as he could before turning the pistol on himself. Haapala said everything suggested Auvinen wanted the massacre to be as spectacular as possible, according to STT.  Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page » . At a news conference Thursday, police said Auvinen had sprayed a flammable liquid, possibly lamp oil, on the walls of the school and that he tried but failed to light it. Students and police painted a picture of panic at the school during the attack, which started around 11:45 a.m. (4:45 a.m. ET). Students said that the principal ordered everyone to stay in their classrooms, but many thought it was just a drill. Students said that, as word spread that a gunman was moving through the school, they were told to barricade themselves in classrooms, lie on the floor down and wait for help. For 40 minutes, many lay in fear as the gunman moved through all three floors of the school. Police said that, when they arrived just before noon (5a.m. ET), they found students trying to scramble out of windows; officers broke down doors to help students escape. Police said that, when they first made contact with Auvinen, they told him to drop his gun, but he responded with fire. Fearful of hitting others, police did not fire back, they said. Police said they found Auvinen a little more than an hour later, just after 1p.m. (6a.m. ET). A search of his house turned up books and the gunman's writings, which suggest he had ""very strong opinions against society,"" police said. Authorities were also investigating notes and videos Auvinen had posted on YouTube, the online video-sharing site. Most of the videos indicated a fascination with violence and some hinted at the massacre itself. Hours before the shooting, a video titled ""Jokela High School Massacre --11/7/2007"" was posted on the YouTube site by someone who identified himself as Auvinen. In rambling text posted on the site two weeks before the shooting, Auvinen called himself ""a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist."" ""I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,"" he wrote. ""I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."" The Jokela High School clip was one of about 80 videos posted on the site by Auvinen. In the video, a picture of the school disintegrates to reveal an image of a man resembling Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip was accompanied by the track ""Stray Bullet"" by the rock band KMFDM, whose lyrics were also quoted by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the Columbine High School massacre of 1999 in the United States. The YouTube site also included video of the Columbine shootings and the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Other video clips included Nazi war criminals. Police said they had not known about the videos before the shootings. YouTube took them down within hours of the shooting. The gunman, who had no criminal record, obtained a license for the weapon on October 19, four months after his 18th birthday -- the legal age limit for owning a firearm in Finland. He practiced sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range in Finland, police said. Finland enjoys a strong tradition of hunting and has a high proportion of gun ownership, with 2 million firearms owned in a nation of 5 million people. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said the shooting had inflicted a ""deep wound"" on the nation's sense of security. President Tarja Halonen called the attack ""shocking and tragic.""

"Menlo Park, California (CNN) -- Look out Vine: Instagram isn't just about sharing arty photos anymore. On Thursday, the company announced its 130 million monthly users will now be able to shoot and share 15-second videos, dressed up with one of 13 special filters. The new video feature was made available to all iOS and Android Instagram users around the world Thursday as a free update to the existing Instagram app. The basic look of the app is the same, but a small movie icon has been added that takes you into video mode. The changes were announced by Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom during a press event at the headquarters of Facebook, which bought Instagram last year. ""It's everything we know and love about Instagram, but it moves,"" Systrom said. The video-sharing feature was widely expected and puts Instagram in direct competition with Vine, the popular Twitter-owned app that lets users share looping six-second video clips. Vine has skyrocketed in popularity in the six months since it launched, attracting more than 13 million users. Many of the six-second videos have a unique look and feel, employing fast cuts and stop-motion animations to tell quirky little stories. Vine, Instagram and the rise of bite-sized video . On Instagram, the videos can be between three and 15 seconds long and include any number of individual video clips. But the coolest feature may come after you shoot the video: 13 brand-new filters, created by an artist specifically for Instagram video. They do the usual tweaks to make video pop, like adding vignettes, upping the contrast and playing with color. There is also an image-stabilization feature to even out shaky videos shot on the go. For now, videos can only be shot from within the Instagram app, and there is no way to upload existing video from your phone's camera roll. The 15-second limit was chosen after testing different times, said Systrom, who called it the right balance ""between not too short that it constrains your creativity"" and not so long that you have to wait a while for a file to upload. In its two and a half years, Instagram has hosted 16 billion photos, Systrom said. Users post 1 billion likes a day, and 130 million people use the service each month, he said. Systrom built up to the announcement with some flowery language about the significance of the new product. ""It's a powerful way to learn about new concepts, ideas and causes that move the world forward in a significant way,"" he said. ""It's our collective belief that the world is better off collected and shared permanently."" Not to be outdone, Vine seems to be readying some new features itself. The app's co-founders posted several Vines Wednesday that suggest users will soon have the ability to save drafts, splice bits of multiple Vines together and browse content based on categories and genres. The video-sharing news is the latest step in Facebook's quest to conquer mobile devices. The company has worked hard to increase revenue from mobile ads, which now make up 30% of the company's ad revenue. Will you be trying out Instagram's video feature?

"(CNN) -- Did you have a Franz Ferdinand moment when you first heard about Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crashing in eastern Ukraine? I am talking about the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination 100 years ago sparked World War I. The reaction from some politicians and hacks suggested they were having such a moment, after the MH17 crash -- hinting that the world would never be the same. The Malaysian Boeing 777, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, crashed in the Donetsk region of war torn eastern Ukraine, in an area controlled by anti-government forces, known as ""pro-Russian separatists"" in the West. Even before any details of the crash were confirmed, Russia found itself in the dock, accused of being responsible for the deaths of 298 people on board that plane, including citizens of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia and the Philippines. The most amazing part of this whole dramatic saga came when Russian President Vladimir Putin held a ""scheduled,"" as we were assured, phone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama, which, as fate would have it, actually took place when the wreckage of flight MH17 was still burning on the ground in a field not far from the town of Shahtersk. Talk about coincidences, eh? According to Kremlin and White House statements on the call, Obama and Putin discussed the crisis on the ground in Ukraine, sanctions and ways to find a diplomatic solution before Putin noted reports that a Malaysian plane had crashed. Details of the two leaders' exchange regarding the crash have not been revealed but it would seem safe to assume that Putin would have tried to assure his American counterpart that Russia had nothing to do with the downing of the airliner. Obama probably pretended to believe him but kept an open mind about it, especially as his stern-faced national security advisers -- of whom there are plenty these days -- were likely telling him that everything pointed to Russia playing some part in this tragedy. Naturally, the moment the plane hit the ground, the Ukrainian government pointed the finger of blame at Moscow, accusing it of arming the rebels in the east and providing all sorts of backup. Handily, a recording of a supposed phone conversation between two ""Russian officers,"" one in eastern Ukraine and the other in Russia, was produced, intended to prove that they were discussing the downing of the plane. But, in all honesty, it would be tough for the Ukrainian government and its allies to explain how this rag tag army -- and yes, it is a rag tag army, whatever some people claim -- could have managed to bring down a plane flying at an altitude of 33,000 feet. Some talking heads on the box have been saying that as the separatists have already brought down a number of Ukrainian aircraft they could have shot down flight MH17. There's only one problem though: all the previous aircraft were flying at much lower altitudes, some actually as low as a few hundred yards from the ground, while flight MH17 was way out of reach of all the shoulder-held antiaircraft missiles that the anti-government forces have in their possession. So to bring down a passenger plane at such altitude a much more sophisticated system would have been needed, not to mention personnel on the ground with the specific training required to operate it. Nevertheless, Putin will have a very tough time convincing the world that Russia had nothing to do with the downing of flight MH17. Because on the face of it the circumstantial evidence is against him. You know, Crimea becoming part of Russia and ""pro-Russian separatists"" waging a war with government troops in the east with Moscow's backing. So in the Kremlin they are obviously getting ready for some serious turbulence, if you pardon the expression, hoping to tough it out -- especially as the situation at the moment remains unclear, with both the Russian military and the Pentagon providing conflicting reports of what ""might"" have happened. Mind you, the Kremlin has already come up with one brilliant move, saying last night it would refuse to accept the two black boxes from flight MH17 that have been recovered by the anti-government fighters at the place of the crash. In theory that denies Kiev the opportunity to claim that Russia is ""tampering"" with the evidence ... although Ukraine claimed Friday that Russia held the recording devices nonetheless. The one thing that will most definitely change after the downing of flight MH17 is that the civil war raging in Ukraine that had somehow been forgotten by the outside world will now -- with the death of nearly 300 foreign citizens -- get an international dimension. And maybe, just maybe, all the key players will now make a serious effort to try to stop the bloodshed there. And the Franz Ferdinand moment will just be a moment and nothing else.","Russia is in the dock over MH17, despite few confirmed facts, says Alexander Nekrassov .

But he says it would be tough for Kiev to argue how a ""rag tag army"" could bring down a plane .
The tragedy will hopefully focus international attention on ending the Ukraine bloodshed, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton supporters launched a counteroffensive this week against claims that documents related to the Benghazi attack investigation were sanitized and ahead of another congressional hearing. A Clinton spokesman responded quickly to the story released Monday, calling it ""patently false,"" and a group helping with the former secretary of state's communications and rapid response mobilized an entire communications strategy, website and talking points around the issue. The strategy has a directness that has not always been seen from Clinton aides and affiliated groups, which have generally waited for a story to fully emerge before taking it on. A GOP-led House Select Committee on the Benghazi attack holds its first public meeting Wednesday, with seven Republicans and five Democrats looking into the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. compound in Libya that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The issue has been white hot politically since then. It loomed as an issue that Republicans used against President Barack Obama in the closing months of the 2012 election, and with the prospect of Clinton running for president in 2016, the issue has continued to burn. Rand Paul: If Hillary Clinton worked for Bill Clinton, she'd be fired . Sharyl Attkisson, who resigned from her job as a CBS News correspondent in 2014 for what she said was liberal bias, published a report Monday alleging that a State Department official close to Clinton had withheld and sanitized documents during the department investigation. The story, which many conservative outlets branded as a ""bombshell,"" was hung on Deputy Assistant Secretary Raymond Maxwell, one of the men reprimanded over the attack. The State Department flatly denied the story. The Accountability Review Board ""had full and direct access to State Department employees and documents. Any accounts to the contrary like that one you mentioned are completely without merit, completely ill-informed,"" said Marie Harf, the department's deputy spokeswoman. ""These reports show a complete lack of understanding of how the ARB functioned. It collected its own documents directly from anybody in the department. There was a department-wide call for information to be given directly to the ARB."" Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, followed up Tuesday with a statement to CNN. ""This is patently false, as the State Department said yesterday about the process that allowed unfettered access to the Accountability Review Board."" Correct the Record, the outside group handling communications for Clinton and urging her to run for president in 2016, launched a rapid response the same day ""to rebut, fact check, and respond to the upcoming Benghazi Select Committee hearings."" The effort includes a website -- BenghaziCommittee.com -- that highlights statements from the group, points out questions already addressed by past Benghazi panels and fact-checks some critics' claims. The group says it hopes to model its response after the way campaigns respond during debates. ""The loss of life in Benghazi was a tragedy but the questions of what happened that night have already been asked and answered,"" the group said in an email. ""Republicans have no credibility on this issue and are wasting taxpayer dollars on these sham hearings to ask questions that have already been answered, all for political gain: both to drive up their base turnout in 2014 and to go after Secretary Clinton for 2016."" Benghazi probe presses ahead despite new report . Clinton has taken responsibility in the attacks and has told a number of groups that it was her biggest regret at the State Department. In her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" she knocks those ""who exploit"" Benghazi for political gain and says, ""Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me."" The passage is considered a flat no to any suggestion that Clinton would testify before the House's latest Benghazi committee. Despite that, committee chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, is undeterred from proceeding with the investigation. A statement Tuesday from the committee said, ""As Chairman Gowdy has said, he is willing to risk answering the same question twice rather than risk it not be answered at all."" CNN's Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","Clinton supporters respond quickly to story saying Benghazi documents were sanitized .

"(CNN) -- Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday in a bribery scandal that rocked the city, the U.S. Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Helen G. Berrigan also ordered that Nagin pay $84,264 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. In February, a jury found him guilty of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and other favors from businessmen looking for a break from his administration. Of the 21 counts against him, he was convicted of 20. The former mayor maintained his innocence even after the conviction. Prosecutors argued that Nagin was at the center of a kickback scheme in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city. A January 2013 indictment detailed more than $200,000 in bribes to the mayor, and his family members allegedly received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City; and cellular phone service. In exchange, businesses that coughed up for Nagin and his family won more than $5 million in city contracts, according to the indictment.

"(CNN) -- The beheading of American journalist James Foley by ISIS militants has stirred grim memories, bringing into focus once again the risks faced by reporters in modern conflicts. Foley's death recalls the murder of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal correspondent who was kidnapped in Pakistan in 2002. Both journalists were decapitated. Videos of their killings were then posted online by extremist groups. In Pearl's case, it was al Qaeda. In Foley's, it was ISIS, a splinter group disowned by al Qaeda earlier this year. 'I wish I had more time' In the video posted Tuesday on YouTube, Foley is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black. Foley reads a message, presumably scripted by his captors, that his ""real killer'' is America. ""I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again,"" he can be heard saying in the video, which CNN is not airing. He is then shown being beheaded. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said that intelligence agencies are ""working as quickly as possible"" to determine the video's authenticity. ""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" she said. Shock waves from Pearl murder . The 2002 murder of Pearl, only months after the September 11 attacks, provoked shock and revulsion around the world because of its brutality and the profession of its victim. ""What it demonstrates is that the business of reporting on war has changed fundamentally,"" the veteran war correspondent Scott Anderson wrote in the New York Times Magazine following Pearl's killing. ""The powers that be in a conflict zone no longer regard the media as a neutral observer but rather as a strategic component -- something to be manipulated or co-opted or simply got rid of,"" Anderson wrote. But Pearl's murder, and the worldwide attention it received, also ""catalyzed the resurgence"" of the beheading of captives by Islamic militants, Timothy Furnish, a historian, wrote in a 2005 article for the Middle East Quarterly. During the Iraq War, militants decapitated three Americans -- the businessman Nicholas Berg and construction company employees Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley -- as well as numerous other foreigners and countless Iraqis. In Saudi Arabia, al Qaeda terrorists beheaded an American businessman, Paul Johnson Jr., in 2004. ISIS's brutality . Now, the focus is on ISIS, which has become notorious for its savage practices in Syria and Iraq, including putting victims' severed heads on poles. The extremist group, which calls itself the Islamic State, has taken control of large areas of Syria and Iraq, bringing with it ruthless slaughter of civilians and persecution of minorities. It has carried out executions, including beheadings, as part of its effort to establish an Islamic caliphate that stretches from Syria into Iraq. In many cases, the group has videotaped the executions and posted them online. The ISIS threat in northern Iraq grew severe enough for the United States to step in with airstrikes to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces. That decision apparently prompted ISIS to retaliate with the brutal killing of Foley, who disappeared in northwest Syria in November 2012. ""Our hearts go out to the family of journalist James Foley. We know the horror they are going through,"" said Pearl's mother, Ruth, according to a Twitter post Tuesday by the Daniel Pearl Foundation. Message to Obama . ISIS has also threatened to kill another U.S. journalist, who appears in the video showing Foley's death. The life of the other American -- believed to be Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syria-Iraq border last year -- depends on what U.S. President Barack Obama does next, the militant in the video suggests. But CNN U.S. Security Analyst Bob Baer said he didn't expect the video would make the Obama administration change tack. ""I don't think the White House is going to pull back on this, even though there probably will be more executions, as promised by ISIS,"" said Baer, a former CIA operative. ""I think this was all foreseen when we started hitting targets in Iraq."" The Committee to Protect Journalists said it estimates that approximately 20 journalists, both local and international, are missing in Syria. Many of them are believed to be held by ISIS, it said. At least 69 other journalists have been killed covering the war in Syria, according to the committee. Among the missing is Austin Tice, an American freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post. Tice disappeared in Syria in August 2012. There has been no word of from him since his abduction. Some foreign journalists held captive in Syria have been released. Would you watch the video? 'Shock value' But ISIS's decision to behead Foley and publicize it online is an ominous development. ""The purpose of terrorism is to strike fear into the hearts of opponents in order to win political concession,"" Furnish wrote in his 2005 article on beheadings by Islamic militants. ""As the shock value wears off and the Western world becomes immunized to any particular tactic, terrorists develop new ones in order to maximize shock and the press reaction upon which they thrive."" Analysts have suggested that terrorists have used beheading previously because of its horrifying effect on the public. Their acts have fueled debate about the significance of beheading in Islamic history and theology. A Slate article on the subject in 2009 said that two apparent references to decapitation in the Quran ""are traditionally understood as inspirations to ferocity and not literal calls for beheading."" The article also points out that decapitation has Western roots, too. It was used for capital punishment in France, Britain and other European countries. It was also allowed in Utah in the 19th century. But it no longer exists as a punishment in the West. In the Middle East, beheading as an execution option remains part of the criminal legal codes in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran and Qatar. But only Saudi Arabia continues the practice. But Foley's savage killing at the hands of ISIS didn't come after a trial by law. ""James was an innocent civilian who was bravely performing his job as a journalist,"" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, the state where Foley grew up. ""This barbaric and heinous act shocks the conscience and highlights the truly evil nature of the terrorists we confront."" CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- ABC's '90s sitcom ""Boy Meets World"" had one of the best TV bromances of our time, but the bond between Ben Savage's Cory Matthews and Rider Strong's Shawn Hunter wasn't part of the original plan. Had the production team behind the '90s coming-of-age comedy had their way, Savage's Cory, the precocious middle child of a loving middle-class family, would've had more male friends instead of his singular BFF, Strong's floppy-haired Shawn. ""If you watch the first five episodes, there's always another kid there and it's a different kid every episode,"" Strong, now 33, recalled in an interview with CNN. ""They kept trying to have another best friend, they really wanted Cory to have two best friends ... and it just wasn't working -- I think they wanted this feeling of 'Cory's gang,' and it just never quite clicked."" Strong, of course, had already been cast as the mischievous, lady-loving underachiever that became a teen heartthrob, a part that ""Boy Meets World"" co-creator Michael Jacobs knew was destined to be the actor's from his first read. But the comedic (and heartfelt) magic that was Cory and Shawn's friendship wasn't as obvious. And then, around a quarter into that first season, Strong was given the opportunity to make Shawn a bigger character. ""There was this kid who unfortunately got fired in the middle of the week because it just wasn't working, and they gave me all of his lines and just made it Cory and Shawn,"" Strong said. ""That same week, Danielle (Fishel) came in as Topanga. That week everything clicked, and we were all like, 'Oh, this is the show. This is the dynamic.'"" For those who are obsessive about ""Boy Meets World,"" which aired from 1993 to 2000, Strong pinpoints this fateful moment as ""the episode where Ben straightens his hair."" As the show stretched on, the ""bromance"" between Savage and Strong became part of its foundation, both to the creative team and the stars themselves. ""As actors, Ben and I really clicked, and it's that kind of connection that you so rarely find with an actor with somebody else, this preternatural connection,"" Strong said. ""This confidence that we always had in each other that we would never let each other down as actors. It's still to this day one of the greatest working relationships of my life."" Hollywood's best bromances . Ironically, Strong never imagined that he'd ever make it beyond the pilot, let alone a seventh season. When he first landed the gig, the idea of being part of a show for six or seven years seemed like a lifetime. In essence, the show has even outlived its own cancellation. It's been 13 years since the series wrapped, but ""Boy Meets World"" still airs regularly, and hardcore fans can own the entire series, now on DVD as a boxed collection for the first time. The passion for the Matthews family and the characters who floated into their lives has produced a spinoff. In 2014, Jacobs will reunite with Savage and Fishel, whose characters have moved on from being high school sweethearts to parents, for a Disney series called ""Girl Meets World."" Although the premise is centered on a new generation, the spinoff is a can't-miss for fans of ""Boy Meets World."" Strong doesn't currently have an official involvement with ""Girl Meets World,"" but he believes that Shawn Hunter will probably show up at some point. ""I'm very much in conversation with Michael Jacobs,"" said Strong who said he is writing and directing, not acting, at the moment. If Shawn were to make an appearance, though, he unfortunately wouldn't still be wearing his original famed leather jacket. Strong couldn't resist taking the item -- as crucial to Shawn's character as his long hair -- when he moved to New York after ""Boy Meets World"" ended. ""I stole the jacket from the show -- Disney wouldn't let us take anything, but I had a leather jacket that I had bought on my own, and I swapped it,"" Strong said. Ironically, the jacket was eventually stolen from his car, Strong said. Strong has great memories of the set. ""It was a ridiculously tight group of people. ... Between Ben (Savage), Will (Friedle), Danielle (Fishel) and me, it was like the goal of everyday became, can we please stop laughing long enough to get through this scene, because we're having so much fun,"" Strong said. Somehow, in the years since they filmed their series finale, the cast has also managed to evade the dreaded PTSS: Post Teen Stardom Syndrome. Photos: Child star transformations . For that, the actor-turned-filmmaker likes to give credit to both his grounded upbringing, and another child star who didn't self-destruct: Ben's older brother, ""The Wonder Years'"" Fred Savage. ""I always give credit to Fred Savage, because he was ahead of us and very close to us but he had been through such a high level of fame,"" Strong said. ""By the time we started 'Boy Meets World,' he was already going to Stanford. There was just this sense of: 'Hey, school's important. Family's important. You don't have to be the most famous person in the world and make a crapload of money. There are more important things in life.'

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek riot police fired tear gas to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators Tuesday, as thousands rallied to protest proposed austerity measures on the first day of a two-day strike. Twenty-one police officers and one demonstrator were hurt, and at least five people have been arrested, police said. About 3,000 officers are deployed on the streets of Athens. The protesters are rallying outside the Greek Parliament building in the center of the country's capital, where lawmakers are set to vote Wednesday on a tough five-year package of tax increases and spending cuts. The newly appointed head of the International Monetary Fund, France's Christine Lagarde, used one of her first media interviews to appeal to the Greek opposition to overcome their political differences and join a national consensus on the reforms. Speaking to French network TF1, she urged Greece's lenders to come to its aid and said Greece must take charge of its affairs in a responsible way, while looking after those people who had the least. Her words came hours after European Council President Herman van Rompuy also urged lawmakers to pass the measures, for the sake of Greece and the wider economy. ""There are decisive moments and the coming hours will be decisive, crucial for the Greek people, but also for the Eurozone and the stability of the world economy,"" he told the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday. As the demonstration continued into the evening, thousands of protesters -- some newly arrived -- faced police in riot gear manning barricades outside the Greek Parliament, but the mood had quieted. Earlier Tuesday, live television footage showed clouds of tear gas as police and protesters clashed, and black smoke from small fires billowing through the streets. A truck belonging to a mobile telecom company was also set alight. Police appeared to be trying to force protesters out of Constitution Square, CNN reporters said, but some were returning and others gathered in side streets ready to move back in. Drumming and music reverberated around the square, as well as shouted slogans. One group of protesters chanted ""Bread, education, freedom,"" an old rallying cry from 1973, when thousands of students clashed violently with police during protests against the military government. The 48-hour general strike kicked off in the early morning hours of Tuesday, hobbling most of Greece's transportation systems but freeing workers to participate in demonstrations. Members of the Communist PAME labor union took to the streets first, waving socialist signs in front of the Greek Parliament. The main rally, a cooperative effort between two much larger, mainstream unions, launched later. Cloth banners reading ""No sacrifices for plutocracy"" flapped in chorus with chants of ""Workers, you can live without a boss,"" and ""We want workers' rights, not profits for the boss!"" Government offices, schools and courts had closed, the unions said. Hospitals were operating on skeleton staffs, according to Greek state television broadcaster ERT. Transportation disruptions took place on land, on sea and in the air. Air traffic controllers periodically stopped work and flight traffic, according to their union. Stoppages also disrupted sea travel in the maritime nation, which encompasses many islands. Trains and municipal transportation also shut down, but Athens metro workers abstained from the strike, according to the country's transportation union. Train operators provided continuous service to demonstrators headed for central Athens. Bus drivers were on strike, keeping city buses off Athens' streets. Greece must pass the austerity measures if it is to win the last $17 billion portion of a $156 billion bailout package from other European nations that was granted in 2010 -- and also to clear the way for an additional potential bailout package to keep Greece afloat going forward. Greece needs the bailout funds to avert a default on debt repayments that are due as soon as mid-July. Such a default would send shock waves through the European banking sector and potentially dent global economic confidence. European Union Commissioner Olli Rehn, the bloc's lead negotiator on the bailout, warned Tuesday that Greece faced ""a critical juncture,"" as he pressed Parliament to pass the austerity measures. ""Both the future of the country and financial stability in Europe are at stake,"" Rehn said in Brussels. ""I trust that the Greek political leaders are fully aware of the responsibility that lies on their shoulders to avoid default."" He warned that there was ""no Plan B"" to avert default, and insisted that economic reforms -- although challenging -- were a better alternative for the Greek people. ""The European Union continues to be ready to support Greece. But Europe can only help Greece if Greece helps itself,"" he added. Protesters lament that the cuts are being carried out on the backs of those who can afford it least. ""With the policy followed since the bailout, we have seen people's living standards going down. It is the workers and the pensioners who are paying the debt,"" said electrical engineer Ioanna Lagonika. Lagonika, who marched in PAME's demonstration, said, ""The PM (prime minister) has said that this is a new start for Greece, but to us it feels like this is our end."" Accountant Pericles Panagakis, who also participated in the Communists' march, would rather see Greece go through bankruptcy. The austerity programs mean ""even tougher measures for the people and just for the people,"" he said. Panagakis would also like to see Greece's wealthiest make up for the government shortfalls. ""The solution is to take the money from people who have money, not from the workers,"" he said. The parliamentary vote, which comes a day later than originally planned, will be followed by a meeting of European Union finance ministers on Sunday to approve the final part of funding from last year's bailout. The head of Deutsche Bank warned politicians Monday against taking steps that might lead the crisis to spread beyond Greece. ""If it is Greece alone, that's already big. But if other countries are drawn in through contagion, it could be bigger than Lehman,"" Josef Ackermann said, referring to the financial meltdown that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment firm in the U.S. in 2008. International lenders have insisted Greece cut spending, lay off public workers, raise taxes and raise 50 billion euros ($71 billion) through selling off state-owned enterprises in exchange for a further bailout of the cash-strapped nation. The latest demands follow austerity measures imposed last year that included pension cuts; a sales tax boost; excise taxes on fuel, cigarettes, alcohol and luxury goods; and a rise in the average retirement age to 65 from 61. The economic crisis has inspired rioting in the streets of Athens in recent weeks, where protesters have thrown firebombs and clashed with armored police. The Parliament plans to vote on the austerity package sometime after 1 p.m. Wednesday. All three unions that marched Tuesday have also planned rallies for Wednesday evening.

"Washington (CNN) -- A major food safety bill that passed the House and Senate earlier this year before stalling because of a procedural problem won final approval Tuesday and now goes to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. The bill, designed to increase government inspections of the food supply in the wake of recent deadly foodborne disease outbreaks, originally passed with wide support in both chambers after originating in the Senate. However, it needed approval again because it violated a constitutional requirement that bills that raise revenue be initiated in the House. The Senate passed its version of the Food Safety Modernization Act on Sunday, and the House voted 215-144 for final approval on Tuesday in one of the final sessions of the lame-duck Congress. The bill, which represents the most sweeping overhaul of the food safety system since 1938, allows for greater governmental regulation of the U.S. food system -- currently in the national spotlight for numerous egg and produce recalls. Among its provisions, the bill gives the federal Food and Drug Administration the authority to issue direct recalls of foods that are suspected to be tainted, rather than relying on individual producers to issue recalls voluntarily. Currently, the FDA can negotiate with companies, but has no power to enact a mandatory recall. It also requires food producers to develop written food safety plans, accessible by the government in case of emergency. Under the measure, the secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to create a food tracing system that would quickly focus on the source of contamination should an outbreak occur. It also requires food importers to verify the safety of all imported foods to make sure they are in accordance with U.S. food safety guidelines. In the Senate version, an amendment sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana exempted relatively small-scale producers that sell most of their food directly to consumers within their state or within a 275-mile radius of where it was produced. Tester had called his amendment a ""win for anyone who eats food,"" noting the local food processors still would be responsible for demonstrating that they had identified potential hazards and were implementing preventive controls to address the hazards, or demonstrating to the FDA that they were in compliance with state or local food safety laws. CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The House votes 215-144 for final approval .

"Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah (CNN) -- Nobody ever said clinching a land speed record would be easy. Danny Thompson knew that when he started going for the spot in racing history's record book that had always eluded his father, Mickey, the famous Speed King. Danny was ready for Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. He'd taken his streamliner, Challenger 2, up to 317 mph at trials. He'd added some engine power and now he was restless, itching for his turn at the starting line. Speed Week was to be the first of several testing grounds as Thompson pushed his little metal ""cigar on wheels"" past 400 mph, past 450 mph, maybe even past 500 mph. He knows she's fast. He just doesn't know how fast yet. And then it started to rain. And rain. And rain some more. On Saturday, racing officials announced that the 2014 Speed Week -- the 100th at Bonneville -- was canceled. The salt is riddled with puddles and just too soggy for racing. The letters CANCELLED apeard in big capital letters on the Southern California Timing Association's website, along with this advisory: ""The SCTA Board is currently on the salt, and has determined that the standing water will not dry in time for us to hold our annual Speed Week event."" For Danny Thompson, who is 64, it was 1968 all over again. That was the year his dad was going to snag the record until the rains turned the salt flats into a lake. ""It's dÃ©jÃ  vu,"" he told CNN, which has followed his journey to Bonneville. ""It'll dry out. We're not giving up. It's just a little hitch in the giddy-up."" What drives Danny Thompson? Danny was just a kid when his dad, Mickey Thompson, became the first American to go faster than 400 mph at Bonneville. That was in 1960, when Mickey clocked 406.6. But to enter the official record books, a driver has to make the return trip along the 7-mile course within an hour, and the average of the two speeds is taken. Mickey's Challenger 1 broke down on the return trip. Mickey's second car, which he called the Autolite Special or ""flying needle,"" clocked 411 mph during a test run in 1968. Mickey knew this car was fast: ""On the right course, in the right conditions, I'm certain my car will run 500 mph,"" he told Auto Racing magazine at the time. ""I look forward to driving it at 500."" But the flying needle never ran at Bonneville. The rain saw to that, and the streamliner went into storage that November. Sponsors moved on to other projects and it was all but forgotten. Two decades later, Mickey approached his son about going for the speed record at Bonneville. Mickey was pushing 60 by then, and Danny was in his 30s. But Mickey, who had been fighting in court with a former business partner, was gunned down in his driveway just weeks later. For a while, it seemed as if the dream died with him. But about four years ago, Danny decided to go for it. He cashed in everything he owned, sold off a couple of Mickey's old cars, and started work on Challenger 2 in a garage in Huntington Beach, California. This was going to be his year. Still could be, if it ever stops raining. ""It cost us 20 grand to come up,"" he said, disappointed that he didn't get to run the Challenger, but far from discouraged. ""We'll just have to find more money and come back up here."" The SCTA board is talking about extending its next event, World Finals, from September 30 to October 3 to make up for lost time during Speed Week. Danny Thompson has come this far. People who know him say he's unstoppable now. Follow Thompson's web site for updates . Thompson is philosophical, pointing out that it took the current land-speed record holder, George Poteet, 10 years to get there in his Speed Demon. Even then, the needle has hasn't moved very far in half a century -- from Mickey's 406.6 to Poteet's 439 mph. ""Any study of the history of land speed racing reveals it is an endeavor fraught with difficulties and frustrating disappointment,"" a friend posted on Danny Thompson's Facebook page on Friday night. He continued, ""It certainly won't be easy, and there may be real moments of drama. But I, like a whole lot of people, believe in Danny and his dream. And it's become our dream, too. When you shake his hand, you can know you're not wasting your time. He is a true champion ... Now go get what you came for.""","Danny Thompson hoped to break land speed record for piston engine .

"(CNN) -- New champions, multiple first-time finalists, big names battling to regain glories -- this has been arguably the most unpredictable tennis season in over 15 years. And there could be more surprises to come. The four grand slams are done and dusted, but places at the year-end championships are still up for grabs for both the men and women. But before we move on to the final leg of the season, it's time to look back at the sport's biggest tournaments and draw some conclusions. Here are five of them. Maria is becoming a clay-court specialist . Let's clarify that. Maria Sharapova is still able to go deep at hard-court events, but of the Russian's 10 titles since the end of 2010, only two -- Indian Wells last year and Cincinnati in 2011 -- have come on surfaces other than clay. At the grand slams, Sharapova has won the French Open twice and been a runner-up in her three most recent visits to Paris, while reaching the semis in 2011, but the last time she appeared in a final at the other three majors was at the 2012 Australian Open. This year's trip to Roland Garros bailed Sharapova out -- the 27-year-old didn't get to the quarterfinals in Melbourne, London and New York. Perhaps in the years ahead, Sharapova might tweak her clay-court schedule to make it less taxing. Her prospects at Wimbledon next year should be better with an extra week between the French Open and the grass-court event. The men's 'Big Four' are more vulnerable . When Marin Cilic defeated Kei Nishikori at the U.S. Open in early September, it meant that for the first time in a season since 2003, two players not named Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Andy Murray won a men's grand slam singles title. Stan Wawrinka, you'll recall, opened the season by claiming the Australian Open. It was also the first time since the 2005 Australian Open that none of the ""Big Four"" showed up in a grand slam final. But is this the end of grand slam dominance by the acclaimed quartet -- who have bagged a combined 40 majors? Maybe not. While Wawrinka has always owned the game to overpower opponents, his victory over Nadal in January's Australian Open final had much to do with the Spaniard's back injury. Remember that Nadal possessed a 12-0 record against Wawrinka, without dropping a set, entering the finale. If Nadal had won the title in Melbourne, Cilic's triumph in New York would be regarded as a blip instead of potentially the lessening of the established stars' grip. If we're looking for the main reason why the Big Four's rivals gained ground this year, injuries to Nadal -- who didn't play at Flushing Meadows due to a wrist problem -- and Murray physically struggling to recover from back surgery in 2013, should be right up there. Even Cilic admitted the chasing pack got ""lucky."" ""I think the guys from the second line were a bit lucky because Andy Murray was also having trouble with his back; Wawrinka was up and down with his tennis after Australia,"" he told reporters in New York. ""A few other players were not playing the best all the time. ""And Rafa is not here. So that opened a little bit the gate for everybody else."" Now, if two players outside the Big Four win majors in 2015 ... Federer is back as a grand slam contender . Speaking of injuries ... Federer's back problems contributed to a poor summer in 2013, which included a second-round exit at Wimbledon and fourth-round loss at the U.S. Open. But the Swiss' health recovery and larger racket led to a return to the later rounds at grand slams in 2014. He reached at least the semifinals in three majors -- with Ernests Gulbis accounting for Federer in the fourth round at Roland Garros -- and was a set away from winning his 18th major at Wimbledon. Gulbis began the year strong, so the outspoken Latvian's win was hardly as surprising as those of Sergiy Stakhovsky and Tommy Robredo against Federer in London and New York last year. Federer's increased forays to the net shorten points and thus figure to add to his longevity, but his net points won in his four losses at grand slams this year -- 59.9% -- shows you how difficult it is to enjoy success with such tactics against the best opposition. Although Federer didn't win a grand slam in 2014, a big title could be on the way. Switzerland is favored to win the Davis Cup after reaching the final last weekend, and if that happens, the only thing missing from Federer's overflowing trophy cabinet will be an Olympic singles gold. French Open warmup tournaments didn't mean much for Nadal . If buildup tournaments were anything to go by, Nadal wasn't supposed to win the French Open. By his standards, the man who is regularly called the King of Clay slumped in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, and lost to Djokovic in the Rome final. His lone title during the European clay-court swing came in Madrid, and even then his camp said he was fortunate because Nishikori was injured. The Japanese player bossed proceedings until, feeling the effects of a back injury, he was forced to retire at 3-0 in the third set. But once Nadal entered the grounds at Roland Garros, that was all irrelevant. He progressed to the final in 712 minutes -- his quickest route to the final in nine visits -- and rallied to overcome Djokovic to preserve his unblemished record in those finals. As for Djokovic, he -- not for the first time -- wilted in the heat. Having won his second Wimbledon title in July, and then got married, he stumbled in stifling conditions at the U.S. Open. As his coach Boris Becker put it, ""the sun hit Novak first"" in his semifinal loss to Nishikori. There was plenty of variety . How rare was it to have eight different singles winners at the grand slams? Very. Only twice since the Open Era began in 1968 had it previously happened: 1990 (Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Martina Navratilova, Gabriela Sabatini; Ivan Lendl, Andres Gomez, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras) and 1998 (Martina Hingis, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Jana Novotna, Lindsay Davenport; Petr Korda, Carlos Moya, Pete Sampras, Patrick Rafter). The way Serena Williams cruised in New York for her 18th major, she has to be the favorite to pick up multiple grand slams in 2015. However, Williams won't be a shoe-in given how the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon unfolded this year. The top-ranked American failed to reach the quarterfinals in all of the other majors -- an almost unthinkable situation given her dominance at the end of last season. It opened the way for three first-time women's finalists -- Dominika Cibulkova, Simona Halep and Eugenie Bouchard -- while Caroline Wozniacki played a grand slam title match for the first time since 2009. Williams and Djokovic won the respective season-ending championships in 2014, but who will triumph at the WTA Finals in Singapore next month and the ATP's London showpiece in November very much remains to be seen.","Tennis' grand slams came to an end this year when Marin Cilic won the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- As World Cup openers go, this was about as bad as it gets for Portugal. Thumped 4-0 by Germany, one key defender sent off, another possibly out of the tournament with injury and its World Player of the Year looking decidedly unfit. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't lacking in effort but was as powerless as those around him to prevent Portugal being steamrollered by Der Mannschaft in Salvador. It started badly for Paulo Bento's men and got steadily worse as Germany maintained its record of scoring at least four goals in every opening World Cup match since 2002. Latest World Cup scores . They were 1-0 down after 10 minutes when Joao Pereira was adjudged to have hauled down Mario Gotze. Fellow Bayern Munich star Thomas Muller confidently slotted home the penalty. It was 2-0 when Mats Hummels thumped a header into the net from Toni Kroos' corner. Just five minutes later, Real Madrid defender Pepe tangled with Muller, who sank theatrically to the turf claiming a hand to the face. Pepe then stood over his opponent and pushed his head towards Muller's, the referee producing a straight red card. Muller then struck just before the interval to put the game well beyond Portugal, pouncing on a loose ball inside the area to fire past Rui Patricio. Portugal made a change at the break, as Ricardo Costa replaced Miguel Veloso, but it made little difference as Germany continued to press home their advantage. Mesut Ozil, who plays for Arsenal, should have found the net when played through on goal but he hit his shot straight at Patricio. With Pepe already off the field, another Portuguese defender joined him -- this time through injury rather than red card -- when Fabio Coentrao pulled up with what looked like a hamstring injury and departed on a stretcher. Germany squandered several counter attacking opportunities before Muller completed a memorable hat-trick on 78 minutes, stabbing a shot into the net after Andre Schurrle's cross had been parried by the goalkeeper. The 24-year-old was top scorer at the last World Cup in South Africa, netting five goals in six games. He now has 20 goals in 50 internationals for Germany. Ronaldo nearly opened his World Cup account in stoppage time but Manuel Neuer saved brilliantly from his fierce free kick. ""Winning was our only option and the team went out there with that in mind,"" Germany coach Joachim Low was quoted as saying by FIFA's official website. ""Thomas (Muller) did really well in attack and created a lot of space for us."" Iran 0-0 Nigeria . Meanwhile in Group F, Iran and Nigeria shared the first draw of the competition in Curitiba. It was the 13th match of Brazil 2014 and it proved unlucky for football fans as it finished in a stalemate. Both teams struggled to create goalscoring opportunities in a drab contest, although Iran missed a golden chance in the first half. Iran's first corner gave striker Reza Ghoochannejad the chance to open the scoring, but Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama stretched to save his near-post header. Nigeria, crowned African champions in 2013, were expected to win the game comfortably but the ""Super Eagles"" failed to seriously threaten the Iranian goal. The result leaves Argentina top of the group after a 2-1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday. Iran faces Argentina on Saturday in Belo Horizonte, while Nigeria travels to Cuiaba to play Bosnia.","Germany thump 10-man Portugal 4-0 in its opening match in World Cup Group G .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of state troopers and police from throughout the country stood at attention outside a Pennsylvania church Thursday to mourn Cpl. Bryon Dickson amid concerns that a survivalist and war buff suspected of gunning down two troopers may be on the hunt for more officers. The FBI, meanwhile, placed shooting suspect Eric Matthew Frein on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. As bagpipes played a mournful tune outside St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton, a small army of troopers stood at attention out of respect for the 38-year-old former marine. A Marine honor guard displayed Corps colors and the American Flag. Church bells rang slowly as six troopers carried Dickson's coffin out of the church and into a silver hearse, followed by the slain officer's young sons, Bryon III and Adam, and his wife Tiffany. Earlier, the Rev. Thomas Muldowney, the Pennsylvania State Police chaplain, told the congregation, ""We gather here in sorrow, disbelief and anger. But most importantly we gather here in faith."" Muldowney said ""Bryon's life was truly a gift from God himself."" ""You can remember him and only that he is gone,"" Muldowney said, ""or cherish his memory and let it live on."" ""Although our hearts today are heavy with grief, may we celebrate a life well-lived and find peace as we remember the many happy and special times that we shared with our fellow brother,"" he said. ""May we believe that he is in a place where he will continue to watch over us as we move forward."" Police continue to search for the man who killed Dickson and wounded another trooper last Friday, officials said. On Thursday, authorities said they believe the suspect is still in the area. Frein is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials said. Frein apparently cut his hair into a mohawk style before the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that re-enacted Cold War-era European conflicts. Frein is the 503rd person to be placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list. His FBI most-wanted poster describes him as a ""heavy smoker, a weapons enthusiast, and a survivalist. He claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa, and he has studied Russian and Serbian languages."" Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday investigators are trying to determine why Frein may have attacked in the small, central Pennsylvania town of Blooming Grove. But they know that, generally, Frein ""has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,"" Noonan said. ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" Police say he's responsible for the chaotic, bloody scene Friday night at the state police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Frein has an apparent fascination with Eastern European armies, their history and attire. His simulation group -- which Bivens declined to name -- would stage re-enactments using Airsoft guns. In this case, though, authorities say Frein is using live ammunition and shooting to kill. ""It is believed that Frein has assumed the simulation role, and is now acting it out in real life,"" Bivens said. Bivens said Frein has ""his head shaved on the sides with long hair on top,"" wider than a ""mohawk"" haircut, apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers. The hairstyle is ""completely different from what he had worn for years. In words directed at Frein, Bivens was blunt. ""If you are cowering in some cool damp place,"" Bivens said, ""We are coming for you. It is only a matter of time until we bring you to justice for committing these cowardly acts."" Nearly 200 officers are scouring eastern Pennsylvania for Frein. The manhunt prompted area schools to close Wednesday. Until Frein is caught, no one is letting their guard down. Bivens said Frein has had a ""longstanding gripe with law enforcement and government in general"" since at least 2006 and will likely ""stay focused on that fight."" Bivens said he thinks Frein is likely still in the general area. 'Get him inside' Cpl. Bryon Dickson was just ending his shift around 11:50 p.m. Friday when he walked out the station's front door. He barely made it outside when a gunman shot him multiple times, a probable cause affidavit said. Another officer, who saw Dickson on the ground, came outside to help, the affidavit said. But as Dickson told her what happened, another shot pierced the air. According to the documents, Dickson asked his colleague to ""get him inside."" But she couldn't. At about the same time, a third officer headed in to start his overnight shift. But as Trooper Alex Douglass walked toward the front door, he, too, was shot, the affidavit said. While Douglass managed to crawl into the station, other officers had to devise a plan to safely move Dickson inside. They swooped into the front of the building in a marked SUV to block troopers as they brought Dickson into the building. But it was too late. Dickson was declared dead at the station. Douglass was rushed to a hospital in Scranton and is recovering from a gunshot wound to the pelvic area. Authorities have been looking for Frein since. They haven't found him. But, on Monday morning, a man walking his dog in a wooded area of Pike County noticed a green Jeep slightly submerged in a retention pond, according to the affidavit. As he walked closer, he noticed no one was inside. But when troopers executed a search warrant, they found a cache of items inside: two spent .308 cartridge casings, camouflage face paint, military gear and information concerning foreign embassies, the affidavit said. They also found Frein's driver's license and Social Security card. A survivalist by hobby . Frein, 31, is a survivalist by hobby who lives in Monroe County, authorities said. Noonan said anyone who spots Frein or knows something about him, should contact authorities right away. A friend of the suspect described Frein as ""a pretty rational guy."" ""He's intelligent. When people say that he's a survivalist, there's almost somewhat of a negative connotation to that,"" the friend, who wanted to be identified only as ""Jack,"" told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""He definitely let his opinions about the government be known,"" Jack said. ""He was obviously a big critic of the federal government, but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me. No indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular. Most of his aggression was (toward) the federal government."" Frein's father told authorities that two firearms were missing from the family's house, including an AK-47 and a rifle. The father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school's rifle club. When Frein shoots, his father told authorities, he ""doesn't miss.""

"BUTTE, Montana (CNN)  -- Three families with young children were heading to a ski vacation together when their plane crashed into a cemetery in Montana, loved ones of the victims said Monday. Dr. Erin Jacobson and his family, shown here in a photo from November, were killed in the crash. Federal investigators said that with no flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder on the plane and no survivors, an investigation into what caused the crash could last months. ""This is going to take a while,"" National Transportation Safety Board Acting Chairman Mark Rosenker said at a news conference Monday. Investigators are looking into whether the single-engine plane was overloaded, what role weather may have played in the accident and what made the pilot decide to divert to Butte, he said. He urged reporters not to ""jump to conclusions"" about the crash. Early speculation focused on the fact that there were 14 people aboard the 10-seat aircraft, but Rosenker said young children often travel on the laps of adult passengers and urged reporters not to rush to judgment about the cause of the crash. ""To jump to conclusions is a disservice to your readers and to those who are watching your broadcasts,"" he said. ""This will be a long and tedious investigation -- extremely thorough. We will look at every factor which could affect the performance of this aircraft."" Investigators said seven adults and seven children were on board, and all died in the crash Sunday. Authorities have not publicly identified the victims. But colleagues and loved ones have named all 14.  Watch friend describe how victim was ""like family"" » . On Monday some of the victims' relatives visited the site of the wreck. St. Helena Hospital in St. Helena, California, said an ophthalmologist who worked there was killed, along with his family. ""The St. Helena Hospital family is filled with such deep sadness over the deaths of Dr. Erin Jacobson, his wife Amy, and their three children, Taylor, Ava and Jude,"" the hospital said in a written statement, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of each victim of this terrible tragedy."" A friend of the Jacobson family said the Jacobson children were 4, 3, and 2 years of age. A dental practice in Valley Springs, California, said dentist Michael Pullen and his wife, Vanessa, were on the plane with their 9-year-old daughter, Sydney, and 7-year-old son, Christopher. The family is from Galt, California. Dr. James DuHamel of DuHamel & Pullen Family Dental said the two families were related. Vanessa Pullen, a physician in Elk Grove, was the sister of Amy Jacobson, he said. DuHamel said Pullen was ""a fantastic dentist,"" and added that he will ""miss him greatly."" Adrian Cotton, whose wife is a sister of Vanessa Pullen and Amy Jacobson, is acting as a spokesman for the families. The third family was that of Dr. Brent Ching, a dentist in Chico, California, his office confirmed without providing further comment. Ching was accompanied by his wife Kristen and children Hailey, 5, and Caleb, 3, Hostetter said. Cotton said the pilot on the plane was Bud Summerfield, who was not related to any of the victims. While investigators continue to look into the crash, it is unclear whether details of what happened will ever be known. There is no requirement for a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder on such private planes. Rosenker said there might be some avionics -- electronic systems that private planes can use for a variety of purposes -- that might contain some information, though they are not built to withstand crashes. A CNN crew at the crash site, Holy Cross Cemetery, could see no large chunks of the plane, a single-engine Pilatus PC-12. But Rosenker said ""portions of all major structural components"" had been identified.  Watch footage from the crash site » . Some visitors set up crosses outside the gates of the cemetery to serve as a makeshift memorial. Others brought flowers. The flight was headed to Bozeman, Montana, but was rerouted to Butte, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus. The plane crashed 500 feet short of the runway at Bert Mooney Airport. No one was injured on the ground, Sheriff John Walsh said. The weather, which was clear Sunday, does not appear to have been a factor.  See a map of the crash site » . The plane was designed to carry 11 people -- two in the cockpit and nine in the cabin, said Rosenker. He noted that young children often travel on the laps of adult passengers. Martha Guidoni said she and her husband witnessed the plane crash. She photographed one of the first images from the scene, which showed the cemetery in the foreground of a huge blaze. iReport.com: iReporter at scene of crash . ""We were just taking a ride -- all of a sudden, we watched this plane just take a nosedive,"" she said. ""We drove into the cemetery to see if there was any way my husband could help someone.

""I looked to see if there was anybody I could pull out, but there wasn't anything there; I couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""There was some luggage strewn around. ...

Stops were made in Vacaville and Oroville, California, before the plane headed for Montana. The plane stopped at the Oroville airport about 11 a.m., refueled and departed about half an hour later, said Police Chief Kirk Trostle. The Oroville airport does not have a control tower. Eric Teitelman, Oroville's director of community development and public works, said that because it has a ""wide-open runway"" and a self-service fuel system, it is a frequent stop for general aviation aircraft. There were conflicting reports about ownership of the plane, which was manufactured in 2001.

"(CNN) -- For all the complexity of our national complexion, Americans still too often think that white makes right. Consider a new study of census returns reported on by the Pew Research Center. It showed, apparently, that significant numbers of Hispanics are now identifying as white. The research was presented at the recent Population Association of America meeting. Some news reports suggested that Hispanics, rather than solidifying a distinct ethnic identity and becoming the driving force of a ""majority-minority"" future, might instead try to be just the latest group of immigrants, such as Italians or Jews, to ""become white."" Such a shift, if it's real, has potentially big implications. Think about national politics, where the Republican Party plays to a shrinking, aging and increasingly anxious base of white voters. If large numbers of Hispanics were to start thinking of themselves as white, that could alter the calculations and rhetoric of the GOP. But it turns out such scenarios are at best premature. What the new research really appears to reveal is just how confused we continue to be about race -- and how, even amidst this confusion, whiteness remains a dangerously malleable idea that Americans must deal with more candidly. Let's start with the three points of confusion that Pew's report on the new research revealed. First, and most basic, is a statement that has been repeated yet ignored so often that it's like the fine print in an ad: ""Hispanics can be of any race."" That means there are black, white, even Asian Hispanics. The label ""Hispanic"" -- meaning, ""with origins or heritage in Spanish-speaking countries"" -- was intended by the census to be a category of linguistic and ethnic heritage, not an official ""race"" of its own. Yet in recent decades, Hispanics or Latinos have indeed begun to forge a cross-cutting identity that can feel like a racial category (shorthanded as ""brown"") and is sometimes set beside the other major blocs of America's racial color grid. So Hispanics can be at once a race and not a race. It's no wonder that media coverage of Hispanics can be muddled. The second point of confusion is that the new research did not in fact find a Hispanic flight to whiteness. What it found was that growing numbers of Hispanics, when told by government forms that they were not a race unto themselves and that they had to choose a race, chose the category called ""white."" As the study authors noted, this reflected the convolutions and limits of the census forms (which are to change in 2020) at least as much any underlying yearning among Hispanics to be white. But this brings us to the third point of confusion, which is that to the extent that some Hispanics did in fact want to be seen as white rather than Hispanic, they were using the clumsy language of color to express the subtle reality of class. An earlier Pew report indicated that the longer their families had been in America, the more likely Hispanics were to check the ""white"" box. This suggests that the way Americans say ""upward mobility for immigrants"" or ""mainstream integration"" is still too often ""becoming white."" Indeed, sometimes our national discourse on race proceeds as if it were all about groups of color vying to be acknowledged, while white people sit back and watch. The invention of panethnic categories such as ""Latino"" or ""Asian American,"" categories that take on a racial life of their own, is in part a reaction to the white-norming of politics and pop culture. But it's also a time-tested, all-American tradition. For proof, look no further than the invention of the white race itself. The great waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries -- to say nothing of the baroque rules of racial categorization in the slaveholding South -- showed that Americans have always been deviously flexible about deciding who gets to be white. At first the Irish weren't, then they were. Same with the Italians and Jews. In more recent times, Asian Americans who've achieved in visible ways have been granted ""honorary white"" status (wanted or not), while some people of color seeking middle-class success have been accused by their co-ethnics of ""acting white"" (whether they thought of it that way or not). The great risk, underscored by the reactions to the new research, is that we go on unthinkingly treating whiteness as the ideal and social baseline of American life. That's harmful because it subordinates people whose backgrounds aren't ""white"" and because it stunts the capacity of all people -- not least poor and working-class whites -- to name and reckon with class divides and inequality. I propose a better way of talking about what third- or fourth-generation Hispanics, or ambitious new arrivals in Chinatown, or resilient African American first-in-the-family college students are all doing. They're not becoming white. They're becoming American. And to become American is now a more colorful, complex and class-bound undertaking than it has ever been. Let's learn to see it that way.

"(CNN) -- As part of a scheme to encourage reading, 50 benches designed in the style of popular novels or kids' stories have been scattered around London. Visitors to the city can find the book benches, which mainly celebrate London's rich literary heritage, by following a series of trails around areas with strong links to writing and writers. Several prominent artists -- including Ralph Steadman, the surreal cartoonist and one-time sidekick of Hunter S. Thompson -- have been involved in creating benches that feature enduring characters such as Paddington Bear, Mary Poppins, Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. The ""Books about Town"" trails, launched by two UK charities, the National Literacy Trust and Wild in Art, can be found in London's Bloomsbury, Greenwich, Riverside and City areas until mid-September 2014. For those who can't get enough of literature-themed loungers, the benches will be auctioned off in October with proceeds going to help fight illiteracy.","Fifty benches celebrating popular London-linked fiction have been scattered about London .

"(CNN) -- A mini metropolis of teepees sprawls across the parched plains, and in the early hours of the morning the first to rise are the children. They have an important job to do. ""We'd wake up in those teepees, and we were pretty happy to slip the bridles off the horses and ride bareback to the river,"" remembers Jim Real Bird, today a man of 58. ""We'd take the horses to the river to drink water -- that was our first job as young boys."" Each August, the rolling hills surrounding Little Big Horn River in Montana are transformed into the ""teepee capital of the world,"" with over a thousand tents and hundreds of horses converging for the Crow Fair and Rodeo. Started over a century ago in 1904, the four-day festival is one of the largest gatherings of Native Americans in the country, with spectacular traditional costumes casting a luminous kaleidoscope of color beneath a brilliant blue sky. It's also an important training ground for the next generation of rodeo stars. ""It's one of the largest Indian rodeos within the United States of America,"" explained Real Bird, who today teaches youngsters how to hold on for dear life in the arena. ""We've had quite a few young Indian men that have ridden here, gone into professional rodeo, and become world champions."" Real-life horse whisperers . Indeed, if you thought the world of rodeo was simply that of the white cowboy, think again. There is another master of the saddle, one who has honed their horsemanship over hundreds of years. ""American Indians have a special relationship with horses because it was a way of life,"" said Jim's uncle, 78-year-old Robert Old Horn, also of the Crow Nation tribe. ""My family were known for their ability to ride bucking horses. There was a mastery to how they could ride a horse -- it involved timing, balance,"" said Old Horn, each word tumbling out slow and deep. Outside the rodeo ring however, there's another sport taking place at Crow Fair -- and it's as fast and furious as they come. Indian Relay . In the world of Indian Relay fearless jockeys race bareback around an oval track three times, leaping from horse to horse while still in motion. At the end of each lap the rider jumps from their first horse, hits the ground running, then climbs onto the back of their next horse for the following lap. ""It's more or less carried on from the warrior days of old, when they would go and invade enemy camps and make off with their horses,"" said Old Horn, who took part in his first relay when he was just 16. ""Today, white people might call it stealing. But back at the time it was a mark of bravery and courage to enter the camps, knowing you could meet your end."" The adrenalin-fuelled relay takes place without helmets, saddles, or goggles, and Old Horn is philosophical about the risks. ""There's a lot of danger in anything you do,"" he says evenly. ""But there's the courage of the participants and the determination to master whatever it is they do."" Colorful Crow . As the sun sets, the evening pow wow begins, the sounds of traditional singing and dancing flowing through the campsite. Riders don't just pack their horse saddles for the annual fair -- they include their dancing outfits and drums too. ""During the day they'd do the races and rodeos, and then in the evenings they took part in a pow wow,"" said Real Bird, about a tradition stretching back 100 years. ""They'd talk their own language, and they knew the Native American songs."" And once the boisterous nightly celebrations have given way to sleep, the children will be the first to stir in their teepees come the dawn. Photography: Femmes fatales take over Paris racetracks .

"(CNN) -- A CBS correspondent was brutally attacked Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square after the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the network said in a statement released Tuesday. Lara Logan, 39, was covering celebrations for a ""60 Minutes"" story, the network said, when a frenzied mob of about 200 people surrounded her, her crew and their security team. Separated from the others in the chaos, Logan was surrounded, beaten and sexually assaulted, the statement said. A group of women and about 20 Egyptian soldiers intervened to rescue the correspondent, the network said. Logan reconnected with her team and returned to her hotel, CBS said. She returned Saturday to the United States, where she has been hospitalized. CBS said it would have no further comment and that Logan and her family requested privacy. Logan, a native of South Africa, began her work with CBS on ""60 Minutes II"" in 2002 and then moved to the original ""60 Minutes"" two years later. She was promoted to chief foreign correspondent in 2006 and to chief foreign affairs correspondent in 2008. Earlier during the Cairo protests, Logan and her crew were detained overnight and interrogated. ""We were not attacked by crazy people in Tahrir Square,"" Logan told Esquire's The Politics Blog about the February 3 incident. ""We were detained by the Egyptian army. Arrested, detained and interrogated. Blindfolded, handcuffed, taken at gunpoint, our driver beaten. It's the regime that arrested us. They arrested (our producer) just outside of his hotel, and they took him off the road at gunpoint, threw him against the wall, handcuffed him, blindfolded him. Took him into custody like that."" Logan spoke with the magazine Thursday night as she boarded a plane for her return to Egypt, saying that her interrogators accused her and her crew of being ""Israeli agents,"" kept them in ""stress positions"" throughout the night and only reluctantly gave her medical treatment for an illness. ""I was violently, violently ill,"" she said. ""I'd been ill for a few days -- I hadn't mentioned it to anyone at CBS."" At first, she said, they ignored her condition ""until I vomited so much that they did have a medic see me at this secret facility -- they wouldn't tell us where we were. Then I was begging for an IV, and at first they wouldn't. I vomited up everything that the medic gave me. I vomited all over the interrogation cell. I vomited all over this office they put me in after that, and so eventually they put me on an IV.""","NEW: Lara Logan told magazine about an earlier detention by the Egyptian army .

"(CNN) -- Americans are in a period of amazingly negative thinking about the state of our country. A recent Gallup analysis drove home how deep and how threatening the current mood is. Gallup asked Americans in early June how much confidence they had in our nation's institutions. The answer: not much. Only 30% had ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot of confidence"" in the Supreme Court. Just 29% felt that way about the presidency. And an abysmal 7% had faith in the Congress. Who is the worst president since WWII ? Think about what this means. Our most trusted national institution, the unelected Supreme Court, has the confidence of almost (but not quite) one out of every three Americans. The presidency is slightly weaker and the Congress collapses to fewer than 1 in 10 Americans. Gallup also did some comparative analysis using findings from its World Poll and the trends regarding Americans' views on government are even more sobering. In the poll, 79% of the American people believe corruption is widespread in government. That is a jump of 20 points since 2006, when 59% of the country thought government was corrupt (a year when the country was dissatisfied enough that the ruling Republicans lost control of both the House and Senate). The Gallup analysis demonstrates that Americans are more likely to believe their government is corrupt than people in Brazil, Hungary or Tajikistan, to cite just three examples. In January of this year, Gallup found that more Americans picked bad government and corruption as our biggest problem than picked any other challenge, including the economy and unemployment. These are stunning numbers. When four out of five Americans believe government is corrupt, something is profoundly wrong. It is a lot bigger than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or for that matter George W. Bush. Under the weight of this negativity, there has been a dramatic decline in satisfaction with the freedom we have to choose how we live our own lives. The number of people saying they are dissatisfied has jumped from 9% in 2006 to 21% in 2013. This 12-point jump in dissatisfaction tied the United States for No. 10 among countries suffering the most rapid decline in satisfaction. The other countries that have experienced drops of that scale are seriously troubled places, including Pakistan, Yemen, Cyprus, and Spain (where youth unemployment is approaching 60%). To put this in context, the Gallup numbers show that in 2006 the United States was one of the top countries in the world when it came to satisfaction with freedom. By 2013 it had dropped out of the top 25% of all countries. A country in which 4 out of 5 people believe their government is corrupt is a country teetering between a populist uprising and a collapse into cynicism, passivity, and fatalism. These results suggest we will either renew our commitment to the rule of law, the punishment of corruption and the insistence on honest self-government or we will cease to be America as the land of the free and the land of opportunity. This Fourth of July weekend, we need to remember what our Founding Fathers did to create the liberty we enjoy and dedicate ourselves to a new burst of freedom and a new wave of political reform that cleans up the corruption and re-establishes the right of every American to dream and to work to fulfill that dream.

Feel free to model the outfit yourself. Voting for the winning look begins August 28 on Facebook. But does Williams, 48, feel like he needs a makeover? ""Why not? I think it's fun, and I would definitely like to have somebody else's opinion on my outfits. And why not let the American public choose?"" Williams said. ""Do I need a makeover? No. Do I want one? Kind of, yeah."" What he doesn't want, though, is to look like every other slick TV pitchman. Williams' original Trivago look is the work of a European stylist. He tried on a number of outfits and Trivago made the final call. ""I had a belt on at one point, and it just didn't kind of go with the outfit and we scrapped the belt. It's probably one of the best decisions we ever came up with because look what it's created,"" Williams said. What it's created, among American fans and critics, is much speculation about this mystery man. Did he just roll in on a red-eye or out of bed or off a bender? Hard to say. And that, it seems, is what has people fascinated. ""It's that 'divorcee who keeps scotch in the glovebox' look,"" according to one Twitter user who replicated the distinctive look for himself. ""I've decided the â€ª#trivagoGuy is what happened when the â€ª#TommyBahama guy lost his wife and started smoking lots of pot,"" said another. The real guy is based in Berlin, where he recently finished a two-and-a-half year stint playing an American rock star on German soap opera ""Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten"" (""Good times, bad times""). That role is actually the reason for the semi-shaven, tousled coiffure of the Trivago ad. On the show he had longer hair and a goatee, so he had to retain some of that to be ready for his rock star role, complete with goatee, a week after shooting the ad. Williams had an early acting role on the ""Cosby Show"" and he has also appeared on ""Law and Order"" and on New York stages. He has released an EP called ""Temporary Man,"" and is an avid wearer of belts. And for those fans who find his rough-and-tumble Trivago look rather fetching, you'll be pleased to know that Williams is single ""and loving it.""","A makeover contest aims to spiff up the disheveled ""Trivago Guy""

"(CNN) -- Singapore's National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has been forced to revise a World Cup-themed ad campaign after it appeared to score an own goal with its latest message. The ad, which was on seen on TV and on local buses, featured a crestfallen boy named Andy expressing his hope that Germany would win football's biggest tournament after his father placed all his savings on that result -- which of course, they did. The jokes started to spill out across the world following Germany's remarkable 7-1 victory over hosts Brazil in the semifinal. ""Cheer up kid, your dad bet on Germany! He's so rich, you don't even need to go to college any more!"" quipped Jimmy Fallon, host of ""The Tonight Show."" Reply . But the quick-thinking NCPG has used the attention -- including from U.S. late night talk show hosts -- to counter with another advertisement, this time highlighting the ongoing nature of problem gambling. The followup ad has one of Andy's friends asking, ""Your dad's team won. Did you get your savings back?"" to which Andy replies, ""No, dad never stops... he wants to bet one more time."" The plaintive conversation is followed up with the line, ""Often, the people who suffer from problem gambling aren't the gamblers."" Prior to the rejig, the NCPG defended the campaign: ""At the end of the day, win or lose, the dangers of problem gambling, and the potential anxiety and pain that loved ones go through remain unchanged,"" a statement read. The organization did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Singapore has somewhat of a love-hate relationship with betting. Problem gambling is an issue in Singapore, as are the related debts owed to loan sharks. Some of the city-state's more unscrupulous citizens are often implicated with global match-fixing scandals, and Singapore has led crackdowns on ringleaders, including Dan Tan, a Singaporean who is currently being held in indefinite detention. In addition, 15 people were arrested last month for allegedly receiving illegal football bets equivalent to US$640,000, police said. However, despite the societal impact that gambling has, Singapore revised its laws in 2006 to liberalize gaming in the city, a move that has brought international operators to Singapore and made it one Asia's casino hubs. The NCPG campaign -- now updated to reflect the father's voracious gambling habits -- will run until July 23.

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- On the streets of the Ugandan capital of Kampala, scores of vulnerable children face uncertain futures. Living down alleyways and trying to make a living near busy traffic junctions, these kids are often subject to abuse and exploitation. Youth unemployment is rampant in the east-central African country, with reports by international bodies, like the African Development Bank, putting estimates as high as 83%. But one former street kid, Innocent Byaruhanga, is hoping to turn things around. In 2011, Byaruhanga launched Pamoja, a center working with former street children and vulnerable youth to produce sustainable shoes out of disused tires. ""What we did was come up with [an] idea that can give skills to these children,"" says Byaruhanga. A former street child himself, Byaruhanga is well aware of what hundreds of vulnerable kids are being exposed to -- dangers like substance abuse, crime, lack of nutrition, exploitation and stigmatization. ""The biggest challenge that youth and former street children face is unemployment and drug abuse,"" he explains. ""They are either exploited by the drug lords or use them to enable them forget their problems. This is because they live in poor conditions and have to cope with their poverty or find a livelihood by all means available to them."" Trash into treasure . Byaruhanga's Pamoja Center is an initiative of his not-for-profit, Save Street Children Uganda, which he established in 2005. The center's goal is to help the youth realize their potential by equipping them with techniques and knowledge that they can use to ""make a contribution to society within their communities."" ""We came out with an idea of making shoes and we said what can we do that people are not doing?"" explains Byaruhanga. ""What can we do that will attract people to buy? What can we do in order that will earn us money at a quicker speed and at the same time which is very cheap?"" The answers weren't far: looking around the slums, the resourceful entrepreneur saw piles of ruined tires laying strewn aside, so he decided to turn trash into treasure. ""We want to use the things that people don't see as valuable,"" says Byaruhanga as he outlines the startup's approach. ""Number one: Ugandan-made; two: Ugandan-owned; three: made from the thing that people don't see; four: we want to do something that is very durable,"" he says. ""The work we are doing is not only help us to create employments for vulnerable children. We also want to protect the environment."" Creating leaders . And so from exhausted rubber tires, youngsters in Kampala are taught how to cut and manufacture eco-friendly footwear. Since 2011, Byaruhanga says Pamoja Center has been able to employ and train over 80 former street children and 37 vulnerable community youth aged between 12 to 24 years old. Not only that, but for every pair of shoes produced and sold, Pamoja shares the profits with the youthful cobbler, in turn allowing them to support themselves. ""We want to surprise the entire Uganda as a nation. We want to set up an industry,"" Byaruhanga says full of vigor. ""Young people should be the ones to lead, to make decision-making. ""We want to create jobs for the youth, we want to create jobs for former street children, and also the orphans.""","Innocent Byaruhanga launched the Pamoja Centre in 2011 in the slums of Kampala, Uganda .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to come together. Last week brought tantalizing hints the nine justices could speak as one on the thorniest of issues -- on cellphone privacy and presidential recess appointments. But in the end came a familiar conservative-liberal split on the last, and perhaps most-watched case of the term ending this week. That was an Obamacare challenge over religious liberty and reproductive choice. When the stakes are highest, especially on cases with a distinct political bent, old habits die hard. ""There's no doubt this is a closely divided Supreme Court. That's been true for decades, and it's no less true now,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""You have five sold conservative votes in the majority, but Justice (Anthony) Kennedy, who is the least conservative among them, does on occasion switch sides and join his more liberal colleagues. There's a constant battle going on in these ideological fights."" All together now . From affirmative action, campaign spending, public prayers, and labor union power-- the justices continue to stack their docket with cases spanning a range of constitutional and legal questions. What was surprising was how often they agreed to agree. Two-thirds of the 72 cases fully decided this term were unanimous, the highest percentage in years. Most were low-profile disputes, but did include: . * A shockingly united rebuke of law enforcement discretion to search for incriminating data in cellphones and smartphones, when suspects are first arrested. The simple answer: ""get a warrant."" * A narrowly-drawn defeat for the Obama administration on recess appointments, those named to temporarily fill high government positions without Senate confirmation. Congress must define when it's in recess, not the administration. Also amazing was that only 14 percent of the court's decisions were 5-4, with just four of those 10 splits along the liberal-conservative marker. But that included four of the most contentious of petitions: . * The big one on Obamacare gave some for-profit businesses discretion to deny certain birth control insurance based on religious objections centered around anti-abortion beliefs. * Allowing civic prayers in local town meetings, even if the ceremonies are predominantly offered by Christian citizens. * Another setback for campaign finance reform, this time giving individual political donors the power to throw more money to more candidates in a federal elections. * A defeat for public sector labor unions over dues for non-members. The swing vote . As usual, Kennedy was the swing vote in the majority in those cases. Chief Justice John Roberts has made no secret of his desire to foster as much unanimity among his benchmates as possible. ""There are clear benefits to a greater degree of consensus on the court,"" he said just months after joining in 2005. ""Unanimity or near unanimity promote clarity and guidance for the lawyers and for the lower courts trying to figure out what the Supreme Court meant."" The key, said Roberts is to rule on the narrowest grounds possible, to do only ""what's necessary to decide the case."" It has been a most elusive goal, and has attracted a measure of bipartisan criticism. Ruling narrowly means both sides may have reason to complain about the outcome. Many legal observers believe the idea of consensus sounds good on paper, but is not practical given the current court's makeup, and the sharply held views of its members, led by Roberts himself. Harmonic principles will be tested mightily in coming months, as the justices begin preparing for their next term in October and what promises to be a more contentious session. Same-sex marriage upcoming? The justices by this time next year could be tackling the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, and whether gay and lesbians have an ""equal protection"" right to legally wed. Federal courts around the country in the past eight months have been all but unanimous those couple do enjoy such a right. It seems all but inevitable the justices will have to answer the question, in what could be the defining civil rights ruling of this generation. But wait, there is more. ""Not only are the justices likely to get the equal protection question over same sex marriage,"" said Goldstein. ""But next term, they are very likely to return to the abortion question, in a case from Texas involving restrictions over where clinics can be located. And that will be a monumental fight, because Roe v. Wade is never settled in the Supreme Court."" Another Obamacare challenge, perhaps over when some Americans can get tax breaks and subsidies when buying insurance on the federal health exchange, may also be put on the he docket. Confidence low . A Gallup survey released Monday found Americans' confidence in the Supreme Court is at just 30 percent, the lowest since 1973. It was as high as 56 percent in the mid-1980s. The numbers reflect an overall drop in confidence in the all branches of government. But members of the court hold fast to their belief they operate independently of public opinion, and politics. ""I don't think any of my colleagues, on any cases, vote the way they do for political reasons. They vote the way they do because they have their own judicial philosophy,"" Justice Antonin Scalia told CNN recently. The five mostly conservative justices were named by Republican presidents, the four more liberal members by Democratic presidents. That dynamic more than anything explains why the court is perceived-- rightly or wrongly-- as hopelessly divided and ideological. Social media, the proliferation of partisan legal advocacy groups, and a corrosive political atmosphere in Washington all have helped to punch holes in the record and reputation of the Roberts Court. Are they completely powerless to change hearts and minds? The court's members will tell you they ignore all that outside noise-- or try to-- and focus instead on the work. ""People think in fixing things, that there's a magic bullet to every problem. It doesn't work that way,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told CNN last year. ""We're trying to convince. And we're trying to convince (the public) what we're doing is the right thing."" What the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision means . Justices strike down abortion clinic buffer zone . Court slows EPA on emissions, but largely backs its rules .","There were signs the court could speak with a unanimous voice in key cases .
But then came Monday's ruling on Obamacare and contraception .
There were 10 cases overall where decisions came down 5-4 ."
"(CNN) -- The Boy Scouts of America has revoked the charter of a Seattle church that refused to fire its pack's gay scoutmaster, according to a letter written by the organization's general counsel and provided to CNN by the church. Pack and Troop 98 is composed of about 15 boys, and according to attorney Steven McGowan's letter, they will have an opportunity to transfer to another troop. ""As you are aware the policy of the Boy Scouts of America does not allow open or avowed homosexuals to serve as volunteer adult leaders,"" read McGowan's letter to an attorney representing Rainier Beach United Methodist Church. The church received its charter in November and selected Geoff McGrath, a 49-year-old Eagle Scout, to lead the troop. The Rev. Monica Corsaro said she knew McGrath was gay, and she wasn't trying to make any political statement by selecting him. ""We were not hiding,"" she said. ""We are talking about real people that are being effected by a policy of discrimination ... by a policy that BSA teaches, so we are just calling it out."" She further said all the boys in the troop were aware of McGrath's sexuality and that his selection was in line with the church's philosophy of being ""open to all people."" Corsaro has even performed same-sex marriages at the church, she said. McGrath could not be reached for comment because he is out of the country, celebrating an anniversary with his partner of 20 years, Corsaro said. But he provided a statement to Scouts for Equality, a group that aims to end the BSA ban on gay scout leaders. ""I'm stunned and disappointed to hear the news,"" he told Scouts for Equality. ""Pastor Corsaro specifically sought out someone with my Scouting background to help get these units off the ground, and her church is now being told to violate their religious convictions. It's unconscionable and irreverent."" According to Scouts for Equality, BSA questioned McGrath's sexuality after an NBC News report last month. ""McGrath, abiding by the Scout's commitment to trustworthiness, acknowledged his sexual orientation to the BSA, which in turn, responded by revoking McGrath's status as Scoutmaster,"" the group said on its website. Corsaro refused to remove McGrath from his post, resulting in last week's letter from McGowan stating, ""As a result of this refusal to comply with the policies, guidelines, rules and regulations of the Boy Scouts of America, Rainier Beach United Methodist Church is hereby advised that it is no longer an authorized chartered organization and may no longer use the Scouting program or any of its registered marks or brands."" BSA spokesman Deron Smith added in a statement to CNN, ""We are saddened by this development, but remain committed to providing all youth with the best possible Scouting experience where the Scouting program is the main focus."" In May, the group's 1,400-member national council voted to allow gay scouts into its troops, saying no youth would be denied membership ""based on sexual orientation or preference alone."" The group maintained its ban on gay scout leaders, however. Because of that ban, Disney announced last month it would end a program allowing its employees to steer corporate donations to the Boy Scouts. Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar, Major League Soccer, Merck, Intel, UPS, Alcoa and AT&T have also ended partnerships with the Scouts because of its policy, according to Scouts for Equality and the Human Rights Campaign. In a Monday statement to CNN, the BSA said it doesn't believe ""the topic of sexual orientation has a role in Scouting and it is not discussed unless it is deliberately injected into Scouting."" The organization also said it ""does not have an agenda on the matter of sexual orientation; we remain focused on working together to deliver the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training."" The United Methodist Church is the BSA's second-largest chartered organization, accounting for more than 10,700 units and almost 350,000 members, according to the Boy Scouts website.","Seattle church loses Boy Scouts charter for refusing to fire openly gay scoutmaster .

"(CNN) -- Adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony's skeletal remains, an FBI latent print examiner testified Monday in the capital murder trial of the girl's mother, Casey Anthony. Elizabeth Fontaine explained the find to jurors by asking them to think about when they remove an adhesive bandage from their skin and some of the adhesive remains in the shape of the bandage. Instead of a bandage, however, the outline was the shape of a heart, she said, and about the size of a dime. Although it has not been mentioned in testimony, court documents in the case have stated that a sheet of heart-shaped stickers, with some missing, were found by police executing a search warrant at the Anthony home. A photograph of a page of stickers, found in a search of the home the day after Caylee's remains were found, was admitted into evidence in the trial Saturday. A line of investigators and forensic experts have been called to the stand by prosecutors in an effort to prove their theory that Anthony, 25, killed her daughter by knocking her out with chloroform and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth. They allege the Orlando woman then put the body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home. The skeletal remains were found in December 11, 2008. Caylee was last seen June 16, 2008, but her disappearance was not reported until July 15, 2008, after Anthony's mother demanded answers about the little girl's whereabouts. Anthony faces seven counts in her daughter's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty. Her attorneys have said Caylee was not killed but rather that she drowned in the family pool shortly after her family last reported seeing her and that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death. George Anthony rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial. The trial is ahead of schedule, Orange County, Florida, Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. told jurors as they took a break for lunch. Prosecutors are down to their final witnesses, he said, but they won't be available until Tuesday afternoon, they said. The prosecution may rest Tuesday or Wednesday, Perry said. The defense anticipated beginning its case Thursday but is trying to accelerate that process and begin Wednesday, the judge said. He said he believes testimony in the case could conclude by the end of next week, although he cannot say for sure. Deliberations could begin by June 25, he said. The court recessed until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Fontaine said she found the heart-shaped adhesive while examining the three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints. She said she didn't find fingerprints but didn't expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements. Any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated, she said. Asked whether she tried to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, which she saw under an ultraviolet light as part of her testing, Fontaine said she did not. ""When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination,"" she said. She said she tried to photograph it later after subjecting the tape to dye testing, but the adhesive was no longer visible. She testified she did show it to her supervisor. Earlier Monday, jurors heard more testimony about a hair found in Anthony's trunk and hairs found with Caylee's remains. However, Perry would not permit Stephen Shaw, a hair and fiber examiner for the FBI, to show jurors a PowerPoint presentation dealing with a study he is conducting on hair decomposition. Anthony's defense attorneys protested vigorously, saying they had not received a copy of the presentation or had a chance to adequately review it. ""The court does find it troubling that the state, at the ninth hour, provides a PowerPoint with color photographs that was not provided to the defense,"" Perry said. The dispute over the presentation was heard outside the jury's presence. Perry did allow Shaw to testify about the study. Shaw told jurors that he examined the hair and a ""hair mass"" found with Caylee's remains and that he came to the same conclusion as FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe. Lowe previously testified that a 9-inch piece of hair from the trunk appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from the little girl's hairbrush and had a dark band that she had seen only in hairs that remained in the scalp of a decomposing body. Shaw said he agreed with Lowe's findings, adding that the ""hair mass"" found with the remains had a ""brushlike"" appearance associated with a later stage of decomposition. Shaw noted, however, as Lowe did before him, that hair identification is not an exact science and that he cannot say the hair was Caylee's, to the exclusion of all other people. In addition, the ""hair mass"" ""is not a suitable normal hair sample,"" he said, and he cannot say with certainty it was Caylee's hair, only that it was found with her remains. Shaw said that in his study, he was attempting to recreate banding in hairs taken from living people. While he said some of the hairs -- which were put in varying indoor and outdoor locations -- showed evidence of decomposition, none showed postmortem banding. However, under cross-examination by defense attorney Jose Baez, Shaw admitted he cannot state definitively that postmortem banding is exclusively seen in hair taken from dead people. Two independent examiners as part of his study both analyzed the hairs, and each in their initial findings identified a hair as banded from a live person, although they both discounted that in their confirmed findings, he said. But Shaw estimated for prosecutor Jeff Ashton that he's seen thousands of hairs in his career and that he has never seen a hair with a decomposition band that did not come from a corpse. Baez also elicited testimony from Shaw that it was his first time testifying in court about such evidence. On Saturday, an insect expert testified that tiny flies found in the trunk of the Orlando woman's car fit the theory that Caylee's body was stored there -- perhaps for three to five days. The flies suggest that something began to decompose inside the trunk but do not prove that the material was a human body, said Neal Haskell, a forensic entomologist from St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana. Such flies will feed on many things, he said. Based on his analysis of temperatures and the reproductive habits of the small flies found on paper towels from the trunk that another scientist found were soaked in fluid from decomposition, Haskell said it appeared that whatever attracted the flies had been in the car for three to five days. Baez, in his cross-examination of Haskell, tried to show that the flies could have been attracted by common garbage or leftover food. Numerous witnesses have testified to a foul odor emanating from Anthony's trunk after her daughter's disappearance; a bag of garbage left in the trunk for weeks has been suggested as the source of the smell, but prosecutors allege it was the smell of human decomposition. Saturday's testimony also included a crime scene investigator who collected a piece of Henkel brand duct tape from an area near where Caylee's skull was found. Ronald Murdock, a forensics supervisor for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, also testified that despite a thorough search of the house, the only piece of Henkel duct tape investigators recovered from the home Anthony shared with her daughter and parents was attached to a gas can. Last week, jurors saw graphic photos of Caylee's bones and heard testimony that they had been gnawed by animals as her body decomposed during as much as six months in the field. They also watched a video superimposing an image of Caylee's skull over her living face and an outline of a strip of duct tape in an effort to prove tape could have been, in effect, the murder weapon, Ashton said. Baez tried to prevent jurors from seeing the presentation, which he called ""disgusting."" But Perry ruled that the role of duct tape in the girl's death is ""highly relevant."" He also rejected a defense motion for a mistrial based on the video at the close of Friday's session. In Session's Cara Hutt and Nancy Leung contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- It's been just over two weeks since the Queen parachuted into London's Olympic Stadium, her apricot dress flapping in the breeze, to the cheers of thousands in the stadium and millions at home watching the 2012 Opening Ceremony. Since then, a potent mix of skill, stamina and resolve turned what appeared on paper as a packed sporting schedule into real-life drama, sorting the best from those who can still only dream of reaching the top. The hard-fought victories and stunning record-breaking performances by seasoned and new sporting superstars -- including Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, Gabby Douglas and Ye Shiwen -- will lead many lists of the most memorable moments from London 2012. But the 30th Olympiad stands alone in creating a number of significant other world firsts, some that have been shouted from the rooftops as well as others that passed quietly without international fanfare. For those, it's time to get out the bunting, ticker tape, streamers or celebratory toast, wherever you may be. Here we list the sporting moments you may have missed, and others that athletes may prefer to forget. Team USA may be ahead in the total medal count, but other countries are celebrating taking home just one after years of effort. Grenada went straight to the top of the podium with its first Olympic medal courtesy of Kirani James,19, who won the men's 400m, making Grenada the country with the smallest population to ever win Olympic gold. Montenegro was close to winning gold until Norway slipped ahead in the women's handball final, ensuring the country's first ever Olympic medal was silver. It was silver too for Guatemala and Erick Barrando, 21, in the 20 kilometer race walk, 60 years after the country first debuted at the Games. Botswana won its first medal after Nijel Amos, 18, who crossed the line in a national record seconds after Kenya's David Rudisha smashed the world record in the men's 800m. On the water, Pavlos Kontides, 22, scored Cyprus' first medal, again silver, in the men's laser sailing. Double-amputee Oscar Pistorius made plenty of headlines, but his presence at the Games to compete against able-bodied athletes was a notable first for London. Pistorius, 25, may have gone home without a medal in his 400m events, but he solidified his place as an inspiration to all, especially after accepting defeat with grace. ""I can't describe the feelings I've had this past week. Thank you all for playing a part in one of the greatest weeks of my life!"" he tweeted. It was a great week too for women's boxing, which made its debut at the Games, bringing 36 female boxers from 23 nations across three weight divisions to the ring. Ireland erupted when Katie Taylor, 26, look home the gold in the women's light (60 kg). ""It's what I've always dreamed of. I've envisaged this moment so many times before but it's better than all my wildest dreams to be sitting here as Olympic champion as well as world and European champion,"" she said. At just 17, Claressa ""T-Rex"" Shields from the U.S. won gold in the women's middle (75kg). And Britain's Nicola Adams, 29, defeated China's Ren Cancan, 24, to take gold in the fly (51kg). And it wasn't just boxing that turned the spotlight on female athletes. Qatar, Brunei Darussalam and Saudi Arabia allowed women to compete on their teams for the first time ever, making London the first Olympics represented by both women and men from all 205 participating nations. Read more: London 2012: The women's Olympics? None of the women won medals but their presence alone was hailed as historic. Crowds cheered as Sarah Attar, a veiled 19-year-old from Saudi Arabia, finished last in her 800m run. ""It was such a huge honor to be asked to come... I just think it could be something amazing for women in Saudi Arabia,"" she said. It wasn't a record-breaking performance, but 25-year-old Andy Murray's defeat of Roger Federer, 31, in the men's tennis final was a long-awaited first for the Scot who had developed a reputation of ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride."" Spectators on Murray Mount went wild as their hero took gold, just one month after losing the Wimbledon final to the Swiss favorite. While pundits argued over whether U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps' record-breaking medal haul in the pool made him to be ""the greatest Olympian ever,"" other athletes left the Games with less than flattering claims to fame. Headlines screamed ""Oh Feck"" after Germany's Stephan Feck performed what some called the ""worst dive ever."" The 22-year-old scored a zero when his hands slipped from his legs during a forward somersault pike. Other athletes left London too with perhaps unwanted attention. Sixteen-year-old American gymnast McKayla Maroney inadvertantly launched an internet meme when she appeared cross-armed and scowling while on the podium to receive a silver medal in the women's vault. Online tributes to Usain Bolt's lightning pose spread like wildfire across the internet, but towards the end of the Games Mo Farah's ""Mobot"" was gaining traction after the Briton sealed gold in both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters. Olympic stars: What I can't live without . The ""wall of noise"" or ""wall of sound"" made its debut at the London Olympics, a phrase used to describe the deafening cheers of the crowd during the 200 meter stretch of the rowing course at Dorney Lake. They may not have set any records -- yet -- but other London Olympians deserve a mention, including Manteo Mitchell, the American 4x400m relay runner who inexplicably finished his team's heat despite running on a broken leg. ""Never thought that the phrase 'break a leg' would reach reality for me lol,"" he tweeted later. One of the most enduring images of the London Games could be the distraught face of South Korean fencer Shin A Lam as she sat weeping on the piste for more than an hour before officials confirmed that she had lost her match. The 25-year-old had appealed on the basis of a technical fault with the clock. Shin went on to lose the clash for bronze and later refused an offer of a ""special medal."" She later came back though to win silver with South Korea's epee team. Japanese equestrian Hiroshi Hoketsu, 71, may have been the oldest competitor at the London Olympics, but he'd have to do it again before becoming the oldest Olympian ever. That title is held by Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn who contested the 1920 Games at the age of 72. Hoketsu has all but ruled out competing at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, not because he doesn't want to but because, at 15, his horse, Whisper, is too old. One of the final events of London 2012 could be considered its most inspiring yet. Among the field for the men's marathon was 28-year-old ""lost boy"" Guor Marial who fled civil war in Sudan for a new life in the U.S. Before the race, Marial dedicated his run to refugees worldwide. Officials allowed him to compete as an independent athlete under the Olympic flag because as a new nation South Sudan does not have an Olympic committee. The event was won by Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda in 2:08:01. Marial placed 47th. Top swim coach: Australia 'getting soft' During the past two weeks, new national heroes emerged. Australia may have disappointed in the pool, but on water the country's sailors held their own. Malcolm Page won back-to-back gold medals in the 470 in London and Beijing, earning him the honor of carrying the Australian flag in the closing ceremony. Another sailor, Ben Ainslie was chosen to wave the Union Jack for Britain after becoming the most successful sailor in Olympic history. London 2012 legacy: Trust the British to get it right . And finally, much has been made of the countries at the top of the leader board, but down the other end accomplishments must be noted and commended. Many countries leave the Olympic Games with just one bronze medal. Step forward Tajikistan (boxing), Hong Kong (cycling), Puerto Rico (hurdles), Morocco (1500m), Saudi Arabia (equestrian), Afghanistan (taekwondo) and Kuwait (shooting) and a first medal ever for Bahrain, a bronze for Maryam Yusuf Jamal in the 1500m. Of course, many countries went home with nothing beyond the experience. Better luck next time in Rio.

"(CNN) -- Search crews in Indonesia have suspended efforts to locate two tourists, still missing two and half days after the tourist boat they were traveling in sank. The head of the rescue mission says the search will resume on Tuesday morning. Officials say 23 other passengers and crew were rescued, pulled from the water by local fishermen and search and rescue teams. The survivors spent more than 36 hours in the water. The two people missing are believed to be Spanish, other passengers on board said. However, officials at the Spanish foreign ministry could not confirm this. The tourists -- mostly from Europe -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway: a cruise from west to east, departing from Lombok in the province of West Nusa Tenggara and ending in Labuan Bajo, in East Nusa Tenggara, with a number of stops along the way. Under normal conditions, the journey would have taken four nights to complete. Everything appeared fine when the vessel, named Versace Amara, set sail last Thursday. Three days into the trip, the boat ran into trouble. Budiawan, head of the rescue mission, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, says it's believed the boat hit rocks off the volcanic island of Sangeang, at about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. Water began leaking into the vessel, forcing the passengers and crew to abandon ship. The vessel was carrying 20 tourists and three local crew members and two local guides. Budiawan says authorities were first notified of the incident on Sunday morning, and immediately deployed crews to the site. The nearest town is Bima on the island of Sumbawa -- a two-hour boat ride away from where the boat sank. The passengers appear to have split into two groups. The first, consisting of 10 tourists, remained near the accident site. They were rescued on Sunday afternoon. Five were picked up by local fishermen, the others retrieved by search and rescue teams and taken to hospital in Bima. After being rescued, one of the passengers identified as Rafael, criticized the lack of equipment on the boat. ""On the boat there was no security. No radio, no GPS, no navigation equipment. There were nothing,"" he told CNN affiliate Trans7 Indonesia. ""Only life jacket, but life jacket it doesn't work. If you're in the middle of the ocean with a life jacket, what happens? Nothing. Because the most important when you have an accident in the sea is to call the rescue team and to call the radio, GPS or something. They had nothing. In the morning, the crew said 'No one is coming to rescue us.'"" Another 13 passengers and crew swam in the water using lifebuoys and life vests to stay afloat. They were retrieved by local fishermen on Sunday evening, in the waters of Sape, a town in East Nusa Tenggara province, and are currently being treated at a hospital there. Budiawan says it's believed the two missing men who were with the second group became separated because of the strong winds and current.","Two tourists missing two days after tourist boat they were traveling in sank in Indonesia .

"(CNN) -- In the latest ""X-Men"" film, Magneto levitates RFK stadium and drops it around the White House; the stadium is destroyed. In ""Godzilla,"" the monster fights off what looks like the entire U.S. military while he flattens both Honolulu and San Francisco. And in the new Tom Cruise film, ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" Paris is left underwater after an alien attack, and a futuristic D-Day-like invasion leaves a French beach strewn with dead bodies and smoldering war materiel. There's plenty more mayhem to come as this season's glut of blow-'em-up flicks rolls out: ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" (aliens drop a cruise liner on a city), ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (outer space vehicles liquefied by the dozens), ""Hercules"" (the title character fights off lions, sea monsters and a whole army of bad guys) and ""The Expendables 3"" (Sly Stallone and gang; train rams into prison). Entertainment Weekly recently referred to it as ""the summer of destruction."" But let's call it what it is: destruction porn. Like real porn, these movies play to our most atavistic instincts. They all include some sort of buildup, the titillation of expectation that really bad, but cool, things are about to happen. They generally climax -- pun intended -- with a massive set piece of CGI carnage. And like real porn, afterwards we're supposed to feel deliriously fulfilled and exhausted. Fact is, we should hate ourselves for feeling this way, as if we'd just had really bad sex. But that's not the reaction destruction porn elicits. Even worse, we're exporting this American blood-lust globally, giving outsiders the impression of a country that has totally gone over to the Dark Side. It's not as if there hasn't been massive carnage in the movies before this. Hollywood has produced plenty of war films, ecological disaster flicks and alien invasion epics in the past. But the sheer frequency of destruction porn these days -- at least 11 movies of this type in summer 2012 (""The Avengers,"" The Dark Knight Rises,"" etc.) and 12 during the same season last year (""White House Down,"" ""World War Z,"" etc.) -- and our delight in seeing things blown up, should make us worry about the mental health of society. Movies have always reflected the anxieties of their age. In the 1950s, we had plenty of nuclear paranoia films,often featuring mutated life forms. (Can you say ""Godzilla""?) The '60s and '70s brought us ecological and bio-terror themes in films such as ""The Omega Man"" and ""Silent Running.""And later films, like ""The Road Warrior,"" reflect an apocalyptic mindset. But the recent spate of films seem to reflect a collective psychic collapse. Sure, there are reasons for this: fear of terrorism, the insecurity created by all those mass murders, like the recent episode in Santa Barbara. We feel that world has gotten even more chaotic. That there's too much of everything. That society has gotten way too complicated, with too many people, too much technology, too many opposing ideologies clashing against each other. It recalls the classic 1959 dystopian novel ""A Canticle For Leibowitz,"" by Walter Miller Jr., in which the end of industrial civilization is referred to as ""the Simplification."" It's as if we're preparing for a global meltdown. And the summertime, when we're supposed to be mellowing out, is a perfect time for Hollywood to exploit our growing appetite for this kind of carnage. There are two specific reasons for this: Most filmgoers are in the under-40 demographic, looking for a night out away from the heat and to put their brains on pause -- and believe me, there's nothing more mindless than watching stuff blow up. If it's photographed lovingly, and with insanely good computer graphics, all the better. The second reason is the importance of the foreign market, which now accounts for nearly 70% of total box office gross. Our global neighbors tend to go for what we do best, which is make big budget films with state-of-the-art special effects, a minimum of dialogue (explosions speak a universal language) and lots of mayhem. Lots. Just to take two recent examples: the just-opened X-Men film has grossed $168 million in the U.S., and twice that much overseas. And the new ""Captain America"" flick -- ""Captain America,"" no less! -- has grossed $255 million domestically and a whopping $454 million overseas. America: A country where scenes of mass destruction are the norm, and carnage is preferred over peace, love and understanding. Is this the kind of negative image of America we want to export? And sure, we all know that ""It's only a movie,"" but don't kid yourself: When we get geeked at the leveling of entire cities, it says something about who we are, and where our society is going. And you'd think after 9/11 and the never-ending mass murders in this country we would be a bit more sensitive to scenes where cities are destroyed and thousands of lives lost, but the opposite seems to have taken place: We wallow in it. We cheer it. Like porn, we can't take our eyes off it. It's seductive and incredibly addictive. Wish fulfillment? Catharsis? Just good old entertainment? It really doesn't matter. While we're in the grips of whatever social psychosis is stoking this ravenous appetite for mayhem, Hollywood will be happy to oblige.","Lewis Beale: This summer's movies show America's growing addiction to 'destruction porn'

"(CNN) -- U.S. forces have handed possession of a tanker carrying an illegal oil shipment back to the Libyan government, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli said Saturday. The tanker, which had been seized by three armed Libyans earlier this month, had sailed last week from the rebel-held port of As-Sidra in eastern Libya. It was carrying oil owned by Libya's National Oil Company. U.S. Navy SEALs boarded the Morning Glory last weekend in waters southeast of Cyprus at the request of authorities in that country and Libya. Saturday's handover also was carried out in international waters. The transfer of the Morning Glory ""went smoothly and as planned,"" the U.S. Embassy said. Speaking on Libyan television, Libyan navy spokesman Col. Ayoub Qassim said three Libyan navy vessels had received the tanker early Saturday along with the three Libyan detainees, the crew and the illegal oil shipment. They are bringing the Morning Glory back to the port of Zawiya, a city about 30 miles west of the capital, Tripoli, he said. The oil will be unloaded in the Zawiya refinery, but it's not clear who the detainees will be handed over to. In a statement on Tuesday, rebel leader Ibrahim Jadran, who heads the federalist armed group that is holding key Libyan oil ports in the east and who attempted to sell this illegal oil shipment, denied the tanker was hijacked and accused the United States of ""blatantly violating international maritime law"" by boarding it. He warned the United States against handing those on board over to the Tripoli authorities, saying they would get tortured and receive unfair trials. The government said they would be safe and treated according to Libyan and international law. The situation remains unsettled in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears that Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped remove Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please. Libya, rebels argue over who controls oil tanker -- and Libya's oil . Ousted PM left Libya on way to 'another European country' CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","U.S. forces have handed a tanker with an illegal oil shipment back to Libya .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. telecommunications companies are trying to put some distance between themselves and U.S. government spying programs after years of quietly complying with court orders to cooperate with National Security Agency surveillance. The Obama administration on Wednesday released a set of declassified court documents showing that in 2010, a U.S. telecom company pushed the government to prove the legality of the NSA's bulk collection of data on U.S. phone calls. The so-called phone metadata program, authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, became public last year in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Since the Snowden disclosures, telecommucations providers have come under criticism from privacy advocates for not fighting hard enough to protect their customers' data from the government's mass surveillance programs. Some technology companies have complained that their compliance, under court order, with U.S. surveillance programs has caused customers to distrust them and could harm their business and the U.S. economy. In January, after a pair of conflicting federal court rulings on the legality of the data program, Verizon questioned the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court about the legal basis for the program. The court turned away the challenge and ordered the company to continue complying. The documents released Wednesday show there was an earlier, more modest effort in 2010 made by at least one provider to push the government to explain the legality of the data collection. Wednesday's declassification came after the company, unidentified in the partially redacted court documents made public, pressed the government to release the 2010 court records, according to people familiar with the matter. The name of company remains classified, but an official familiar with the matter confirmed it was Sprint. The Washington Post first reported the name of the company and said the company's lawyers were prepared in 2010 to challenge the NSA program's legality until the government more fully explained it. Sprint is pleased with the release of the records, spokesman John Taylor said. ""Sprint believes that substantive legal grounding should be provided when the government requests customer information from carriers,"" he said. ""Sprint has a longstanding commitment to protecting our customers' privacy and will challenge an order for customer information that we don't think complies with the law. ""This is an important part of the debate in how our government balances the need to provide for our national security while protecting civil liberties,"" Taylor continued. ""Sprint also believes this balance can be achieved without obligating carriers to keep customer information any longer than necessary for legitimate business purposes."" With ongoing Snowden document disclosures, the company sought the declassification to show it didn't blindly go along with government spying, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The 2010 records show the dispute fell short of a full court challenge of the NSA data collection. But documents show the company pushed the government into negotiations to provide more information about the legality of the program. In the end, the documents show, a federal judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ordered the company to continue to comply with the NSA's programs.

"(CNN) -- Wise men say to look before you leap. In Alaska, it's advisable to look before you land. That's because, in Alaska, where seaplanes are common, you just might land on a whale. Last week in tiny, remote Angoon, Thomas Hamm was shooting video of a seaplane coming in for a landing. It was a mundane scene in the island community that's only accessible by boat or seaplane. The video starts out normal. But as the plane lowers, it's clear something is different about this approach. ""All the sudden, the pilot advanced the throttle and I didn't know why. I thought, 'Oh something must be wrong,'"" Hamm told CNN. That something was a whale, a humpback, swimming just under the surface. For a moment, it appeared the whale and plane would collide. But the pilot pulled up, getting just enough lift to avoid the mammal. The plane landed safely seconds later. Later Hamm showed the pilot the video he shot. Hamm said the pilot told him he didn't notice the whale; he reacted to the commotion on the shore. Guys were pointing and yelling. Right as the pilot pulled up, the whale breached, clearing his blowhole and drenching the plane's windshield. That's one way to make a splash.

"(CNN) -- Complaints of itchy, irritated wrists have prompted Fitbit to voluntarily recall all of its Fitbit Force wristband activity trackers. About 1.7% of Force users reported cases of skin rashes after wearing the devices, Fitbit CEO James Park said in a letter to customers on Friday afternoon. The cause of the irritation, which is assumed to be allergic contact dermatitis, is either the nickel that's in the stainless steel part of the device, or adhesives or other materials used in the strap. The $130 Force wearable pedometer was released at the end of 2013 and is the most recent product from the fitness hardware company. The Force is a silicon wristband with a small display and sensors for measuring motion. It tracks the wearer's number of steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and sleep patterns and syncs the information to a computer or smartphone. ""On behalf of the entire Fitbit team, I want to apologize to anyone affected,"" Park said. ""From the beginning, we have taken this matter very seriously."" The company first acknowledged the complaints last month and said that anyone who experienced skin irritation could return their device for a full refund or a replacement tracker. Since then, the company has conducted a more complete investigation of the devices and ruled out any problems with the electrical or hardware elements. Any Force owners interested in returning their wristbands for a full refund can fill out a form on the Fitbit website or call the company's customer service center. They'll receive a kit to mail the Force back to the company and should receive a refund check in two to six weeks. This is not the first time a wearable fitness device has run into quality issues. In 2012, Jawbone offered full refunds to customers who purchased its buggy UP wristband activity tracker. Fitbit still sells its other popular trackers, including the older Flex wristband and wearable trackers that clip onto clothes. The company also has plans for future replacement products. ""Rest assured we're working on our next-generation tracker and will announce news about it soon,"" Park said.","Fitbit is voluntarily recalling its Fitbit Force activity tracking wristbands .

"(CNN) -- Could you fit your life into 300 square feet? Developers are betting on it, positioning tiny living spaces as a new status symbol for urban millennials. Chic, central and closet-sized, micro-condos -- loosely defined as units under 500 square feet -- are being marketed as luxury rentals or a stylish first step onto the property ladder. While small units are already the norm in high-density Asian megacities and old European neighborhoods, major U.S. cities like New York and San Francisco are leading a new charge in North America with others quickly following suit. ""What these great world cities have in common is a scarcity of the resource called land and a large number of people who want to work and play in these cities,"" says Mark Vlessing, co-founder of London developer Pocket Living. According to a report from Neilson, an American consumer research company, 40% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 36 want to live in urban areas instead of the suburbs their parents idealized, but 69% feel they don't earn enough to afford the lifestyle they covet. High rent, rising property prices, and growing demand make finding an affordable home harder than ever. Local governments have taken notice. New York City, for one, has waved its minimum 400-square-foot housing requirement for a pilot project with units between 250 and 370 square feet. Last year, Pocket Living -- which makes 400-square-foot units for those who earn less than around $100,000 a year -- received roughly $36 million from the mayor of London to build approximately 400 units for first-time home buyers. Small units are seen as an affordable way to make cities accessible to more people. This was the case for Andrea Wong, a hair stylist living in Vancouver. In 2012, unable to afford a centrally located apartment, she decided to move into a unit in Burns Block, the city's first micro-condo. Most of the studios she'd seen rented for around $1,400 a month, so her 291-square-feet apartment -- the building's largest -- seemed like a steal at $1,000. But it was the design, she says, that she sealed the deal. The tiny space -- all enamel-like white cupboards, foldout tables, and wall-mounted design hacks -- was not only smart, but stylish. ""I wanted something that looked pretty modern. The use of space was really good,"" she says. ""I didn't feel like I was living in a jail cell or anything."" Her friends marveled. Her place was officially cool. Maxwell Ryan, the New York-based founder of home design website Apartment Therapy, isn't surprised that micro-condo developers are pushing design and utility as their major selling points. To him, it shows an awareness of how generational priorities have shifted. ""As a culture, there's been a renaissance of interest in design -- design as a lifestyle choice, design as a way of life,"" he says. Ryan believes young people will happily accept smaller spaces, but only if done properly. ""When you design a small space, you can design it in a way that has more utility and expansiveness,"" he says, going on to quote Charles Eames, one of the 20th century's most celebrated product designers: ""I have never been forced to accept compromises, but I have willingly accepted constraints."" It's a maxim Smart House, an upcoming micro-condo project in Toronto, exemplifies. The designs, masterminded by architecture firm architectsAlliance, are stylish, with seemingly endless concealed storage, contemporary finishes, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Drawers become dishwashers and refrigerators. Couches fold into beds and walls. A number of elements, like a bathtub and oven, have been left out. But even these omissions are meant to cater to the millennial lifestyle. ""This generation wants to live within the city,"" says Peter Clewes, of architectsAlliance. When they aren't working, they're eating out with friends and enjoying city life, not spending time at home. For a unit that offers elegance on a budget (Smart House units, which have yet to go on sale, will likely start at $285,000), Clewes thinks they'll be willing to make a few sacrifices. ""Five years ago, if you suggested units of 258 square feet, people would say that's mean, that's immoral. But that's starting to flip the other way,"" Clewes says. ""It's become a moral cause. We need all (income) groups to make a healthy city."" No one seems to know whether tenants or owners will look at micro-condos as temporary stops, or something more permanent. Certain elements seem so tailored to a certain lifestyle they risk being outgrown by those they so carefully target. For Wong, the initial novelty of micro-living wore off as time wore on. She started to resent not having space for her screen-printing and acrylics projects, or an oven for cooking. When it came time to renew her yearlong lease, she decided to move to a 620-square-foot unit across the street, even though it cost almost $400 more per month. Today, Wong lives with her boyfriend in a 900-square-foot apartment in East Vancouver. Now 35, she's more focused on settling down. But she doesn't regret giving micro-condos a try. ""My lifestyle has changed a lot since I lived down there,"" she says. ""I liked being there at the time, but I like the space I have now.""","Micro-condos -- units under 500 square feet -- are a growing trend in cities like New York, San Francisco and London .

"(CNN) -- If you're cursing Mother Nature right now, we understand. The official start of spring was March 20, and yet signs of winter abound. There's snow on the ground in the North, and the South is being tossed between 40-degree and 70-degree weather like a pingpong ball. Yet ""even in the throes of what feels like a 2014 Ice Age, millions of Americans have begun showing up in doctors' offices with the tell-tale signs of allergies,"" the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says. Fantastic. Polar vortex may mean miserable allergy season . It may be even worse for allergy sufferers in certain cities across the country. The foundation has released its annual list of the worst places for spring allergies. Topping the list this year are Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. These so-called allergy capitals are ranked based on pollen levels, use of allergy medications and the number of board-certified allergists in the area. Louisville has moved up the list from No. 5 last year because of higher-than-average pollen counts, high use of allergy medications and too few allergy specialists, according to the foundation. New York; Columbia, South Carolina; and San Antonio are new to the top 20. Only Los Angeles residents can breathe a sigh of relief; the city fell 39 places from No. 38 last year to No. 77 this year. Here are the worst cities for spring allergies in 2014: . 1. Louisville, Kentucky . 2. Memphis, Tennessee . 3. Baton Rouge, Louisiana . 4. Oklahoma City . 5. Jackson, Mississippi . 6. Chattanooga, Tennessee . 7. Dallas . 8. Richmond, Virginia . 9. Birmingham, Alabama . 10. McAllen, Texas . Why, you may ask, would lingering winter weather affect spring allergy season? Where do allergies come from?

He'll outline plans to repair an endangered planet's environment, to strengthen our arms and cyber defenses, to put immigration reform behind us and a stronger workforce ahead of us. The White House says three words summarize Obama's message: ""Opportunity, action and optimism."" And Washington cynics respond with cliched eye-rolling, muttering, ""Sure, sure."" The clock -- so they say -- is ticking down on the last three years of his administration. Not so fast. Maybe Obama is planting policy and nurturing programs that will bear fruit long after he leaves office. Congress, on the other hand ... Opinion: Obama, the pain and fear must be named . In the past, Obama urged the Congress to ""Seize the Day."" Instead, it seized the government, bringing it to a grinding halt. House Speaker John Boehner acknowledged the Republicans were to blame, and that the action hurt the Republican Congress, which has only 19% of the public's confidence. (Obama's approval rating has grown to 44%, regaining as the health care website improves.) Nolan McCarthy, a noted political science scholar at Princeton University, and Michael Barber led several colleagues in examining the impact that a gridlocked, partisan Congress is having on our political system of checks and balances. It was a substudy by an American Political Science Association task force, convened by Harvard political theorist Jane Mansbridge and Boston University political scientist Cathie Jo Martin. Grover Norquist: The misdirection of a president . The panel concluded that ""sincere ideological differences"" caused the gridlock -- as well as ""strategic behavior to exploit those differences to win elections."" ""Consequently,"" it found that partisan ""polarization has reduced congressional capacity to govern."" Congress is ""... more prone to delays in appropriating funds, and increasingly slow in handling executive and judicial appointments."" No surprise, there -- it's evident to any onlooker that these showdowns over the budget and debt are as much about ""winning"" as they are about convictions. The loser, though, has not been the other (Democratic) party, but our constitutional system. Newt Gingrich: Why Obama is playing a weak hand . ""Of significant concern,"" McCarthy wrote in The Washington Post, ""is the extent to which this reduction in legislative capacity has contributed to a shift in the constitutional balance as it enhanced opportunities for executive and judicial encroachments on legislative prerogatives."" In other words, a Congress that obstructs the public's election mandates and refuses to compromise only weakens itself. Boehner boasted after the 2012 debt face-off that Republicans got ""98% of what we wanted."" Maybe. Regardless, the American people are not getting what they need. The signs of growing congressional weakness are everywhere. This past week, Mesa, Arizona, Mayor Scott Smith, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said, ""The partnership between local and federal government is not as strong now as it once was."" Steve Israel: GOP misguided and obsessed . Smith, a Republican who will run for governor of Arizona this year, added, ""Instead of Congress pulling together to help working Americans, there is an all-out assault on programs that would help them."" He described his fellow mayors as a ""pragmatic bunch who care more about finding solutions than about focusing on ideological differences."" That description also fits Obama, whom studies have shown to be the ""most moderate president since World War II."" Perhaps that moderate, Ike-like, approach accounts for some of his difficulties last year. (By the way, Obama is the only the president since Eisenhower to win back-to-back elections with more than 51% of the vote.) While 2013 wasn't as bad for Obama as some pundits claim, it clearly could have been better. Obama will try, as he has for five years, to forge bipartisan compromises on an agenda that moves this changing nation forward. If Congress balks, again, he'll do what the mayors are doing: find a way to move forward. John Edwards: Dems should do more on poverty . The White House released a statement over the weekend, saying ""The President has a pen and he has a phone, and he will use them to take executive actions and enlist every American -- from business owners, workers, mayors and state legislators to young people, veterans, and folks in communities across the country -- in the project to restore opportunity for all."" Our constitutional system demands cooperation and compromise. Governing can get messy. But the Founders believed that factions in Congress would share one principle: Common national goals trumped party, and to achieve those goals, bipartisan deals were better than no deals. Such had been the Founders' hope and the reality for many a Congress in the past. Alas, such a Congress no longer exists. The future will be forged. Obama will adapt to the congressional realities of today -- even if that means moving ahead without Congress by issuing executive orders as constitutionally defined and reaching beyond Congress to the American people and their leaders, local and state, public and private. Right on, Mr. President. Time to move the country forward.

"(CNN) -- Missouri lawmakers gave final approval to a measure that requires a woman to wait 72 hours from her initial doctor's visit before she gets an abortion. The Republican-controlled House voted 111-39 in favor of the legislation late Wednesday. Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, has not said whether he'll sign it. If the governor signs the bill into law, it will triple the time a woman has to wait to have an abortion in the state. ""Currently, Missouri requires a 24-hour waiting period between the time a woman seeks her first consultation and exam from a physician and the time she returns to undergo an abortion procedure,"" state Rep. Kevin Elmer said in a statement. Elmer, who sponsored the bill known as HB1307, said the legislation would give the woman more time to review her decision. ""This bill is a way to give a potential mother some additional time to think about this life-altering decision, and to talk to family and friends who can help provide support during what is undoubtedly a difficult and emotional time,"" Elmer said in a statement. ""This bill is really an effort to balance the rights of the mother with the rights of the unborn child. We are not denying the mother her rights, but simply asking her to give more thought before making a decision that she may later regret."" Abortion rights advocates slammed the bill, describing it as an intrusion on personal lives. ""Governor Nixon must veto this bill and stand firmly with a woman's right to make her own private medical decisions, including the decision of whether to have an abortion, in consultation with her doctor,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. But anti-abortion group Missouri Right to Life said the measure is long overdue. It ""will save babies and protect all women, both adults and minors, from abortion clinics seeking to make a profit on an abortion,"" it said in a statement. The Missouri Senate approved the bill Tuesday in a 22-9 vote after Democrats decided to forgo a filibuster, CNN affiliate KOMU reported. If it's signed into law, Missouri will join South Dakota and Utah, both of which have a 72-hour waiting period.","The Republican-controlled House votes 111-39 in favor of the bill .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""We are One""? Not quite. Singer Jennifer Lopez, who was supposed to perform the official song of this year's World Cup at the opening ceremony this week, has pulled out. ""Regretfully Jennifer Lopez will not be attending this year's World Cup opening ceremonies,"" her rep told CNN in a statement late Sunday night. No reason was offered. Lopez teamed up with rapper Pitbull and Brazilian star Claudia Leitte to record Brazil 2014's official song, ""We Are One (Ola Ola)."" The trio was slated to perform at the tournament's opening ceremony ahead of the host's first match with Croatia on Sao Paulo on Thursday. The World Cup song has been a tradition since the 1966 World Cup in England, when a song dedicated to the tournament mascot, a lion named ""World Cup Willie,"" was released. Four years ago, it was Shakira telling the world to ""Waka Waka"" ahead of South Africa 2010. Soon after the song was released, Pitbull, who has previously worked with the likes of Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias, spoke of his joy at being involved in the project. ""I'm honored to join Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte at the FIFA World Cup to bring the world together,"" said Pitbull. ""I truly believe that this great game and the power of music will help unify us, because we are best when we are one.""","Singer pulls out of opening ceremony performance .

"London (CNN) -- The past few days in Ukraine have been marked by an escalation of street protests and ongoing clashes with riot police in the center of Kiev, as Ukrainians respond to new repressive laws adopted last week. The legislation seriously undermines the freedom of assembly, media, privacy and civil society. These laws constitute a crackdown on major democratic freedoms and offer a path to dictatorship. They criminalize defamation, introduce a label of ""foreign agents"" for foreign funded NGOs, enact jail terms for wearing masks and hard hats during the protest, and restrict the work of non-registered news agencies. In short they could seriously undermine the chances for free and fair presidential elections when they are held. The protests erupted two months ago against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych's foreign policy U-turn away from EU integration. Since then, his strategy has been to suppress and intimidate the media and political activists. In December, prominent journalist Tatiana Chornovol was attacked and badly beaten. The Ukrainian president's office condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Since then, four protesters have died amid ongoing clashes with police and dozens have been arrested -- and a Ukrainian Catholic Church spokesman told the National Catholic Reporter that the church's website had been compromised by cyber attacks via neighboring Russia. Instead of dialogue and compromise, President Yanukovych has chosen the hard line towards establishing dictatorial rule. His ruling Party of Regions, in cooperation with the Communist Party, passed the repressive laws, and the Ministry of Interior issued a decree allowing riot police to use force and weapons against the protesters. The Kiev court prohibited any demonstrations until March 8. Statements about the ""foreign instigated"" nature of the protests and the language of an ""external enemy"" have started to appear in the ruling party rhetoric. Yanukovych has also fired his long-standing head of presidential administration, Serhiy Liovochkin, who is believed to take a moderate position in proposing dialogue with the opposition and protesters. As of today his post is vacant. The expectations are that it could be filled by a hardliner. Groups of thugs and aggressive young men who support the government have further destabilized the situation. On Tuesday more than 500 of them were roaming the streets of Kiev. Any attempts by citizens to call in police forces to address this security issues were ignored. Such further escalations could be the plan of the elites to introduce marshal law and forbid any demonstrations. What can be seen in Ukraine is an attempt to create a criminal dictatorial rule in order to preserve the power of Yanukovych, as the chances of his political survival or a victory in free and fair elections in 2015 are slipping away. It is a dangerous strategy, which will be futile for three main reasons. First, the civic protest is strong and is spreading to the east and south of Ukraine. Each aggressive move on the side of the regime sparks more and more people on the streets. Independent opinion polls show that 50% of the population support the protest and 25% cent are ready to participate in it actively. Second, the charisma of Yanukovych is hardly matching the profile of the dictator. His recent addresses to the nation and pre-recorded closed meetings with Ukrainian media show his lack of confidence and evasion of talking about political crisis. Much less is he ready to face any open rally of his supporters. His popularity levels are at a record low. Even before the start of the protest they were only 14%, compared to 42% in 2010. Finally, Ukraine's economic model is not viable to support a dictatorship. The macroeconomic situation remains very fragile and the investment climate had deteriorated even before the political crisis. The coffers of the state are drained as illegal raids pushed businesses into a shadow economy. The $15 billion infusion from Russia will only help so much and these disbursements will be tied to conditionality, such as state asset sales. Earlier this month the World Bank pointed to endemic corruption, weak governance, limited access to finance and a lack of competition as serious obstacles to growth. All this dooms Yanukovych's aspirations for a dictatorial rule. He should face the reality of irreversible change and prevent a further escalation. The alternative is an unpredictable collapse of his rule, as the nation will reject a tight grip on freedom and democracy. READ: Clashes turn deadly for first time .

"(CNN) -- For the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Miley Cyrus was as attention-grabbing as ever. The 20-year-old singer, who was a two-time performer during Sunday's ceremony in Amsterdam, Netherlands, lit what appeared to be a joint on stage during her acceptance speech for best video with ""Wrecking Ball."" Wearing a white leotard and a furry shrug, Cyrus carried a Chanel purse on stage with her as she accepted the award. Although her EMA wouldn't fit in the clutch, she did try to make a little more room by fishing out what looked like a spliff and then proceeded to smoke it. The puff wasn't shown during the EMAs' airing on MTV's flagship channel, and Cyrus has been quiet about her action on Twitter. On Sunday night, she simply instructed her Twitter followers to ""Stay in school & Be kind. Other than that HAVE FUN."" Regardless, Cyrus' smoking was a slightly more risque act during a relatively tame event, which featured performances from Snoop Dogg, Icona Pop, The Killers, Kings of Leon and Bruno Mars. Yet, given that this was an MTV event, the night wouldn't have been complete if it didn't include a little twerking. That came courtesy Cyrus, who, for the second time in three months, took the stage at an MTV awards ceremony to perform her hit ""We Can't Stop."" While some might've been expecting something just as scandalous as her now-infamous set at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Cyrus went in a different direction. Instead of giant teddy bears, the 20-year-old singer was accompanied by alien figures dressed in head-to-toe black, and she herself wore a skintight, knee-length silver dress rather than a onesie. Cyrus also swapped her VMAs dancing partner, Robin Thicke, for a little person in a black latex catsuit. The twerking stayed more or less the same and was completely absent from her later performance of ""Wrecking Ball."" Cyrus was clearly one of the night's big draws -- she even came out first, ahead of the night's MC, LMFAO's Redfoo -- but she didn't lay claim to the entire show. Thicke followed Cyrus with a rendition of ""Blurred Lines"" that had a cameo from Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, and the night's best female award winner Katy Perry soon followed with a performance of ""Unconditionally"" that found her suspended in the air. Like the singers who went before her, Perry fully embraced the night's theme of an ""out of this world"" space party, ending her performance in a glowing silver bodysuit. Throughout the event, held at Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome, awards were handed out in obligatory categories such as best pop, rock and alternative, as well as EMAs-specific honors such as top worldwide act and world stage. Eminem, one of the EMAs' top nominees, took home the award for best hip-hop act, and was also named the global icon of the year. In between awards and performances, Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy made some comedic appearances, showing just how much can go wrong when his overly confident newscaster character is unleashed in the Netherlands. This year's show marked the EMAs 20th anniversary.","The 2013 MTV EMAs celebrated its 20th anniversary Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Florida is the traditional tie-breaking primary in the January gantlet -- but there's very little that's traditional about the Sunshine State. It is a sprawling cross section of 10 media markets and one of the most diverse states in the nation, containing communities of voters across the political spectrum. But we talk about politics in shorthand, and many stereotypes endure long after they are bypassed by reality. So here are three stubborn myths about the Sunshine State to think about as Floridians go the polls on Tuesday. 1) It's senior-citizen central: This stereotype started in the post-war boom, as legions of grandparents sought out the warmth of Florida to ease their aching bones. The state came to be seen as a land of early-bird specials, bad drivers and retirement communities punctuated by amusement parks -- ""God's waiting room."" But in the 1980s, young families began to move into Florida en masse, following economic opportunity and now-ubiquitous air-conditioning. Today, just 17% of Florida's population comprises senior citizens -- just above the national average, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Moreover, 22% of Floridians are under-18 -- a number boosted by high levels of immigration from Latin America. And two Florida cities, Gainesville and Tallahassee, are among the top 10 youngest cities in America, with median ages of 24 and 26 respectively. Florida's diversity is no myth -- but the idea that it is defined or even disproportionately dominated by AARP voters doesn't hold water. 2) Cuban-Americans are the Hispanic community: This stereotype goes back to the exodus of Cubans fleeing the tyrannical communist regime of Fidel Castro in 1960. To be sure, a vibrant, passionate and conservative community remains centered in Miami and the surrounding area. The Bay of Pigs Museum remains a staple on any Republican presidential candidate's trip to Miami. But Cuban-Americans make up only 30% of the Hispanic population of Florida. Southern Florida has become the capital of Latin America, as wealthy families have realized it is the most stable nearby place to put their money and families. Among the Spanish-speaking population are large numbers of Dominicans, Mexicans, Venezuelans, Colombians and Puerto Ricans (who are not immigrants at all, but fellow Americans). Simply denouncing Castro won't be enough to win their votes. Fidel Castro recently weighed in on the GOP primary race and proclaimed it ""in all seriousness, the greatest competition of idiocy and ignorance that has ever been"" -- except for all the show trials, imprisonments and executions of his political rivals, of course. Interestingly, despite Mitt Romney's attacks on fellow Republican candidates who support comprehensive immigration reform and the Dream Act, polls show that he is doing surprisingly well with the Hispanic vote this time around. 3) There is a typical Florida voter: Compared with the other states in the January primary ordeal -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- Florida is a complex array of 10 media markets, all with different characteristics. The northern part of the state, from the Panhandle to Jacksonville, is the deep South, a continuum of adjoining Georgia and Alabama. The I-4 corridor, from the Space Coast to Orlando to Tampa/St. Pete, is largely made up of young families -- some native to Florida, but many others Midwest transplants looking for a new start. The tony southeast coast of West Palm Beach is a wealthy enclave with many snowbirds from the Northeast. Miami and the southern tip make up the capital of Latin America. And Key West is the Caribbean. All of which means it is expensive to run statewide in Florida -- and the messaging is complex. It must appeal to more of a series of nation-states than a state with a homogenized character. It is, to that extent, the best test of a candidate's ability to connect in a national campaign to date in the primary calendar. It is a red state, a blue state and a swing state -- all rolled into one. Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Florida is not one-dimensional; it contains left, right and center voters .

"(CNN) -- An urgent humanitarian situation has become a major political conundrum. The surge of Central American children illegally crossing the border into Texas has politicians debating possible responses while scattered protests against the influx threaten to become an organized movement in coming days. Even fellow Democrats are criticizing President Barack Obama's administration over the issue likely to linger through the November congressional elections. Here's a look at Wednesday's developments: . Rising Anger . ""We are being invaded!"" screams a flyer urging nationwide protests this weekend against the tens of thousands of youngsters coming to America on their own from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The July 18-19 ""National Day of Protesting Against Illegal Immigration, Amnesty and the Border Surge"" has a host of right-wing groups participating and promises more than 250 demonstrations at state capitols, Mexican consulates ""and on streets and overpasses coast to coast, including Hawaii and Alaska."" Not in my backyard: Communities protest surge of immigrant kids . While the impact remains uncertain, the effort follows an increasing eruption of public opposition to government efforts to place the newly arrived youngsters in holding facilities across the country. Earlier this month, screaming protesters waving American flags in Murietta, California, turned back buses transporting undocumented youngsters to a detainee facility. On Tuesday, protesters on both sides of the debate faced off at an Oracle, Arizona, boys ranch intended for temporarily housing child immigrants from Texas, according to CNN affiliates covering the story. Some communities were more welcoming, such as Fontana, California, where staff and community donations of food, clothing and toys awaited buses carrying about 40 of the youngsters to a local church last week, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. New polls . Americans consider immigration the most important issue for now, according to a new national survey released Wednesday. The Gallup poll conducted July 7-10 found 17% ranking immigration first, a 12 percentage-point increase for the issue since last month. Other issues cited included dissatisfaction with the government at 16%, the economy at 15% and jobs at 14%, with nothing else reaching double digits. As expected, more Republicans than Democrats chose immigration as the top issue. ""With no solution to the current crisis in sight, and less than four months to go before the midterm elections, it is easy to believe the issue could still be a factor come November,"" a Gallup news release said. On Tuesday, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed a majority of people back Obama's $3.7 billion plan to address the border surge, but far fewer approve how the President or congressional Republicans are dealing with what the administration calls an urgent humanitarian situation. CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said such numbers show people were fed up with political stalemate over immigration. ""I think they've had it with both parties in this,"" she said. ""So Congress better get something done pretty quickly here."" Congress mulls over the issue . Obama met Wednesday with Hispanic lawmakers and then House Democrats to seek support for his emergency funding request to respond to the border crisis. The President seeks to reduce a backlog of cases overwhelming the immigration system by speeding up hearings to determine who stays and who goes. His request includes $1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children in government custody, and $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers. Another $300 million would help Central American governments discourage parents from paying smugglers to get their children to the United States. So far, Republicans have balked at Obama's request, saying they will come up with a smaller plan. Unintended consequences: 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis . One proposal by Texas legislators -- GOP Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar -- would change a 2008 law that requires immigration hearings for children from countries other than neighbors Mexico and Canada who arrive at the border on their own. It would stop requiring hearings but allow children to request one, which would have to take place within 72 hours. The measure also would provide some additional funding, but much less than Obama seeks. While Republicans sought to build support in both chambers for the plan, top Senate Democrats said no. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey called it inhumane, saying 72 hours was insufficient time for people seeking asylum from endemic violence and other social ills back home to make their case to an immigration judge. Homeland Security head goes to Senate . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told senators Wednesday he wants Congress to pass a spending bill and make changes to the 2008 law so his department can more effectively process and return immigrants. But lawmakers from both parties said they were not ready to sign onto his request. In a nearly two-hour closed session for all senators in the Capitol, Johnson pressed for a policy change similar to the one proposed by Cornyn and Cuellar. Johnson described the briefing as ""very constructive and useful,"" but lawmakers from both parties said the plan fell short. ""That won't be enough,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""We're going to have to streamline the deportation process."" Cornyn said the administration's plan didn't do as much as his proposal to quickly resolve the crisis. Unhappy with the proposed changes, Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown argued, ""To make a wholesale repeal to the law doesn't make sense for the country."" Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democratic leader, said he wasn't ready to accept any change to the 2008 law, which he said was designed to protect children who have been the victims of human and sexual trafficking and other crimes. ""Some of these kids have horrible experiences they've been through,"" said Durbin, adding Congress needs ""to make sure at the end of the day these kids are treated humanely, compassionately, and we don't return these kids to a deadly circumstance in their home country."" The senators were told that the number of unaccompanied minors entering the country has leveled, now making up one in seven of illegal migrants to the country. Graham said there was an audible gasp in the room when senators were told the cost to taxpayers for caring for each unaccompanied minor now in the United States runs from $250 to $1,000 per day. Democratic split . Privately, Democrats acknowledged a divided Senate caucus, with some wanting to maintain the existing legal rights while others were ready to drop the fight to secure more funding before Congress goes on its five-week summer recess at the end of July. Signs of the divide on the political left extended beyond Congress. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a possible presidential nominee in 2016, criticized the Obama administration for planning to send back most of the Central American children from the recent surge. ""We are Americans, and we do not return refugee kids who find themselves on our doorstep back into war-torn or famine-racked places where they will face certain death,"" he told CNN. ""So I think we have to act like Americans."" At the same time, he acknowledged trying to prevent some of the child immigrants from being sent to a western Maryland site under consideration for a temporary holding facility. ""What I said was that would not be the most inviting site in Maryland. There are already hundreds of kids already located throughout Maryland,"" O'Malley said of his phone conversation with White House domestic policy adviser Cecelia Munoz. Obama, who wants to quickly send back immigrants with no legal basis to remain in the United States, has to corral his Democratic colleagues in Congress, warned David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst. ""He ought to be focusing like a laser on the question of getting some sort of legislation passed,"" Gergen said. What's the difference between immigrant and refugee?

"(CNN) -- Russia and Ukraine will face off again Saturday. But this time it's not the geopolitical arena where the action takes place -- but the glitzy stage of the Eurovision Song Contest. Both countries have made it through the semi-finals to compete in the grand final in Copenhagen, Denmark. The usual artistic rivalry has been given an added piquancy by the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March and eastern Ukraine is currently roiled by pro-Russian separatist protests. The organizers describe Eurovision -- widely loved for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as a non-political event meant to unite Europe through song. But in reality, politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances. This was demonstrated to an unusual degree on Tuesday, when Russia's entrants -- 17-year-old twins Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, told CNN that the contest is about national identity as well as music. ""Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,"" Adams said. ""The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities."" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion. It goes, ""...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time ... maybe there's a day you'll be mine."" Ukrainian singer Mariya Yaremchuk, who is performing a song titled ""Tick-Tock,"" said Tuesday that she was proud to be representing her country. ""Actually, my main position is that I'm proud that I'm Ukrainian and everything I do here is for the Ukrainian people,"" the 21-year-old said. ""I'm not standing alone on the stage, there are 46 million Ukrainians behind me on the stage."" Yaremchuk will be the first to perform on Saturday night, while Russia's Tolmachevy Sisters will be 15th out of 26 finalists to take the stage. After the singing comes the voting. Former Soviet nations have tended to award their votes to each other. Whether the crisis in Ukraine changes that equation remains to be seen. The countries involved in the contest award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. They can't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both English and French. Television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines, which count for half the final tally. The remainder of the vote is cast by national expert juries. The country with the highest points total wins -- and has the rather expensive honor of hosting the following year's event. In 2013, more than 180 million viewers in 45 countries tuned in to the action. READ: Eurovision showdown: Ukraine and Russia face the music .

"(CNN) -- When you think of GIFs, those never-ending sequences of looping motion, you're more likely to associate them with lightly humorous viral content than a respectable art form. However, their hypnotic movement has been gaining favor with the artistic community, and now one of the most high profile museums in the world, London's Saatchi Gallery, has teamed up with Google+ to explore their more reflective side. They gathered a roster of impressive judges, such as film director Baz Luhrmann, artists Shezad Dawood, Tracey Emin and Cindy Sherman, and Saatchi Gallery CEO Nigel Hurst, for The Motion Photography Prize, the first global competition for artists working with animated GIFs. Over 4,000 people from 52 countries entered their work, which fitted into six categories - landscape, lifestyle, action, people, night and urban. The top gong went to a Brooklyn-based creative director Christina Rinaldi, whose mesmerizing GIF of a New York City window cleaner, shown above, draws the viewers in with its almost trance-inducing repetition. Cindy Sherman, American photographer and film director, was attracted to the vibrancy of Rinaldi's work: ""It almost transcends the GIF medium by turning the soapy water into brushstrokes, so it seems more like creating a painting,"" she explained. Rinaldi herself said that choosing motion rather than still photography was crucial to capturing the rhythm of the window cleaner at work: ""I was inspired by his brush strokes and the texture of the suds,"" she said,"" I watched him as if he were a performance artist -- his work temporary and only to be witnessed within a few seconds. I quickly became enamored with his efficient rhythm. Surviving in New York City requires an elevated sense of efficiency and an innate hustle."" The work of other finalists -- Kostas Agiannitis, MicaÃ«l Reynaud, Matthew Clarke, Emma Critchley and Stefanie Schneider, highlighted the diverse and creative nature of a GIF as an art form. ""There is incredible potential in this technology, and many photographers are now using GIFs to create motion in their work"", says Saatchi Gallery's CEO and one of the judges Nigel Hurst. ""You're looking at an image that floats somewhere between a still photograph and film, it has elements of both but sometimes incorporated in an unexpected way, which makes it even more compelling,"" Hurst says. He added that the judging process was no different than when looking at other, more conventional, art: ""What stood out for us were images which were arresting, and used the parameters of the GIF in an imaginative way."" Artist and illustrator Clay Rodery, whose work has appeared in the New York Times, The Atlantic and on HBO, initially started creating GIFs to practice animation, but soon started making entire pieces for the format drawn by the chance to more eloquently express ideas he had inside his head. He says:"" First and foremost I'm conscious of it looping. Its duration might be very short, sometimes only several frames, but in a loop there is the potential for its content to be endless."" Moreover, Rodery says that GIFs helped him develop as an artist: ""It most certainly has expanded the breadth of my work and its emotional impact. These days you need to work very hard to get your work to stand out, and a moving image really does wonders to get you noticed.""

"(CNN) -- An underwater explorer who says he's confident he's discovered the Santa Maria, Christopher Columbus' flagship, said Wednesday that there's evidence that the ship has been looted. During a news conference, 68-year-old Barry Clifford said that the remains of the possible ship off the coast of Haiti probably hold ""a great deal of cultural material"" but that he and his team of divers can tell that thieves have disrupted the wreck and taken things. When asked when the ship might have been looted, Clifford said he didn't know. ""Something might have been done several months ago, maybe a couple years ago, I'm not sure,"" he said. Clifford says he wants the Haitian government to act as soon as possible to help preserve the what he says is the ship's remains. He also wants the Haitian government to give him permission to continue to study the wreckage. ""I'm not looking for money,"" Clifford said. ""I'm looking for the government (of Haiti) to protect this."" He said that whatever his team does next must be coordinated through the Haitian government. A CNN team was in Haiti on Wednesday and asked the senior adviser to the country's prime minister about Clifford's claims. Adviser Damian Merlo said in an e-mail that officials did not know whether the wreck was indeed the Santa Maria. Merlo said Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe said that if Clifford's claims are correct, ""it would be of great importance, not only for Haiti, but for world history."" ""We need to ensure the site is handled properly to protect any archeological findings,"" Lamothe said, according to Merlo. Clue from another wreck . Clifford is an experienced explorer, according to the History Channel website, which described him as ""one of the world's premiere underwater archaeologists."" His assertion that he's probably found the Santa Maria is tied to a shipwreck he and his team investigated in 2003. A cannon was found as part of the first wreck. But, Clifford told CNN, archaeologists at the time ""misdiagnosed"" the cannon. Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, ""I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh, my God,' "" Clifford said. He realized the 2003 find might have been the one. A couple of weeks ago, he returned to the wreck with a group of experts. The team measured and photographed the ship. But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said. The ship ""still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the site's identity,"" archaeologist Charles Beeker of Indiana University said Tuesday. ""Barry may have finally discovered the 1492 Santa Maria."" The evidence, Beeker said, is ""very compelling."" The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said. The wreck is stuck on a reef off Haiti's northern coast, 10 to 15 feet beneath the water's surface. Did Phoenicians beat Columbus by 2,000 years? After 125 years, ship rediscovered at bottom of San Francisco Bay . Wrecked in 1492 . The Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus' small fleet that set sail from Spain in August 1492 under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on in October 1492 was an island in the Caribbean. Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Columbus established a fort in Haiti. That December, the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island's coast. Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship, which was about 117 feet (36 meters) long, were used by the garrison at the fort, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493. The Nina and Pinta were put back into service after their voyages and were not preserved, said historian Laurence Bergreen, author of ""Columbus: The Four Voyages."" There have been reproductions of those ships, but they are based on vague assumptions. ""We don't have very accurate records of what they looked like,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Melbourne made it three years in a row as the world's most livable city, according to the 2013 Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Global Livability Survey. The top cities and indeed much of the rankings remained similar to last year, with Australian and New Zealand cities landing five of the top 10 spots. Canadian cities made up another three of the top 10 positions. Elsewhere in the EIU rankings, 28 cities saw changes in their rankings with negative livability changes driven by ""civil unrest, with the Arab Spring, European austerity and Chinese discontent all contributing,"" according to the EIU report. Vienna came a close second while Canadian cities Vancouver and Toronto stayed at third and fourth; Calgary tied with Adelaide for fifth place. The top spots are mostly ""mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density,"" said the EIU. At the bottom of the list, due to ongoing civil conflict in Syria is Damascus -- dropping 10 rankings. A total of 140 cities were surveyed under five categories: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. Scores in each category and sub-category are compiled and weighted to give a total out of 100. 100 is considered ideal and 1 intolerable. The report noted a few major changes. Madrid dropped five spots to 44th due to ""unrest and protests,"" but remains in the top tier of livability. The Slovakian capital of Bratislava moved into the top tier (a score of 80 or above), now at 63rd place in the ranking.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- The anniversary of a fatal police shooting triggered a new riot in Greece's capital Sunday, with protesters occupying a university building and throwing rocks and burning garbage at police. Riot police with gas masks and shields faced off against about 200 demonstrators, some of whom attacked and injured the dean of the University of Athens following a protest march Sunday afternoon, authorities said. The protesters were holed up inside and around the school's administration building. Police are barred from entering the downtown campus. Demonstrators broke up masonry from the courtyard of the 19th-century building and hurled chunks of the stone at police, who responded with stun grenades and tear gas and imposed a blockade of the building. The university's dean, Christos Kittas, was in intensive care after being attacked, and 16 police officers were injured, Greek authorities said. At one point, both sides halted their confrontation to let an elderly man on a motor scooter pass between their lines -- only to resume the melee once he was gone. Skirmishes between police and demonstrators continued past nightfall, but some of the demonstrators were dispersing. Protests began Saturday night to commemorate the December 2008 killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos, whose death at the hands of police sparked rioting at the time by young self-styled anarchists across Greece. Police said they had made more than 230 arrests since the demonstrations began. Sunday's protest march drew several thousand people and was generally peaceful, but a few hundred -- including some children -- broke off from the march to occupy the university campus. Authorities have been barred from entering university grounds without the consent of the students since tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the military junta that then ruled Greece. John Psaropoulos contributed to this report for CNN.","Protests commemorate December 2008 killing of 15-year-old .

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A series of recent graffiti messages on school walls in Mexico's most violent city threaten attacks if teachers don't hand over their Christmas bonuses. The ominous warnings have sent a new wave of fear through Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where groups of concerned parents have pulled their children out of class, some schools have been evacuated and authorities say they are stepping up security. ""We are afraid because nobody, including the teachers, said anything to us. We learned about it because we heard about it from other mothers and nothing more ... we are afraid that something is going to happen to our children,"" mother Rosa Villagrana said. Chihuahua state Gov. Cesar Duarte traveled to Juarez to speak out against the threats, which first appeared several weeks ago. ""We could not ever allow what is being signaled, even with the severity of the security crisis, but an attempt is being made to destroy the integrity and the tranquility of the teachers, the principals, the parents and the children,"" he said. ""To the criminals we say that whoever dares to extort will face life imprisonment."" Prosecutors have not captured whoever is responsible for the messages or determined whether they are part of a prank. Authorities have created a special team to investigate extortion in Ciudad Juarez, located across the border from El Paso, Texas. But some parents say that does little to calm their fears. ""People say that we have to entrust ourselves to God, right? Only he can say everything. Why can't the authorities? They no longer patrol and they no longer capture the bosses who are really behind this. They don't capture the bosses and they aren't patrolling anymore, so there are no results,"" father Oscar Olmos said.","Some parents are pulling their children out of class .

"(CNN) -- The United States has been called the ""no-vacation nation,"" and looking at the table above, it's not hard to see why. Many other countries allow for much more vacation time, according to a 2009 survey by Mercer, a human resources consulting firm. The numbers above reflect the minimum vacation days for an employee who works five days a week and has 10 years of service with a company. But the United States comes with an asterisk. That's because the U.S. -- unlike the other countries on the list -- lacks a federal law that mandates vacation time. For comparison purposes, Mercer listed the ""typical"" amount of days off that large U.S. companies give their 10-year employees: 15 paid vacation days and 10 public holidays (25 total). That's a far cry from Brazil and Lithuania, which top the list with 41 total days off. Finland, France and Russia offer a minimum of 40 days off. India and China are the only countries in the survey that typically have fewer paid vacation days than the U.S., but India makes up for it with 16 public holidays -- the most in the survey along with Japan.

"(CNN) -- A burger grown in a laboratory. Sounds like science-fiction? Well up until very recently it probably was but now the prospect of lab-grown meat appearing on our supermarket shelves is closer than ever. Synthetic or test-tube meat involves taking a small amount of cells from a living animal and growing it into lumps of muscle tissue in the lab, which can then, in theory, be eaten as meat for human consumption. As well avoiding killing animals, scientists believe it could help reduce the environmental impact of meat production. The technology to create artificial meat has been around since the turn of the century -- NASA once looked into developing it for their astronauts -- but making an edible and commercially viable product has remained out of reach. It also remains to be seen whether consumers will accept it as an alternative to farm animal-based meat. But now a U.S. scientist says he is closer than ever to achieving the technological breakthrough. What's more, he believes a market for his lab-grown meat does exist. Hungarian-born Gabor Forgacs, of the University of Missouri, is a specialist in tissue engineering, working to create replacement tissue and organs for humans. He realized the same technology could be used to engineer meat for human consumption. He became the first scientist in the United States to produce and publicly eat some of his tissue-engineered meat, at the 2011 TEDMED conference. His company, Modern Meadows, has already attracted a number of investors since being launched in 2011, including, says Forgacs, funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. See also: 3-D printing: the shape of things to come . Initially at least, his engineered meat is likely to be more of a ""niche"" product, priced somewhere close to Kobe beef, which is currently around $125-$395 a kilo. ""This product isn't going to be for the masses at the beginning, it's going to be for eco-conscious people and people who don't eat meat for ethical reasons,"" says Forgacs. However, Forgacs is not the only scientist working on lab-grown meat. Dutch researchers, led by professor Mark Post of Maastricht University, are promising a high-profile launch for their synthetic hamburger by the end of the year. ""It's not going to be as easy as some people imagine,"" says Forgacs, and adds, ""I am not racing him (Mark Post)."" In fact, rather than attempt to race to produce an engineered meat product, Forgacs said his first lab-grown product is going to be leather, which he says ""is a similar product to some extents but not as controversial and doesn't require the same legislation that meat does"". When it comes to producing meat, Forgacs says the most difficult part is creating muscle tissue that tastes, looks and feels like animal flesh. ""What the final outcome is going to be is difficult to predict,"" says Forgacs. ""One thought is that it'll be something like an ingredient to a lot of staples which are based on animal protein -- for example we make something which has the consistency of ground meat and that can be used for patÃ©, meatballs. ""Take the analogy of flour. You don't eat flour, it's not very tasty but you eat a zillion products that contain flour and are very yummy. Whether or not this is going to be a major application of our product I don't know but this is definitely something I envisage it leading to."" See also: 'Scrambler software' to protect phones from prying ears . Forgacs says lab-grown meat is becoming increasingly necessary as the world struggles to cope with an unsustainable meat industry. As well as animal welfare concerns over rearing large numbers of farm animals in close proximity, the water use, farmland for animal feed, waste and greenhouse-gas emissions associated with meat production make it one of the most significant environmental problems in the world today. The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization estimated that 18% of global greenhouse emissions are accounted for by the livestock sector, and demand for meat is predicted to double over the next 40 years. Research from the University of Oxford, published last year, estimated that lab-grown meat produces 78-96% lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventionally produced meat within the EU. It also had a 99% lower land use and a 82-96% lower water use. ""The rules of the game of meat production are not the same as they were 100 years ago,"" says Forgacs. ""It's not sustainable. We are destroying this planet with intensive meat production. Seventy percent of arable land today is one way or another connected to animals through grazing animals or growing food for them. We're running out of it."" He adds: ""What we're doing is a transformational idea. We're going to produce something that is not exactly the same but it is going to be cost efficient and much less harmful to the environment."" What still remains uncertain is whether or not consumers will accept a lab-grown meat product. Neil Stephens, a sociologist from the Cesagen Centre at UK's Cardiff University, has been studying the emergence of lab-grown meat and has interviewed a number of researchers working on the technology. ""Is this stuff really meat or something else?"" says Stephens. ""Some want it to be meat, and recognized like any other meat. Others think it is better to be seen as a new type of meat and as such OK to taste or look different. Then there is a minority who feel it is a meat substitute, very meat-like but not meat."" Without a product available for people to see, smell and taste, Stephens says it is difficult for any debate about how to classify it to move forward. ""If it ever becomes a marketable product it will still be a small one. It is not going to be plumped in the supermarket. It will take time to gain acceptability,"" says Stephens. Many of the scientists working on lab-grown meat still see their research as marginal and are striving to get synthetic meat accepted as a reality, according to Stephens. Whatever the final outcome, lab-grown meat is no longer in the realm of science fiction. ""It is coming. There is no question that someone will hit it big and if we are the ones then so much the better,"" says Forgacs.","U.S. scientist says he is close to creating commercially available meat in a laboratory .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- The trail of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has led investigators to the New Hampshire home of a former Chechen rebel living in exile, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday. FBI agents interviewed Musa Khadjimuradov and searched his Manchester home this week, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While the official did not detail what investigators uncovered during the search or the contents of the interview, Khadjimuradov indicated in an e-mailed statement to CNN that he was questioned about his contact with dead suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities have cast a wide net in the investigation into the Boston bombings, examining everything from the suspects' movements to people they knew, to determine whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev or his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, received help in carrying out the attack. ""I am sure the FBI knows by now that I have nothing to do with the terrible act in Boston,"" Khadjimuradov said in the statement. ""I would like to state that I barely knew the Tsarnaev family, and only met them for the first time after we moved to the U.S. During the very few encounters, which were initiated by Tsarnaev, we have never discussed political or religious issues, so I could never guess what ideas were in their minds."" What we know about Chechnya . Khadjimuradov, 36, said this week was the second time he has been questioned by federal authorities about his relationship with the elder Tsarnaev, who visited his home about three weeks before the April 15 bombings that left three dead and hundreds wounded. Investigators first talked to him on April 29, he said. In an interview this week with Voice of America, Khadjimuradov said he believes federal investigators questioned him because they wanted to know whether Tsarnaev had used a shooting range in the area. ""Because they say he has shooting practice here in New Hampshire. That's like two or three times. So he bought fireworks here, from New Hampshire, you know? And he buy some ammunition for guns here in New Hampshire. And before the attack, like three or four weeks, he came to my house,"" he said. Suspect: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims . ""So now I believe they're thinking like he was coming here to New Hampshire and that I try to help him or something."" He told Voice of America that he met Tamerlan Tsarnaev at a Chechen Society gathering in Boston in 2006, he had seen him only three times in three years, and the discussions were never about religion or politics. What was Tamerlan doing in Russia? ""Nothing. Never. He never talking about the religious, politics or anything like that to me,"" he said. Authorities have said the surviving Tsarnaev brother told investigators that no one else was involved. In addition to questions about how the bombings were carried out, investigators have been trying to determine how the Tsarnaev brothers were allegedly radicalized. Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. The Tsarnaev brothers, ethnic Chechens, lived in Kyrgyzstan and Dagestan in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, where Islamic insurgency has taken hold in a fight for independence. Troubled North Caucasus region plagued by violence . Of particular interest has been Tamerlan's 2012 trip to the semi-autonomous Russian republic of Dagestan, home to numerous Islamic militant groups that have warred against Moscow's rule. Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tamerlan before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate committee. In his statement, Khadjimuradov said he understood why authorities wanted to talk to him and that he fully cooperated. ""These guys need to do everything they can to solve this case, so they can prevent anything like this horror from happening again,"" it said. Khadjimuradov, who relocated to the United States in 2004 as a refugee, has said he served as one of the bodyguards for Akhmed Zakayev, a Chechen separatist leader wanted by Russia. Zakayev, who now lives in London, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

"(CNN) -- If you've spent any time at all following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict these past few years, you've probably run into a lot of bad news. But what if there were another type of story about Palestinians and Israelis that you weren't being told? What if beyond the bloodshed, hostility and extremism, there were also hopeful examples of Palestinian and Israeli civilians leading effective nonviolent movements to end the occupation and build peace? The fact is that plenty of these inspiring examples exist, but the world, and specifically the major media outlets covering the conflict, have yet to give them proper attention. This is problematic on two counts: First, it gives anyone following the conflict a false and dangerous impression that there is no hope, and that extremists on both sides far outnumber moderates who are willing to work toward a peaceful solution. Second, and more important, it deprives those courageous individuals who choose nonviolence of the attention they so urgently need in order to grow and spread their message. Violence and nonviolence are, after all, two different forms of theater. They both depend and thrive on the response of an audience. TED.com: Jeremy Gilley's plan for ""One day of peace"" If we, as a global audience, focus solely on violence and militarism, we reinforce the notion that they are the most effective form of action. On the other hand, if we pay more attention to nonviolent or unarmed efforts, we strengthen the legitimacy and influence of those choosing to use these means. This is why at Just Vision, our mission is to create and distribute media, including documentary films, that tell the stories of Israelis and Palestinians working nonviolently to resolve the conflict and end the occupation. We also provide in-depth introductions to these visionaries by publishing new interviews with them on our website every few days. By providing these resources to millions worldwide, we ensure that those who promote nonviolence have an effective platform through which they can share their accomplishments and ideas with their own societies and others around the globe. Our latest documentary film, ""Budrus,"" tells the story of a Palestinian community organizer who successfully unites Palestinians of all political factions together with Israeli supporters in an unarmed movement to save his village from destruction by Israel's Separation Barrier. The film shows how, for 10 months, the residents of Budrus and their supporters engaged in unarmed protest, and how they ultimately triumphed by convincing the Israeli army to shift the course of the barrier and saving their village. Since its release, ""Budrus"" has been seen by hundreds of thousands around the world, and it will be made available to millions more on September 21, the International Day of Peace, when it will be broadcast online for free. Many of the Palestinians and Israelis who have seen ""Budrus"" have come away both surprised and hopeful: surprised to learn that a nonviolent movement they had never heard of existed on their doorstep, and hopeful that this might be a model that could inspire others in their community to take similar action. TED.com: Jody Williams' realistic vision for peace . Though it is just one film, ""Budrus"" has already begun to change the conversation on the role and impact of nonviolence in Palestinian and Israeli society. The lessons of Budrus and the dozens of other nonviolent initiatives we follow resonate even more loudly when considering recent historical examples. Looking back at some of the great influential social movements of the past few decades, whether it's the civil rights movement in the United States, the global feminist movement or the recent Arab Spring, some of the biggest positive changes to our societies have come from grassroots nonviolent activism, not the actions of governments or armed campaigns. Given the proper stage, these movements proved that civil disobedience and peaceful protest could be more moving, more captivating and ultimately more influential than the use of lethal force. Yet, if no one had paid attention to those first students sitting in at the lunch counters in North Carolina, or to the desperate plea of a young Tunisian vegetable salesman, who can say where those movements would be today? Where we choose to direct our attention matters. And in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this decision can save numerous Israeli and Palestinian lives and help finally bring an end to the bloodshed. Rather than endlessly waiting for new leaders to emerge or conditions to change, it's time we realized that the solutions to the conflict are being played out every day right in front of us. It's up to us to notice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julia Bacha.","Julia Bacha: Why don't we hear the stories of nonviolence from the Israel-Palestinian conflict?

"Lusaka, Zambia (CNN) -- ""What are we going to call the country? What is the flag going to look like? What is the currency going to be called?"" These are not questions most six-year-olds are concerned with -- unless you are Mulenga Kapwepwe. ""I grew up in an environment where the struggle for the country, the liberation of this country, was very much a part of the conversation in the home,"" says Kapwepwe, a renowned Zambian playwright and daughter of the country's former vice president, Simon Kapwepwe. ""For me, Zambia is not an abstract concept,"" she says. ""It's something that I heard being birthed in the house that I lived in -- even the name of the country, the answer came from our house. Literally. My father coined the name and it was agreed that this country would be called Zambia."" Act One: Curtains up . From a young age, Kapwepwe was surrounded by the changemakers who helped liberate the African nation from British colonial rule. An artistic child, it was not uncommon to find a young Kapwepwe at the theater or opera with her father enjoying the performance right beside her. His encouragement for Kapwepwe to follow her passion into the arts has led to a fruitful and illustrious career as one of the nation's most beloved and respected playwrights. Undaunted by her lack of formal theater education, Kapwepwe began writing her own plays early on in her career. ""I'd begun to write the history of my tribe,"" she recalls. ""And as I got into it and I dug into it, I thought this would make a really good play, but I didn't know how to write a play,"" explains Kapwepwe. ""I told myself, 'Well, I don't think Shakespeare went to a playwright school so I'm sure I don't have to."" And she was right. Over the years, Kapwepwe, who is also the chairperson of the National Arts Council, has received countless accolades for her theater work. Her plays all focused on issues that dug deep into the history and culture of Zambia, looking at the role female leaders played in traditional life prior to colonization, and questioning why this is no longer the case. Act Two: Build it and they will come . Away from the stage, Mulenga has involved herself with many projects to try help Zambian youths. She has built libraries in Lusaka, Zambia's capital, to give young children the opportunity to read and further educate themselves. ""One thing about books and my father, is that we had a lot of books when we were growing up. So I got into building libraries because I feel other people must have the same experience that I had. And especially for me the people who might not have the opportunity. Kapwepwe would eventually build not one, not two, but three temples of literature in Lusaka. ""What would a library in Africa look like? You know, a library is about knowledge, and a place where you can get knowledge, but also, we kind of mix it up with the traditional African hut, where you discuss things and you are mentored. You get knowledge and you interact, there's drama. There's also sorts of things going on."" Act Three: A lasting legacy . That ingenuity to inspire Zambian youth led the vivacious playwright to her next endeavor -- a record label. After stumbling across traditional native music at the National Archive, Kapwepwe wanted new ears to hear its majesty. ""I thought let me get the music and give it to young people so that they can work with it and then they can put it back into the public ear,"" says Kapwepwe says, record label has so far produced three albums. The cultural ringmaster's ambition wouldn't stop there. Kapwepwe went on to found the Lusaka Youth Orchestra to provide teens with a space to embrace music, as well as create a youth sports team -- the Chilenge Girls football team -- to keep young girls ""off the streets."" A true tour de force for Zambian arts and culture, Kapwepwe has no plans to slow down anytime soon. In fact, her next goal is direct a film. Ultimately she's unafraid of failure because to this patron of the arts, if you don't try, then you won't succeed. She says: ""Don't abandon your ideas. You can scale them down. You can reshape them.

"(CNN) -- Dr. Charles Raison, CNN's mental health expert, addresses two questions from readers reacting to a piece on anxiety from Kat Kinsman, CNN Eatocracy managing editor, on her lifelong struggle with the condition. Look for Raison to address other questions in the future. Q: Can using marijuana or having a drink or two be helpful for people with anxiety? What should they watch out for? Dr. Raison: If one goes on any search engine looking for study results related to marijuana or alcohol and depression or anxiety, one will immediately see that most of the evidence tells a cautionary tale. Many studies suggest that regular use of either marijuana or alcohol is associated with an increased risk for a variety of mental health problems, anxiety and depression among them. Increasing data suggests that regular marijuana use in adolescence may also be a risk factor for developing very serious psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. In addition to promoting other disorders, alcohol is especially liable to abuse and dependence and has ruined innumerable people's lives for millennia. Far fewer studies have examined whether using these compounds in moderation might improve depression or anxiety. But as Socrates noted almost 2,000 years ago, alcohol is both a blessing and a curse to mankind. Indeed, now we know that the regular modest use of alcohol actually promotes a number of health factors. Similarly, it is increasingly clear that many of the chemicals within marijuana hold great promise for the treatment of physical pain. The endocannabinoid system in the brain -- which is a primary target for marijuana -- has profound effects on how people think and feel. My son is mentally ill, so listen up . For example, increasing evidence suggests that the ""runners high"" many people get after strenuous exercise is produced primarily by activation of the brain's' internal endocannabinoid system. Other chemicals in marijuana impact other brain pathways, like serotonin, that are known to play a role in depression and anxiety. People have been taking a drink or two in the evening since time immemorial. And many people will attest that this practice helps them shed the cares of the day. Recently, I've met with several very experienced psychiatrists who have been recommending small amounts of marijuana use for for very depressed patients who haven't responded to antidepressants. In some patients, they are reporting remarkable improvements. But the problem at this point is that while many studies have shown an association between alcohol/marijuana and mental illness, I don't know of any really rigorous studies looking at the therapeutic potential of either for depression and anxiety. Answering the question of what people who use these substances should watch out for is easier. They should watch out for the possibility that they become more anxious or depressed after drinking or using marijuana. And they should keep a close eye on their use, especially use of alcohol, which can be highly addictive. Whatever potential benefit alcohol and marijuana may offer is 100% lost once they are abused. Q: What are the best anxiety treatments who don't want (or are afraid) to take medicines? Is there anything that might ease their concerns? Is there a point where medication becomes essential? Dr. Raison: By far the best studied non-medicine treatment for depression or anxiety is psychotherapy. Literally hundreds of studies have shown that on average psychotherapy works as well for these conditions as do medications. Of the various psychotherapies, the best studied is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. But studies are being done all the time, and other forms of therapy are also emerging as highly effective. Over and above the type of therapy employed, a key factor of therapeutic success is the ""fit"" between the client/patient and therapist. In practical terms, this means that people should feel comfortable with their therapists. If one feels ignored, looked down upon, dismissed or attacked, it is very unlikely the therapy will be successful. Very often when therapy works people start feeling better within a few weeks, so this is also something to look for. No other non-medical treatment for depression or anxiety has anywhere near the amount of supporting evidence that psychotherapy does. Having said this, significant evidence now points to the usefulness of exercise for improving mental health. Especially when it comes to depression, exercise has been repeatedly shown to be of value. Both strength training and aerobic exercise have benefits and combining them is the best of all. However, to get the full antidepressant effect of exercise requires real commitment. To work optimally, exercise must be engaged in for at least 30 minutes a day five days a week. And the intensity level should be such that one has some difficulty carrying on a conversation while doing it. Anxiety, you're not the boss of me . However, other health benefits accrue from far less strenuous exercise and in general many people feel better with even moderate exercise. Several supplements have shown promise in depression. Both SAMe and L-methylfolate have shown promise as additions to people not fully responding to antidepressants. Most of us in the field think they also work by themselves, although more data are needed. The data for St. John's Wort is plus/minus. Some evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetyl-cysteine may also hold promise for the treatment of depression . If someone has a pattern of becoming depressed every winter, bright light therapy with a light box delivering at least 10,000 lux of light has been shown to be very effective. About 10% of the population suffers from some degree of low mood and energy in winter. This phenomenon is more common in cold, dark, gray places than in warm, sunny Southern ones. The power of a light box to lift mood and give energy can really be exceptional. This is an option that is sadly too often overlookied. Many people swear by a variety of non-traditional approaches. The bottom line is that if someone is helped by these modalities and not harmed, the goal has been achieved.

"(CNN) -- A Ukrainian transport plane was shot down Monday by a rocket that Kiev's government contends appeared to be coming from Russia. The plane was about four miles high over eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region near the Russian border, where the Ukrainian military has been battling pro-Russian separatists, officials said. Crew members of the Antonov-26 made contact with the army, officials said, and the Ukrainian military is trying to bring them into territory it controls. The plane's altitude was too high to be fired upon from the ground with a portable missile system, a statement from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said. The plane was hit with ""a more powerful missile weapon that was probably used from the territory of the Russian Federation,"" the statement said. A spokeswoman with the Russian President's office said she could not confirm any missile had been fired from the Russian Federation. On Friday, pro-Russian separatists fired rockets at a Ukrainian military camp in the Luhansk region, killing 19 troops and injuring at least 55 others, according to Ukraine's counterterrorism office.

"(CNN) -- You don't necessarily need a vintage Les Paul or a shiny Stratocaster to be a guitar hero. A Cape Town-based company is crafting eye-catching electric guitars out of re-purposed oil cans, striking a chord with music fans around the world. Dubbed ""Township Guitars,"" the hand-made six-strings are inspired by the traditional can instruments that have long been played by the resourceful residents in South Africa's poorest areas. ""The whole idea comes from the traditional kind of thinking,"" explains Dani Ngwenya, the company's chief quality controller, tasked with personally fine tuning every instrument. ""When we were kids we couldn't afford to buy a guitar so we used to make our own guitars, with a can used as an acoustic kind of body -- but these (Township Guitars) are just purely electric,"" adds Ngwenya, an accomplished guitarist himself. Distinctive sound . Each Township Guitar comes with a single or double coil pick-up as well as volume and tone controls, a truss rod and a fully adjustable bridge. Read this: 5 African festivals you have to see . They consist of a five-liter oil can body -- often covered in the colors of the South African flag -- a maple neck and a rosewood fingerboard. This gives the guitar a nice, clean, kind-of-twangy sound, creating a distinctive tone that reflects South Africa's rich musical history. ""The idea of the oil can guitar is very much a South African thing,"" explains Roy Bermeister, chief executive of Township Guitars. Hear the guitar in action . Bermeister says that when European settlers arrived in South Africa, they brought with them oil cans, which locals transformed into musical instruments . ""Some turned them into drums; some turned them into bass guitars; and some turned them into what's called a ramkiekie,"" says Bermeister -- a ramkiekie is an early-style four-string guitar that features an empty oil can as its body. Read this: The rise of Fatoumata Diawara . ""So now this ramkiekie is a 21st century guitar that you can hear in Carnegie Hall,"" says Bermeister. Played by rock stars . The company sells its guitars online and from the small shop it has set up inside the bustling Waterfront Craft Market, a popular destination with tourists visiting Cape Town. Here, near the end of a long line of stalls packed with colorful wares and intricate handicrafts, Ngwenya can be heard strumming away, his fluid playing and distinctive sounds attracting throngs of curious onlookers. Indeed, the company says its hand-built creations have caught the eye of many guitar lovers, including some of the world's most renowned musicians. ""There is a number of really famous guitar players who've come and played the guitar here and bought them later,"" says Ngwenya from inside the market. Read this: The gospel stars who sell mouse kebabs . ""I've got people like Peter Gabriel buying the guitar, with his guitar player David Rhodes,"" says Ngwenya. ""Just recently somebody bought one for David Gilmour,"" he adds. ""Chris Rea is one who's using them a lot; Roger Taylor bought two guitars a few years ago; Paul Carrack too."" 'Work of art' All this wouldn't be possible, however, if it wasn't for a friend of Bermeister, a guitar enthusiast named Graeme Wells. Back in 2002, Wells decided to make an oil can guitar for himself. A few weeks later, clutching his creation, he met up with Bermeister at a popular Cape Town cafÃ©. ""He showed me this oil can guitar which was magnificently made and tuned beautifully,"" remembers Bermeister. ""It was really, in my opinion, a work of art."" Read this: Kora legend breaks music barriers . But Bermeister was not the only one impressed by Wells' creation. Famous South African musician Jimmy Dludlu also happened to be at the same cafe. Fascinated by the oil can guitar, he asked if he could play it and, moments later, ordered one for himself. This prompted Wells and Bermeister to go into business together, setting up a workshop and starting manufacturing the aptly named Afri-Can Guitars. But a few years later, the two split up the business and in April 2008 Wells, who suffered from asthma, died. ""We lost a very talented guitarist and a very talented guitar manufacturer,"" says Bermeister. ""He was a real luthier -- we took over from there and just tried to keep the standards."" Unlike Wells' striking creations, which were mostly designed to be collectors' items, Bermeister says the company's focus today is to create solid, affordable guitars with a ""local flavor."" Township Guitars typically cost between $525 and $650, depending on the instrument's features. The company employs five people and imports components such as pick ups, humbuckers and strings from China. Bermeister says that although running such a business is not without its challenges, the company would like to diversify its offerings. ""We see a lot of opportunity in expanding our product range,"" he says. Read this: Somali rappers defy bullets . Back in the crafts bazaar, Ngwenya continues serenading passersby, his effortless playing filling the spacious market.

""I'd really love it if he comes around the shop."" So, if ""Slowhand"" is reading, how about an oil can guitar version of Layla? Click through the gallery above to check out the Township Guitars.

"Silverstone, England (CNN) -- Formula One prides itself as the pinnacle of technical innovation and sports cars of the imagination -- but sometimes the sport needs bringing back down to earth. So on Wednesday Pirelli showed F1 a possible back to basics vision of the future as it debuted a new 18-inch tire -- a size fitted to many everyday road cars -- on the final day of the Silverstone in-season test. The concept tire is five inches taller than the sport's current 13"" wheel and has a lower profile -- which means it's comprised of a larger wheel rim and less rubber. Lotus test driver Charles Pic trialled the new rubber at the high speed Silverstone circuit, the stage for Lewis Hamilton's British Grand Prix victory on Sunday. A former Marussia and Caterham racer, Pic set a lap time of one minute, 44.728 seconds on the new tire -- nearly 10 seconds off the fastest lap set on 2014 rubber. ""We weren't looking for performance,"" Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery told reporters. ""The priority today was to show people what a Formula 1 car would look like with a change in rim. ""From what I've seen and heard people seem to quite like the idea. Most people said it looked quite modern -- it didn't look strange."" Pirelli could roll out the new tires as early as 2016. Producing F1 tires, which are the same specification as road car tires, would make it easier to share technology, as well as to reap the commercial benefits of being able to sell its customers replica F1 rubber. ""We don't actually make any 13"" tires apart from for F1 and the GP2 and GP3 Series,"" explained Hembery. ""The tire today looks more like the product we sell on a regular basis. ""Our business is focused on large wheel diameters and 18"" is almost standard for us, it's the sort of thing you get on a sporty road car. ""Others might say there's less advertising space so there is a strange conundrum. ""Our high end business is in wheels around 20"" -- so that's the other discussion to have, should we be really going for a much bigger wheel? Maybe F1 needs to do something more dramatic."" Assessing the tires after running on them for just 14 laps, Pic said: ""The overall grip was very low and (the car) was five or six seconds off the pace, mainly for the reason that all the aerodynamics and the rest of the car are made for the tire we are running now and not the 18"". ""I think in the philosophy it will be a type of tire that will react quickly, so the reaction you get in the steering wheel is more nervous and each time you get a snap it's quicker. ""If we go one day to this type of tire it will be a big challenge first for the team because they will have to build a completely new car around it and it will also be a challenge for the driver."" Asked by CNN if he liked the aesthetics of the tire he said: ""Honestly, I thought they were a bit too big but maybe it was because it was the first time seeing them on the car!"" Pirelli took over from Bridgestone as F1's official tire supplier in 2011 but a series of dangerous blowouts in 2013 left it reeling. After making substantial changes to its rubber, Pirelli's contract was renewed until the end of the 2016 season. A switch to a more standard 18"" wheel might be an incentive for other tire manufacturers, such as Michelin, to consider a return to the sport. But any tire change will have to be agreed by the sport's governing body, the FIA, its commercial rights holder Formula One Management and the teams. The taller tires -- which are almost as high as the sidepods of the Lotus chassis -- will affect the aerodynamic flow, weight and suspension of the cars. ""We know what 18"" will mean -- it's a bigger challenge,"" Hembery continued. ""There will be variations in pressure, there will be sensitivity on the car's camber and in F1 you go over the curbs a lot more so you do have an integrity challenge. ""Today is a first step and it's in the hands of the sport to decide what they want to do."" After a major rule change, focused on new engine technology, for the 2014 season, the teams might be reluctant to embrace change again. As one team official whispered in the Silverstone pit lane during Wednesday's test: ""Change is fear."" Hembery countered: ""Change is expensive, change is challenging and I'm sure the team engineers will be scratching their heads going 'no, no, no.' ""But others will be thinking maybe it is one of the aspects that needs to change in F1 to bring a different look and feel to the sport."" The FIA might look more favorably on a tire development that would bring the sport closer to road car technology. This season's new engine regulations were partly designed to align F1 with the ""greener"" hybrid technology now seen as essential to the future of road cars. The future of the multimillion dollar sport -- which now only has Mercedes and Ferrari as the two major car manufacturers running teams -- also relies on its road car relevance for its long term survival. Could a change of tires be another step towards securing its future? It's all about the tires: Pirelli plan on hold . Pirelli comes out fighting over Formula One tire chaos .

"(CNN) -- A harrowing United Airlines flight Friday over the Pacific Ocean was forced to land on remote Midway Island because of what an FAA official said was an electrical odor on board. The United Airlines plane, carrying 335 passengers and 13 crew on a Boeing 777, was flying from Honolulu to Guam when it was forced to land and spend seven hours on the Pacific atoll, said United spokeswoman Mary Clark. A replacement aircraft later carried everyone back to Hawaii on Friday, she said. When explicitly asked Saturday whether the disturbing smell was smoke or something burning, Clark described the incident as an odor in the cabin. A passenger, Karen von Merveldt-Guevara of Sedona, Arizona, said the pilot spoke of smoke and failure to the radar and other systems. ""The captain said there was smoke in the cockpit and the radar failed and other electronic systems were failing, so they had to land. I think they landed old-school. They did an amazing job to get there safely,"" Merveldt-Guevara said. ""At one point there was one drop of about 40 feet. After that turbulence, it got really silent. I thought everybody was praying, and we were coming in on the wings of faith. We were all praying,"" Merveldt-Guevara told CNN. She said an odor emanated even before the plane took off. But the jet took flight any way before being diverted to Midway Island, a U.S. territory known as home to a World War II battle. United is now investigating the plane, a Boeing 777. The new jetliner is one of the most sophisticated in aviation, Clark said Saturday. United couldn't comment on further details, such as the purported radar failure, because its investigation is ongoing, Clark said. Passengers: 'They should not have let us go' Von-Merveldt said that passengers were told before the flight began that there was an odor in the cockpit. Some people left the plane, but Merveldt-Guevara decided not to because she was with 25 people traveling together to a big family gathering in Guam. ""I'm just digesting it,"" she said Sunday in a telephone interview. ""I think they should not have let us go from the plane from Honolulu. They told us they had a problem with a smell in the cockpit. ""We had 25 family members on board, and that made me think it was OK to stay,"" she added. After all, she thought, her airplane ticket was a last-minute gift given to her a week earlier. ""I thought this was godsend, this was meant to be. I was thinking this can't go wrong!"" she said. In fact, the flight takeoff was delayed in Honolulu for three hours, during which the plane sat on the tarmac, she said. ""Then they let us go, and I thought it didn't feel right, but hey,"" she said. But during the flight while everyone was asleep, Merveldt-Guevara overheard a conversation of a passenger with a flight attendant who said the plane was returning to Honolulu. ""When more people woke up, they made an announcement. I could understand they didn't want mutiny. First we thought it was of a storm hitting Guam. Then the smell got worse in the cabin, and I started to gag because of the smell of chemicals. The attendants were busy. In between they would communicate saying they were busy in the cockpit trying to figure things out,"" Merveldt-Guevara said. US Airways crew members fall ill again, forcing second diversion in two weeks . On Midway Island . A video shows people fanning themselves with leafs of paper inside the cabin, apparently after the plane landed. In the video, a voice on the intercom tells the passengers: ""Midway is not an island that has hotels and things. It's just a diversion airport. What they're offering is they have gymnasium here that you can all go to if you like and they have chairs and things. We can put you there until we figure out what exactly is going on. They will open up their stores so you can get something to eat."" The video then displays passengers getting off the plane and walking the tarmac in the middle of the night. Inside the gym, passengers sat on chairs or rested on the floor. At the end of the video, the passengers cheered when addressed by a man in the top bleachers. Apparently, they were about to get off the island. A new flight, 2105, flew the passengers to Guam, where they landed Saturday, Clark said. FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer described the odor aboard the plane as an ""electrical smell"" in the cabin or cockpit. On Sunday, Merveldt-Guevara expressed relief that the journey was over. ""I thought let's just be grateful. Let's savor the moment,"" she said. But she said her luggage still hadn't arrived in Guam.

"(CNN) -- A Texan couple faces an agonizing wait for the birth of their baby boy to a surrogate, some 14,000 kilometers away, in a country now under military rule that's changing the laws mid-way through the pregnancy. The parents, who have asked not to be named, have never met their surrogate, who they chose from a photo and profile supplied by a clinic in Thailand. ""We are not allowed to have direct access to the surrogate, (to) talk to her.... but we are in contact with our agency that has kept us up to date even in the midst of all that has been happening,"" they said in an email to CNN. What's been happening is an unprecedented crackdown on a lucrative industry that has flourished in the absence of rules and regulations. In recent weeks, Thai authorities have raided a number of surrogacy clinics, closing some down and throwing hundreds of couples into a legal and emotional maelstrom. ""The thing that has helped me cope with all the uncertainty is my faith and the hope to have a baby,"" said the intending mother from Texas. She's not alone. Hundreds of confused couples . Families Through Surrogacy (FTS), a non-profit organization that helps intending parents through the process, says there are currently around 400 couples with pregnant surrogates or frozen embryos in Thailand. Around half are from Australia, with many others from the U.S., Canada and Israel, said FTS founder Sam Everingham, who has been inundated with calls from around the world from worried parents. ""Many clinics are being run on a skeleton staff, or staff working from home. As a result it's very hard for parents to contact their clinics,"" Everingham said. ""We want to assure parents that their surrogates are being looked after. They shouldn't panic, they shouldn't try to contact their surrogates direct. This is a difficult time but clinics are doing all they can to ensure those existing pregnancies are looked after,"" he said. Draft laws approved . The recent police raids have exposed the extremes of surrogacy in Thailand, including the case of a 24-year-old Japanese man suspected of fathering at least 12 surrogate babies because he wanted ""a big family,"" according to his lawyer. DNA tests are underway. The industry had already been subject to international scrutiny following the case of baby Gammy, a seven-month-old boy with Down Syndrome whose parents left him with their Thai surrogate, while taking his twin sister home to Australia. It was later revealed the children's father, David Farnell, was a convicted pedophile. Change in the industry was already underway, with the announcement by Thailand's military government in late July that clinics would be reviewed to ensure they were abiding by the Medical Council's code of conduct. Many weren't. ""People have been operating on a pretty informal basis and the risk has always been that that would change, and change very quickly. So in that sense the worst fears of legal professionals like myself have come to bear,"" said Jenni Millbank, a surrogacy expert from the University of Technology in Sydney. Last week, the interim Thai Cabinet approved a draft law to make commercial surrogacy a criminal offense. It's unclear when it will be formally approved by the National Legislative Assembly and endorsed by the Thai King. Everingham told CNN it's unlikely people in current arrangements will be charged. ""The Thai government has assured us in recent days that there will not be penalties for those in current arrangements, whether they be surrogates or intending parents. (But) there will be a new process for exit from the country,"" he said. Babies stopped at airport . In the last few days, Thai immigration officials have stopped two couples -- from the U.S. and Australia -- from leaving the country with their newborn babies. Police Major General Suwitpol Imjairat said both had been allowed to leave after presenting a missing document. ""Thai authorities are now more rigorously enforcing documentary requirements upon exit of the country when they suspect a child has been born of surrogacy in Thailand,"" said a spokesman from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). A spokeswoman from the U.S. Embassy said: ""We are aware of reports of cases where the parents were not permitted to exit, and we are seeking clarification about Thai Immigration requirements."" Suwitpol told reporters on Tuesday: ""If all documents are right, there will be no problems."" Legal limbo . Couples with pregnant surrogates are now expected to have to seek a Family Court ruling before they're able to take their newborns out of the country -- a process that could take up to six months. ""It's been three to five weeks in the past. It's a huge increase,"" Everingham said. The extra costs and delays are an unexpected blow for couples who have already spent thousands of dollars on surrogacy services, but there's little they can do. ""Going early to Thailand would serve no purpose, and we would not know who to lobby anyway,"" the hopeful Texan mother said. ""We are not rich. We have regular jobs, and like most people, we only have so much vacation time to use to get our baby and take care of the legal requirements to take our baby home."" End of Thai surrogacy? Already, people who may have sought surrogacy in Thailand are looking elsewhere, Everingham said. ""Mexico and Nepal are very viable possibilities now for same-sex couples, singles and de facto couples."" The options will be discussed at a conference in Washington DC, next month, when Families Through Surrogacy will also be calling for mandatory criminal checks worldwide on intending parents, to avoid a repeat of the outrage that followed the case of baby Gammy. ""At the moment, some U.S. clinics do ask for criminal checks on parents, but it's the least that can be done by clinics to protect their reputation, as well as protect the babies who'll be born,"" Everingham said. It's likely the Thai crackdown will lead to a sharp drop in foreign parents seeking surrogacy in the country. However, Everingham says he doesn't think that it's the end of the industry in Thailand. ""There is going to be surrogacy in the future, but brokers or intermediaries won't be allowed. Basically it looks like it'll only really be possible if you arrive with a local Thai person or you're bringing a surrogate in from another country with you.""","400 couples worldwide worried for surrogate babies in Thailand .

"(CNN) -- For many people the financial sector appears to be a sprawling, interconnected mass of colossal banks, complex jargon and mind-boggling numbers. As a result, a question like ""how do we improve the financial system?"" often seems very abstract. We can propose particular policies -- such as limiting bankers' bonuses -- but these do not fundamentally change how people experience the system. Entrepreneurs, likewise, push particular innovations that they think will improve finance, but they normally focus on some limited shorter-term goal, like reducing fees in the payments system. It is not a vision that can rally people together. What we need is a vision that provides us with simple, broad guideposts of where we want to eventually get to. I would personally like to see a financial system more like Wikipedia. The key characteristics of Wikipedia . Wikipedia has five key characteristics. Firstly, everyone has the opportunity to participate in producing it. You can set up an account and begin editing. Secondly, provided you have the Internet, you have access to using it. Thirdly, it is transparent. If edits are made, people can check them and hold the editors to account. You can debate what should be included in articles, and request amendments. The fourth characteristic is the community ethos that has developed around it. Participants may bicker with each other, but on balance they feel they are working towards a larger goal of building the site and its integrity. The final key characteristic is that you have access to the underlying software, so if you do not think Wikipedia is working, or have different requirements, you can implement your own version of it. For example, check out Appropedia or Conservapedia. We are quite a way from achieving a financial system that embeds these characteristics, but let's look at initiatives that are aiming towards changing that. Goal 1: Wider participation in financial production . Right now, production of financial services is limited to a closed, elite group of professionals -- bankers, fund managers, traders, and so on -- who reap very large rewards. They might possess talent, but they are also known to not always act in the public interest, and to occasionally cause giant economic crashes. Encouraging wider participation in financial production would create more diversity in the system whilst empowering people. This is why peer-to-peer finance systems are a welcome innovation. They enable people to take control of a portion on their savings and lend or invest it directly into ventures that they feel personally attracted to. One of my favorites is Abundance Generation, which allows people to invest directly in wind farms. It gives an active role to someone who might otherwise passively deposit savings in unaccountable, non-transparent banks. Other sites like Zidisha enable peer-to-peer microlending in developing countries. Goal 2: Wider access to financial services . The current financial system tends to steer money to those who already have it. For example, huge amounts of money get lent to hedge funds, while entrepreneurs with small businesses that are useful to society, but that are not sexy like Facebook, get ignored by big investors and banks. One welcome trend that is challenging this is the rise of crowdfunding, which opens up financing opportunities to all sorts of underdogs. This includes filmmakers, young businesspeople who have heart but little track record, and projects that are too small for big banks to care about. For example, Crowdfunder is used to raise money social enterprises like Urban Harvest. There are some great niche crowdfunding platforms too, such as the US-based Beacon Reader which caters for journalists. Goal 3: Increased transparency . The financial sector is notoriously opaque. Have you ever tried to find out what your bank invests in? It is often almost impossible. In the UK, banks like Triodos Bank have taken the lead on trying to be transparent and accountable. Such institutions represent a tiny percentage of overall banks, but set a great example. Initiatives like Berlin-based OpenOil work from the borrower side, casting light on the money behind large oil companies. Goal 4: Building a collaborative culture . The prevailing culture of finance is split into two toxic camps. On the one hand there are passive retail investors who put money into banks and pension funds but who do not expect much in the way of accountability. On the other hand, there is the high-flying world of glory-boy traders and corporate financiers who care little about financial inclusion. People do not always want to have to take full responsibility for their finances, but it would be great to encourage more collaborative, creative participation in financial life. That is why it is fantastic to see the rise of do-it-yourself corporate finance initiatives like Brewdog's Equity for Punks, where individual beer lovers get to participate in an enterprise they are passionate about, without having to pay Goldman Sachs fees. Check out Community Shares too. Goal 5: Preserving the right to dissent . No financial system is ever going to be perfect, and any particular model inevitably comes with tradeoffs. For example, deposit insurance was initially put in place to protect small-scale depositors, but it has subsequently contributed to people's complacency towards banks. Our goal should not be to try design a stable utopia, but to preserve peoples' ability to challenge or dissent from whatever dominant system is in place at any one time. To allow this to happen though, we need to improve financial education. The current banking sector is unaccountable for many reasons, but one of them is simply the poor state of financial literacy, leaving empowered financiers facing off against people who frequently feel alienated or unsure about how the system works. Finance is a social art, not a closed science. Nobody should ever be mislead into thinking that they do not have right or ability to make a stand. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brett Scott.","The financial system should take cues from Wikipedia, says former broker Brett Scott .

"(CNN) -- In a country with a flourishing porn industry and an annual penis festival, it may come as a surprise that an artist with a mission to make female genitalia ""more casual and pop"" has run afoul of authorities. But in Japan, a conceptual artist known for creating works inspired by her genitals is being held by Tokyo police on charges of sharing obscene material electronically. Megumi Igarashi, who goes by the pseudonym Rokudenashiko (which means ""good-for-nothing kid""), launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise money to build a kayak in the shape of her vagina using a 3-D printer. In exchange for donations, supporters of the project were given data that would allow them to make their own 3-D prints of her genitals. Police arrested Igarashi Saturday, charging her with ""distributing data that could create an obscene shape through a 3-D printer."" The 42-year-old denies the charges, saying that she doesn't acknowledge that the work is ""an obscenity."" For her, it's a piece of fine art. In fact, Igarashi came up with the the idea for the project based on her own self doubt. Female genitalia is such a taboo in Japanese society, she explained on her fundraising page, that it has become ""overly hidden."" She did not know what a vagina ""should look like,"" she said, and worried that her own was ""abnormal."" Images of penises, on the other hand, were an acceptable part of pop culture, she said. (And anyone who's witnessed crowds licking phallic lollipops and sporting penis-shaped glasses at Japan's ""Festival of the Steel Phallus"" will find it difficult to argue with her.) The artist has embarked on a whole series of cutesy works inspired by the female anatomy, from smartphone cases to a giant kawaii mascot. She created miniature dioramas, including one of workers toiling away in a vagina-shaped crevice at Fukushima's damaged nuclear plant. Many critics of her arrest have pointed out that Japan only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. Distributing uncensored images of real genitalia is a crime under the country's obscenity laws. More than 17,000 people had signed an online petition calling for Igarashi's release as of Wednesday. One of her lawyers, Kazuyuki Minami, acknowledges that not everyone will appreciate Igarashi's work, but says that her case is about more than artistic expression. ""Whether you experience empathy with her works that challenge a taboo will depend on the individual's sensitivity. However, all people who believe in freedom and equality of human beings should understand that her arrest and detention was not right thing."" Police are still questioning Igarashi, a spokesperson for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police told CNN Wednesday. The earliest the artist can be released is August 8, although police can hold her for up to 20 days in order to gather evidence because she denies the charges, the spokesperson said. If convicted, she could face up to two years jail time or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen (around US$24,500), her lawyers say. China to deport Tiananmen 'pork' artist .

"(CNN) -- If you've spent any time on Facebook in the past day or so, you may be wondering: What's up with all the giraffes? Are they suddenly endangered? Is the circus in town? Is Toys R Us having a sale? No, no and no. (Although depending on where you live, the circus may actually be in town.) Photos of the spindly, long-necked animals are the byproduct of a meme that's been sweeping the social network in recent days. The meme invites users to share a riddle with their friends, who then are supposed to send a private message with the answer (don't post it in the comments, obviously). Any user who guesses wrong must agree to change his or her profile photo with one of a giraffe. Why a giraffe? It's not clear. CNN iReport: Who is talking on Facebook about giraffes? The riddle goes like this: . 3:00 am, the doorbell rings and you wake up. Unexpected visitors. It's your parents and they are there for breakfast. You have strawberry jam, honey, wine, bread and cheese. What is the first thing you open? (Spoiler alert: The answer is at the bottom of this story.) Most users agree there are two acceptable answers, although given that Facebook is an unruly community of 1.2 billion people, there's some debate over that. Judging by some comments on Facebook, some users are growing tired of the giraffe riddle. Others are making jokes. ""If anyone shows up at my house at 3 am they had better get a hotel because I'm not answering the door,"" wrote one commenter on CNN's Facebook page. Said another, ""I got it right, but the giraffe pic cracked me up so I made it my profile pic."" Then there was this commenter on the Chicago Tribune's Facebook page: ""Truth be told ... upon realizing it was your parents you'd probably open the wine first."" The answers: ""The door"" and ""your eyes.""","A new Facebook meme asks users to answer a riddle .

"(CNN) -- Bruce Wayne would never stand for BatKid getting cut from the Oscars, and the Internet hasn't either. Rumor has it that the March 2 Oscars ceremony was supposed to include 5-year-old Miles Scott, aka ""BatKid,"" but didn't due to rumored tension between the show's producers and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" star Andrew Garfield. Now the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is supplying an explanation. ""Due to the nature of a live show, hard decisions sometimes must be made,"" a statement from the Academy says. And those difficult decisions, the statement continues, ""require the Academy to cut segments due to the logistics of production."" Initially, Miles was going to appear during the Oscars' superhero segment along with Garfield. Miles has become about as famous as the actor, thanks to his heroic efforts as ""BatKid"" last fall. Miles has been fighting leukemia since he was 20 months old, and, through the ""Make-A-Wish"" foundation, wanted nothing more than to be Batman for the day. In November his wish was granted, as San Francisco was turned into Gotham and thousands of volunteers -- including President Obama -- rooted for Miles and pitched in to give him plenty of crime-fighting to do. His participation in the Oscars ceremony would have been a treat, for both Miles and the viewers at home. But on March 5, the New York Post's Page Six ran a story implying that tension between Garfield and the show's producers led to the bit being pulled. Both the Academy and Garfield have disputed those claims, saying that it was a mutual understanding that the segment needed to be eliminated. Garfield's lawyers told the Post that ""Andrew did nothing but give his time to Miles,"" and that it was producers Zadan and Meron who ""decided the bit didn't flow. It didn't work. It wasn't because Andrew refused anything."" And according to the Academy, Garfield ""understood that his segment had to be omitted, and he drove to Disneyland on Monday to spend time with 5-year-old Miles Scott and his family."" CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Miles Scott, aka Batkid, had a planned appearance at the Oscars that was cut .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The world's oldest known Christian Bible goes online Monday -- but the 1,600-year-old text doesn't match the one you'll find in churches today. The British government bought most of the pages of the ancient manuscript in 1933. Discovered in a monastery in the Sinai desert in Egypt more than 160 years ago, the handwritten Codex Sinaiticus includes two books that are not part of the official New Testament and at least seven books that are not in the Old Testament. The New Testament books are in a different order, and include numerous handwritten corrections -- some made as much as 800 years after the texts were written, according to scholars who worked on the project of putting the Bible online. The changes range from the alteration of a single letter to the insertion of whole sentences. And some familiar -- very important -- passages are missing, including verses dealing with the resurrection of Jesus, they said. Juan Garces, the British Library project curator, said it should be no surprise that the ancient text is not quite the same as the modern one, since the Bible has developed and changed over the years. ""The Bible as an inspirational text has a history,"" he told CNN. ""There are certainly theological questions linked to this,"" he said. ""Everybody should be encouraged to investigate for themselves."" That is part of the reason for putting the Bible online, said Garces, who is both a Biblical scholar and a computer scientist. ""Scholars will want to look very closely at it, and some of the Web site functionality is specifically for them -- the ability to search the text, the ability to highlight a word, the degree of detail is particularly interesting for scholars interested in the text,"" he said. But, he added, ""It's for everyone, really a wide audience, because of curiosity, because they appreciate the value of it."" By the middle of the fourth century, when the Codex Sinaiticus was written, there was wide but not complete agreement on which books should be considered authoritative for Christian communities, according to the Web site where the Codex is posted. The Bible comes from the Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai desert, where a scholar named Constantine Tischendorf recognized its significance in 1844 -- and promptly took part of it, Garces explained. ""Constantine Tischendorf was in search for ancient manuscripts, so he appreciated the age and value of it,"" Garces said. He took a handful of pages to Germany to publish them, then returned in 1853 and in 1859 for more. On that last trip, he took 694 pages, which ended up in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet government decided to sell them in 1933 -- to raise money to buy tractors and other agricultural equipment. The British government bought the pages for £100,000, raising half the money from the public. Garces called that event one of the first fundraising campaigns in British history. Film footage from the time shows crowds of people turning out to see the manuscript, which was considered a national treasure, he said. Though the Bible has been reassembled online, in the real world it remains scattered. Most of it is in London. Eighty-six pages are held at the University Library in Leipzig, Germany, parts of 12 pages are held at the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg, and 24 pages and 40 fragments remain at St. Catherine's Monastery, recovered by the monks from the northern wall of the structure in June 1975. The manuscript contains the Christian Bible in Greek, including the oldest complete copy of the New Testament. (A copy held at the Vatican dates from about the same period.) Older copies of individual portions of the Christian Bible exist, but not as part of a complete text. The Codex also includes much of the Old Testament that was adopted by early Greek-speaking Christians. That portion includes books not found in the Hebrew Bible and regarded in the Protestant tradition as apocryphal, such as 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 & 4 Maccabees, Wisdom and Sirach. The New Testament portion includes the Epistle of Barnabas and The Shepherd of Hermas. As it survives today, Codex Sinaiticus comprises just over 400 large leaves of parchment -- prepared animal skin -- each of which measures 15 inches by 13.6 inches (380 mm by 345 mm).","Handwritten Codex Sinaiticus is more than 1,600 years old .

"(CNN) -- Cassidy Stay has seen the worst -- the brutal killings of her parents and siblings, ages 4 to 13, in their Texas home. On Saturday, the 15-year-old quoted Dumbledore, the wise man from the Harry Potter series, in hopes of finding some good amid the horror. ""Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times,"" Cassidy said, citing J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" ""if one only remembers to turn on the light."" The remarks -- at a public memorial for her family -- were the teenager's first public comments since she emerged as the lone survivor from the carnage in her family's Spring home. Authorities say that Ronald Lee Haskell barged into residence on Wednesday demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife. She was not there, but the Stay family was. And soon, in a barrage of bullets, six of them were dead. They included Cassidy Stay's parents, Stephen and Katie, as well as her 7- and 9-year-old sisters and 4- and 13-year-old brothers. Authorities: Man kills 4 children, 2 adults . Cassidy was targeted as well, with the Harris County Sheriff's Office indicating the shooting left her in critical condition. By Saturday, though, she was not only out of the hospital but standing tall, wiping away tears as people remembered her parents and siblings and offered support to her. Thanking the first responders, doctors and nurses who'd helped her, the teenager said, ""I am feeling a lot better and am on a very straightforward path to a full recovery."" Unfortunately, her family isn't coming back. Reminders of this were everywhere, including a board that had hearts with their names. Cassidy mentioned them too, right after quoting Dumbledore. ""I know that my Mom, Dad, Brian, Emily, Becca and Zach are in a much better place, and that I will be able to see them again one day,"" she said at the gathering. Accused killer collapses in courtroom . Grandfather: Cassidy saved 20 lives . At the same ceremony outside Lemm Elementary School in Spring, Roger Lyon remembered his daughter Katie, his son-in-law and grandchildren, saying, ""We will miss them in the morning and in the evening."" ""The best way, we think, (to move on) is to concentrate on the living, to cling to hope of life that has emerged in this terrible darkness."" He was talking about Cassidy. Lyon then recounted what the teenager had done -- how she'd been shot and how she'd seen her parents and siblings shot. After all that, her grandfather said Cassidy ""had the presence of mind to remain quiet and to play dead."" Once the coast was clear, the teen got up, called police ""and told them we were in danger."" ""Without her courage and quick thinking, we might be mourning the deaths of 20 -- yes, I said 20 -- people today, including myself and nearly all of our children and grandchildren,"" Lyon added, crediting Cassidy for alerting authorities who headed off Ronald Lee Haskell and arrested him after a three-hour long standoff. While in the hospital, Cassidy talked about angels she'd learned in Sunday school are sent to ""protect his children in times of great need,"" according to Lyon. ""After she had been shot on Wednesday, she said it felt as though the angels were there with her, putting their hands over her mouth -- whispering to her to be quiet,"" her grandfather said. ""'I was quiet when I needed to be quiet,' she told us."" Between the balloons being released into the sky in the Stay family's memory, in between all of the tears and the hugs among those in the crowd who knew them, there were many reminders of Cassidy's actions -- and not just from her grandfather -- on Saturday. Her name, after all, was among those on the board with those of her slain family members. Hers was the only heart that wasn't red. And it was the only one with extra words added: ""Our hero.""

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi River: home to grand old paddle steamers, blues music, Huckleberry Finn, and... pirate ships. With its skull-and-cross-bones flag flapping in the wind, and swashbuckling captain at the helm, this is perhaps the last boat you'd expect to find on America's most famous inland waterway. But the 12-meter Gypsy Rose II is just one of six pirate ships built by 54-year-old Captain Tim Woodson and setting sail on the iconic river. Now the buccaneering boat has been sold to the History Channel for $80,000, after being advertised on classifieds website Craigslist. ""It's probably the most photographed ship on the Mississippi River,"" Woodson, from St Louis in Missouri, told CNN. ""We get a lot of kids running along the shore, trying to catch the cannonballs as we go by,"" he said, referring to the 4-inch sponge balls shot from the ship. Dream boat . The professional boat builder first started making pirate ships five years ago, converting ordinary house boats into fairytale vessels. ""I wanted to find an old boat that I could transform into something really cool,"" said Woodson. ""My girlfriend asked: 'What are you going to do?' I don't know where it came from, but I said: 'I'm going to build a pirate ship.'"" That's exactly what he did, adding fake masts and covering the boat in planks of wood stained with varnish and black spray paint. ""As you walk on board you see a skeleton wearing an eye patch -- that's the old captain we pillaged the boat from,"" said Woodson. ""The sails are all torn with cannonball holes,"" he added. ""Inside, the first thing you see is a hand-drawn map, globe of the world, and an old desk covered in treasure."" Luxury living . The remarkable boat may appear to be something out of a 17th century European fable, but inside it has all the luxuries of a modern ship. Woodson spent just over two months building Gypsy Rose II, which can hold around 30 passengers. It features two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen, and putters along at 30 kilometers per hour. ""The galley is fully functional but is stacked with rum barrels and pewter mugs,"" said Woodson. ""It really is a modern-day pirate ship with 1600s treasures scattered throughout."" Costume drama . With his battered hat, ripped vest, and dangling earring, Captain Woodson is every inch the pirate of old. Alongside his girlfriend, Wench Maria, he can be found steering his fantastical vessels from Missouri to Illinois as part of sightseeing tours down the murky Mississippi. Groups can also rent the boats for pirate-themed parties, with one elderly woman recently celebrating her 99th birthday on board. ""When I was a kid, pirates were cool and that hasn't changed,"" Woodson said. ""It's about that feeling of being free, of being an explorer."" ""It gives you an excuse to be the bad boy."" One man's fleet . Among Woodson's six converted pirate ships are a former 21-meter U.S. troop carrier and another 12-meter boat now lined with 18 bunk beds for school trips. Once complete, each boat is advertised for sale on Craigslist, with the History Channel snapping up Gypsy Rose II for its TV series Ax Men, which follows the history of timber cutters. Other boats have been bought by cruise operators and restaurateurs. ""When I was building my first ship, people would say I was crazy,"" said Woodson. ""But five years, six boats, and probably 200 cruises-a-year later -- they're not telling me I'm crazy now.""","Missouri boat builder creates his own pirate ship, sails Mississippi River .

"(CNN) -- When James Franco doesn't like something, you'll know about it. On Thursday, the 35-year-old actor appeared to take a stand against The New York Times and its theater critic, Ben Brantley, after the paper ran a hesitant review of Franco's Broadway debut in an ""Of Mice and Men"" revival. In the April 16 piece, Brantley called ""Of Mice and Men's"" opening night on Wednesday ""respectable"" and ""respectful,"" but also ""generally inert."" The revival, directed by Anna D. Shapiro, sees Franco portray the smaller, sharper George from the John Steinbeck story, while Chris O'Dowd portrays his oafish companion, Lennie. Brantley wrote that the two leads, who star alongside Leighton Messter, ""wear their archetypes like armor."" And while the production would make ""an excellent audiovisual aid for middle-school instructors who are teaching (George) Steinbeck's novella,"" Brantley believes ""habitual theatergoers ... shouldn't expect the kind of revivifying interpretation that makes revisiting a classic feel essential."" Franco has been blissfully promoting his turn in ""Of Mice and Men"" for weeks, and seemed pretty excited to both land the part and read the reaction to it. Following ""Of Mice and Men's"" opening night, the actor shared Variety's more favorable review, which credited director Shapiro for ""an impeccably mounted production"" and praised the ensemble acting as ""flawless."" But Franco was vehement about the Times' take. ""Sadly Ben Brantley and the NYT have embarrassed themselves,"" Franco said in an Instagram post that has since been removed. ""Brantley is such a little b**** he should be working for Gawker.com instead of the paper of record. The theatre community hates him, and for good reason, he's an idiot."" The remarks have since been removed from Franco's account, but not before they were screengrabbed for posterity. Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson shared the image on Twitter, acknowledging that it had been sent to him by a friend.","James Franco appeared to take issue with a New York Times review of his play .

"(CNN) -- Almost a century ago Eglantyne Jebb, the founder of Save the Children, said that the only international language the whole world understands is the cry of a child. Now, as we start the 500-day countdown to the deadline for the Millenium Development Goals and prepare to mark World Humanitarian Day on Tuesday, I am not so sure. Having done far too little to stop children and their schools from becoming instruments of war in Gaza, we have also been slow to respond to the plight of the Yazidi children of Iraq, utterly incapable of providing basic health and education for a million child refugees exiled from Syria and appear powerless to rescue the Nigerian schoolgirls abducted by the Boko Haram terrorist group whose aim is to stop girls going to school. All of this despite international legislation, including the 1907 Hague Regulations, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and more generally the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions on children and the excellent recommendations from Graca Michel that the U.N. Security Council should pay special attention to the abuses of children's rights in conflict zones, including the misuse of schools. Now today, exactly 500 days out from December 31, 2015 -- the point at which we all promised to achieve universal education for all children, there are still 58 million children who never go to school, millions of them unable to do so because they are condemned to child labour, child marriage, child trafficking or, in the case of girls, medieval forms of discrimination. Round the world young people are starting to see the blindingly-obvious connection between boys and girls shelled in Gaza, the schoolgirls abducted in Nigeria, the Syrian refugees without a home, millions of children denied basic rights -- including the right to education across the world -- and the rape of girls in India, the forced marriages of 9 and 10 year olds in Bangladesh, the genital mutilation of their counterparts in Mauritania and across Africa and the denial of girls' basic rights in Pakistan and elsewhere. It all comes down to one basic truth: Almost 70 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is still an abject failure to take children's rights seriously and, as the adult world vacillates its people themselves who are now becoming the most vociferous in their anger at the violations of their rights, beginning to see their freedom fight as a civil rights struggle and leading the charge for change. And what marks 2014 a turning point for children's emancipation is the country-by country growth of civil rights groups led by young people themselves and, spurred by contact and communication across the Internet, their coordination under umbrella organizations such as Girls Not Brides, fighting schoolgirl marriage; the Global March against Child Labour, opposing child slavery; and the World at School, championing the right to education for all boys and girls. Young people's groups, from Bachpan Bachao Andolan, fighting child labour in India; to the Yellow Movement in Ethiopia and the Street 2 school campaign in Tanzania have yet to trend on Twitter and Facebook. But they soon will. Opinion: Nigeria's kidnapped girls not forgotten . Girls fighting child slavery from the Kalamari forum in Nepal and the 19 child marriage free zones in Bangladesh have yet to become a major presence on our streets. But it will happen soon. And on Monday 500 youth ambassadors representing all countries of the world will announce they will meet in New York on September 22 and, shadowing the next day's U.N. General Assembly of world leaders, they will attempt to force the rights of children onto the international agenda. They will argue hard, and they will be heard. This is not about asking and receiving. They are demanding their rights. They will demand that children should not be weapons of war and schools should never become theaters for prosecuting conflict. They will demand the Security Council now properly police laws that ban the militarization of schools and, as called for in the Lucens guidelines, the insertion of these obligations into doctrine and military manuals. They will demand that education should be a right across borders, with a universal obligation to offer all children education even in unstable environments -- and for the early removal of all barriers, from child labor and child marriage to sexual discrimination -- to this universal right. Of course, what moves people to hear the anguish of the child is the plight of the most marginalized. But, sadly, it is always the weakest, the youngest and the most vulnerable -- the street child, the orphan, the trafficked girl, the isolated rural poor -- who remain neglected, forgotten and left behind. It is to reverse this injustice that we, the adult world who have done too little, must now support young people waging their own liberation struggle. It is not too late: we must, of course, use the next 500 days not just to be more attentive to the needs of the children of the world and to keep our promises but also to offer practical support to young people as youth ambassadors, young people's representatives and new youth groups mobilize for this new struggle. For if the enduring image from a century ago is one of helpless children waiting to be protected and even pitied, then the image remembered by the next generation will be radically different. As young people connect, communicate with each other and assert their rights, the new ""cry of a child"" is less likely to be the shedding of tears and pleas for charity than defiant marches on our streets and a deafening clamor from young people themselves for justice.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Officials have ruled the death of a 10-year-old girl who got into a fight last week to be a homicide, authorities said Monday. Joanna Ramos, a fifth-grade student at Willard Elementary School, died of blunt force trauma to the head six hours after an altercation with a female classmate that lasted less than a minute, said Long Beach Police spokesman Sgt. Rico Fernandez. Authorities have identified the other girl, who is 11, as well as several onlookers, and they are continuing to investigate what happened. ""There are several accounts of what transpired based on interviews with witnesses, but we have not concluded the precise motive,"" Fernandez said. In a statement, police said Ramos and her unidentified classmate had challenged each other to a planned fight when their school session ended Friday. ""The two girls met in a nearby alley next to a church and began hitting each other,"" Fernandez said. The fight was brief, and no weapons were involved, authorities said. According to Long Beach Unified School District spokesman Chris Eftychiou, Ramos finished her regular school session at 2:12 p.m. Friday and was supposed to remain on campus to begin her scheduled after-school program at 2:30. ""We believe the altercation occurred during that 15-minute window because she apparently left and returned for the session, which involves help with homework and academic-related activity,"" said Eftychiou. After the fight, the girls left and went their separate ways. Ramos stayed in the afternoon session for about an hour but did not exhibit obvious signs of physical trauma, said Eftychiou. ""When she did complain of not feeling well, her cousin picked her up, but we had no indication she was involved in an altercation,"" he said. ""Only when she was at the hospital did we get word about the altercation, and there is no indication that bullying was a factor,"" said Eftychiou. Once the investigation and autopsy are complete, the findings will be turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for review and to determine whether charges will be filed in the case. No arrests have been made, authorities said. On Monday, grief counselors were brought into Willard Elementary to assist instructors and students. ""It was a somber day,"" said Eftychiou. Ramos had been enrolled at the school for about a year and a half, he said.","10-year-old girl fights with classmate in an alley and dies at hospital six hours later .

"(CNN) -- UK police have arrested 660 suspected pedophiles -- including doctors, teachers and scout leaders -- in a six-month operation spanning the country, the National Crime Agency said Wednesday. The operation -- which targeted people accessing indecent images of children online -- involved 45 police forces across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. More than 400 children across the United Kingdom have been protected from harm as a result, the National Crime Agency said in a statement. Thirty-nine of the suspects were registered sex offenders, the statement said, meaning the vast majority were not previously known to police. Their number also included social care workers and former police officers. The operation was kept under wraps until Wednesday to protect children and gather evidence against the accused, the statement said. The National Crime Agency is not revealing the methods used to track down the suspects because it hopes to deploy them again in the future. The charges brought so far range from possession of indecent images of children to serious sexual assault, it said. Many suspects have yet to be charged in the case. ""This is the first time the UK has had the capability to coordinate a single targeted operation of this nature,"" said Phil Gormley, the agency's deputy director general. ""Our aim was to protect children who were victims of, or might be at risk of, sexual exploitation. A child is victimized not only when they are abused and an image is taken. They are re-victimized every time that image is viewed by someone."" Some of those who start by looking at indecent images online go on to abuse children directly, he said, so arresting them now may prevent them from crossing that line. The operation comes amid wide public concern over the issue of sexual abuse of children in the United Kingdom. Children's TV entertainer Rolf Harris was sentenced this month to five years and nine months in prison for a string of indecent assaults against women and girls. His trial came in the wake of shocking revelations of predatory sexual behavior by the late TV host Jimmy Savile against vulnerable children and adults. The publicity around those high-profile cases appears to have encouraged others to come forward with allegations of abuse. Chief Constable Simon Bailey said the majority of police forces in England and Wales are dealing with an ""unprecedented increase"" in reports of sexual abuse of children. ""Forces are investigating exploitation of children and young people by groups and gangs, non-recent abuse including large-scale investigations into abuse in institutions over many years and sexual abuse by parents and family members,"" he said. CNN's Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","A six-month UK-wide operation snares 660 suspected pedophiles, police say .

"Honolulu (CNN) -- The Internet loves a list. Lists spark conversation. They start fights. People see a list and come away asking questions: Why isn't my song on The Atlantic's list of ""10 best songs about the subway."" Or why is my state on Gawker's ranking of the ""worst 50 states in America."" (Their winner/loser: Arizona. Ready, set: debate.) Lists, in short, ""are awesome,"" as Buzzfeed's CEO put it in a memo earlier this year. That site, which is the undisputed king of the Internet list, is known for using rankings, lists and GIFs to make people read about all kinds of wacky topics they never would have cared about, or even imagined, before. As I'm writing this, the site has lists for ""11 DIY recipes for your favorite '90s snacks,"" ""29 insanely elaborate custom coffins from Ghana"" and ""4 delightfully sexist political ads from the '50s"" on its homepage. I'm not ashamed to say I totally would read that stuff. But I want to push the idea in a new direction. I'm heading up a new CNN project called Change the List. It aims to appropriate everything that's great about lists -- shareability, intrigue, digestibility -- to the end of creating change in some of the places that need it most. For each project, we will start with some sort of ranking that deals with a pressing social issue. CNN will send me, your lucky guide to all things list-y, to the place at the bottom of the list. I'll report on what's going wrong, why the issue matters, and what could be done to help. Then I'll enlist (pun intended, sorry ...) you, CNN's dutiful readers, in a social campaign created to help bump that place off the bottom of the list. It's a collective experiment in make-a-difference journalism. The goal is that, together, we can change the list. The first Change the List project focuses on voter participation in the United States. You may have heard there's this little election coming up in November? Despite the fact that pundits have been yacking about the race for years, and candidates are spending unprecedented dollars on attack ads, millions of Americans will wake up on November 6 and go about the day as if they weren't blessed with the opportunity to help decide the future of the world's pre-eminent democracy. They won't vote. This is particularly true in Hawaii, where fewer than half the state's eligible voters cast a ballot in 2008. That's the case even though Barack Obama is Hawaii's (for-real, certifiable) native son. Hawaii, rather consistently, has the lowest voter turnout rate in the United States. Less than 49% of eligible people voted in the 2008 presidential election, according to data crunched by Michael McDonald from George Mason University. Compare that to the top state, Minnesota, where almost 78% voted. I'm in Hawaii this week to look into why that's the case -- and to see what people there are trying to do to increase voter participation in paradise. The trip will include a meeting with Kanu Hawaii, a nonpartisan group that's going door to door to register first-time voters. Volunteers are uploading photos of these new civic participants -- the people who actually have the power to change the list -- to iReport. Photos submitted via Instagram and Twitter with the hashtag #changethelist also will pop up soon on this CNN page. (If you've never voted, please make a pledge to do so here). I'm also planning to visit the district with the lowest of the low voter turnout rates in Hawaii; a meeting with a homeless candidate who won the Republican primary for a U.S. House of Representatives race; and conversations with people in the state who don't vote because they say the United States is illegally occupying the islands. When I get back, we'll try to create a conversation that could change the list -- that could bump Hawaii out of 50th place. Look for a stream of content on voter turnout between now and November, when I'll report back on our successes and failures. The aim of Change the List, by the way, is not to shame the countries, cities or states that fall at the bottom of the lists. It's to seek understanding that could lead to solutions. No finger pointing here. Just action. There's a fair chance the concept may leave you thinking something like this: ""Hey, but won't another place fall to the bottom of the list when it's over?"" Know that you're right. But I think of it this way: By trying to boost a place off the bottom of the list, we hope to raise standards for everyone. You can follow this journey -- to Hawaii and beyond -- on the new Change the List Tumblr. Sign up for an e-mail newsletter to get updates on how you can help with this project.

"(CNN) -- Niki Lauda is the Lazarus of Formula One. Having risen in triumph from the brink of death, his tale of almost biblical proportions was given the Hollywood treatment in recently-released blockbuster ""Rush."" But the straight-talking triple world champion does not believe in miracles or the sentiment of the silver screen. The Austrian has built his own legacy by defying not only death, but also his family, employers and arch rivals along the way. ""I go my own way,"" the 64-year-old, whose fightback from life-threatening injuries in 1976 to win two more world titles ranks as one of sport's greatest comebacks, told CNN's The Circuit. ""Thank god, I learned in sport, that there is no excuse. It's very simple, if you're first, second or third there's no discussion. ""If something goes wrong, look into yourself first -- what did I do wrong? ""I only see black and white, I have no gray areas and I hate them. ""I try to analyze, take the decision, even if it's the wrong one, it's better than making no decision because if you take no decision you never find out what you have to do. "" Maverick racer . Lauda was born into a wealthy Austrian family four years after the end of World War II, but despite growing up with privilege he learned quickly that he would have to make his own way in the world. His family disapproved of their teenage son's racing ambitions. When Lauda found an Austrian bank to sponsor his debut with the March F1 team, his grandfather -- who happened to sit on the board of the bank -- scotched the deal. ""He said, 'No way! If this is my grandson, you will not sponsor him,' "" Lauda says. ""I really got upset with him and said, 'Leave me alone, it is my own business.' Then I started racing my own way."" Lauda bankrolled his own way on to the F1 grid, making his debut in the 1971 Austrian Grand Prix for the uncompetitive March team. His decision to take out further bank loans to finance his F1 career paid off at the end of 1973 when he was signed by Ferrari -- but even this new era with the sport's most iconic team saw Lauda continue to do things his way. ""I remember my first test in Fiorano,"" he recalls. ""I drove the first couple of laps and (team founder) Enzo Ferrari was there and Piero his son to translate. ""Ferrari said, 'So kid what do you think of this car?' ""I said the car was s**t. And Piero said, 'You cannot say this. You cannot tell my father that the car is s**t because he will throw you out. Tell him it's no good, it sounds a little better.' ""He told him and the old man really got upset because I criticized a Ferrari."" Lucky to be alive . Lauda soon earned the respect of ""Il Commendatore,"" a proponent of tough love who the Austrian still describes as ""the most charismatic guy I have ever met in my whole life."" In 1975 he stormed to five wins to capture his first world title with the Italian powerhouse -- but the following season fate cruelly intervened. Going into the German Grand Prix at the notorious Nurburgring circuit, which he had asked his fellow drivers to boycott due to its poor safety setup, Lauda was leading the 1976 title hunt. He came out of the race fighting for his life. Lauda's Ferrari burst into a fireball after a crash on the second lap. He was pulled from the flames with severe burns and lung damage. Lying in hospital later that night, he was administered the last rites by a priest. Analysis: Does F1 lack the characters of the past? Typically for Lauda, he saw things differently. At the age of 27, he summoned his will of iron to find a way back -- calling it the most courageous decision in his F1 career. ""First, I knew about the danger,"" says Lauda, who wears a baseball cap to hide the scars left by his fiery crash. ""I went to every accident, even if I was not involved or didn't see it, to understand what happened. ""The accident did not surprise me because I knew it was dangerous. I told myself, 'I was lucky, I'm still alive so why not as I'm alive, God help me, let's try.' ""This was the big challenge ... a comeback. For me it was clear, that the longer I wait, the more difficult it's going to be because the more worries you start building up. ""I had to do it as quick as possible to overcome these problems and to keep racing as before."" Defining moments . Just 42 days after his crash in Germany, Lauda was back in the cockpit of a Ferrari and racing to defend his title at the Italian Grand Prix. It was a comeback that defied the medics and his rivals, but it was another brave decision that decided the title. Lauda refused to race in the torrential rain in the title-deciding Japanese Grand Prix, a decision that saw the title swing into the hands of his rival James Hunt. ""I would take the same decision today,"" Lauda says. ""It was stupid to race."" The story of those defining points has been turned into ""Rush,"" a movie by F1 fan and director Ron Howard. For Lauda, his self determination has continued to guide him to this day. After winning a second title with Ferrari and moving to the Brabham team, he quit F1 with two races still to run in the 1979 season. Lauda said he ""tired of driving round in circles,"" and a new career as an airline boss beckoned. However, a second coming for McLaren brought his third and final world title in 1984, before an inevitable second retirement followed. Lauda is now an opinionated but respected voice in the inner circle of F1's paddock, where he patrols as a non-executive chairman of the Mercedes team and a TV analyst. If ""Rush"" is the movie of his life then the soundtrack has to be Frank Sinatra's ""My Way."" ""I do not want to change,"" Lauda insists. ""I will continue all the way through to the end of my life in this way.""","Formula One legend Niki Lauda defied his wealthy family to pursue a career in racing .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- As violence continues to wrack Iraq, another ethnic slaughter may be in the making by Sunni extremists from ISIS. ISIS fighters have besieged the ethnic Turkmen Shiite town of Amerli in the north for two months, and its fewer than 20,000 residents are without power and running out of food, water and medical supplies. ""The situation of the people in Amerli is desperate and demands immediate action to prevent the possible massacre of its citizens,"" said Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Iraq. He said the suffering was ""unspeakable"" and demanded that the Shiite majority Iraqi government ""relieve the siege"" on Amerli. Small town fights ISIS . About 5,000 families live in Amerli, which has been under siege for 70 days, according to Dr. Ali Albayati, head of the Turkmen Saving Foundation. He told CNN the town is running without electricity, is out of medicine and can only turn to wells for water. Nearly three dozen villages surrounding Amerli are already under ISIS control, Albayati said. The people of Amerli are relying on the Iraqi government to take them out by helicopter or support them with food drops, Albayati said. In the past 10 days, he added, only one flight has delivered food. Surrounded on four sides, the 17,400 residents have had to defend themselves with only the help of local police, said Masrwr Aswad of Iraq's Human Rights Commission. Their situation echoes the ordeal of Iraq's ethnic Yazidis, whose plight after they were forced to flee into the mountains to escape militants ISIS triggered U.S. aid drops and the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. ISIS has targeted Shiite, Christian and other minority communities with shocking violence, as it has advanced across Iraq. Yazidis braced for life in exile . Bombings, mosque shooting . Suicide bombers targeted the Interior Ministry intelligence headquarters in Baghdad on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 35 others. In Kirkuk, a series of three car bombs and a roadside bomb killed at least 20 people. ISIS had warned on Friday there would be revenge for the killing of 50 of its members in a battle in Jalawla, Iraq. ISIS specifically promised to retaliate against the Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The bombings came as the death toll rose to 70 from an attack on Sunni Muslims a day earlier at a mosque in northeast Iraq, when suspected Shiite militiamen opened fire on worshipers. The mosque attack threatened to derail efforts to form a new, inclusive government -- something world leaders have said is a must if the country hopes to defeat Islamic militants. Iraqi authorities did not immediately identify the attackers, but Sunni politicians have put the blame on Shiite militias. Outraged Sunni lawmakers withdrew from negotiations to form a new government, saying they would not return until those behind the attack were arrested, two party officials told CNN. U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq -- including military advisers -- as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. And U.S. officials have said that Washington is mulling the possibility of going after ISIS fighters in their stronghold in eastern Syria. What will it take to beat ISIS? Where is ISIS? CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Baghdad, Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Anna Coren and Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Death toll rises to 70 following mosque attack targeting Sunni Muslims .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is investigating circumstances surrounding the disappearance of IRS emails that Republicans believe could shed light on the possible targeting of conservative and other political groups by the agency. The investigation into the email disappearance, which the IRS said was due to a crash of former agency official Lois Lerner's hard drive, is part of a wider criminal probe of whether any IRS employees broke the law in unfairly singling out specific political groups for extra scrutiny. ""The investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from Ms. Lerner's computer,"" according to Deputy Attorney General James Cole in testimony submitted to the House Oversight Committee. The panel will hold a hearing on the matter on Thursday. Email controversy flared over senator . But Cole will also say that he can provide no details as to what investigators have learned because the probe is ongoing. ""The IRS investigation was launched by the department without hesitation and immediately after Ms. Lerner publicly acknowledged the potential misconduct,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement emailed to CNN. ""It has been conducted with the utmost integrity ever since, and department officials have regularly characterized the investigation as a top priority,"" she added. Lerner, who ran the division that executed the IRS targeting of groups claiming tax-exempt status, resigned last year after the Treasury Department's inspector general found those working under her used ""inappropriate"" criteria to scrutinize certain groups. Since then, she has refused to testify at hearings, invoking her constitutional right not to do so. That decision and the lost emails have frustrated Republicans, but also amplified their rhetoric and invigorated their push to find any documents related to Lerner and her time in government. EPA tells Congress it lost emails too .","Republicans believe emails could shed light on possible IRS targeting of conservative groups .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton crashed out of qualifying for the German Grand Prix on Saturday as Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg took pole for Sunday's race at Hockenheim. The German sealed his fifth pole of the season with a time of one minute 16.540 seconds edging out Williams' drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa who finished second and third respectively. Earlier there was concern for Hamilton as he crashed at around 250 kph (155 mph) during the first three qualifying session (Q1). The 29-year-old Briton slammed sideways into the barriers at the hairpin leading into the stadium section of the circuit. A shaken Hamilton eventually emerged from his car before being taken to the medical center for an examination which revealed no serious injuries. ""I hit something,"" Hamilton told the team over the radio. ""I hit... hit the brakes - the brakes failed."" Mercedes later confirmed that Hamilton's car had suffered a failure of the right front brake disc. Hamilton was lying in 16th place when he crashed out but will start Sunday's race in 15th after Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez, who qualified in 14th place, was hit with a penalty. Elsewhere, McLaren's Kevin Magnussen qualified in fourth with Daniel Ricciardo one place behind with Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel down in sixth. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is one place further back with Daniil Kvyat steering his Toro Rosso to eighth on the grid. Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez make up the top ten. Rosberg was happy with his day's work but would have preferred his teammate have been pushing him hard in Q3. ""It's great, home race here and to be on pole is fantastic,"" Rosberg told reporters. ""Of course I would have preferred if it was an open fight with Lewis. A little bit less happy as a result because Lewis didn't have a shot at it in the end. ""But all in all, still a fantastic day up to now, but no points for today. (The) important (part) is just tomorrow, still a long way to go but it's still a good start."" Victory on Sunday would cap an extraordinary 10 days for the 29-year-old German. On July 11, Rosberg wed his childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold. Two days later Germany sealed the World Cup beating Argentina 1-0 in the final and earlier this week Rosberg extended his contract with the Mercedes team. Rosberg currently leads the drivers' championship by four points from Hamilton with Red Bull's Ricciardo 67 points off the pace in third. Read more: Schumi's wife praises fans .

"(CNN) -- Waking up to realize you suddenly have no leg or legs is as horrible an experience as one can have, and one that will, sadly, be faced by a number of people injured in the bombing of the Boston Marathon. It happened to me when I was 16 after a bone cancer diagnosis and amputation (the cancer later spread to my lung and caused a lung to be removed as well). As I looked down in the recovery room to where my right leg used to be, all I saw was a short stump. This is frightening for sure, and only one of the things you're dealing with after an amputation. Luckily perhaps, your entire being is consumed just with healing; the bigger issues come later. First thing to deal with is massive physical pain from the surgery, and it will be worse because of the shrapnel packed bombs. The explosive force traumatizes the tissues and the fragments injected into the body cause collateral damage. Modern medicine does well with pain management, so this phase will, luckily, pass quickly. For the new amputee, challenges come fast and furious, but so does the natural ""fight"" that is in all humans. My very first challenge was trying to stand on one leg. The body and the mind do not adjust immediately to major changes like the loss of a 25 pound leg, so balance while standing up is elusive. But it will come and that is a first little victory. It's the first of many little accomplishments that begin to build up one's zeroed-out self-confidence. Our bodies heal and adapt well--the mind is a bigger challenge. Someone newly disabled naturally has thoughts of ""why me?"" as well as feelings of loss, despair and even depression. As John Green wrote in a wonderful book called ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" about a boy who lost his leg to cancer, ""You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world."" Bad things happen and all we can do is adapt and move forward. Terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers . We are pretty attached to all our body parts, so of course there is a sense of loss. People don't study ahead for how they will deal with every possible eventuality that affects the trajectory of their lives. This new horrible reality of being disabled is a shock. There is fear of the unknown. What will I be able to do? How do I get back to normal? Will people stare at me because I look different? And it is easy to imagine how this leads to the tar-pit of self-pity. But that is not what happens to most people and it won't happen with the Boston Marathon bombing survivors. Compared with the primitive prosthetics of my youth, modern prosthetics are technological marvels. It is surprising to most people, but prosthetics' most important role is not ambulation: They are a social device to ""level the playing field"" and allow others to see you as not different. Today's computerized knees keep people from falling (with mine, I have gone seven years without a fall; before that, for 33 years it happened once a week). They cut energy use for walking in half, and allow normal stair walking. But there is a down side. A computerized above-knee prosthesis is between $50,000 and $60,000, of which the best insurance companies typically pay about 80%. That can be $12,000 out of pocket. This is where we can help the new Boston Marathon amputees. Opinion: Getting on with life after terror hits . By far the biggest long-term issue for anyone knocked down in life is the loss of self-esteem. Humans require strong self-esteem for a healthy, happy life. As Gloria Steinem said, ""Self-esteem isn't everything, it's just that there is nothing without it."" She's right. Building back the lost self-esteem is the hardest and most important challenge for the newly disabled. How does one do it? I found that sports were key. I liked sports and, of course, physical activity was good for me. Pick something you like. Focus. Work hard at it. Work harder than anyone else. You can't help but get good at it. That feels good. That makes you want to work even harder. You keep getting better and better at it and then others stop saying you are pretty good, considering you only have one leg, and start respecting you. You've won and your self-esteem rises and takes your happiness up with it. I started with skiing, which at first was more ""turn, fall, get up, turn, fall, get up"" than swooshing down the slopes. Now I am a double-black diamond (amputee) skier. I tried biking and every year join a 200-mile bike-a-thon. I added swimming and in May will do my 20th ""Alcatraz Sharkfest"" swim across San Francisco Bay. Crystal legs and snake arms: Artificial limbs as art . The natural challenge-response we all have in us is what will be the biggest help to the new amputees. It goes like this: ""You can't run with one leg."" Says the amputee, ""Who says I can't?!"" and he or she will be off and running. We know that those with so-called disabilities don't fall into the pity tar-pit and in fact, do better than they or anyone around them ever thought possible. Some even excel far beyond what they had ever accomplished before they became ""differently abled."" Richard Bruno studied polio survivors in the '80s and wrote in ""The Polio Paradox,"" ""Polio survivors who were told they would never go to college or get a job became the country's best and brightest."" Like who, you might ask? President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Johnny Weissmuller, Judy Collins, Jack Nicklaus, Dinah Shore, Alan Alda, Joni Mitchell and many more. These polio survivors had significant physical problems but refused the label disabled, and never accepted the word ""can't."" To them, to me, and I predict to these bombing survivors, disability is simply ""different ability""; and just you watch, maybe even ""superability."" Who says they can't? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jothy Rosenberg.","Jothy Rosenberg lost his leg at 16, an experience that some in Boston blast have had .
He says it's horrible. And it's challenging physically to adjust, psychically even more difficult .
But you can, he says. Sports mastery helps restore self-esteem .
Rosenberg: Those hurt can excel far beyond what they imagine. Don't accept ""can't"""
