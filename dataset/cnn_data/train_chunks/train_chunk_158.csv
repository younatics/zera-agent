"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China criticized a ""woeful"" human rights record in the United States on Friday, a day after a U.S. report said Beijing's own record is getting worse, with harsh crackdowns on dissidents. ""The United States' tarnished human rights record has left it in no state -- whether on a moral, political or legal basis -- to act as the world's 'human rights justice,' "" China said in an annual report on U.S. human rights. The report cited the arrests of protesters participating in the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States. Many protesters, it said, accused police of brutality. It also said the United States has ""fairly strict restrictions"" on the Internet, saying the U.S. Patriot Act and Homeland Security Act both have clauses about monitoring the Internet, giving the government or law enforcement organizations power to monitor and block any Internet content ""harmful to national security."" ""The facts contained in the report are a small yet illustrative fraction of the United States' dismal record on its own human rights situation,"" China's report said. Thursday, the U.S. State Department criticized a number of countries, including China, in its annual report on human rights around the world. The human rights situation in China, it said, ""deteriorated, particularly the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association,"" with Chinese forces reportedly committing ""arbitrary or unlawful killings."" The report said Chinese authorities have held activists in unknown circumstances and placed their family members under house arrest. Abuses ""peaked around high-profile events,"" including visits of foreign officials, milestone anniversaries and calls for street gatherings inspired by the Arab Spring. The U.S. report comes after the arrival in the United States of one of China's best-known activists, Chen Guangcheng, after he escaped house arrest and took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, marking a dramatic diplomatic showdown between Washington and Beijing while U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was visiting China for talks. China regularly criticizes U.S. interference with what it calls domestic political issues. Although the U.S. report covered 2011, before the high-profile saga over Chen, it detailed concerns about Chen's treatment, including thugs' ""severe"" beatings of him and his wife. It said that Chen was denied medical care, while activists trying to visit his house in eastern Shandong province said they were ""assaulted, detained, forcibly removed or otherwise abused."" The State Department report also criticized the human rights records of Myanmar, Syria, Bahrain, North Korea, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","A Chinese report criticizes the human rights record of the United States .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The daughter of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been axed by a BBC television show after she made an offensive ""off-air"" remark, the corporation has confirmed. Margaret Thatcher (left) and her daughter Carol Thatcher in   Southampton, England in June 2008 . According to reports in the British media, Carol Thatcher referred to a tennis player as a ""golliwog"" back stage during the filming of The One Show last Thursday. The remark was made about a male tennis player taking part in the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne. The term is an offensive word for black people used in several countries. She was immediately challenged about her gaffe but dismissed it as a ""joke."" The BBC said it considered ""any language of a racist nature wholly unacceptable,"" before adding that it had hoped Thatcher, 55, would issue an unconditional apology but she had declined to do so. The remark is thought to have upset a number of people on the show, with one BBC spokesman quoted by The Times newspaper as saying: ""We will no longer be working with Carol Thatcher on The One Show."" However, the corporation said on its Web site that she would not be banned from the BBC as a whole. Thatcher's agent is now demanding an apology from the BBC, the corporation reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, Thatcher's spokesman told The Times Wednesday that she made the remark in a conversation with the show's presenter Adrian Chiles back stage. ""Carol never intended any racist comment,"" he said. ""She made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up. There's no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment -- we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that. ""It is disgusting that we've had a leak of private conversations in the green room -- the BBC has more leaks than Thames Water."" The Golliwog first appeared as a character in an 1895 book, ""The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls,"" described by author Florence Kate Upton as ""a horrid sight, the blackest gnome."" Based on a black minstrel doll Upton played with as a child, the character inspired early 20th-Century dolls by several manufacturers and was used as the trademark of James Robertson & Sons, a British jam and preserve maker, in the early 1900s. The term ""wog"" became a widely used racial slur for dark-skinned people that grew in popularity among some Britons during World War II. As late as the 1960s, soldiers in Great Britain's Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders military regiment wore a brooch of one of the Robertson characters for each Arab they killed, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. The term ""golliwog"" is used as racial slur in Germany, England, Ireland, Greece and Australia, according to the museum's Web site.

Get Me Out of Here!,"" was a regular contributor on the BBC prime-time show.","Carol Thatcher referred to a tennis player as a ""golliwog"" backstage .

"New York (CNN) -- Banks are holding more than $200 million in insurance payments meant for victims of Superstorm Sandy, nearly four months after the storm made landfall, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The Cuomo administration said it has delivered letters to various banks and mortgage service providers asking they ""use maximum discretion and effort to speed the release of funds."" ""Families need to be able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs,"" Cuomo said in a written statement. ""After insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape."" A month of outrage later, Senate passes Sandy relief . The state's Department of Financial Services found that four of the biggest U.S. banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase -- are holding more than 4,100 checks worth more $130 million. The banks were not immediately available for comment, though have maintained that they were socked with a massive amount in payouts that require processing in the wake of the storm. Thousands of storm-battered residents are still awaiting a total of $208 million in insurance checks. Cuomo said the payouts are often issued jointly to the homeowner and their bank or mortgage servicer, which then requires the ""bank's endorsement of the check before the homeowner may access the funds."" Delays can follow when banks request proof of repairs or servicing required by federal mortgage agencies. But many residents have complained that they haven't received the funds they need to start the repairs. Superstorm Sandy left 132 people dead in the United States and contributed to tens of billions of dollars worth of damages, especially along shoreline communities in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a 30-day stay of execution for condemned Georgia murderer Warren Lee Hill, whose attorneys say he's mentally disabled. Georgia had asked the justices to lift the stay, which was granted minutes before Hill had been scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday night. A federal appeals court in Atlanta halted the execution to give lawyers a month for written arguments on whether Hill should be spared under the federal ban on executions of the mentally disabled. Georgia law requires inmates to prove mental retardation ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" to avoid the death penalty -- the highest standard of any state. State prosecutors say Hill has repeatedly failed to meet that standard in years of appeals. But three doctors who examined Hill for the state have reversed their conclusions and now say he should be spared, giving fresh ammunition to Hill's attorneys. That reversal ""establishes consensus among every doctor who has evaluated Mr. Hill that he is mentally retarded,"" his lawyer, Brian Kammer, said Thursday. Hill's defenders say he has an IQ of 70. He was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison. Hill was already serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright, when he beat Handspike to death with a nail-studded board. Tuesday's reprieve was his second in less than a year.","The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to overturn Warren Hill's last-minute stay .

"(CNN) -- This past week, at ""town hall"" meetings in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and New Hampshire, a group of Republican senators sounded alarms about disasters that will befall local economies should the threat of more than $500 billion in defense cuts over the next decade become a reality in January. To his credit, the group's leader, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, admitted that Congress should take some of the blame for creating this situation. But that was a rare recognition of reality at town halls that were more like a Republican version of the mythical Potemkin villages: fake towns hastily put together by Russian Minister Grigory Potemkin to impress the visiting empress. The real purpose of the GOP's Potemkin town halls? To redefine Congress' unfinished task of deficit reduction as an Obama administration leadership failure that has put both national security and swing-state jobs at risk by playing games with defense spending. The road to these town halls began in Washington a year ago with a congressional vote that was needed to raise the debt ceiling and avoid U.S. default on a debt that has skyrocketed since 2000. House Republicans, shackled by a tea party ball-and-chain, turned the vote into a heated debate on spending cuts. The ensuing legislative battle led not to meaningful deficit reduction but to the Budget Control Act of 2011. It's an 11th-hour ""Hail Mary"" legislation that raised the debt ceiling -- and kicked the deficit can down the road by one year. The Budget Control Act mandated $917 billion in federal spending cuts over a 10-year period, including some $487 billion in defense cuts. But that wasn't all. The centerpiece was a different kind of act: A high-wire act called ""sequestration."" Sequestration is a trigger. It's scheduled to be pulled in early January -- unleashing $1.2 trillion in additional cuts, half in defense, half in other domestic spending, unless Congress agrees on an alternate plan. Almost no Democrat or Republican wants to make these sequestration cuts because they will have significant and negative consequences for national security and for domestic spending, affecting millions of Americans. In fact, almost no one who voted for this legislation ever thought these cuts would actually be made. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was intended to provide breathing space and to buy time. Sequestration was added to force a congressional ""supercommittee"" to come up with a deficit deal late last year, ""or else."" But the supercommittee was as divided as the Congress that created it; Congress couldn't come up with a solution, and it was no real surprise that the supercommittee couldn't either. McCain and his swing-state town hall team were right in framing the consequences: If the trigger is pulled, sequestration will have immediate and negative impact on millions of Americans. This includes not just U.S. troops, defense industry civilians and local bases. It also includes schools and Head Start participants, struggling families for whom child care support is critical, unemployed workers who need job training programs -- all would lose out in the nondefense portion of sequestration. But the senators were disingenuous in exhorting their audiences to ""demand presidential leadership"" to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff in January -- and wrong to imply that the president has been AWOL on the issue, leaving national security and jobs at risk. President Barack Obama has made clear he doesn't want to see these cuts happen next year. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has repeatedly declared that sequestration defense cuts -- coming on top of the 10-year, $487 billion in defense cuts that start next year -- would have disastrous consequences for our national security. Obama has been at the table since last summer trying to prevent this by reaching a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction. He laid out a detailed plan to reduce the deficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade -- a plan that would bring annual domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy since President Dwight D. Eisenhower and would require less in defense cuts than recommended by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission. But the president calls for a balanced approach that includes spending cuts and investment revenue. His proposed spending cuts outweigh the proposed additional revenue by more than double. But it's the investment revenue which has been the deal-breaker for most Republicans. In fact, that's the major reason that sequestration includes the $500 billion in defense spending cuts: Faced with their own Hobson's choice of putting at risk either the defense budget or continued tax breaks for the wealthy, Congressional Republicans grimaced -- and threw defense into the cauldron to protect the tax breaks. It seems clear that the political brinksmanship will continue until Republicans and Democrats in Congress figure out how to do what military and civilian leaders at the Pentagon had to do this past year in addressing the initial $487 billion in defense cuts: Namely, tie spending to the national interest and do so recognizing ""we're all in this together."" Obama ordered the Pentagon to devise a plan ensuring that national security priorities would guide and frame spending decisions, rather than the other way around; and ensuring that the U.S. military would remain the strongest and best in the world to protect and defend U.S. national interests. The generals, admirals and civilian leaders did just that. All had a stake in the outcome and recognized the world had changed. All were involved throughout in shaping the plan. All recognized that pet projects and sacred cows had to meet the tests of commonly defined national security priorities or be reduced or jettisoned. All understood that to succeed in keeping the country safe and secure, they needed not just to cut in some areas but to invest in others, and that having the best and strongest military in the world was not really synonymous with continuing to spend unlimited billions. All made difficult individual decisions in the belief that they were all in this together, and they have spoken publicly and privately in support of the strategic framework they developed to guide defense spending decisions over the next decade. Maybe instead of holding political Potemkin town halls in swing states about the dangers that sequestration poses for the Pentagon, we should ask congressional leaders to take lessons from the Pentagon on how to work together to prevent it from happening. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Doug Wilson.","Doug Wilson: GOP distorting reality behind Pentagon cuts that could be triggered in January .

"(CNN) -- Iran warned Tuesday it would strike against an ""enemy"" threatening it if needed to protect its national interests -- even if the enemy didn't attack first. Gen. Mohammad Hejazi, a deputy head of Iran's armed forces, said his country ""will no more wait to see enemy action against us,"" according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""Given this strategy, we will make use of all our means to protect our national interests and hit a retaliatory blow at them whenever we feel that enemies want to endanger our national interests,"" Hejazi said. 5 voices: Will tensions lead to war? Fars added that in November, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had ""warned enemies about Iran's tough response to any aggression or even threat."" ""Iran is not a nation to sit still and just observe threats from fragile materialist powers which are being eaten by worms from inside,"" Khamenei told students at a military college in Tehran, according to Fars. ""Anyone who harbors any thought of invading the Islamic Republic of Iran -- or even if the thought crosses their mind -- should be prepared to receive strong blows and the steel fists of the military, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), and the Basij (volunteer) force, backed by the entire Iranian nation,"" Khamenei said, according to the report. Hejazi's remarks come amid high tensions between Iran and much of the world. The United States, European powers, and Israel have helped lead efforts to pressure Iran into taking part in serious negotiations over its nuclear program. Iran insists its program is for civilian purposes, but numerous countries are concerned Tehran is working to build a nuclear weapons arsenal. Israel has made clear it is considering an attack on Iran's nuclear program. Both countries often openly antagonize each other. On Sunday, Tehran cut off crude exports to British and French companies in retaliation for a new round of sanctions imposed on the regime. Officials with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, began a second round of talks Monday with Iranian officials. The IAEA said the talks were an opportunity to get more clarity about the ""possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.""","A deputy head of Iran's armed forces said his country won't wait for enemy action .

"(CNN) -- He overcame his nerves on Saturday, but Trevor Fisher Jnr. will have to do it all again if he wants to win his first European Tour title. The 33-year-old will have a shootout with fellow South African Richard Sterne at their home Joburg Open on Sunday after moving out to a five-shot lead over the rest of the field. Both shot four-under-par 68 to be 19 under the card after three rounds, with 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in a group of four players tied for third. ""A bit of nerves set in there,"" said Fisher, who has won seven times on southern Africa's Sunshine Tour. ""You try not to think about the lead, but it's there in front of you."" Fisher finished third at the same tournament in January last year, his best result in a top-level event. ""I was a bit jumpy with the swing and wasn't waiting at the top, so I hit a few bad shots there,"" he told the European Tour website on Saturday. ""But I came back nicely with a few birdies. It's just a feeling, and you've got to try and feel comfortable out there as much as possible."" Sterne is looking for his first victory since December 2008, when he won two successive titles on home soil and three that year including the Joburg Open. The 31-year-old finished second at last week's Dubai Desert Classic, having led at the halfway stage. ""It's quite draining for two weeks in a row, but I'd rather be here than in the middle of the pack. The heart is pumping quite fast out there,"" said the five-time European Tour winner. Schwartzel, the Joburg champion in 2010 and 2011, is looking for his third successive title after December victories at the Asian Tour's Thailand Open and the co-sanctioned Alfred Dunhill Championship held in Malalane near Kruger National Park. He was tied with fellow South Africans Jaco van Zyl (67) and George Coetzee (70) plus Chile's Felipe Aguilar, who also carded 68. Pebble Beach leaderboard .

"Milwaukee (CNN) -- I do not have long hair; I have smoked occasionally; I am married to a gora (white guy) -- I'm a Sikh, but no poster child for the Sikh community. I am critical of the difference between words and actions in our religion's promised equality for women. But like most Sikhs I do still believe in one god, karma and reincarnation, and I find the poetry of our 10 gurus deeply inspiring. Nevertheless, on a postcard-perfect Sunday morning five days ago when my local gurdwara, or house of worship, was attacked by an apparent white supremacist, I was very much a Sikh, doing whatever I could. After the shooting, my Irish-American husband David and I rushed to Oak Creek and joined the group of Sikh men and women standing in the parking lot of a bowling alley across a boulevard from police vehicles surrounding the temple. We held hands, offered presence and solidarity. Only three commandments are given to Sikhs: work hard, share with your neighbors, take the name of the lord. Only the last two were possible on that day. Yellow tape cordoned us off. My fellow Sikhs were dressed in Sunday best -- a mix of business suits and white kurta pajamas among the men, salwar kameezes for the older women. I noticed that many men of working age have short hair and no longer wear turbans. Since the shooting of a Sikh in Arizona in 2001, recorded hate crimes against Sikhs have decreased. However, young Sikh men heard over the gurdwara grapevine that If you want to wear your turban, emigrate to Canada. Canada has had an official policy of multiculturalism since 1971. News: Temple shooting dredges up memories of long history of bias crimes against Sikhs . On Sunday, as we waited for those trapped inside the gurdwara, a kind soul from the Salvation Army came around suggesting trauma counseling. Anger and frustration, he said, can surface later. A middle-aged man in the crowd came forward and thanked him in English. In Punjabi, he added, ""The shooter needs counseling if he survives. He should be invited to do sewa."" Sewa is community service. It has been used to bring about restorative justice in Canada, by familiarizing perps with Sikhs and Sikhism. A young man wearing a ""We the People"" T-shirt looked up from his Twitter feed. ""They're saying we're an obscure religion. How can 23 million people be obscure?"" I thought of my turbaned father guiding tourists around the state Capitol in Madison as a UW student working for Gov. Gaylord Nelson, teaching Americans their history. Sikhism may have been ""obscure"" in the 1950s, but -- now? We have Sikhwiki, we have SikhNet, we have SALDEF, we have SikhChic. But those who hate don't read about those they blame for their status shock or economic troubles. ""We offer langar every Sunday,"" said a woman, referring to the free dining hall open to the public. ""But even homeless goras don't come."" A little boy asked of the suspect: ""Won't his mother be ashamed of him? Won't his whole family be ashamed of him?"" ""Don't be silly,"" his sister said. ""He's a gora."" ""Maybe this will make some Wisconsin politicians talk about gun control,"" said a young woman wearing Capri pants, a bright orange crocheted top and a chunni over her head. ""Don't be silly,"" her uncle said. News: Sikhs repair, reclaim temple after rampage . I said, ""I should have made more fliers, led tours of the gurdwaras."" But in 25 years married into a Euro-American family, the only relative who has volunteered to attend gurdwara with me is my husband. Could I have persuaded strangers? ""Whenever we invite goras, we get evangelicals who want to convert us,"" said an elder I've called ""aunty"" for years. ""I tell them your god is my god."" ""Any time I explain we're not Muslims, it sounds like we would prefer them to harass Muslims,"" said the man in the 'We the People' T-shirt. ""Just better say nothing. Keep to ourselves."" And we do. Most Sikhs don't look for jobs, we make them. We gather together for worship on Sundays because we live in a Judeo-Christian country, but most of us do our remembrance of god every day. We don't have a Sabbath; most of us work all the time. We wear the kirpan (ceremonial dagger) to remind us to defend those who cannot defend themselves. We're Sikhs. We're supposed to look different so that we cannot blend into crowds and evade responsibility. We're Sikhs, so we're supposed to inspire by courage and never teach fear. Our very name means we're supposed to always be learning. We're taught not to ask for favors, but to thank Vahe-guru, the highest teacher, for grace, for our critical faculties, intuition and creativity. News: Walker says Sikhs showed love in response to hate . Today I will dress in white, the color of mourning, to attend the funerals of the six Sikhs who were killed and offer support for their families. Afterward, I'll go to the gurdwara that 200 Sikhs cleaned yesterday as our sewa. There I'll join in prayers for the departed and for the three men wounded and still in the hospital. The gathering will end as always with prayers for ""sarbat da bhala"" -- the progress of all humankind. I know that by the grace of the creative force and our courage, American Sikhs will survive this act of destruction. An ignorant man showed his country and the world what fear and hate can bring about. May we now show what love and service can achieve.

"(CNN) -- When former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner went on a vengeful killing spree this month, one couple found themselves under the protection of the same officers with whom they serve. Phil and Emada Tingirides, a captain and sergeant in the LAPD, respectively, experienced moments of fear that stretched into days of uncertainty after Dorner killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades. Phil Tingirides was on the disciplinary board that terminated Dorner's employment with the police department in 2008, and was considered a primary target of Dorner's because his name appeared on a manifesto written by the renegade cop. Opinion: In rampages, it's about revenge . In the document, which announced his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case. The Tingirides were among some 50 families that were placed under police protection because they were named as targets of Dorner's rage. Phil Tingirides had never met Dorner before his disciplinary hearing years ago, and never spoke to him afterward. What a surprise for him, then, to be dragged into an unfolding nightmare this month. ""Never, ever did I think someone would go to this extent in their rage over the discipline that was handed down to them,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday. The call informing him that he was a potential target came on a Wednesday afternoon. The first thing he did was call his wife and children and get them all back to his house. ""We hear threats all the time, but rarely so specifically, and that someone has already carried out in the most cowardly way,"" he said. The couple has six kids in a blended family, ranging from 10 to 24 years in age. The biggest challenge was protecting the young ones from what they heard on television and social media about the manhunt for Dorner, Emada Tingirides said. ""We shut the TV off after the first day,"" she said. What killed Dorner . Under police protection in their own home, the parents tried to explain to the younger children what was going on, all while seeing ""their fear growing,"" Phil Tingirides said. The parents never broke down in front of their kids, Emada Tingirides said, but the couple would sometimes sneak into the garage and cry. With television news ruled out, the family spent their time watching other channels and playing board games. Quality time, it turns out. ""We found that it brought our family closer together,"" Phil Tingirides said. The manhunt ended last week when Dorner was cornered and died in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city he had once sworn to protect and serve. The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in a cabin after a shootout with law enforcement that left a sheriff's deputy dead and another wounded, McMahon said. The cabin caught fire when police shot tear gas canisters into it. On Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the department would review Dorner's firing and all the claims made in his manifesto. The chief says the review is an act of transparency, to reassure the public that the department polices itself.

"(CNN) -- Rwanda officially closed on Monday its village tribunals overseeing the prosecution of suspects in a 1994 genocide that left 800,000 dead, marking the end of more than a decade of local court prosecutions. Government officials gathered in Kigali over the weekend to formally mark the closure of the courts, known as the gacacas, which closed the last of its cases earlier this month. ""What these courts achieved went beyond anyone's expectations. They administered justice and united Rwandans at the same time,"" Rwanda President Paul Kagame said in a statement posted on the gacacas website. ""These courts were evidence of our ability to find solutions to challenges that seemed insurmountable."" The closing of the gacacas came on the heels of the last of the criminal prosecutions related to the genocide by the International Criminal Court, though appeals of ICC findings are expected to go through 2014. according to the ICC . The leaders and masterminds of the genocide were tried by the criminal courts and the ICC, and civilians who contributed to attacks or loss of life directly or indirectly were sent to gacacas. Gacaca courts were introduced in the central African nation after the April 1994 genocide. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis were also killed. The gacacas were originally formed to resolve minor disputes among villagers but were reinvented to hand out justice to the perpetrators of the genocide and help fast-track reconciliation efforts in the broken nation. The nation's justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal set up to try genocide suspects were overwhelmed, and handling all the cases in those courts would have taken hundreds of years, according to the president. Gacacas hearings were held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred. There were no lawyers and no judges in robes. A panel of local villagers with no legal experience conducted the proceedings. More than 1.5 million cases were heard by the gacacas, according to estimates. Critics of the gacacas said they did not meet international standards for a fair trial, while others said it exposed victims who testified to revenge attacks. But proponents of the system, which allows a victim to address the tribunal, said it reduced prison congestion and allowed survivors to hear first-hand what happened to their family members who were killed.

"(CNN) -- A former Rwandan minister was sentenced Thursday to 35 years in prison after being found guilty by a U.N. tribunal of genocide, incitement to genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. Augustin Ngirabatware was the country's planning minister at the time of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which left some left 800,000 people dead. His is the last trial to be held by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which was set up to prosecute those suspected of genocide and other serious rights violations.

Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis were also killed. The tribunal found Ngirabatware, 55, guilty of directly and publicly inciting the killing of Tutsis at a roadblock in February 1994, and of distributing weapons that were used to kill Tutsis in Nyamyumba commune in April of that year. He was also convicted of ""participating in a joint criminal enterprise ... whose members shared the common purpose of destroying, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group, and exterminating the Tutsi civilian population in Nyamyumba commune.""

The former minister was detained in Germany in 2007 and transferred for trial at the tribunal in 2009. He will be given credit for time served in detention. ""The delivery of judgment today in this case marks a historic occasion and important milestone in the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,"" said chief prosecutor Justice Hassan Bubacar Jallow.

He said over the past 18 years, the tribunal indicted 93 people for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rwanda. Of those, 83 have been arrested, with 75 of them prosecuted to judgment, he said. Convictions resulted for 65 of those tried, while 10 of the accused were acquitted. Three died after indictment. Ten others were referred to national jurisdictions for trial and a handful remain fugitives. ""It has taken considerable effort, dedication and diligence by several parties for this outcome, amongst them the governments and law enforcement authorities of some 21 countries,"" Jallow said. He also praised the more than 3,000 witnesses from several countries who testified at trial despite significant challenges. ""We hope that the ICTR has through the execution of its mandate made a difference: a difference in ensuring accountability for those who played a leading role in the tragedy of 1994 in Rwanda; in contributing to justice, reconciliation and respect for the rule of law in Rwanda; in demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of the process of international legal accountability for international crimes,"" Jallow said. A number of appeals are still outstanding at the tribunal.","Former planning minister Augustin Ngirabatware is given 35 years in prison .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek politicians have been unable to form a new government in their economically embattled land late Friday, and the president might have to step in to breach the impasse. Socialist PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos met with Antonis Samaras, head of the center-right New Democracy party, and Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza party and failed to forge a deal, the parties reported. Venizelos was the third Greek politician since Sunday tasked with forming a new government. Samaras and Tsipras had tried and already failed to organize a government. Venizelos is to meet with President Karolos Papoulias and tell him he can't form a coalition, government officials said. Papoulias will call the party leaders and ask them to try and form a national unity government. If a unity government can't be formed by Thursday, Greece must call new elections. The political wrangling comes after Sunday's national elections in which seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote. Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. But this week's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures, policies of cutting spending and raising taxes to reduce public debts. Voters backed parties on the far left and right, withholding support from PASOK and New Democracy, the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted austerity measures. The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece's bailout agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the most outspoken supporter of fiscal discipline in the eurozone. Other leaders have been ousted by voters frustrated with austerity. France's President-elect, FranÃ§ois Hollande, campaigned against austerity and has promised to push through measures to boost economic growth. Venizelos said Sunday's fragmented results in the Greek election show voters don't trust ""any party on its own."" But he has said he wants Greece to stay in the eurozone. Samaras said his New Democracy party would be willing to participate in a national unity government ""provided it ensures Greece's stay in the euro"" and a revision of the bailout agreements with the country's foreign lenders. Earlier, Samaras said it will be tough to form a ""viable government,"" but he said, ""There is still hope."" Speaking to other members of parliament earlier, Samaras accused the leftist Syriza party, which placed second in the elections, of ""populism"" and a desire to take the country to new elections. Samaras said any new elections would mark a battle ""between the pro-European parties and the anti-European left."" Tsipras said Greece is no longer bound by austerity promises made in return for rescue loans. Tsipras has also demanded an examination of Greece's massive debt and a moratorium on part of its repayment. Tsipras said Venizelos wants a government participating in the policy of the bailout. But Tsipras said ""the refusal to take part is not given by Syriza but by the Greek people."" ""Venizelos and Samaras are sticking to the points that they signed in the bailout,"" Tsipras said after meeting with Venizelos. ""They want a pro-bailout government with a left alibi."" ""No government has the right to stick to the measures of the bailout,"" Tsipras said. An opinion poll Thursday shows that Syriza would come in first if fresh elections were held, with nearly 28% of the vote, much higher than the 16.8% that landed the party into second place during this week's elections. PASOK and New Democracy, the two parties that have been dominating political life in Greece for decades, have seen their popularity plummet as a result of the two bailouts and the austerity measures dictated in the programs. The poll shows that if elections were held New Democracy would slightly increase its position to 20.3%, while Pasok's popularity would suffer an even steeper decline to 12.6%. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy.","NEW: Politicians in Greece hold unsuccessful talks to form a government .

"Washington (CNN) -- Facing a bruising midterm election in less than four months, President Barack Obama's aides are putting together an aggressive schedule to deploy former President Bill Clinton at campaign and fundraising events in key states around the country, according to Democratic officials familiar with the plans. ""It's a no-brainer you would use one of the most talented politicians the country has ever had,"" said one Democratic official familiar with the discussions. ""There are few as good at laying out the contrast with Republicans."" There has been speculation Clinton might not be used that frequently because of lingering frostiness between the two presidents dating to the divisive days of the 2008 campaign. But the two camps tried to put any such tension to rest in recent weeks at a quiet White House meeting between Clinton aide Doug Band and White House Political Director Patrick Gaspard, according to officials familiar with the discussions. Sources said Band and Gaspard met right after the former president's surprise decision in late June to buck Obama and endorse former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff in a hotly-contested U.S. Senate primary. Obama had already endorsed incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet in the Democratic primary and only learned of Clinton's move after-the-fact. When Robert Gibbs was asked at the time if the White House would like to be notified of such an endorsement earlier in the process, the press secretary responded, ""Before you guys? Sure."" In addition to smoothing things over at the White House meeting, Democratic officials told CNN the Clinton and Obama teams mapped out an ambitious schedule to get Clinton on the campaign trail as often as possible in between his foreign travels to such hot spots as Haiti. ""We want whatever we can get from him,"" said one of the senior Democratic officials involved in the conversations. Democratic officials told CNN the White House specifically wants to use Clinton in key swing states where Obama is not particularly popular, such as Arkansas and Kentucky. In his home state of Arkansas, Clinton already helped Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln survive an intense primary challenge earlier this year and will now be used to help save the incumbent in an even tougher general election match-up with Republican John Boozman. Clinton also will be used in Kentucky, where the White House has high hopes of picking up a seat with Democratic nominee Jack Conway facing Republican Rand Paul, who has been engulfed in a series of controversies. ""I think he and President Obama will be a good one-two punch,"" added a second senior Democratic official. The second official noted that Obama cannot travel to every single congressional district over the next four months, and there are some specific regions where Obama would not go over well but Clinton could play better. Clinton recently campaigned tirelessly in Arkansas, a state that Obama lost badly to Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, in 2008, to help Lincoln survive a runoff. In May, the former president also campaigned for Mark Critz, the Democratic candidate in the special election to fill the late Democratic Rep. John Murtha's Pennsylvania seat. Clinton got a lot of credit among Democrats after Critz defeated Republican Tim Burns, giving the party a shot in the arm in a difficult year. Democratic officials also say that Clinton's campaigning could fit well into the narrative that Obama has been focusing on in recent days about how he inherited an economic mess from former President George W. Bush and now believes the midterm election is a choice between going back to failed policies or moving forward on policies that could help pull the U.S. out of recession. ""Let's not forget that Bill Clinton was the last Democratic president who had to clean things up after years of Republican rule,"" said one senior Democratic official. ""Clinton made tough choices that created [budget] surpluses. He can go out there and say, 'Look, I've lived this.' He's got a lot to offer because it's like an eyewitness account to what the country will look like if Republicans get in charge -- the obstruction, the investigations.""","The midterm election is less than four months away .

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber vowed to push Sebastian Vettel for the 2013 world title when their champion Red Bull team launched its new Formula One car on Sunday. The veteran Australian has had to play second fiddle to the all-conquering Vettel in the past three seasons, despite at stages being in contention for his maiden championship. He has had to contend with recent criticism from Red Bull's motor sport advisor Helmut Marko, who claimed the 36-year-old can't cope with the title pressure. ""I do believe I can have a crack at the championship again this year, as I have done in previous seasons,"" Webber told reporters at the RB9's launch at the team's English headquarters in Milton Keynes. ""That is my goal and what I think about each day when I get up, and I'm working hard with the team on doing that. ""They know I need 100% support. You cannot win a world title with only 90, you need 100, and we're going into 2013 with this in place, and I'm comfortable with that."" Team boss Christian Horner, who signed a new multi-year contract last week, backed Webber to be a contender despite him finishing sixth overall last season -- 102 points behind his teammate. ""If we weren't happy with Mark then we would never have signed him to be with the team for this year,"" he said. ""We're very happy with Mark and we give both drivers equal opportunity. It's ultimately down to what they do on the circuit. ""For us, it doesn't matter which driver wins, as long as it is a driver in one of our cars. Both of these guys believe they are the best, and the team will do the very best it can to support them."" Vettel became the youngest driver to win three world titles as he overhauled Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in the final third of the season. ""It all starts again from zero. We've all got the same chances in what will be a tough year again with a lot of races,"" the 25-year-old German said. ""So I'm just looking ahead. I'm not looking back on past races because I am convinced it doesn't give you a head start or an advantage. ""Obviously, the expectations are still there, but more than that we expect ourselves to do well again, so there is a lot of pressure. ""Right now there is excitement to get back into the car, start testing, then go racing and find out where we are. It's one thing to do all the talking now, but as soon as you have the helmet on, you simply want to perform and do your best.""","Red Bull launches new RB9 ahead of preseason testing later this month .

"(EW.com) -- You know what happens in ""Taken 2,"" don't you? The same thing that happened four years ago in Taken, but different. (But the same.) Directed by French tough-stuff Transporter 3 specialist Olivier Megaton, the movie is simultaneously silly, nasty, a lazy festival of stereotypes, and a cleverly made piece of merchandise â€” i.e., it's the devil we know. This time the blithely violent revenge thriller takes place in Istanbul, which, like Paris in the original, is infested with evil stubbled Albanian gangsters. And now it's retired CIA intel pro Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen) who get taken too. Miraculously, the couple's singularly hostage-prone daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), avoids captivity, and even proves a worthy bad-guy opponent, primarily through the use of her near-magic iPhone. By the way, the chief evil stubbled Albanian gangster, Murad Hoxha (Rade Serbedzija, who is Croatian), wants revenge because Bryan killed his son in the previous movie after that son kidnapped Bryan's daughter to force her into prostitution. Suffice it to say, things do not go well for Murad. Chained up and locked away along with his ex-missus, Bryan, with his very specialized set of skills, nevertheless wriggles free. Then, on the way to rescuing his ex, he alternately beats the crap out of people, shoots the crap out of people, runs the crap over people, and growls the crap out of people. Anyone who thinks any of the above constitutes a spoiler is not the audience for the phenomenon of the ""Taken"" oeuvre, a pair of icy-eyed movies laid over a gooey core of aspirational family bonding. In these films, by sheer dint of will, strategic career planning, and physical training sessions suited to his now 60-year-old chassis, Neeson sets himself the goal of becoming a Harrison Ford-like action hero. And this he does: He's sturdy, solid, efficient, opaque, and wears a black leather jacket well. Ta-da. He's an action hero. (Seems like a waste of a career arc to me, but guess who's the millionaire?) The apex of the star's work here is when he manages not to betray a giggle when directed to whisper into the phone to the perpetually edge-of-panicked Maggie Grace, ''Your mother and I are going to be taken. Listen to me very carefully.'' As Oscar Wilde almost said in ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" to be taken once may be regarded as a misfortune; to be taken twice looks like carelessness.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams wept with delight after becoming the oldest woman to ever hold the number one world ranking. The 31-year-old American star clinched a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory over Petra Kvitova in the quarterfinals of the Qatar Open to move back to the summit following a two-and-a-half year interval which almost saw her quit the sport. ""I am so sensitive nowadays -- I am always crying, but I never thought I would be here again you know,"" Williams told reporters. ""I have been through so much and I never thought I would be here,"" she repeated. Martina: Serena will 'break all records' Williams first became World No.1 on July 8, 2002 at the age of 20 and will take top spot for the sixth time her career. It is a remarkable comeback for Williams, who slipped as low as 175 in the rankings after missing almost a year with injury and a life threatening pulmonary embolism in 2011. But she returned with a bang in 2012, winning Wimbledon, Olympic Gold, the U.S. Open and the WTA Championships, while she has also triumphed in 59 of her past 62 matches. Williams, who will start her 124th career week at No.1 on Monday, beat Chris Evert's record of 27 years ago when she reached the top at the age of 30 and 11 months -- six months younger than her successor. Serena Williams hits her own face . That's a total only bettered by Steffi Graf (377), Martina Navratilova (332), Evert (260), Martina Hingis (209) and Monica Seles (178). The achievement had looked in doubt with Williams 4-1 down in the final set, but the American fought back to clinch a dramatic 7-5 victory. Williams will now face Maria Sharapova in the semifinal after the Russian defeated Australia's Sam Stosur 6-2 6-4, while Victoria Azaraenka also progressed to the last four after defeating Sara Errani. Federer breezes into Rotterdam quarters . Meanwhile, defending champion Roger Federer crashed out of the Rotterdam World Tennis tournament after suffering a shock 6-3 7-5 defeat by France's Julien Benneteau. The World No.2, who won the tournament in 2005 and 2012, was hoping to bounce back after losing out at the semifinals of the Australian Open. ""I'm very disappointed, I have some regrets about this match,"" he told reporters. ""He played great and created more chances than I did. He deserved to win. It was a tough loss, but they do happen. Being broken so many times (five) indoors won't get the job done. My game was up and down overall. ""He made it difficult and generated pressure. That made you try to serve harder. When I had some chances I didn't take them. I was maybe a point or two away from taking it into a third set and then the clock resets."" Relaxed Federer accepts the end of his dominance . Benneteau, the world 39, will play a Saturday a semifinal against either fifth seed compatriot Gilles Simon or Slovak Martin Klizan. ""This was a dream match, and I played like a dream,"" he told reporters. ""This is for sure my biggest win. He was the favorite, but maybe he played a bit tight. I've been playing well all week, improving with each match. ""I've had a great week here so far and I hope it's not finished.""

"(CNN) -- An unusual standoff is unfolding on the island of Borneo where about 100 men from the southern Philippines have come ashore demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area, Malaysian authorities said. Malaysian police and armed forces are negotiating with the men, who arrived by boat Tuesday in the remote, eastern district of Lahad Datu, in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo. The men claim to be the ""Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu"" and say they don't want their people to be sent away from the area, Tan Sri Ismail Omar, the Inspector General of the Royal Malaysian Police, said Thursday, according to the country's national news agency Bernama. Malaysian security forces have surrounded the village where the men are, and discussions with the group are ""proceeding well,"" Ismail said. ""We have told them to leave Sabah peacefully, as we do not want any situation which can threaten the security of the people,"" he added. Founded in the 1400s, the Sultanate of Sulu once encompassed numerous islands in the southern Philippines. At one point, it also comprised parts of Borneo, including Sabah. The historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a ""dormant claim"" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. Sulu is now part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in the southern Philippines, an area whose islands come within a few dozen kilometers of Sabah and where Islamic militants groups such as Abu Sayyaf operate. A previous hostage drama . In 2000, gunmen associated with Abu Sayyaf kidnapped more than 20 people, including Malaysians and Europeans, from a resort on the Sabah island of Sipadan, about 100 kilometers south of Lahad Datu, and held them for ransom in the southern Philippines. The group of Filipino men cornered in Lahad Datu say they don't want to be linked with any militant group in the Philippines, Ismail said, according to Bernama. But police don't rule out that the men are armed, he said. ""So far the situation is not tense and they appear to be behaving well,"" Ismail was quoted as saying. ""We believe the group has friends in the village but do not have homes there."" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said it was important that the matter ""be resolved without any bloodshed,"" Bernama reported. Philippine government and military officials are coordinating with their Malaysian counterparts on the matter, the official Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported Friday. Abigail Valte, a spokeswoman for Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, said the government is trying to ""ascertain the facts"" about the situation, according to PNA. She said Manila was ready to provide assistance to those involved in the standoff after Philippine diplomats in Malaysia had assessed the situation. The Philippine foreign ministry and the Malaysian prime minister's office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN on Friday. Philippine military officials declined to comment on the matter. According to PNA, Manila still claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal.

Reigning champions Dortmund have beaten Bayern in their previous four league meetings but had to come from behind to steal a point on this occasion. Some tight defending by the visitors frustrated the home side in the first half, but the deadlock was broken in the 67th minute when Toni Kroos swept past two defenders before firing home a low left-foot shot into the right corner.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A member of Iraq's governing coalition has told CNN he expects Tariq Aziz, Iraq's top diplomat under Saddam Hussein, to be executed next year. Saad Yousif al-Muttalibi said in an interview in Baghdad: ""It will definitely take place, and it will take place after the Americans leave Iraq."" A lawyer for Aziz, who served as foreign minister and later deputy prime minister, said he was surprised. ""I did not expect the government would be that stupid; by doing this they will drag this country to the edge of the abyss,"" said Badi Arif in a telephone interview. ""What about the national reconciliation that this government has been calling for? The government's position will be even weaker if they carry out the execution after the American troops leave the country and this will lead to more conflict among Iraqi factions."" A Justice Ministry official said the execution of Aziz, like those of other former regime members, will be carried out once the Presidency Council ratifies the order and hands it over to the ministry. The execution ""is not linked and has never been linked to the U.S. military presence nor to political pressure,"" the official said. Separately, a new law is under consideration that would require death sentences be ratified by the president within 15 days of their being handed down, al-Muttalibi said. Al-Muttalibi added that all of Iraqi society, including members of the three main sectarian groups -- Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds -- favor the law. Aziz was captured by U.S. forces in April 2003, shortly after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Hussein. He appeared frail when he testified in Hussein's 2006 trial on war crimes charges, for which the ousted dictator was hanged later that year. Aziz was sentenced to death in October 2010 by the Iraqi High Tribunal for his role in eliminating religious parties during Hussein's regime. His family was shocked by the verdict, his daughter told CNN at the time. ""My father served his country for more than 22 years. He delivered himself to the U.S. Army (after the fall of Hussein) because he wasn't afraid. He didn't do anything wrong. He served his country,"" Aziz's daughter, Zainab Aziz, said. ""He has been wronged."" Arif said last year that there was a political motive behind the death sentence. ""Mr. Aziz used to always tell me, 'They'll find a way to kill me, and there is no way for me to escape this,'"" Arif told CNN. ""But from a legal perspective, this sentence is wrong; this is illegal and this is unexpected."" Aziz served as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003, also holding the post of foreign minister for part of that time. After the verdict was announced, Amnesty International urged Iraq not to carry out the sentences, even as it acknowledged the brutality of Hussein's regime. ""Saddam Hussein's rule was synonymous with executions, torture and other gross human rights violations, and it is right that those who committed crimes are brought to justice,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's director for the Middle East and North Africa in 2010. ""However, it is vital that the death penalty, which is the ultimate denial of human rights, should never be used, whatever the gravity of the crime,"" he said in a written statement. The Vatican also opposed the death sentence, spokesman Federico Lombardi told CNN. ""This is not the most adequate way to promote reconciliation and reconstruction of justice and peace in a country that has suffered so much,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Let me explain to you why it's important that I have a .50-caliber machine gun capable of firing 500 rounds per minute bolted to the top of my Corolla. I live in Washington. You do know that this is a dangerous city, right? A guy I know got mugged last month. Not only that, it's entirely possible that while going around the Beltway, a commando team of Taliban fighters could come up behind me on their way to murder the president, and the only thing standing between them and disaster will be me. Not to mention that this one time, after I cut a guy off because he was in my blind spot, he gave me a really dirty look. If had had my .50-cal, you can bet he would have stayed a good distance back. If you consider this reasoning rational, then you were probably also persuaded by the testimony Gayle Trotter of the Independent Women's Forum gave Wednesday to a Senate committee discussing potential legislation to place some relatively modest limits on guns. Opinion: Why the NRA fights for gun rights . Trotter argued that women need to have the biggest, baddest weapons they can get their hands on. Why? For ""the peace of mind that a woman has as she's facing three, four, five violent attackers, intruders in her home, with her children screaming in the background, the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary-looking gun gives her more courage when she's fighting hardened, violent criminals. If we ban these types of assault weapons, you are putting women at a great disadvantage."" So we can't limit the most dangerous weapons, because somewhere there might be a woman who needs one to fight the five violent attackers who have invaded her home. And we can't limit the rounds a magazine can hold, because what if that frightened housewife needs to engage in an hourlong firefight? You don't expect her to reload, do you? Your average gun owner may think that's crazy, but it's the world some extreme gun advocates -- including those with great influence in Congress -- inhabit, where laws should be written not with the reality of Americans' lives and deaths in mind, but according to the most horrible fantasies anyone can conjure. Now, let's talk about some reality. The sad fact is that what women most have to fear is abusive partners, not home invaders. According to one analysis of FBI data from 2010, 94% of female homicide victims knew their killers, and most of those killers were husbands or boyfriends. And as you've probably heard, a gun in your home is many times more likely to be used to kill one of the people in that home, be used in a suicide, or result in an accidental death than it is to be wielded against an intruder. What gun advocates say is that we all need to put ourselves and our families in danger to prepare for the home invasion that is the equivalent of being struck by lightning. According to the FBI, in the entire country in 2011 there were just 201 justifiable homicides committed with guns by private citizens. There are over 300 million guns in America, which means that about 1 out of every 1.5 million guns was actually used for lethal self-defense. According to the National Weather Service, your chance of being hit by lightning this year is a mere 1 in 1 million. Opinion: Americans, even NRA members, want gun controls . Nevertheless, people still have the right to own as many guns as they want. What we're debating is which kind of guns they can get and what procedures they'll have to follow to get them. Perhaps Gayle Trotter believes that having a few handguns and rifles just isn't enough to protect herself; she needs the kind of weaponry that Seal Team Six carries if she's going to feel secure in her home. That could be what Nancy Lanza thought as she amassed the arsenal her son Adam would use to commit his horrific crime in Newtown. That may seem like an inflammatory comparison -- after all, what are the odds that someone in your family is going to go crazy and kill a bunch of people? Perhaps lower than the odds of a heavily armed band of escaped convicts invading your home. But not by much. Let's have one final dose of reality, the story of Hadiya Pendleton. A 15-year-old honors student from Chicago, she recenlty performed with her school's band at President Barack Obama's inauguration. Four years ago, as an elementary school student, she appeared in a public service video imploring kids to stay away from gangs and violence. This Tuesday, she was in a park with friends when someone came up and started shooting. She was shot in the back and died at a local hospital. Hadiya Pendleton's tragic death wasn't someone's paranoid fantasy, and it wasn't lighting striking. It was one of the many real faces of gun violence in America today. She had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was a tragically common place to be. Just since the Newtown massacre, 1,463 Americans have been killed with guns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: OK if I drive around with a machine gun on my roof? I live in dangerous city .

"(CNN) -- As more and more celebrities sign up for a day at the races, a growing list are taking their passion for the sport one step further and becoming racehorse owners. From Hollywood directors such as Steven Spielberg to English Premier League soccer stars like Wayne Rooney, the lure of playing a bigger part in race day has led to many putting money into the development of one particular horse or even into the breeding of a whole group. Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood has a stud farm in the Republic of Ireland and even 1990s pop icon MC Hammer has been the proud owner of a Kentucky Derby entrant. Royalty dominates the list of celebrity successes on the track, with the United Arab Emirates-based Godolphin stable owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum turning out 200 winners a year, netting nearly $17 million in prize funds. And while other celebrity owners are not as prolific in the winning stakes, many do see it as a future business and a serious investment of their time and money. English soccer player Michael Owen is already co-owner in a stable which has trained many UK race winners -- including those owned by his former Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney. United's manager Alex Ferguson is also a racehorse owner. A former top-flight English footballer, Mick Channon, is now more renowned for training horses than he is for his achievements in a Southampton and England football shirt.

"(CNN) -- On Thursday morning, iLounge released mockups of what it says the next iPhone is going to look like, according to the site's own unnamed sources. The main differences in appearance between the next iPhone and the current iPhone 4S? A metal back, a smaller dock connector, a 20 percent decrease in thickness, and a longer 4-inch display. Concept designs for future iPhones are a dime a dozen and usually look like something Syd Mead might have slapped together after a glue-induced aneurysm. But iLounge's concept looks pretty good. It may not prove to be an accurate prediction in the end, but it's a sensible proposal. The most obvious change in iLounge's mockup is the 4-inch screen. That's a big bump, as the iPhone's display has stayed at 3.5 inches with a 3:2 aspect ratio since 2007. Why in the world would Apple change it now? It all comes down to LTE. LTE radios take up more room in a smartphone than 3G radios and use more power. To put LTE capabilities in the next iPhone, you need to make room not just for the radio, but find enough juice to power it without significantly decreasing battery life. The problem is there's just not a lot of room inside an iPhone for anything more than is already there. An iPhone is a densely packed sandwich of silicon, radios, flash storage, motors and cameras. Over the past five generations, Apple has packed in everything that makes up an iPhone about as densely as possible, and the battery still makes up the bulk of every device. If it's going to fit anything else, Apple needs to make more room. That's one reason why iLounge is saying Apple will be ditching its current dock connector for a micro-sized version: Space saved in this area is space Apple can stuff with a larger battery or make for a bigger LTE chipset. But it's also a reason why Apple would make the display bigger. There's been a lot of talk over the last couple of years that with the iPhone 5, Apple would bump the display up to a larger four inches, but the rumor's always had a lot of problems. Increasing the iPhone's display while maintaining its current 3:2 aspect ratio would make the device wider in the hand and harder to operate one-handed. It would also either decrease the pixel density of the iPhone's Retina display, making it less ""retina-ey"" and more jaggy to the eyes, or require more pixels per inch to compensate, causing iPhone developers to design their apps for multiple resolutions (the exact same kind of fragmentation problem that's bitten Android on its ass). No good. That's why conventional wisdom (until a couple months ago) was that Apple would keep a 3.5-inch display and eschew LTE until the radios were sufficiently small and power-efficient to fit into the current iPhone's form factor. But with the new iPad's WiFi + 4G release, Apple has made it abundantly clear that it is finally ready to embrace LTE. And the way the company is going to do it is by making the iPhone's display longer, but not wider. This theory was first floated over on The Verge, then gained traction when Daring Fireball's John Gruber hinted that the person who had initially suggested it might just work for Apple, and know what direction the next iPhone would go. It's got a lot to recommend it. By ditching a 3:2 aspect ratio in favor of a 9:5 display, the new iPhone would feel about the same in the hand as the iPhone 4S, retain its current 326ppi resolution, and allow Apple room for an LTE chip and more battery. Apps could either be easily updated to support the new iPhone's 4-inch display without breaking compatibility with 3.5-inch devices, or run in a letterbox without modification at their existing resolution. There are other perks. Lengthening the display allows the iPhone in landscape view to show 16:9 videos without the ugly bars on either side. It gives game developers more room for on-screen controls, like virtual buttons and thumbsticks, without a gamer's fingers obscuring what's on the display. And so on. Only Apple knows for sure what the next iPhone will look like, but iLounge's concept isn't necessarily all wet. Putting the display on a stretching rack might be the key to getting an LTE iPhone this year. And if you think Cupertino would never mess around with an iDevice's aspect ratio like this, might I introduce you to our good schizophrenic friend, the iPod nano?

"Washington (CNN) -- Gen. John Allen, the former leader of coalition forces in Afghanistan who was nominated to become supreme allied commander of NATO, is retiring instead of continuing to pursue the post, President Barack Obama announced Tuesday. Allen informed Obama that he will leave the service rather than move forward with the nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, a White House statement said. ""I met with General John Allen and accepted his request to retire from the military so that he can address health issues within his family,"" Obama said. In a statement later Tuesday, Allen said his reasons for retiring were personal. ""While I won't go into the details, my primary concern is for the health of my wife, who has sacrificed so much for so long. For more than 35 years, my beloved Kathy has devotedly stood beside me and enabled me to serve my country. ""It is profoundly sobering to consider how much of that time I have spent away from her and our two precious daughters. It is now my turn to stand beside them, to be there for them when they need me most,"" he said. Allen, a Marine Corps general, was the top coalition commander in Afghanistan for nearly two years. He relinquished that command earlier this month after planning the end of the mission's combat operations. However, Allen was caught up in a scandal over embarrassing e-mails with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley that came to the public's attention during the same investigation that brought down former CIA Director David Petraeus. CNN previously reported that Defense Department officials said there was inappropriate language in those e-mails, but no evidence of an affair between Allen and Kelley. Allen's nomination for the NATO commander post was put on hold while the Pentagon's inspector general looked into the issue. He was cleared of wrongdoing after several months and the White House initially indicated Obama would proceed with the nomination. On Tuesday, Obama called the general one of America's finest military leaders. Allen ""presided over the significant growth in the size and capability of Afghan National Security Forces, the further degradation of al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and the ongoing transition to Afghan security responsibility across the country,"" Obama said in the statement. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in a statement on Tuesday that Allen's leadership in Afghanistan ""will be long remembered as pivotal"" to the mission. ""The strategy he developed and implemented has put us on the right path towards completing this mission, with Afghan forces now on track to step into the lead for security nationwide this spring and to assume full security responsibility by the end of next year,"" Panetta said. Panetta, who also is stepping down, previously acknowledged that Allen has ""been under a tremendous amount of pressure,"" and advised him to take his time in deciding whether to continue pursuing the NATO commander position. In July 2011, Allen succeeded Petraeus to inherit the largest-ever NATO force in Afghanistan and spent 19 months directing his forces against Taliban insurgents and preparing for the first phases of a hand-over of provincial security to local and national forces. About 150,000 ISAF members were deployed at that time, including just under 100,000 U.S. troops. There are 66,000 U.S. service members currently deployed to the region, and Obama announced last week his intention to bring home 34,000 of them within a year. Less than a month after he assumed command, the United States suffered its deadliest single attack of the Afghan war when insurgents downed a CH-47 Chinook helicopter in Wardak province, killing 30 U.S. service members. The toll included 22 Navy SEALs. Allen later faced additional diplomatic crises that followed controversial incidents that included the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. service members, U.S. airstrikes that resulted in civilian deaths and the killing of 16 civilians in a massacre allegedly carried out by a U.S. service member. An uptick in ""green-on-blue"" attacks -- in which Afghan forces or trainees turn their weapons against U.S. counterparts -- is also believed to have hampered the training of Afghan forces and contributed to increased public discontent at home over American deployment to the region. A graduate of Georgetown University and the National War College, Allen also drew distinction for his counterinsurgency work in Iraq, particularly in the country's volatile Anbar province in 2008, where he helped isolate a growing insurgency. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Allen says he is retiring due to concern about his wife's health .

"(CNN) -- It has all the trappings of a trashy romance novel: a flamboyant billionaire media tycoon enthralled by a leggy Moroccan exotic dancer nicknamed ""Ruby Heartbreaker."" But this is real life, and the sex scandal involving former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and the dancer, Karima El Mahroug, has been a tabloid headline writer's dream. Read more: Berlusconi's 'bunga bunga' women testify at his trial . The now-76-year-old Berlusconi is accused of having sex 13 times with El Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17, which normally wouldn't be a problem since the age of consent in Italy is 14. But sex with a prostitute under 18 is a crime there. El Mahroug was expected to take the stand Monday in Berlusconi's trial on charges that he hired her for sex and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft. But while Berlusconi has said that both allegations are attempts to smear him, members of his defense team declined to question El Mahroug when she appeared in court Monday, and they told her she could leave. After El Mahroug left the courtroom, the prosecutor asked the court to use her testimony from the investigation period as evidence instead. Berlusconi lawyer Nicolo Ghedini told reporters that his team decided not to interrogate El Mahroug because of worries that any responses or debate in court could cause tension during the hotly contested campaign leading up to Italy's national elections next month. Read more: Berlusconi under fire for controversial comments about Italy . The performer, who has since appeared scantily clad in photographs across the country, told the Italian news channel Sky TG24 about two years ago that she had lied about her age before meeting Berlusconi for a dinner party at his private residence near Milan. ""He knew that I was 24 years old because I told everyone that I was 24 years old,"" El Mahroug said. ""I didn't want people to know that I was a minor."" It was during that first encounter on Valentine's Day in 2010 that she said she received 7,000 euros (about $9,375) after a friend informed Berlusconi that she needed help. Berlusconi: Italy's most colorful, controversial public figure . Both have denied allegations of having sex. ""Absolutely no,"" El Mahroug said. ""I just arrived in Milan, and it was a little difficult living there,"" and Berlusconi gave her the money to help support herself financially, she said. The friend ""spoke with (Berlusconi) and explained my situation, my story, my family situation,"" she said. ""And he helped me."" Investigators say they later questioned the dancer's former roommate, who claimed El Mahroug had confided in her, describing the details of her sexual relationship with the Italian premier. 'Bunga bunga' parties . In addition to the charges against Berlusconi, three of his associates are accused of selecting up to 33 young women, including El Mahroug, to attend so-called bunga bunga parties at Berlusconi's house, where the women would perform erotic dances before the prime minister chose one to spend the night with. Read more: Prosecutors: Businessman got women for Berlusconi . Berlusconi, who served three times as Italy's prime minister, laughed off the allegations in a 2011 interview with a leading Italian newspaper. ""I'm 75, and even if I'm a bit mischievous, 33 girls in two months is too much even for someone who is 30,"" the daily La Repubblica quoted him as saying. Just to keep things interesting, last month, on an Italian talk show, the former prime minister announced plans to marry a television showgirl-turned-politician a half-century younger. Francesca Pascale, 27, is ""a girl who is beautiful on the outside, but even more beautiful on the inside,"" Berlusconi said. Planning a comeback . In recent months, Berlusconi has been plotting his political resurrection, agreeing to an electoral pact with the right-wing Northern League. It's a development that could lead to no outright winner in the country's parliamentary elections in February. Opinion: What does Silvio's return mean for Italy? Berlusconi's defense team asked the court Monday to suspend the trial until after the election because Berlusconi is busy with the campaign and is not able to attend. The prosecutor called the request politically motivated. The latest opinion polls show Berlusconi's party and the Northern League gaining ground on the center-left coalition, but still trailing. He said that in the event of their victory he could be willing to serve as finance minister, and he proposed Angelino Alfano, his party secretary, as prime minister. However, Berlusconi could conceivably become prime minister for a fourth time. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 21. Then, the judge will announce his decision on the defense's request to call more witnesses, including two international celebrities: American actor George Clooney and Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Berlusconi, a billionaire media tycoon, has survived scandal before. He has been accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery over his career, but a tax evasion case marked the first time he was convicted of an offense. In October, a Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to four years in prison for tax evasion. However, under the Italian legal system, he and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court. Also, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire this year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. CNN's Hada Messia and Livia Borghese contributed to this report from Rome; Mark Morgenstein updated it from Atlanta.","NEW: Former Italian PM's attorney has chosen not to call exotic dancer as a witness .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Traversing Mexico's highways as a bus driver has always been a dangerous job, says Enrique, whose route takes him from central Mexico to Tamaulipas, on the border with the United States. ""But never like now, that I can assure you,"" said Enrique, who has been a driver for three years. His view coincided with other bus drivers who spoke with CNNMexico, who drive through drug cartel territory, and asked for anonymity because of fear of retribution for speaking on the record. Assaults, armed men, crossfire, bodies or human heads on the side of the road, form part of the daily stories that drivers have told each other in the past two years. It is a reality that came to light with the discovery last month of mass graves in the town of San Fernando, Tamaulipas, that possibly contained the bodies of kidnapped bus passengers. In addition to the development of kidnappings and assaults of passengers, bus drivers are extorted so that they may transit freely on the highways. ""In some places these people (drug cartels) ask for money in exchange for our security. ...They ask us for money to supposedly travel safely on the roads,"" said another bus driver. How much money do they demand? ""From 200 to 1,000 pesos ($17-$87)."" What guarantees are there that with that they will leave you alone? ""There is no guarantee, but there is nothing we can do when they arrive with a gun, intimidate you, and tell you they belong to this or that criminal group."" ""Suddenly, on the street, they watch us, they arrive in trucks, it's easy to recognize us because of the uniform,"" the driver continued. ""They approach and say, 'I come from this place and belong to this group. We are asking for your cooperation, or else there will be problems -- consequences."" Carlos, a bus driver with 10 years of experience, said that in his travels through Tamaulipas, he has been witness to armed confrontations between police and traffickers, and in more than one occasion has seen bodies strewn or mutilated on the highways. One time, he had to maneuver his bus to avoid running over two groups who were firing on each other right on the highway. ""I accelerated and dodged the bullets,"" Carlos said. ""The passengers were scared. Some cried, others prayed."" ""I almost ran over all of them because they passed by running. They didn't care about the size of the bus, or about who was on the highway, they crossed it in plain morning. We accelerated to avoid that a bullet would hit the bus,"" he added. In more than a decade of driving through the Tamaulipas cities of Reynosa, Matamoros, Ciudad Victoria and even San Fernando, Carlos said that he has never seen anything like what he has witnessed in the past months. ""Not even when we had to cross the mountains. Now, not even the highways are safe,"" he said. Another driver, referring to the kidnapping and apparent killing of bus passengers in San Fernando, said, ""We had been witnesses to the violence in the country. Today we are protagonists. It touched us, they reached us."" Government analysts and the country's National Human Rights Commission, posit that Tamaulipas, like other northern states, two phenomena have converged and resulted in the recent violence: drug trafficking and migration. The drivers interviewed agreed that the routes in the north part of the country have become desirable for criminals because a majority of the bus passengers are migrants destined for the United States. ""(These are) people who are carrying money or who comes from (the United States) with dollars and gifts for their families,"" the driver says. According to the human rights commission, last year more than 11,000 migrants were kidnapped in Mexico during their journeys to the United States. And, according to the National Security System, in 2010 there were 2,142 robberies on highways in all of Mexico. States like Michoacan and Tamaulipas went from having zero highway assaults last year to 11 and 28, respectively, so far this year. ""There were always assaults on the highways, but they were sporadic and another type of crime. They were people dedicated to robbery, but not drug trafficking,"" said another bus driver, who identified himself as Rafael. ""We can't explain what is happening. We suppose that it is the reaction of organized crime to the job the government is doing to eliminate them, but at the same time we see a lot of corruption among the police,"" he said. "" The cities of Matamoros, Reynosa and Laredo, in the northeast of the country, are the considered the most dangerous routes. Asked if they want to continue traveling north, a bus driver answers that, ""for necessity, for work, by orders, but it is unsafe. In a tone of jest they ask us if we are carrying our bulletproof vest and helmet. Once someone tells you that, you start thinking, 'I hope nothing goes wrong.'""","Buses traveling through northeast Mexico face dangerous situations .

"Denver (CNN) -- For 106 years, cowboys and cattlemen have been coming from around the West to Denver for the annual National Western Stock Show. It's part state fair, part rodeo and all American. At night there is professional rodeo, but during the day hundreds of ranchers of all ages bring their best cows and bulls for judging. On the line is a blue ribbon and bragging rights. The sprawling backstage area in the bowels of the building echoes with the din of commercial-strength blow dryers as cow after cow is shuttled though the makeshift bovine beauty parlor before being led into the ring. Upstairs the cowboys and cowgirls mosey around vendors hawking boots, buckles and hats. They mingle with the fleece-clad Denverites and chat amongst themselves about grain prices, drought and yes, Tim Tebow and the Broncos. The show kicked off last weekend and runs through January 22. Soon enough these cattle herders will be back on their ranches as winter bears down on the West. But for now it's warm and dry at the stock show, where cows and cowboys alike are the stars of the show.","The National Western Stock Show has taken place in Denver for over a century .

"(CNN) -- In summer 2010, Big Sky High School graduate and football star Glen Maricelli began a grueling 2,170-mile drive from Missoula, Montana, for a collegiate tryout in Marietta, Georgia. It was the farthest from home he had ever been. His goal was a chance to continue his athletic success. Four days later, he arrived in Georgia, exhausted. An hour after that, Maricelli was trying out for the Running Eagles squad, sprinting for fitness tests in the sweltering Georgia summer heat. Gasping for air and dripping with sweat, Maricelli couldn't be happier. ""When you're running those sprints, lifting those weights and running up hills, it sucks at the time,"" he said. ""But right when you're done, everyone is out of breath and looking all around, it's like 'yes, it was worth it. That was good.' "" A football running back known for scoring three touchdowns in a game, Maricelli discovered rugby in high school as a way to condition. Rather than rely on the controlling coaching aspect of football, rugby allowed Maricelli and his teammates to run the plays and run the game. The sport became his passion, so he put his football days behind him and looked for a college rugby program. Now a sophomore at Life University in Marietta, Maricelli plays for one of the top varsity rugby teams in the U.S. But for most colleges, rugby is considered at best a second-grade niche sport. Seventy-five miles to the east in Athens, Georgia, a true portrait of collegiate rugby versus collegiate football unfolds. Unlike the University of Georgia football team, with its sold-out stadium of more than 92,000 fans any given fall Saturday, UGA Rugby barely has 100 fans, although both teams collide with well-known Southeastern Conference rival schools. ""What happens is, the footprint of collegiate football in the South is monstrous. It takes the air out of the room,"" University of California head rugby coach Jack Clark said. ""Playing rugby is akin to a communist activity."" Yet behind the scenes, rugby serves an American passion for a worldwide sport. Finding a field . It's the simple act of stumbling upon a practice, catching a rare match on TV or tossing a rugby ball around that draws people away from the ingrained mentality of American football. Universities with big football traditions often offer rugby, but football's domination can make it hard for ""ruggers."" They set up at recreational sport fairs, speak at student group meetings and recruit from high school tournaments, but they can offer only rudimentary benefits. In the place of customized scooters, Nike team wear and logo-embossed gear, rugby players say they discover lasting friendships, passionate competition and the dynamics of a heavily skill-based game with a lifelong, global network. The recruits will have to pay for dues, travel expenses and jerseys, and they must practice three to five days a week. But first, they have to find a field. Although some of the big colleges like Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee have fields designated for club rugby, the UGA team classifies itself as a ""stepchild."" ""Historically, rugby players have been 'field gypsies,' "" said Rod Seddon, president of the Georgia Rugby Union. University of Georgia senior and criminal justice major Robert Thomas knows the struggles firsthand. One Thursday when he was 19, Thomas stepped on a rugby pitch for the first time. That Saturday, he played in his first match but had no idea what he was doing. ""Two weeks later, I don't know what it was, but right before the SEC Tournament, something clicked, and everything made sense,"" he said. Although Thomas had never played a team sport before, the camaraderie aspect drew him in immediately. ""It's driven to not just be a team on the field but off the field that I really like,"" Thomas said. ""We do everything as a team."" From field setup to team dinners, it's not hard to spot the UGA ruggers on campus. They're always together. On a Wednesday night downtown, people sometimes ask what they're celebrating. The teammates respond that it's Wednesday, and they're just hanging out, as usual. Cameron Nizdil, a 20-year-old sophomore from Moorpark, California, was offered a walk-on spot on UGA's track and field team. Running is in his genes, but Nizdil turned down the opportunity and pursued rugby instead. ""Rugby had the better social environment,"" Nizdil said. ""It was the best decision ever."" Anatomy of a team . Collegiate rugby teams often comprise powerful athletes, football and basketball players who entertained rugby as a third sport in high school. The athletes require ""a real melting pot of skills and a portfolio of body types,"" Clark said. From towering players built like oak trees to shorter, nimble sprinters, physicality is expected. Each one has the chance to sprint, pass and tackle, and a successful tackle won't stop the action. There is no quarterback or wide receiver. ""Unlike football, we don't want guys to travel for a weekend just to sit on the sidelines,"" said Rene Daniel, a rugby coach at Georgia Tech. With no pads or helmets to cushion the rough blows, players also have to learn how to use their bodies without causing serious injury. Few timeouts, limited substitutions and the possibility of five or six matches in a single tournament force them to be in top form. It is a rapid, bruising contest that crashes muscle against muscle and challenges mental and physical technique over pure power. ""I love football, so I went out to play rugby in college, and it was a big change, but it was addictive,"" said Willie Washington, a UGA senior. ""I like the challenge of it. In football, you get the ball, and people can block for you. In rugby, it's you against seven or 15 other guys. You've really got to think and be smart with the ball."" Blaine Scully graduated from high school as a three-sport, All-American athlete. A natural, he excelled at basketball, water polo and swimming. In June, the recent University of California-Berkeley graduate helped the national rugby team, the USA Eagles, defeat Russia for the Churchill Cup Bowl, an annual rugby union tournament leading up to the World Cup. Scully discovered rugby in college under the tutelage of American rugby legend Jack Clark, head coach of the Golden Bears. Clark has had to fight hard to preserve the rugby tradition but says it is often one of the five most-attended sports out of 29 at the university. ""What I know is that rugby positively changes lives. Everyone that plays the sport is willing to pay it forward,"" Clark said. ""I had a player tell me after the season was over, 'Coach, this was the hardest thing I've ever done that I wouldn't trade for anything,' and I said, 'Well, that about sums it up, son.' "" Getting into the game . Collegiate club teams usually begin their season in the fall with a month of training to orient the ""new guys,"" whether it is freshmen or those new to rugby in general. One of the biggest challenges: teaching guys to pass the ball laterally or backwards, only, and still score. It creates a culture of teamwork -- ""the most team-oriented team sport,"" Thomas said. ""When you have to give up five days a week and some weekends when you're traveling, it becomes a job, essentially, but a job that one loves,"" Georgia Rugby Union secretary Nicholas Burgess said. It showcases the volunteer nature of rugby: There are few paid positions related to the sport in the entire U.S. Rugby is a true battle on the field, from the bloodied players who forge on without stopping to the one missed tackle that can cost the game in a breathless contest. Afterward, the home team hosts a social for the visiting team, no matter who wins. They even put up the out-of-town players in their homes. It is a game driven by respect, because each player knows what another has gone through to be on the field. ""Of course it sucks to lose, especially at home,"" Thomas said.

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of being part of a major soccer match-fixing organization has given himself up to Italian police after being a fugitive since December 2011. Admir Suljic, a former football player, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport Thursday following his arrival from Singapore, having told authorities he would do so via his defense lawyer. The 31-year-old Slovenian has been accused of direct involvement in a transnational criminal group said to be composed of individuals from Singapore and the Balkans which had been targeted by the ""Last Bet"" investigation. Authorities said the group's activities included influencing the results of Italian league matches during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons. Investigations into this have targeted top clubs such as Napoli, and involved a raid on the Italy team headquarters ahead of Euro 2012. ""This is exactly the type of result which can be achieved when police share information in real time and use Interpol's global network to locate, identify and arrest suspects,"" said the head of the worldwide policing agency, Ronald Noble. ""The arrest of this suspected match-fixer could not have been achieved without Italy and Singapore's close cooperation with Interpol, nor without a great deal of behind-the-scenes work by prosecutors and magistrates. ""Those who doubted Singapore's ability or commitment to fight match-fixing and bring those wanted for arrest to justice need to understand that Singapore acts when the evidence exists and is shared and when their laws permit. Singapore and Italy remain two of Interpol's most active and effective member countries."" Interpol said Suljic was one of more than 500 fugitives wanted by 59 member countries as part of 2012 Operation Infra-Red -- which has so far led to 130 people being arrested or located. He is suspected of working for Singaporean businessman Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, who is also wanted by Italian authorities. Italian police said Suljic had ""spent a long period of inaction in Singapore in close contact with other members of the group of this organization, including a well-known Singaporean citizen."" Meanwhile, Singapore police said Thursday that four senior officers will go to Interpol's French headquarters in Lyon during the next fortnight to assist in match-fixing investigations. The force said it hoped to help build ""a concrete case"" against the individuals and syndicates involved. ""The team aims to collect available information from these countries and seek their assistance to grant us access to evidence, witnesses and/or suspects whom they believe to be involved in the alleged match-fixing cases,"" read a statement. ""The team will also be exploring avenues to offer our assistance and share available information we have with these affected countries."" Match-fixing has been described as a ""disease"" afflicting football by the secretary general of world governing body FIFA. On Tuesday, Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua was stripped of its 2003 domestic league title and fined $160,000 after a crackdown against such activities. It was one of 12 clubs involved, along with 33 individuals. Four former China internationals and an ex-World Cup referee were banned for life, having been jailed a year ago for the same offenses. Interpol's European equivalent Europol has also revealed that 380 matches on the continent are under investigation, including top-level Champions League games. The international players' union FIFPro said in December that it is planning to launch an online match-fixing ""hotline"" for its members. On Wednesday, the acting president of the Asian Football Confederation highlighted the need to eliminate match-fixing from the game. ""We need to admit that match-fixing is a real danger to football's ethical values and needs to be eliminated to preserve the sanctity of the sport,"" Zhang Jilong told delegates at the Interpol conference in Kuala Lumpur. ""Match-fixing is too complex and widespread for one organization to fight it alone. To fight this, we need a joint and coordinated effort."" Interpol official Dale Sheehan highlighted the social costs of match-fixing. ""Criminals can make millions in illicit profits from match-fixing with little risk of being detected and will exploit every opportunity,"" he said at the conference. ""Sports and fair play are the very fabric of our society and youth, and the impact of match-fixing -- including murder, suicide, assault and threats -- has the ability to undermine that very fabric.""","Match-fixing suspect arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Two people are missing and at least 14 people were injured when a gas line in Kansas City, Missouri, exploded and ignited a four-alarm fire, officials said Tuesday night. The explosion apparently leveled JJ's restaurant, a popular spot in Country Club Plaza, an upscale shopping district and residential neighborhood that is a regional gathering place. James Garrett, a spokesman for the Kansas City Fire Department, said three people were unaccounted for Tuesday night. Missouri Gas Energy said: ""Early indications are that a contractor doing underground work struck a natural gas line, but the investigation continues."" Mayor Sly James said the walls of the restaurant had collapsed. Dr. Leonardo Lozada, the chief physician at St Luke's Health Systems, said he heard the explosion at the hospital, which is a block and a half from the restaurant. ""Yes, it was pretty loud. I just heard it; it wasn't that traumatic,"" he said, adding that some people told him they saw the roof blow off. Officials at three hospitals indicated at least 14 people were hospitalized, including three in critical condition and three in serious condition. The number of injured had dropped from previous reports because there was ""a lot of confusion with people coming into the emergency room."" Lozada told CNN. Two patients are in critical condition at St. Luke's Hospital, said Dr. Marc Larsen. One of the patients suffered extensive burns; the other facial trauma, he said. Most of the five other patients suffered minor lacerations or inhalation injuries, he said. Lozardo said one man had burns to ""40% percent of his body, mostly to his lower extremities."" Garrett said here were no fatalities at the scene, but two of those hurt had life-threatening injuries. About 100 fire fighters fought the fire before it was put out, fire chief Paul Berardi said. When the first fire trucks arrived the restaurant was fully involved with a few people inside, he said. Witness says man told her to leave restaurant . One witness told CNN affiliate KSHB a man who had a hand-held device came into the restaurant before the blast and told her and 10 others in JJ's to leave. Jennifer Carter told the station that restaurant workers already had turned off the appliances because people inside had smelled gas. She said she left when told and was a few blocks away when she heard the explosion. Garrett confirmed that workers from Missouri Gas Energy were ""on the scene"" before the explosion. Residents who live near JJ's said they reported smelling gas to the utility company about an hour before the explosion, according to CNN affiliate KCTV. The explosion shook doors and windows at nearby businesses and homes, the station reported. James, who came to the scene from his office, said his primary focus was the victims. ""That's the main concern, making sure they come out OK,"" he said. Garrett said gas lines have been shut off. ""People are still not allowed back into the plaza,"" he said. ""I don't know when it will reopen -- hopefully tonight."" CNN's Carma Hassan and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","NEW: Utility company said it appears contractor struck a gas line .

"(CNN) -- Quentin Tarantino has made a spaghetti western and cross-pollinated it with a blaxploitation picture, but it's fully formed, unapologetic and easily one of the best popcorn flicks of the year. I'll go further: It's my favorite American movie of the past 12 months. Before we get to the why, a quick outline of what's in store: ""Inglourious Basterds"" standout Christoph Waltz plays a bounty hunter masquerading as a dentist (the wagon he drives has a giant molar wobbling on the roof). Although he's German by birth, he speaks such florid English most of the Americans he encounters have trouble keeping up. His name is Schultz, but he goes by the more distinguished (and resonant) Dr. King. Dr. King is tracking a gang of outlaw brothers, and he enlists the aid of a slave who knows them by sight. This would be Django (Jamie Foxx), who starts the movie as a piece of property but becomes Dr. King's business partner and ally. Django eventually takes the upper hand, as the pair trespasses onto the notorious Candyland, the plantation where Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), serves Southern aristocrat and sadist Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Notorious B.I.G. helped Jamie Foxx get in 'Django' character . It's a typical, even quintessential Tarantino gambit: to take two defunct, disreputable genres, dust them off and mash them together. It's what he does: sniff out the nitro and introduce the glycerin. Lately, in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and again here, he's added historical flashpoints to the mix for a little extra flare -- and upset those commentators who believe that appropriating history (Nazism, slavery) for the purposes of entertainment automatically trivializes it. Not true. While Tarantino's morally challenging, emotionally wrenching films carve a different path from the sanctimonious costume dramas made to flatter middlebrow tastes -- and perhaps -- seduce awards voters, they are no less intellectually provocative for it. The comparison with ""Lincoln"" is irresistible -- the two films take place within five years of each other. One is grounded in assiduous historical research and offers a shrewd analysis of idealism and political pragmatism, while the other is pure fantasy. But it's the fantasy that truly rattles the chains of slavery, confronting not just the racist assumptions but also the economic power structure that underpinned it -- the paradoxes, hypocrisies and insidious evils that permitted the system to flourish for so long. Unlike ""Lincoln,"" ""Django Unchained"" affords room at the heart of its narrative for compelling and assertive African-American characters, both heroic (Foxx in the title role) and otherwise (Samuel L Jackson, memorably repellent as a house servant who has become his master's right hand and confidant). 'Django' cast debates: How does movie violence influence violence in real life? At a time when so many of our movies aspire to be colorblind (but ""urban"" film remains largely ghettoized), ""Django Unchained"" dares to confront racism as a potent force and a moving target, discovering horror and also grotesque comedy in the niceties of Southern etiquette: the way a white landowner can maintain a black mistress, for instance, or tolerate the grumbling of a loyal servant, just so long as everyone knows he will have his dogs tear a runaway limb from limb. That may be the film's true subject, when you get right down to brass tacks: the vacuity of good manners, and the limits of tolerance. Rambling but in a jaunty, generous, let's-shoot-the-works fashion, ""Django Unchained"" draws on dozens of westerns -- some of them American, others from Italy and Germany -- and includes a very funny travesty of the Ku Klux Klan that might have been an outtake from ""Blazing Saddles."" It doffs its hat in the direction of German mythology, and the soundtrack samples James Brown, 2Pac, Rick Ross, Ennio Morricone and John Legend in the process. It's a big, brazen movie, brilliantly acted across the board, one of the best things Tarantino has done.

"(CNN) -- Call it the Super Bowl MVP -- the most valuable power outage. For 35 bewildering minutes Sunday night, the Super Bowl showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers ground to a halt when half of the lights in the New Orleans Superdome went out. Players stretched on the field. The more than 71,000 fans in attendance did the wave. And with no immediate explanation for the outage, social media lit up. From Twitter to Facebook, from Tumblr to Flickr, it seemed just about everywhere in the social media-sphere somebody had something to say -- sometimes funny, sometimes not so much -- about what became known online as ""the blackout bowl."" There were even those who felt forced to say something about being, well, forced to say something. ""The worst part about this power outage is that people at parties were forced to talk to each other,"" Fortune Feimster, a writer for the E! show ""Chelsea Lately,"" tweeted. The brand bowl . Within four minutes of the outage, advertisers had sent out their first tweets. The funniest tweets of the Super Bowl . Nabisco's Oreo cookie was among the first to jump on the Twitter brandwagon, with an ad featuring the cookie on a partially blacked out page. ""You can still dunk in the dark,"" it read. The people behind Tide laundry detergent went up with a Twitter ad that read: ""We can't get your #blackout, but we can get your stains out. #SuperBowl #TidePower."" Even Audi took a swipe at its competitor, tweeting that it was sending ""LED lights"" over to the dome, whose official name is the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. In fact, the outage was the No. 1 Twitter-related moment of the Super Bowl, generating 231,000 tweets per minute. The second big moment? The 108-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Baltimore Ravens Jacoby Jones. But even that only generated merely 185,000 tweets per minute, according to the site. Momentum shift . New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu promised answers. ""In the coming days, I expect a full after action report from all parties involved."" The power company said it wasn't to blame, and stadium officials apologized but said little else until well after the game. And then, in a statement hours later, Superdome officials said a piece of equipment designed to monitor the electrical load ""sensed an abnormality in the system."" ""Once the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the Superdome in order to isolate the issue,"" the statement said. It still isn't clear what the ""abnormality"" was -- but more than a few people had their own suspicions. A majority on social media blamed it on the fans of the 49ers, who were trailing 28-to-6 in the third quarter before the blackout. Photos began quickly showing up on Flickr, Twitter and Facebook of the so-called hands of a 49ers' fan reaching into electrical power box to turn off the power, with the words: ""They not winning that easy."" Conspiracy, cried a Ravens fan on Facebook. ""If the 49ers win after this, you all know who's to blame."" Even Justin Timberlake had something to say about it, tweeting #momentumshift. There may be something to it. After the power was restored, the 49ers scored three times in just four minutes. Then again, maybe not. ""Whatever. Who hasn't blacked out in New Orleans,"" one person said on Twitter. Or in San Francisco, for that matter. In December 2011, the lights went out twice during the same game at Candlestick Park. The 49ers won that game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 20-3. Blame it on Bane . Some said it was the curse of the Superdome -- despite hosting seven Super Bowl games and its more than $300 million renovation following Hurricane Katrina. The stadium was built near a cemetery and New Orleans Saints fans have long said it was the reason the team had fared so poorly. Some on Twitter and Facebook joked Saints quarterback Drew Brees was responsible, pulling the power plug to get even for the team failing to make football's big show. Then there were those who pointed to Bane, the villain in the Batman movie ""The Dark Night Rises."" In the movie, Bane mines a football field in Pittsburgh that explodes after a great scoring run by Steeler Hines Ward. ""Investigation confirms not even Bane's power outage attempt can save the 49ers,"" said one Twitter user with the handle The Batman. Beyonce's wattage . The general consensus on social media appeared to be that Beyonce's high-wattage half-time performance was mostly likely to blame for the blackout. ""Beyonce blew the fuse! Genius!"" tweeted singer Adam Lambert. Matchbox Twenty guitarist Paul Doucette, who was at the game, tweeted a picture of the blackout. ""Beyonce left and apparently took electricity with her,"" he said.  ""Damn she's good."" In the end, the Ravens may have won Superbowl XLVII in New Orleans. But the power outage won its social media time slot. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The power outage at the Super Bowl turned into the #blackoutbowl .

"(EW.com) -- Bruce Willis' return as John McClane, A Good Day to Die Hard, topped the box office over the Friday-to-Sunday period, but with a weaker-than-expected $25 million. Fox's $92 million thriller, which also stars Jai Courtney, earned $8.2 million on Thursday, its first day of release, and after four days, it's earned $33.2 million. That's a substantially weaker start than 2007′s Live Free or Die Hard, which started with $33.4 million in its opening three-day weekend. Die Hard's middling performance isn't a total surprise. This has been a remarkably tough winter for male-driven action vehicles, many of which star members of The Expendables. Arnold Schwarznegger's $45 million entry The Last Stand has earned just $12 million after five weekends. Sylvester Stallone's Bullet to the Head, which reportedly cost $55 million, has only earned about $10 million after three. The Jason Statham thriller Parker cost about $35 million but has only grossed $17 million after nearly a month in theaters. The Mark Wahlberg/Russell Crowe shoot-em-up Broken City has languished with $19.5 million against a $35 million budget. (Meanwhile, 2013′s top four highest-grossing movies — Identity Thief, Mama, Warm Bodies, and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters — all feature women in leading roles.) Obviously, A Good Day to Die Hard has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops, though, and it shouldn't be written off as a misfire. The film's $7,036 per theater average from 3,553 theaters was strong, and with a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade, it may benefit from word-of-mouth in the weeks to come. Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend, and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard's $134.5 million finish, but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard's strong international performance so far. The film earned a tremendous $61.5 million overseas this weekend, bringing its international haul to $80.1 million and its worldwide cume to $113.4 million. Those overseas results may keep John McClane Yippee-Ki-Yaying for years to come. Last weekend's champ, Identity Thief, dipped only 32 percent to $23.4 million in its second weekend. The Melissa McCarthy/Jason Bateman laugher has now earned $70.7 million against a slim $35 million budget, and, for Universal, it's the latest in a hot-streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost (almost) make up for the fact that the studio spent $209 million on Battleship, which earned only $65.4 million, last year. With the exception of The Man with the Iron Fists, every Universal film since the fall has been a profitable venture: Pitch Perfect ($65 million vs. $17 million budget), This is 40 ($67.4 million vs. $35 million budget), Les Miserables ($145.5 million vs. $61 million budget), Mama ($68.3 million vs. $15 million budget), and now Identity Thief. Next up on the studio's plate? The surefire smash Fast & Furious 6. Close behind in third place, Relativity's $28 million Nicholas Sparks adaptation Safe Haven opened with $21.4 million. Including Valentine's Day grosses, the goopy romance, which stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel, has earned a solid $30.5 million. Relativity did a great job of marketing Safe Haven as the top choice for Valentine's Day couples, and the built-in cachet of Nicholas Sparks continues to prove irresistible for many moviegoers. Among all eight Sparks films, Safe Haven's $21.4 million frame trails the opening weekends of just Dear John ($30.5 million) and The Lucky One ($22.5 million), which finished with $80 million and $60.5 million, respectively. For star Hough, who's made the transition from Dancing with the Stars pro to fledgling country singer (remember?) to Hollywood leading lady, Safe Haven represents her best-ever opening weekend following underwhelming debuts from Burlesque ($11.9 million), Footloose ($15.6 million), and Rock of Ages ($14.6 million). She may carve out an acting career, yet. Like Die Hard, Safe Haven missed with critics, but earned a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, which were 71 percent female and 68 percent below the age of 25. Weinstein's animated effort Escape from Planet Earth benefited from the fact that no family films have hit theaters in almost two months and finished in fourth place with $16.1 million. Facing no family competition, Escape, which cost $40 million, fared better than Weinstein's last attempt to get into the animation game, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, which bombed with just $10.1 million in April 2011. Despite poor reviews, Escape from Planet Earth wound up with a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. Rounding out the Top 5 was Summit's Warm Bodies, which fell only 20 percent to $9 million, giving it a $50.2 million total. While the YA adaptation hasn't become the next Twilight, positive word-of-mouth has helped Warm Bodies, which cost about $35 million, avoid the steep drops that usually plague films aimed at teens. It could finish with about $65 million. Fellow YA tale Beautiful Creatures didn't earn such a Warm reception on its opening weekend. The witch-y tale bombed with only $7.5 million — $10 million including Valentine's Day grosses. Warner Bros. is distributing the film, which was financed for $60 million by Alcon Entertainment. Fortunately for the distributor, its other recent release, The Hobbit, is on pace to pass $300 million at the domestic box office on Monday. Audiences issued Beautiful Creatures a lukewarm ""B"" CinemaScore grade. 1. A Good Day to Die Hard -- $25 million ($33.2 million total) 2. Safe Haven -- $21.4 million ($30.5 million total) 3. Identity Thief -- $23.4 million ($70.7 million total) 4. Escape from Planet Earth -- $16.1 million ($16.1 million total) 5. Warm Bodies -- $9 million ($50.2 million total) 6.

"(CNN) -- NATO troops in Afghanistan have been ordered to halt some joint operations with Afghan security forces after a spate of attacks by their local allies and amid fallout from a controversial anti-Islam video. ""Most partnering and advising will now be at the battalion level and above,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. ""This does not mean there will be not partnering below that level. The need for that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."" But Carney stressed that the broader strategy of handing security over to local and national forces would continue and that the new policy will not effect NATO's planned withdrawal for 2014. ""In response to an increased threat situation as a result of the 'Innocence of Muslims' video, plus the recent insider attacks, ISAF forces are increasing their vigilance and carefully reviewing all activities and interactions with the local population,"" Maj. Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said earlier Tuesday. 4 NATO troops killed in 'insider' attack . ""We adjust our force protection measures based on the threat. If the threat level goes down, we could see a rolling back on this decision."" The ""Innocence of Muslims"" video, which was privately produced in the United States, mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. The U.S. government has condemned the video, which spurred deadly protests in several countries, including Afghanistan. On Tuesday, for example, an insurgent group carried out a suicide attack that killed 12 people, including eight foreigners in Kabul, saying it was in response to the film. The other factor behind the partial joint operations suspension is the number of ""green-on-blue"" attacks in the country. More than 50 coalition troops were killed between January and mid-August in instances where uniformed Afghans turned their guns on allied troops. Why asylum-seekers are fleeing Afghanistan . NATO's senior civilian representative in Afghanistan, Simon Gass called the need for the new policy a ""bump in the road,"" adding that ""people in all of our countries would expect us... to make sure that our soldiers are kept out of harms way as much as possible."" ""The circumstances in which we have reduced our partnership operations are not ideal by any means at all, they are not what we would have wanted,"" he said. ""Nor are they a great strategic set back."" On Monday, the Pentagon said that NATO commander Marine Gen. John Allen had ordered commanders ""to review force protection and tactical activities."" ""While some partnered operations are temporarily suspended, many continue, and regional commanders have the authority to approve more,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said. Allen's guidance was given at the recommendation of key Afghan leaders, Hodge said. ""This will likely lead to adjustments in exactly how, when and where ISAF troops operate, especially during the current period of heightened tension,"" she said. British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday that, ""There has been no change of policy in Afghanistan"" for British forces. Speaking to the House of Commons, Hammond cited a press release issued by the ISAF commander saying ""some prudent, but temporary, measures to reduce our profile and vulnerability to civil disturbances or insider attacks"" have been put into place. Hammond echoed Carney's statement from the White House, saying ""partnering and advising"" would take place at the battalion level and above. ""The change does not mean that where will be no partnering below that level. The need for that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and approved by the regional commanders,"" Hammond added. Over the weekend, four Americans and two British troops were gunned down in attacks believed to involve Afghan police. In addition, insurgents disguised in U.S. Army uniforms launched a coordinated assault Friday at the joint American-British base Camp Bastion, raising concerns that the attackers had inside knowledge. That attack killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six AV-8B Harrier jets, international forces said. Camp Bastion is also where Britain's Prince Harry is based. Harry was taken to a secure position after the perimeter at Bastion had been breached, British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC. How insurgents entered Prince Harry's base . U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday that he is ""very concerned"" about insider attacks. ""This is an approach that the Taliban is resorting to, similar to the use of (improvised explosive devices),"" Panetta said. ""We think, very frankly, that it is kind of a last-gasp effort to be able to not only target our forces but to try to create chaos because they have been unable to regain any of the territory that they have lost."" The halt in some joint operations with Afghan forces comes weeks after U.S. Special Operations forces suspended the training of some Afghan Local Police recruits while it double-checks the background of the current police force. ""Green-on-blue"" refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force and green refers to allied forces. The spate of green-on-blue attacks comes as American and NATO troops are training Afghan soldiers and police to maintain security within the country ahead of the planned end of allied combat operations in 2014. It's unclear what impact, if any, the earlier suspension in training and the temporary halt of some joint operations will have on the timetable to withdraw.

An earlier Pentagon review that said that about 10% were by Taliban forces that had sneaked into Afghan military and police ranks. ""It's less about the precision of 25 versus 10 than it is acknowledging that the Taliban are seeking ultimately to have some impact in the formation,"" Allen said.

"(CNN) -- The chilling acts the 15-year-old boy is accused of defy imagination: . Pumping his mother, brother and two younger sisters with bullets. Gunning down his dad when he returned home. Texting a picture of his lifeless mother to his 12-year-old girlfriend. Plotting to kill strangers outside a supermarket. But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster. They can't fathom what could have gone so terribly wrong. ""Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue, we can't be sure yet,"" his uncle, former New Mexico state Sen. Eric Griego, said. ""What we do know is that none of us, even in our wildest nightmare, could have imagined that he could do something like this."" The family statement describes the boy as a gifted athlete and musician who was active in youth services at church. It said the teen accompanied his father on mission trips to Mexico and wanted to continue a long family history of military service by becoming a soldier. The family disputed any media characterization that the teen was a loner and said he had many friends and was a wrestler in state tournaments. His father was a champion wrestler and coach. The family also said they did not want anyone to use the case in the nation's unfolding debate about guns. ""To be clear, our family has differing views on gun rights and gun control. What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case,"" the family statement said. ""We ask those in the media and those who would use the media to make their political case, to not use Nehemiah as a pawn for ratings or to score political points. He is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever."" But authorities painted a far different picture of the teen. Sheriff: Teen planned shootings for at least a week . Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston said Griego was ""involved heavily"" with violent video games and that he ""was quite excited as he got the opportunity to discuss that with our investigators."" He said that the boy planned the shootings for at least a week. That he told investigators he was frustrated with his mother. That he contemplated killing his girlfriend's parents. That he hoped to continue his killing spree at a Walmart ""with mass destruction"" and die in a shootout with police. The teen's demeanor, as he shared all this, was ""stern, very unemotional,"" Houston said. Now, Griego will stand trial as an adult in the weekend killings, prosecutors announced. He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque. Opinion: How a boy becomes a killer . The tragedy unfolds . The tragedy unfolded early Saturday morning, when Griego carried a .22-caliber rifle to where his mother and 9-year-old brother slept side by side, an arrest affidavit said. The teen fatally shot his mother, waking his younger brother Zephania in the process. When Griego told Zephania that their mother was dead, the younger boy did not believe him, the document stated. ""So Nehemiah picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face,"" the affidavit said. ""Nehemiah stated his brother became upset, so he shot his brother in the head with the same rifle used to kill his mother."" After that, police said, ""Nehemiah stated he lost his sense of conscience."" The boy went on to kill his sisters, 5-year-old Jael and 2-year-old Angelina, before his father Greg came home from a volunteer graveyard shift at a homeless shelter. Authorities believe the father, a former pastor at an Albuquerque church and a chaplain to the city's fire department, was the last to be gunned down in the home. KRQE: Security officer -- Boy was a 'great kid' 'Beyond any human reasoning' Most of the victims were shot with the .22, but a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle was also used in the killings, sheriff's Lt. Sid Covington said. Authorities said the weapons appear to have been purchased legally. The Griegos also had five grown children, none of whom lived at home, Covington said. After the slayings, Griego ""spent the majority of the day with his girlfriend,"" Houston said. He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said. Authorities arrested the teen after he attended his family's church with his girlfriend, and a staff member called deputies. Pastor Skip Heitzig said father Greg Griego was also a pastor for a number of years who did prison ministry at the Metropolitan Detention Center and helped to rehabilitate convicts. Greg Griego also helped them re-enter society. ""The news stunned us all,"" Heitzig said of the shooting. ""We are doing what we can as a church body to minister to the remaining family members. Only the Lord Jesus Christ can heal this type of pain and heartache, and He is faithful to do so,"" he added in a statement. His church, Calvary Albuquerque, is scheduled to hold a prayer vigil Wednesday at 7 p.m. for the Griego family. Griego was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death, but the hearing was waived, CNN affiliate KOAT reported. The affiliate said Griego's case will go to a grand jury within 10 days. ""This is beyond any human reasoning or understanding at this time,"" the sheriff said.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the circumstances surrounding the release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbasset al-Megrahi from a Scottish prison last year. The Scottish government released al-Megrahi just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months. Al-Megrahi is the only person convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Most of the dead were Americans. The flight was heading to New York from Frankfurt, Germany, via London, England, when it blew up. A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al-Megrahi in 2001. Al-Megrahi is ""a very sick man,"" but there is no way to tell how long he will live, according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, said earlier this month that he recently saw al-Megrahi in Libya. Swire criticized U.S. senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of al-Megrahi. He said he had written to them to say it was more important to let Scottish legal proceedings run their course, because a review commission had found possible miscarriages of justice in the case. ""They didn't want to know about that,"" he said of the senators. Swire, who said he does not think that al-Megrahi is guilty, defended the decision. ""At three months, just over half [of people with his cancer] would be dead,"" Swire said. Doctors have said al-Megrahi has terminal prostate cancer. But after three months, mortality rates level off, and there is no way to predict how long cancer patients will live, said Swire, a retired general practitioner. ""He can walk a few steps,"" Swire said of al-Megrahi. He did not ask al-Megrahi or his doctors about the Libyan's medical condition out of respect for his privacy, he said. But he said the fullness of his face suggested that he was on steroids to slow the cancer. Al-Megrahi was appealing his conviction when he was freed on compassionate grounds in August 2009. He then dropped the appeal. Swire said he thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, because it leaves him with no way to clear his name and no way for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent, to have the case reviewed. But al-Megrahi's death could change the legal playing field, Swire speculated. ""If he were to die, the the situation would change,"" and Swire might be able to get the case reopened, he said. Swire is in the minority among victims' families in thinking that al-Megrahi is innocent. American officials have blasted officials for releasing al-Megrahi. ""As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. President Barack Obama's assistant on homeland security and counter-terrorism, John Brennan, called the release ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted that al-Megrahi was given three months to live when he was released, but is still alive. Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya. ""A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy,"" Menendez said. ""It was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man."" ""Al-Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts,"" Menendez said. Lautenberg said: ""It is the families of those victims who deserve compassion, not this terrorist."" The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","270 people died in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 15-year-old American girl are seeking to get their daughter back after she ran away with her boyfriend to Brazil, where authorities handed her over to the boyfriend's family. The Brazilian authorities' decision to give custody of Samantha Hernandez to her boyfriend's uncle, while a legal action against her goes through the system, has left her family and U.S. officials scratching their heads. ""If this was a senator's daughter, if this was a congressman's daughter, somebody would've gotten her back already,"" said Samantha's father, Robert Hernandez of Florida. On August 29, Samantha and her boyfriend, whom she had met online less than a year ago, boarded a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with Samantha using a fake passport, police said. A federal police commissioner in Minas Gerais state, where Belo Horizonte is located, said that Samantha arrived at the Confins International Airport and went through the customs process, where it was determined that the Brazilian passport she was using belonged to someone else. Because Samantha is a minor, she was transferred to the custody of Brazil's civil police, which will investigate the crime. She was not immediately sent back to the United States because the crime she is accused of committing does not allow for immediate repatriation, the official said. Instead, she was released to her boyfriend's uncle, without any consultation with her parents in the United States, the father said. Details about her boyfriend, his nationality and that of his uncle were not immediately known. ""It is outrageous and very dangerous to the welfare and well-being of an American minor girl that the Brazilian government hastily awarded custody to a man who is not in any way related to 15-year-old Samantha Hernandez,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who was a sponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. ""I am painfully aware that runaways and child abductees are at significant risk of exploitation and abuse. Brazil has a legal and moral duty to immediately return Samantha to her parents in the U.S."" The office of Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, who represents the district where Robert Hernandez lives, said it has been in touch with the parties involved. ""We reached out to the family last week and have been in touch with the family and the State Department,"" the office said. ""We've been working with the consulate in Brazil as well."" U.S. officials in Brazil are working closely with Brazilian officials and talking to Samantha and her family to provide assistance, said Heidi Arola, who is with the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. The father's attorney, Albert Gayoso, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that the U.S. State Department told the mother that U.S. officials conducted a ""wellness check"" on Samantha on Thursday, during which they took pictures of the girl and the house where she is staying. Also, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, has reached out to the family, his office said. Robert Hernandez said he has considered going to Brazil himself to get his daughter, but said he could be breaking Brazilian law if he were to attempt to get his daughter back on his own. In the meantime, all communications between Samantha's family and the boyfriend's family have ceased since she went to Brazil. ""We need the attention of the U.S. and Brazilian governments,"" Samantha's mother, Joann Allard, said in statement. ""Samantha needs to be taken into custody and deported back to the U.S. immediately."" She added, ""All adults who enabled a 15-year-old girl through two U.S. (security checkpoints) into Brazil should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" ""Honestly, we just want her to come home,"" Robert Hernandez said. ""I want her to really come to her senses and say, 'You know what, this was a mistake.' "" Judging from a phone call Samantha had with CNN affiliate WBBH, there are still many obstacles to that. ""I definitely do not want to go back. I'd rather jump off a bridge with sharks and piranhas in the water, with meat tied to my neck, than go back there,"" she said. ""Obviously, they don't care how I feel. I'm happy here.""

Miller's mother and father will join the Obama at the White House on October 6 ""to commemorate their son's selfless service and sacrifice,"" the White House said. Miller -- born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1983 -- enlisted in the Army in August 2003 as a Special Forces candidate. He became a Green Beret in 2005 and was based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The White House announced last week that Obama also intends to award the Medal of Honor to Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard Etchberger for his valor in saving the lives of three wounded comrades at a then-secret base in Laos in 1968. After Etchberger saved his fellow airmen, he was shot and killed by enemy fighters. The ceremony for Etchberger is scheduled for September 21 at the White House.

"(CNN) -- The 19th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards offered few surprises but lots of congeniality on Sunday night. Winners took a moment to thank losers, and the ceremony couldn't have been kinder as the peer group gathered to celebrate the best performances of the past year. Visit here for a full list of the night's winners . Here were just a few of the highlights of the evening: . 1. Everyone was so nice! From Julianne Moore reading the names of every single actor in her ""Game Change"" cast (including the baby!) to Jesse Tyler Ferguson sending the ""30 Rock"" cast a shout out when his ""Modern Family"" cast beat them out for best comedy ensemble, the evening was filled with collegiality and grace. Winners paid tribute to losers and Lifetime Achievement Award recipient Dick Van Dyke declared the room filled with ""the greatest generation of actors in the history of acting."" 2. Speaking of Dick Van Dyke ... He definitely came off as one of the sweetest men in show business. From his loving story before the ceremony of how he met his wife at the SAG Awards to the positively thrilled look he had on his face when he received a standing ovation during the presentation of his Lifetime Achievement Award, it was as if he was channeling one of his most beloved characters, Rob Petrie, from ""The Dick Van Dyke"" show. Loved it. 3. There were plenty of firsts . Anne Hathaway scored her first SAG win with the outstanding female actor in a supporting role for her turn as Fantine in ""Les Miserables"" as did Julianne Moore for outstanding female actor in a TV movie / miniseries for ""Game Change."" The cast of ""Downton Abbey"" won outstanding ensemble cast in a drama series, which was their first nomination and win. ""I'm just so thrilled I have dental,"" Hathaway joked. 4. Learning that 14 seems to be a magic number . ""I got my SAG card when I was 14,"" Hathaway shared. ""It felt like the beginning of the world. I have loved every single minute of my life as an actor."" Turns out Jennifer Lawrence, who won for outstanding female actor in a leading role for ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" also snagged her card when she was 14 -- for a role in an MTV promo for ""My Super Sweet 16."" Hope springs eternal for child actors it seems. 5. The sassy quips . Oh how we loved Bryan Cranston, best male actor in a drama series winner, dropping a line about being endowed with the statue followed by ""for tonight, at least, I'm well-endowed. Thank you."" And Phyllis Logan, speaking for the cast of ""Downton Abbey"" when they won outstanding ensemble cast in a drama series, crowed, ""Shut the front windows!"" We didn't quite get it, but we loved it. The flu epidemic didn't spare Hollywood as actor Tommy Lee Jones reportedly missed out of picking up his statue for outstanding male actor in a supporting role for ""Lincoln"" because he was sick. The cast of ""Argo"" won for best cast in a motion picture, and Daniel Day-Lewis scored outstanding performance by a male actor for his role in ""Lincoln."" The SAG Awards, which are decided exclusively by actors, are distinguished from the Globes, which are chosen by a group of about 80 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The five film SAG awards traditionally set the stage for the Oscars, voted by about 8,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to be handed out four weeks later. The SAG ceremony at the Shrine Auditorim & Exposition Center in Los Angeles also includes eight primetime television categories, a followup to the Globes and last fall's Emmys.

"(CNN) -- The NBC sitcom ""30 Rock"" lost some flight attendant fans after actor Alec Baldwin was kicked off an American Airlines flight when he refused to turn off his phone. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants requested Tuesday that the airline remove the show from all flights after last week's incident at Los Angeles International Airport. Baldwin was booted off the flight because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said. The actor was apparently playing ""Words With Friends,"" a Scrabble-like online game. ""We fully support the flight attendants and the way they handled the situation,"" spokesman Jeff Pharr said. ""The crew responded as they have been thoroughly trained to do so by the FAA as safety professionals onboard the aircraft."" Pharr added that the union would retract its petition if Baldwin issued an apology to the attendants. ""30 Rock,"" meanwhile, continues to air on some American Airline flights in accordance with its standard programming procedures, airline spokesman Tim Smith said. The actor mocked American Airlines over the weekend during a cameo appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" issuing an apology to himself while dressed as airline ""Capt. Steve Rogers."" NBC declined to comment on Tuesday's petition. Last week's incident prompted a flight delay and triggered a wave of comments on social media about the actor's behavior.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In the developing world millions of people struggle to operate machinery, read from a blackboard, or just see the world around them, because they don't have access to the eyeglasses they need. Self-refraction glasses let the wearer adjust the lenses to suit their vision, without the need for an optometrist. But a pair of glasses developed by Joshua Silver, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, offers an affordable solution. The glasses can be adjusted to the right strength by the wearer without the need to visit an optometrist. A major reason for that is a chronic shortage of optometrists -- in Ghana, for example, there is just one for every eight million people. That makes it incredibly difficult for ordinary people to visit an optometrist, without which it's impossible for them to get glasses. But Silver thinks he may have come up with a solution to the problem. His self-refraction glasses mean people can correct their vision without needing an optometrist (see Fact Box). ""Take a Sub-Saharan country where there is one optometrist for every million people; those people will never see an optometrist, so how will they get eyewear?,"" he told CNN. ""Any model of delivery of vision correction in the developing world that depends on eye care professionals won't work. If you find a model that doesn't rely on them, then you potentially have a solution."" Silver has been developing the glasses for over 20 years and continues to research the technology at the Center for Vision in the Developing World (CVDW) at the University of Oxford. He told CNN that about 80 percent of those who try the glasses are able to correct their vision, but there are limitations. They can't be used to correct astigmatism and it's not known if they are suitable for children, although the CVDW is currently running a study to determine if schoolchildren can correct their own vision with their teachers' help. So far, 30,000 pairs of self-refraction glasses have been distributed around the world, through an adult literacy program in Ghana and the U.S. Military Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) Program. The man behind the HCA program was Kevin White. He has now retired from the military and has set up Global Vision 2020 to distribute self-adjustable glasses. White has just returned from Liberia, where he trained 40 people from local NGOs to dispense the glasses. White sees charity organizations already working in developing countries as the key to distribution. ""If I can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses, and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses, then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that's a way to reach a lot of people,"" White told CNN. But for the program to be sustainable, White says the next step is to train his dispensers to become trainers themselves, so that he builds a growing network of people in developing countries who can distribute the glasses. Silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world don't have access to the glasses they need, and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020. But he is under no illusions that he can do it alone. ""No one person or company can possibly deliver that many glasses by 2020. There's a big infrastructure that needs to be set up to do that, and I'd like to see it happen,"" he told CNN. Distribution is one problem, cost is another. Currently, it cost $19 to manufacture a pair of self-refraction glasses, and Silver acknowledges that the price needs to come down to a few dollars a pair to make them affordable. Another issue is style. The glasses are currently functional, rather than fashionable, and that may limit their uptake, but more cosmetic versions are being developed. Silver says far more research is needed before those one billion people get their glasses, but he sees his self-refraction technology as a step toward that goal. He told CNN, ""It's one of the world's largest problems. There's an immense amount of interest in solving it and self-refraction is one route that can assist with that.""","A lack of optometrists means many in the developing world can't get glasses .

"(CNN) -- It is a measure of the squad Alex Ferguson has at his disposal that the Manchester United coach can make eight changes to the side that drew with Real Madrid and still move closer to an historic treble. With his side 12 points clear at the top of the English Premier League and in the box seat after drawing 1-1 with Real in their European Champions League last 16 tie, they moved into the last eight of the FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Reading. Only goalkeeper David De Gea, midfielder Phil Jones and striker Danny Welbeck, who grabbed United's goal at the Bernabeu, survived from the Real Madrid test as they defeated struggling Reading. Portuguese winger Nani and Mexican striker Javier Hernandez put United into a 2-0 lead before Jobi McAnuff ensured a tense last ten minutes at Old Trafford. United are now in line to play Chelsea in the quarterfinals, if the Blues beat second-tier Middlesbrough. The only negative of the evening was a potentially serious injury to Jones, who limped off after 42 minutes and later left the ground on crutches. ""It was a good cup tie and ended up a really good one,'' Ferguson told ESPN. ""They (Reading) went for it, piled the ball into the box and we withstood that. ""We played some great football, missed chances, had shots blocked and their goalkeeper made some saves. ""I`m satisfied with the quality of the game. We had to defend, our goalkeeper made some excellent saves because at 2-0 we were never comfortable.'' On Jones' injury Ferguson told the club's own channel MUTV: ""We will have to assess it in the morning. It is an ankle injury so I would imagine he would not be ready for Saturday and we will see what he is like after that."" Arguably, Ferguson's finest moment in his 26-year stint as manager of United came in 1999 when his side won the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League. And his side are in with a chance of repeating that famous triumph after extending their unbeaten run to 16 matches. United piled on the pressure in the early stages but Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici kept them at bay with smart saves from Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young. Nani came on for Jones and twice went close, volleying narrowly wide before forcing Federici to tip over his fierce shot but the pressure finally told as the Portuguese tucked home from Antonio Valencia's cross. Three minutes later Hernandez doubled United's lead with a near post header but McAnuff's finish on 81 minutes gave Reading hope though they couldn't force an equalizer. In Italy, Lazio spurned the chance to leapfrog AC Milan into third place after they went down to a shock 3-0 defeat at Siena. Innocent Emeghara put Siena into a sixth minute lead, turning home Matteo Rubin's cross before Alessandro Rosina polished off another Rubin center to make it 2-0. Emeghara got his second and Siena's third on the hour mark to seal an important win for the club, who remain in the relegation zone despite picking up three points.","Manchester beat Reading 2-1 to move into the quarter finals of the English FA Cup .

"(CNN) -- If the U.S. election race conjures up images of mud flying through the air for many Japanese, campaigning politicians in the Land of the Rising Sun evoke visions of a more white-gloved affair. Japan's politics are as Machiavellian as anyone else's behind closed doors, but their public campaigns are demure compared to the United States -- and many in Tokyo are aghast at the negative campaign tactics used on the road to the White House. Japan has plenty on its mind these days. The country is wrangling with questions about how to rebuild its tsunami-devastated coast, what to do with its idled nuclear reactors, and whether a tax hike will solve its economic woes, so it's no surprise if people in Tokyo aren't riveted to the lead-up to the U.S. elections. But the U.S. is important to Japan's economy and to Japan's increasingly rocky relationship with North Korea, so people are not ignoring it completely -- even if U.S. politics falls somewhere below the 'retirement' of a young pop idol in the morning shows' news order. For those not up on their Japanese pop, Atsuko Maeda's surprise announcement that she was leaving mega-pop idol group AKB48 in March got as much breathless coverage in Tokyo, maybe more, than Rick Santorum garnered in the U.S. press for his decision to exit stage right of the 2012 Republican primaries. In the 2008 Democratic primaries, Japanese observers saw Hillary Clinton as a powerful and intriguing former first lady, but it was Barack Obama's historic run that got even more attention when a small coastal city that happened to bear his name formed the ""Obama for Obama"" support group. Japan watched the group cheer as the Super Tuesday election results came in 2008. They still make sweet steamed bean buns, called manju, with Barack Obama's picture on them and have announced plans to erect a statue of him in town. The idea that whoever won the 2008 Democratic nomination would make history was exciting for the Japanese. This time around, most people see the current field of Republican hopefuls as a noisy blur, an only-in-America phenomenon -- or a ""matsuri,"" as one woman described it, in reference to Japan's colorful, oft-chaotic outdoor festivals. The notion that American campaigning is a complicated ""show"" was mentioned repeatedly by the people I spoke to, and Twitter is filled with Japanese observers likening U.S. politics to ""watching a movie"". One thing that adds to the unreality of it is the issues at play. While there are right-wing parties in Japan, their focus tends to be a noisy brand of nationalism, rather than the emphasis on religious values embraced by Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. The major newspapers have recently carried election primers on the role of Mormonism and evangelical Christianity in the election. One such piece asked: ""What is this 'evangelical Christianity' we hear about in the U.S. elections?"" Religion simply isn't as loud a voice in Japanese politics as it is in the American election race. Read more: Election postcard from Paris . Not that the U.S. has any kind of monopoly on noise. Rules dating back to the 1950s heavily restrict how Japanese politicians can campaign. These laws prevent candidates from taking to Twitter or updating their websites during the 12-day campaign period. In that short time, white-gloved candidates drive around waving from their campaign cars, repeating their names and asking for votes over loudspeakers attached to the car roofs. Japanese candidates park their cars at intersections with heavy foot traffic and make speeches with microphones plugged into portable amps in front of some of the busiest train stations in the world. While small crowds do gather, people generally tolerate the racket only grudgingly. When a British man was arrested last spring for grabbing a microphone from a candidate in front of a train station in a Tokyo suburb and shouting, ""Japanese elections are too noisy,"" he found an outpouring of support online from Japanese people who were also quietly fed up with the racket. Many Japanese are intrigued by the idea of the U.S. candidates' debates. The handyman in my Tokyo flat complex told me the debates are the reason that he thinks the US election process is ""better than Japan's."" ""The debates are on TV, right? That gives everyone a chance to listen to the candidates, understand what they believe, and then make up their minds,"" he said. ""We don't have anything like that, so we don't know as much about who the candidates actually are before we vote."" Those who watch the elections more closely view the debates and the hoopla around them more warily. One Japanese student told me: ""What's good about the 'show' side of the debates is that it gets more people to watch. But ultimately you don't know if you're getting the candidate's own views or just hearing what his team of strategists came up with. It's easy for people to be manipulated by the politicians and the people behind them."" Many Japanese people say that they don't fully understand the U.S. election system, and I am quick to reassure them that many of us Americans wouldn't want to be tested on it, either. But they have the sense that the American elections are more direct, and that the U.S. is therefore a more representative democracy. Read more: Election postcard from Cairo . Japan has a symbolic emperor and a parliament, and citizens do not directly elect their leader. There are no primaries; party leaders choose candidates. Since the campaign season is so short, they often look for candidates who will have good name recognition. This is why the less-powerful Upper House of the Diet often hosts a cast of minor celebrities including TV anchors, talk show commentators -- and even a handful of pro-wrestlers. The most colorful of these was Atsushi Onita, who didn't shy from mentioning his signature ""thunder fire powerbomb"" move in the Diet. The need for name recognition is one reason why political seats are seemingly passed down within families. The handyman explained, ""When a politician's son or daughter runs for office, we say, 'Oh, that's so-and-so's kid, he'll do,' without giving it too much more thought."" He's clearly not the only one who thinks this way -- a study in 2009 found that a quarter of Diet members and almost half of the LDP legislators at the time were the children of former politicians. Even if the American election itself seems inscrutable to Japanese voters, the result -- a leader who is in office for at least four years -- looks good. Japan has had four prime ministers since Obama won the 2008 election, and the margin for error is thin. The Ph.D. student says, ""Fixed terms in the U.S. mean that even a sloppy start can be redeemed, but in Japan, they dissolve the Diet easily, so they can't recover from mistakes."" As Japan slowly rebuilds after the earthquake, calls are growing for a system with a stronger, more directly elected leader and a more efficient system of government. Japan will be looking at what parts of the U.S. system it might want to draw from and what it could improve. And until then, Tokyo will be looking up from its smartphones once in awhile at the American political matsuri.","While Japanese campaigns are more civilized, the Japanese enjoy the more boisterous U.S. election race .

"(CNN) -- It's not exactly the war of the roses, but a New York couple is taking a divorce case to a new level. Dr. Richard Batista (left) and his attorney, Dominick Barbara, says the divorce case is not just about a kidney. Dr. Richard Batista and his wife, Dawnell, are fighting over a kidney he gave her. Batista and his attorney, Dominick Barbara, appeared on CNN's Larry King Live on Wednesday to discuss the case and why he filed a lawsuit. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: When did the wife need the kidney? Richard Batista:  Well, she needed three of them. The one that I donated was back in 2001. King: Who else donated? Batista:  Her father donated the first kidney in -- well, I'm going to go back -- when she was 13 years old. The second kidney she needed after two years of our marriage and that was back in 1992. Thereafter, we had three children, prompting the third kidney transplant, which took place in 2001. King:  How is she doing now? Do you know? Batista: To the best of my knowledge, I understand that her kidney is doing better than mine. King:  When did the marriage go bad? Batista:  It's hard to say, but it was not on a good foundation around the time of the third transplant. King:  What's it like, by the way, to donate a kidney? Batista:  Well, it is probably the most wonderful feeling that you can possibly ever imagine on this planet. King:  Is the surgery difficult? Batista:  The surgery, for me, was performed arthroscopically, so I have several port incisions, with a separate hand incision to allow for the kidney to be extracted. The surgery discomfort and pain itself was not all that horrendous, very tolerable. I was on my feet the following day. King:  What was the cause of the divorce? Batista:  Well, she has her allegations. King:  What were yours? Batista:  Infidelity. That's my reason. Dominick Barbara: Actually, Larry, in the state of New York, it's one of the grounds for divorce. When the show started, you mentioned the demand for the kidney or the value. Really, that's not what's going on. We use that as an example of what the doctor wants. What the doctor wants is, A) health to be taken into consideration in the division of the assets, whether or not she'd be entitled to maintenance or not. But most of all, (what's) being done so he can be part of the children's lives. That's what really this case is all about. King: He's not allowed to be part of their lives now? Batista:  It is my belief that the influence that the children are under, from the household, has put such a pressure on them that they no longer have visitation time with me, despite my most strongest efforts, both through phone call attempts through their mother and through the court system. King:  What is he going to do with a kidney back? Barbara: He doesn't want the kidney. Remember, this is a God-like act when one gives a kidney. You can certainly understand that. No, what he wants the court to do is take into consideration what he's done, what a wonderful thing it is he's done and some understanding from the court. You know, it's so strange; here he does this, and when he says he's allowed to see his children, well, legally he is, but these children have been so alienated from him. By the way, prior to the divorce, you should know that this was a 24/7 dad. The children loved him dearly. He's a broken-hearted man from that. Before we started the litigation, we thought very deeply how it's going to affect everyone. It was out of desperation that he did it. King:  Dr. Batista, you think this might affect other people donating kidneys? Batista:  I hope, at the very least, first of all, I have to say that the real issue here is for me to get my children back. Aside from that, to draw light to the lack of kidney availability, to the number of poor and dying patients across the country who are yearning to live. I hope, and it's my prayer, that this fallout will help enlighten those people who have any question about organ donation come forward, because there are so many people who are dying as a result of not having an organ. King:  In view of how bitter this has gotten, Dr. Batista, if you had to do it over again, would you not donate it? Batista: Without hesitation, I would give another kidney.","New York doctor, soon-to-be-ex-wife fighting over kidney he gave her in 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Dead baby bottlenose dolphins are continuing to wash up in record numbers on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and scientists do not know why. Since February 2010 to April 2011, 406 dolphins were found either stranded or reported dead offshore. The occurrence has prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to designate these deaths as an ""unusual mortality event"" or UME. The agency defines a UME as a stranding incident that is unexpected or involves a significant loss of any marine mammal population. ""This is quite a complex event and requires a lot of analysis,"" said Blair Mase, the agency's marine mammal investigations coordinator. Mase said NOAA is working closely with a variety of agencies to try to figure out not only why the bottlenose dolphins are turning up in such large quantities but also why the mammals are so young. ""These were mostly very young dolphins, either pre-term, neonatal or very young and less than 115 centimeters,"" she said. Marine mammals are particularly susceptible to harmful algal blooms, infectious diseases, temperature and environmental changes, and human impact. ""The Gulf of Mexico is no stranger to unusual mortality events,"" Mase said. Sensitivity surrounding marine life in the area is particularly high after the BP oil disaster that sent millions of barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico nearly a year ago. The incident occurred on April 20, 2010, when a Deepwater Horizon rig leased to BP exploded, killing 11 workers and leading to the worst oil spill in U.S. history. As recently as two weeks ago, scientists documented a dead dolphin with oil on its remains, Mase said. Since the start of the oil spill, a total of 15 bottlenose dolphins have been found with either confirmed or suspected oil on their carcasses. Even after the gushing well was capped, the agency said nine oiled dolphins have been found since November 2, 2010. Of those nine, six were confirmed to contain oil from the incident; one was found with oil that did not match the Deepwater Horizon samples, and two have not yet been tested. The dolphin deaths may be completely independent from the oil spill, Mase said. ""Even though they have oil on them, it may not be the cause of death,"" she said. ""We want to look at the gamut of all the possibilities."" The agency said bottlenose dolphins are actually the most-frequently found stranding marine mammal. Scientists say they are equally concerned about the number of sea turtle strandings. Similar to the dolphin deaths, an abnormally high number of turtles have been found either floating close to shore or washed up on shores in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. ""The vast majority of these are dead, with states in moderate to severe decomposition,"" said Barbara Schroeder, NOAA Fisheries national sea turtle coordinator. The majority of them are Kemp's ridley sea turtles, an endangered species since 1970. But some strandings included loggerheads, which are also endangered. ""Since January 1st, we've had just under 100 strandings,"" Schroeder said. ""About 87 of those have been documented since the middle of March."" Only about a third of those found were in good enough shape to perform necropsies, she said. Seven turtles showed indications that they had been in accidents involving watercrafts, while another displayed injuries consistent with being caught on a hook. Results from the rest appeared to indicate they had drowned near the bottom of the Gulf -- possibly either from forced submergence or an acute toxic event. NOAA Fisheries Stranding Program Coordinator Dr. Teri Rowles said tissue samples from both turtles and dolphins are being carefully documented due to the civil and criminal litigation ongoing with BP. ""We are looking at what is the impact of the oil spill and the response activities to the oil spill event, and what impact they had on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem,"" she said. ""We did not say that the dolphins have died because of the oil, just that they have come back with oil on them.""","Since February 2010, 406 dolphins have been found dead or stranded .

"(AOL Autos) -- Do you want a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro? You'd better be prepared to offer the dealer more money than the MSRP requires, and you'd better be willing to wait. Various reports have indicated that General Motors can't build the reborn bow tie pony car fast enough to quench public demand. The Camaro was originally built from 1967 to 2002; the 2010 model marks the brand's rebirth. The 2010 Camaro is catching more than a few eyes. That's excellent news for a company that needs a reason to smile, and it could be even better for dealers donning Chevrolet's famous bow tie. After all, car sales are still firmly in the tank, and GM has seen more than its fair share of shrunken demand. In May, GM announced that it would close 1,100 dealers by the end of 2010, leaving them with about 3,600. Dealers started selling the two-door Camaro in May. Why it's popular . Chevy representatives swear the 2010 Camaro's styling isn't retro, although it does bring forward some styling cues from older Camaros (namely the 1969 model) in a thoroughly modern manner. If you're not intimate with the historic Camaro design language, zero in on the new car's vestigial vents ahead of the rear wheels and the dual-plain grill flanked by round headlights. These elements overlay the long-hood/short-deck 2+2 body style Ford made famous with their original 1964 Mustang (the source of the ""pony car"" moniker). AOL Autos: 2010 Chevy Camaro first drive . What's modern about the new Camaro's exterior is everything else. Short front and rear overhangs are modern, as are the large wheels (up to 20-inch compared to 1969 when 14-inch wheels were the norm). Furthermore, extensive aerodynamic testing shaped the brooding overhang of the grille, plan view shape of nose, and everything aft of the roof's rear pillar. The blend of old and new carries through inside. High-quality and modern materials form the foundation for a driving environment bejeweled with instruments clearly inspired by the first-generation Camaro. The twin pods and their curiously canted numerals effectively communicate the Camaro's formidable performance. The Camaro's interior technically seats four, but because it's a 2+2, the rear seats don't offer much leg room. However, complaining that the Camaro doesn't have enough room in the rear is silly...much like complaining about a motorcycle having inadequate doors. (If you're looking for more interior room, check out the Chevy Malibu.) AOL Autos: Best July deals on cars and trucks . Cool stuff inside the Camaro . • The fastest Camaro has a 6.2-liter V-8 engine, generating 422 horsepower . • Despite its 304 hp, the V-6 Camaro gets a fuel-sipping 29 miles per gallon on the highway . • The SS model offers 20-inch aluminum wheels and 4-piston Brembo brakes and offers an optional white stripe color option on the hood . • Optional gadgetry includes XM Radio, a USB port and Bluetooth . Reserving a place in line . Dealers have already booked about 25,000 orders for the Camaro, yet only half have been delivered to date. Analysts reportedly told Bloomberg that dealers are getting $500 over sticker on average, too, and at least one dealer is guessing that he won't have a Camaro to sell in stock for at least a year. Bartow Chevrolet in Florida sold its first two Camaros at MSRP, and the dealership has already booked 18 orders. AOL Autos: 2009's best looking vehicles . There is no question that the Camaro has grabbed the attention of the car-buying public, and the recent debut of Transformers 2 will likely give the pony car another marketing shot in the arm. GM sold 5,463 copies of the Camaro in May, and we're guessing that number will grow as production ramps up.AOL Autos: Top 10 movie car chases .

"BRADFORD, England (CNN)  -- Tuesday is her 104th birthday, but that hasn't stopped Britain's Ivy Bean from being an avid Twitter user and possibly the oldest person on the social networking site. Ivy Bean has 27,000 Twitter followers and tweets from the care home where she lives in Bradford, England. From the care home where she lives in the northern English city of Bradford, near Leeds, Bean updates her more than 27,000 Twitter followers about the ups and downs of her life -- from getting her hair done with her good friend Mabel, to eating fish and chips and watching her favorite game show, ""Deal or No Deal,"" on TV. Last month, she tweeted her sadness that her friend Norma had passed away overnight. Before getting onto Twitter, Bean was already active on Facebook, where she maxed out her 5,000-friend limit in no time. Bean says she prefers Twitter because it's easier than Facebook -- it only requires updating. She has linked both accounts so that her tweets automatically show up on Facebook. Bean says she knows people must think it's amazing that she's so active on online, but she thinks it's a good way of keeping in touch with people. And for those who find it hard to jump on the Twitter bandwagon, Bean offers this advice: ""Keep on at it."" ""Old"" is not the first -- or second or even 10th -- word that comes to mind with Bean, an engaging, lively and friendly lady with a warm and infectious smile. A resident of Hillside Manor, she recently won a gold medal at the residential home's Over-75 Olympics in the Frisbee-throwing category. And she enjoys bowling on the home's Nintendo Wii. No surprise, perhaps, for a lady who was a gymnast when she was younger. What do her friends think of her online popularity? ""I think they might be jealous,"" she said with a joking laugh. Others at Hillside Manor also have Twitter accounts, but not Bean's friend, Mabel Davis, 87. ""Just put me on yours, Ivy,"" she says. Already, Bean's centenarian tweeting and Facebooking have attracted international attention, and news outlets from around the world have interviewed her. Bean's daughter, Sandra Logan, 61, said she arrived for a visit one day only to find her mom busy with a call. ""I'm on the phone with Israel,"" Bean called out to her daughter. Part of the reason Bean is so active online is because the care home makes activities for its residents a priority. One resident wanted to learn more about photography, so he now takes a course once a week at a local college. The home also helped another resident get a passport so he could visit his son in Spain. Hillside Manor also recently hosted a quiz with students from the local college. The subject was history. The Hillside Manor residents won. ""We're trying to do something different than knitting or crochet,"" explained Pat Wright, the home's manager. Bean came from a large family with four brothers and three sisters. All are gone, Logan said. Bean, who was in the middle of her siblings, was approaching 40 when she got married during the ""great war"" to Harold Gibson Bean. He was a cook in the army, and she worked in a mill. After the war, the couple got a job ""in service"" to a wealthy family. Ivy Bean was a housekeeper and her husband was the cook and butler to Lord and Lady Guinness in Northamptonshire, England. Daughter Sandra, their only child, was born two years later, in 1947. The couple retired together but Harold Bean died a few years later, when he was in his 70s, Logan said. Bean now has three great-grandchildren with two more on the way, Logan said. They all call their famous great-grandmother ""Little Nan."" Wright says Bean is ""very open"" to new suggestions and new ideas and is always willing to have a go at something. ""She must have been like that all her life,"" Wright says. ""It's not a new thing. I think if you're one of those people that'll try anything through your life, it doesn't stop when you get old."" As she types an update on her Twitter page, Bean certainly seems to be displaying an open mind. Would she agree? ""I don't know if I have or not,"" Bean says. ""But there's something there.

"(CNN) -- As water levels already at or above flood stage continue rising in rivers in southwestern Louisiana, the weather forecast says more rain is on the way. But it won't be as bad as the torrents that have caused widespread flooding in seven parishes, the National Weather Service predicts. There is about a 20% to 50% chance of showers and thunderstorms in much of the region through Monday. Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon after thunderstorms drenched the state with as much as a foot of rain this week. Hundreds of people have been evacuated. There were no initial reports of injuries. Many rivers in the southwest, closer to Texas, where flooding has been prominent, are still rising and expected to crest over the weekend. At least one is predicted to hit major flood stage. The flood region is a low-lying prairie, and water about thigh-deep spread over a broad region, inundating homes and cars. The town of Eunice has had 12.25 inches of rain since Tuesday, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service said. St. Landry Parish spokeswoman Megan Vizena said 30% of the area was underwater. Authorities in Franklin, near the Gulf of Mexico, evacuated 118 people after 7 inches of rain washed over some roads and bridges, the weather service said on its website. In Acadia Parish, rescuers saved close to 80 people from rising water, including 20 at an oil well. The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish. A third tornado was sighted in Iberville Parish, according to CNN affiliate WBRZ. Rivers to Louisiana's southeast, near Mississippi, have also gone over flood stage, but inundation has not been dramatic there. Much of the region is hilly and not as prone to flooding. Those rivers have also already crested, according to NWS data. The heavy rainfall accompanies a broad warming trend covering the southeastern United States and reaching into the Midwest, according to the weather service. Both have the same root cause, said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. ""It's a southerly flow coming over the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said. ""It's a subtropical air mass,"" Pedram Javaheri, and can spark thunderstorms as it collides with a cooler front coming over from Texas. 2012 was the warmest year on record for the contiguous 48 states of the United States, according to the National Weather Service. But Javaheri sees no connection between that and the current weather system. Cold weather should return soon, giving the country a normal start into 2013, he said. Four-fifths of the country will see colder than average temperatures in the third week of January. Watch encores of CNN's ""The Coming Storms"" at 8 and 11 p.m. ET Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for Graham Spanier on Wednesday blasted a university-funded review that accused the former Penn State president of complicity in the alleged coverup of a child sex abuse scandal involving former coach Jerry Sandusky. Timothy K. Lewis called the review led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh a ""blundering, indefensible indictment"" and ""a flat-out distortion of facts"" that was ""infused with bias and innuendo."" Freeh's 267-page report was released in July and blamed Spanier, legendary football coach Joe Paterno, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz with taking part in a coverup to avoid bad publicity. Spanier blasts report, says he was abused as a child . The scandal led to Spanier's ouster and shocked the nation after Freeh's team concluded that the school's top administrators had ""empowered"" Sandusky to continue his abuse. Freeh also said Paterno could have stopped the attacks had he done more, though neither graduate assistant Mike McQueary, Sandusky nor Paterno -- who died in January -- were interviewed by his investigators. The former defensive coordinator was convicted in June of sexually abusing 10 young boys over several years. He continues to maintain his innocence. In Spanier's first interview since the scandal unfolded, he spoke with The New Yorker magazine in an interview published Wednesday. Spanier reiterated his position about e-mails he is accused of exchanging with top university officials over two specific allegations of abuse involving Sandusky: one in 1998 and another in 2001. ""I have no recollection"" of the exchanges from the 1998 incident, he told Jeffrey Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and CNN senior legal analyst. ""I am aware, as I said in my letter to the board of trustees, that I was apparently copied on two e-mails. I didn't reply to them. The first e-mail that I saw didn't mention anybody's name. It simply said something to the effect of 'The employee will be interviewed tomorrow,' something like that, no name mentioned. Then, about five weeks later, I think it was, I was copied on another e-mail that said, 'The interview has been completed, the investigation has been completed, nothing was found, Jerry felt badly that the kid might have felt badly.' "" Penn State to host sex abuse conference . Spanier then said Curley and Schultz came to him ""with a heads-up"" after the 2001 incident, in which McQueary reported that he heard ""rhythmic slapping sounds"" coming from a university shower room and saw Sandusky directly behind a young boy. ""They said we received a report that a member of the athletic department staff, after a workout in one of our athletic facilities, saw Jerry Sandusky in the locker room with one of his kids, meaning one of his Second Mile kids,"" Spanier said, referring to Sandusky's former foundation. ""And it was reported that they were horsing around in the shower. Now, they either used the word 'horsing around' or 'horseplay.' And the staff member wasn't sure what he saw, because it was indirect and around a corner."" The former president then said he recalls asking whether the administrators were ""sure that's how it was described to you, as 'horsing around'? ""And the answer was yes from both Gary and Tim,"" Spanier recalled. ""I remember, for a moment, sort of figuratively scratching our heads and thinking about what's an appropriate way to follow up on 'horsing around.' I had never gotten a report like that before."" Spanier then said that he decided Curley should speak with Sandusky ""and explain to him that this is unacceptable to us."" Penn State football loses star tailback to USC . ""He was no longer an employee at the university; he'd been retired for three years. So we didn't have any hold over him in that way. But he was with the Second Mile, and we thought, we should tell the president of the Second Mile that we're going to give Jerry this directive, and we'd like their support for that, and we don't want any Second Mile kids being brought into the athletic shower facilities."" Curley and Schultz still face felony perjury counts amid accusations of lying to a grand jury and failing to report suspected child abuse. They have pleaded not guilty. ""As Mr. Spanier's lawyers said today, there is one thing about which there is no doubt: Tim Curley did not tell Dr. Spanier that Mr. Sandusky sexually abused a young boy in 2001,"" said Curley's attorney, Caroline Roberto. ""And that is because Mike McQueary never told anyone, including Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, that he witnessed Mr. Sandusky sexually abusing a young boy in a Penn State shower."" She said the truth will be determined at trial and not by the ""baseless opinion of a so-called independent investigation."" Schultz's attorney, Tom Farrell, said the Freeh report was ""inaccurate, incomplete and unfair."" Schultz testified to a grand jury that McQueary never told him that the assistant had witnessed sexual abuse, Farrell reiterated. Attorneys: Sandusky voice mails released .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- To the casual observer, the Chinese Communist Party may seem like a monolithic, united entity. In recent years, its leadership has ruled collectively, rather than by the hand of a paramount leader, which was a characteristic of the Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping eras. But while the party outwardly stresses harmony and unity, political analysts believe its estimated 80-million-strong members are divided along deep-rooted factional lines with varying perspectives on social, economic, political, military and foreign affairs. CNN looks at what makes the Chinese party machine tick. Who are the key factional powers within the party? The Chinese Communist Party is broadly divided between informal ""elitist"" and ""populist"" coalitions, according to China expert and Brookings Institution analyst Cheng Li. Other analysts conceive of the split in different terms, such as between liberal-minded reformist and conservative hard-liner camps. Li argues the core elitist faction is the ""taizidang,"" or so-called ""princelings"" -- the offspring of former revolutionary leaders and high-ranking officials. Another elite, albeit fading, faction is the so-called ""Shanghai Gang,"" or followers of Jiang Zemin, who served as mayor of Shanghai before becoming China's supreme leader in 1989. The populists are dominated by the ""tuanpai"" -- politicians who cut their teeth in the Chinese Communist Youth League, the party's nation-wide organization for youth aged 14-28 to study and promote communism. The league is also a training ground for party cadres. But any analysis of these factional allegiances must be treated with caution -- as an educated but speculative discussion at best -- given the lack of official information and the complexities influencing politicians' backgrounds. ""Factional lines are often unclear, shifting or overlapping, conditioned by old alliances, family interconnections, conflicts, rivalries, shifting loyalties and pragmatic tactical considerations,"" according to CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Jaime FlorCruz. ""In some cases, these affiliations are also conditioned by the members' work patron/protégé experience, i.e. with or under whom they worked and rose to power."" How are these factions oriented? Broadly speaking, the factions run along socioeconomic and geographic divides. The elitist coalition tends to represent business interests, including entrepreneurs and the rising middle class of China's affluent coastal regions, according to Li. The princelings typically have prestigious backgrounds as the descendents of former party heroes, tending to have credentials governing affluent provinces along China's eastern coast. For example Bo Xilai, the disgraced politician once tipped for political stardom in China, is the son of Bo Yibo, a former Politburo member who last served as vice-chairman of the Central Advisory Commission during the Deng era. Some politicians have sought to round out their resumes with credentials across geographic and socioeconomic lines. Bo famously adopted a populist approach invoking Mao nostalgia during his tenure as party secretary of Chongqing, while Xi Jinping -- widely expected to become China's next president -- left a prestigious post in Beijing to work in rural Hebei for three years. Li says the elitists are currently headed by Wu Bangguo, Chairman and Party Secretary of the National People's Congress (the national legislature) and Jia Qinglin, Chairman and Party Secretary of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (the advisory body of delegates from different political parties and parts of Greater China.) Both are protégés of former president, Jiang. As the name implies, the populist coalition tends to promote an agenda representing the concerns of the urban and rural poor, including migrants and farmers. The tuanpai core faction typically comes from humble backgrounds and worked their way up the ranks via the Chinese Communist Youth League in Beijing and inland provinces. Li says the populists are currently led by President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, who have accordingly promoted policies such as eliminating agricultural taxes, developing inland cities and promoting affordable housing. A further contrast, Li says, is that princelings tend to have a great depth of experience in economic policy, including banking and foreign trade and investment, whereas the tuanpai tend to be more skilled in rural administration. Hu's heir apparent, Xi, is a princeling, whereas Wen's likely successor, Li Keqiang, represents the tuanpai. What is the Politburo Standing Committee? The 18th Congress of the Communist Party will officially unveil the new members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the innermost sanctum and supreme decision-making body of the Communist Party — and by extension the leaders of China's government. Party members typically occupy its highest positions. Members are typically drawn from those already on the standing committee, as well as the broader Politburo overseeing the Communist Party. The standing committee is a subset of the Politburo. It is also possible that a non-Politburo member could be promoted directly into the standing committee, as in the case of Xi and Li Keqiang during the 17th party congress. Members must also fall within the unofficial retirement age of 68 (i.e. born from 1945 onward), says Li. Beyond these basic criteria follows what Li calls an ""extraordinarily complicated and multi-faceted deal-making process"" to narrow the pool to nine members. Speculation is rife that the upcoming committee will be cut to seven members. While the closed-door process involves complex factional negotiations and power struggles that few in the outside world are privy to, Li says the overriding factor is ""patron-client"" ties, meaning departing members attempting to prolong their influence and protect their interests by placing their protégés onto the committee. This involves compromise and deal-making behind the scenes. How will these factions be represented in future? China watchers widely expect that two of the current standing committee members, Xi and Li Keqiang, will retain their membership. Their factional inclinations are reflected in their policy priorities, says Li of the Brookings Institution. Xi is focused on the private sector, market liberation in foreign investment, and Shanghai's role as a financial and shipping center. In contrast, Li Keqiang emphasizes affordable housing, basic health care and clean energy. This equilibrium extends within the upper echelons of the leadership, which is about evenly split between the elitists and populists, according to Li. Most analysts concur that the era of charismatic, paramount leaders ended after Deng Xiaoping, replaced by relatively colorless technocrats who governed through collective leadership. What does this mean for China's future? Out of necessity, this balance has led the elitist and populist coalitions to adopt a collaborative approach of collective leadership rather than a zero-sum game mentality, underpinned by shared fundamental goals: ""to ensure China's socioeconomic stability as well as the survival of Chinese Communist Party role at home, and to enhance China's status as a major international player,"" Li said. The analyst says this collective leadership style is the ""defining feature of today's Chinese elite politics.""","Chinese Communist Party not monolithic, united entity .

"(CNN) -- As the world looks for ways to help the victims of Haiti's earthquake, the FBI is now warning that there are also those who are looking for opportunities set up scams surrounding the latest disaster relief efforts. The FBI advises that people should be very skeptical of any unsolicited appeals they receive or find on the Internet. One month after Hurricane Katrina, the FBI said it was suspicious of most of the 4,600 Web sites soliciting money on behalf of those victims. Within an hour of the World Trade Center attacks, scam sites popped up on the Web according to ScamBusters.org. At CNN's Impact Your World, you can find a list of list of Web sites of charities highly rated by CharityNavigator.org, an independent, nonprofit organization that evaluates and rates thousands of charity groups based on effectiveness and financial stability. But Web sites are not the only way criminals try to get their hands on charity funds -- they might also send you an e-mail, a letter, phone you or even knock on your door. Here are some tips from the FBI, Scam.Busters and the Better Business Bureau on how to make sure your money goes to people in need. • Be skeptical if someone e-mails you or contacts you through social networking sites claiming to be a quake victim or a government or charity official and asks for donations, the FBI says. Also, the agency says, do not click on any links within those e-mails. And do not click on attached files labeled photos or video because they may contain viruses. • It's OK to be suspicious. Ask for the name, phone number and address of the charity. The American Institute of Philanthropy says honest charities encourage you to know about them and respond to your questions. Also, request that they put the information in writing. • However, do not give them your personal or financial information, because that may leave you vulnerable to identity theft. • Don't be misled by a charity name that ""sort of sounds familiar."" Scammers may change one word in the title to trick you. • Ask if the charity is registered with any organization and get the registration number. Check for the organization on Web sites such as the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance, or Charity Navigator.org. • Ask what percentage of the money you give actually reaches the needy. You also can designate how your donation is to be used. • Don't ever donate cash. Make the check out to the name of the charity, not the person asking for money. And get a receipt with the name of the charity on it. Do NOT give your credit card number to telemarketers or use it on a Web site of a charity you have not checked out. • If the person seeking your donation asks you to give more, that may be a sign that something is wrong. Legitimate charities are grateful, not demanding.","To help Haiti earthquake victims, check out charities at Impact Your World .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy backed Sen. Barack Obama for president Monday, saying, ""It is time again for a new generation of leadership."" Sens. Edward Kennedy and Barack Obama are all smiles after Kennedy endorsed Obama. ""It is time now for Barack Obama,"" the Massachusetts senator and brother of the late President Kennedy added. He stood with Obama, his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, and his niece, Caroline Kennedy, before a screaming capacity crowd of students at American University in Washington. ""Like you, we want a president who appeals to the hopes of those who still believe in the American dream,"" he said. ""I've found that candidate. And it looks to me like you have too,"" he said.  Watch Kennedy compare Obama to JFK » . After Kennedy spoke, Obama told the boisterous crowd: ""I know what your support means. I know the cherished place the Kennedy family holds in the hearts of the American people."" The Illinois Democrat said he would work to carry on the vision the senator's brother laid out when he was president nearly five decades ago. ""The dream has never died ... it lives on in those Americans, young and old, rich and poor, black and white, Latino and Asian and Native American, gay and straight, who are tired of a politics that divides us and want to recapture the sense of common purpose that we had when John Kennedy was president of the United States of America,"" Obama said. ""That is the dream we hold in our hearts,"" Obama said. ""That is the kind of leadership we long for in this country. And that is the kind of leadership I intend to offer as president of the United States of America."" Kennedy said he has always planned to ""support the candidate who inspires me, who inspires all of us, who can lift our vision and summon our hopes and renew our belief that our country's best days are still to come.""  Watch Obama explain why Kennedy decided to endorse him » . Picking up on Obama's central campaign theme, he said, ""I feel change in the air. What about you?"" Kennedy praised Sen. Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards, saying Edwards ""has been a powerful advocate for economic and social justice. And Hillary Clinton has been in the forefront on issues ranging from health care to the rights of women around the world. ""Whoever is our nominee will have my enthusiastic support,"" he said. But he also took a line from Clinton's campaign, saying Obama ""is ready to be president on Day 1."" In what may have been a veiled swipe at Clinton, Kennedy said of Obama, ""From the beginning, he opposed the war in Iraq. And let no one deny that truth."" Clinton has pointed to various statements Obama has made about Iraq, suggesting he has not been consistent -- an accusation he has denied. Kennedy -- a fixture of the Democratic Party popular with many liberals -- was introduced by Caroline Kennedy, who spoke of her father, the slain president. She said Obama offers the ""sense of hope and inspiration"" that Americans today need. In fact, she said, her children ""were the first people who made me realize that Barack Obama is the president we need."" The New York Times reported Monday that Sen. Kennedy endorsed Obama despite pleas from the Clinton camp to remain neutral in the Democratic race. The Massachusetts senator decided to endorse Obama after becoming concerned about the often-bitter campaigning involving former President Clinton before Saturday's South Carolina primary, which Obama won, the newspaper reported. The Times said Kennedy was angry the former president had introduced what he felt were racial themes into the campaign and that Bill Clinton had made misleading statements about Obama, matters Kennedy and Clinton discussed during two heated telephone conversations earlier this month. Caroline Kennedy endorsed Obama in a weekend New York Times editorial. Members of the Kennedy clan are split in the race. Former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend issued a statement Sunday stating her support for Clinton. ""I respect Caroline and Teddy's decision, but I have made a different choice,"" she said. ""While I admire Sen. Obama greatly, I have known Hillary Clinton for over 25 years and have seen firsthand how she gets results. As a woman, leader and person of deep convictions, I believe Hillary Clinton would make the best possible choice for president."" She added that her brother Bobby and sister Kerry are also backing Clinton. Kennedy Townsend is the oldest child of Robert F. Kennedy. Sen. Kennedy's decision to endorse Obama could help Obama's campaign as he seeks momentum toward Super Tuesday on February 5, when 22 states and American Samoa will weigh in on the Democratic race. In polls, Obama has trailed Clinton nationally. Obama, coming off the South Carolina victory, has been seeking to expand his support nationwide. He won that state with the help of a large majority of African-American voters, while most white voters supported Clinton or Edwards. Sen. Kennedy spoke enthusiastically, interrupted by frequent applause from the young crowd. ""When John Kennedy thought of going to the moon, he didn't say no, it was too far, maybe we couldn't get there and shouldn't even try,"" he said. ""I am convinced we can reach our goals only if we are not petty when our cause is so great -- only if we find a way past the stale ideas and stalemate of our times -- only if we replace the politics of fear with the politics of hope -- and only if we have the courage to choose change. ""Barack Obama is the one person running for president who can bring us that change. Barack Obama is the one person running for president who can be that change."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Rafa Benitez's turbulent reign as Chelsea manager took another battering on the day his supposed successor, Pep Guardiola, agreed a deal to become the new manager of Bayern Munich. Benitez, who was appointed as Chelsea interim manager in November following the dismissal of Roberto Di Matteo, was left stunned after his team squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with lowly Southampton. European champion Chelsea is now 13 points adrift of Premier League leader Manchester United with 16 games remaining and has failed to win any of their past three games at Stamford Bridge. Guardiola agrees three-year deal with Bayern . A 1-0 defeat by bottom side Queens Park Rangers was followed by a 2-0 loss in the League Cup against Swansea City. Benitez has managed just one home win in six attempts in all competitions since taking over, while he has triumphed in six of the seven away fixtures. But few expected Chelsea to drop points against a Southampton team which they had demolished 5-1 in the FA Cup on January 5. Chelsea suffers home humiliation . New signing Demba Ba and Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard had given Chelsea a comfortable advantage at the break as the Blues dominated. But Southampton, which has lost just two of its previous 12 league games, refused to accept defeat and launched a stirring fightback. Substitute Rickie Lambert headed home his 10th goal of the season with 58 minutes gone before Jason Puncheon netted a dramatic equalizer with 15 minutes remaining. The result leaves Chelsea in third place, six points behind Manchester City and just two ahead of London rivals Tottenham. James Gibson: The man who saved Manchester United -- twice . Elsewhere, Manchester United booked its place in the fourth round of the FA Cup and a home tie against Fulham following a narrow 1-0 win over West Ham. Wayne Rooney, who missed a second half penalty, scored the only goal of the game after nine minutes. Arsenal will play second tier Brighton in the fourth round after edging out Swansea 1-0 courtesy of Jack Wilshere's spectacular strike. Messi leads Barcelona to new record . Meanwhile, Barcelona was held to a 2-2 draw in the first leg of its Copa del Rey quarterfinal by 10-man Malaga at Camp Nou. Malaga, which was soundly beaten 3-1 by Barca in La Liga last weekend, took a surprise lead through Manuel Iturra after 26 minutes. But Barca, which has not lost a domestic game this season, hit back through Lionel Messi and Carles Puyol to lead 2-1 at the interval. Nacho Monreal, a halftime substitute for Malaga, was then sent off with 15 minutes remaining to leave the visitor facing an uphill task. But with Barca seemingly coasting to victory, Ignacio Camacho popped up at the death to fire home and ensure the two teams will start level on January 24. In Italy, Mattio Destro's extra-time strike booked Roma's place in the semifinals of the Coppa Italia. Destro scored the only goal of the game as Roma recorded a 1-0 win at Fiorentina to set up a last-four clash with Inter Milan. Valentine's Day comes early for Epinal . In France, Rennes sealed its place in the final of the French League Cup following a 2-0 win over league champion Montpellier. Julien Feret and Mevlut Erding scored the goals to set up a final clash with Saint Etienne on April 20.","Chelsea only manages 2-2 draw at home to struggling Southampton .

"(CNN) -- Americans who celebrate on New Year's Eve with a bottle of champagne, party hats and a kiss at midnight have an important lesson to learn from the rest of the world (and certain regions of this country): The arrival of the new year is meant for feasting. As the new year arrives around the globe, special cakes and breads abound, as do long noodles (representing long life), field peas (representing coins), herring (representing abundance) and pigs (representing good luck). The particulars vary, but the general theme is the same: to sit down and share a meal with family and friends to usher in a year of prosperity. Where to see in the new year in style . Here are some of the common traditions around the world and a few hints about where to partake in them: . Hoppin' John, American South . A major New Year's food tradition in the American South, Hoppin' John is a dish of pork-flavored field peas or black-eyed peas (symbolizing coins) and rice, frequently served with collards or other cooked greens (as they're the color of money) and cornbread (the color of gold). The dish is said to bring good luck in the new year. Different folklore traces the history and the name of this meal, but the current dish has its roots in African and West Indian traditions and was most likely brought over by slaves to North America. A recipe for Hoppin' John appears as early as 1847 in Sarah Rutledge's ""The Carolina Housewife"" and has been reinterpreted over the centuries by home and professional chefs. The dish reportedly got its name in Charleston, South Carolina, and it is a veritable staple of Lowcountry cooking. So this is as good a place as any to eat it. Husk, the acclaimed restaurant of chef Sean Brock, often serves Hoppin' John, as does Charleston institution Hominy Grill. Not heading south for the holidays? Seersucker in Brooklyn, New York, is serving Hoppin' John from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on New Year's Day. Twelve grapes, Spain . While Americans watch the ball drop in Times Square on New Year's Eve, Spaniards watch the broadcast from Puerta del Sol in Madrid, where revelers gather in front of the square's clock tower to ring in the New Year. Those out in the square and those watching at home partake in an unusual annual tradition: at the stroke of midnight they eat one grape for every toll of the clock bell. Some even prep their grapes -- peeling and seeding them -- to make sure they will be as efficient as possible when midnight comes. 6 food must-haves for 2013 . The custom began at the turn of the 20th century and was purportedly thought up by grape producers in the south with a bumper crop. Since then the tradition has spread to many Spanish-speaking nations. Those spending New Year's Eve in Madrid should head over to the Puerta del Sol before midnight. It's a lively square, surrounded by bars, restaurants and shopping, so it's a good place to be when the new year comes. Tamales, Mexico . Tamales, corn dough stuffed with meat, cheese and other delicious additions and wrapped in a banana leaf or a corn husk, make appearances at pretty much every special occasion in Mexico. But the holiday season is an especially favored time for the food. In many families, groups of women gather together to make hundreds of the little packets -- with each person in charge of one aspect of the cooking process -- to hand out to friends, family and neighbors. On New Year's, it's often served with menudo, a tripe and hominy soup that is famously good for hangovers. Those who live in cities with large Mexican populations shouldn't have much trouble finding restaurants selling tamales to go for New Year's Eve and Day. But gourmands who want the real deal should head to Mexico City, where steamed tamales are sold from vendors on street corners day and night. They can also be found at established restaurants like Flor de Lis or Pujol or tamale specialists like Los Tamales y Algo Mas. Oliebollen, Netherlands . In the Netherlands, fried oil balls, or oliebollen, are sold by street carts and are traditionally consumed on New Year's Eve and at special celebratory fairs. They are doughnut-like dumplings, made by dropping a scoop of dough spiked with currants or raisins into a deep fryer and then dusted with powdered sugar. In Amsterdam, be on the lookout for Oliebollenkraams, little temporary shacks or trailers on the street selling packets of hot fried oliebollen. Marzipanschwein or GlÃ¼cksschwein, Austria and Germany . Austria, and its neighbor to the north, Germany, call New Year's Eve Sylvesterabend, or the eve of Saint Sylvester. Austrian revelers drink a red wine punch with cinnamon and spices, eat suckling pig for dinner and decorate the table with little pigs made of marzipan, called marzipanschwein. Good luck pigs, or GlÃ¼cksschwein, which are made of all sorts of things, are also common gifts throughout both Austria and Germany. Vienna bakeries this time of year will be filled with a variety of pig-shaped sweets. Head to Julius Meinl, with more than three floors of gourmet food shopping, cafes and restaurants, to find the most impressive display of pig-shaped Champagne truffles, marzipan and chocolate in a variety of sizes. Soba noodles, Japan . In Japanese households, families eat buckwheat soba noodles, or toshikoshi soba, at midnight on New Year's Eve to bid farewell to the year gone by and welcome the year to come. The tradition dates back to the 17th century, and the long noodles symbolize longevity and prosperity. In another custom called mochitsuki, friends and family spend the day before New Year's pounding mochi rice cakes. Sweet, glutinous rice is washed, soaked, steamed and pounded into a smooth mass. Then guests take turns pinching off pieces to make into small buns that are later eaten for dessert. This New Year's Eve, at Manhattan Japanese restaurant En Japanese Brasserie, the chef (and willing customers) will take part in the mochitsuki. The resulting mochi will be served as dessert later in the evening. The restaurant is also serving two kaiseki menus, both featuring soba noodles as a final savory course. At midnight, they will break open a barrel of sake to welcome the New Year. King cake, around the globe . The tradition of a New Year's cake is one that spans countless cultures. The Greeks have the Vasilopita, the French the gateau or galette des rois. Mexicans have the Rosca de Reyes and Bulgarians enjoy the banitsa. Most of the cakes are consumed at midnight on New Year's Eve -- though some cultures cut their cake on Christmas or the Epiphany, January 6 -- and include a hidden gold coin or figure, which symbolizes a prosperous year for whomever finds it in their slice. Cotechino con lenticchie, Italy . Italians celebrate New Year's Eve with La Festa di San Silvestro, often commencing with a traditional cotechino con lenticchie, a sausage and lentil stew that is said to bring good luck (the lentils represent money and good fortune) and, in certain households, zampone, a stuffed pig's trotter. The meal ends with chiacchiere -- balls of fried dough that are rolled in honey and powdered sugar -- and prosecco. The dishes find their roots in Modena, but New Year's Eve feasts thrive across the country. Pickled herring, Poland and Scandinavia . Because herring is in abundance in Poland and parts of Scandinavia, and because of their silver coloring, many in those nations eat pickled herring at the stroke of midnight to bring a year of prosperity and bounty. Some eat pickled herring in cream sauce, some have it with onions. One special Polish New Year's Eve preparation of pickled herring, called Sledzie Marynowane, is made by soaking whole salt herrings in water for 24 hours and then layering them in a jar with onions, allspice, sugar and white vinegar. Scandinavians will often include herring in a larger midnight smorgasbord with smoked and pickled fish, pate and meatballs. Kransekage, Denmark and Norway . Kransekage, literally wreath cake, is a cake tower composed of many concentric rings of cake layered atop one another, and they are made for New Year's Eve and other special occasions in Denmark and Norway. The cake is made using marzipan, often with a bottle of wine or Aquavit in the center and can be decorated with ornaments, flags and crackers. Those who can't make it to Copenhagen this year for Danish treats should check out Larsen's Danish Bakery in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. They have a long-running mail-order business to accommodate kransekage lovers across the country and carefully pack each ring on the tower individually for easy assembly right before your New Year's Eve feast. A 10-ring cake goes for $86; an 18-ring cake is $150. What are your New Year's dining traditions?

"RALEIGH, North Carolina (CNN) -- A woman whose husband and two sons are accused of plotting ""violent jihad"" overseas said federal authorities tricked her into leaving her home so they could search it. Sabrina Boyd says terrorism allegations against her husband, Daniel, and two sons are false. Sabrina Boyd said Tuesday that she rushed out to a hospital earlier this week after being told her loved ones had been in a serious car accident. The FBI declined to comment on the allegation. Boyd's claims came the day before an eighth suspect in this North Carolina group of alleged terrorism supporters was identified as Jude Kenan Mohammad, a knowledgeable source told CNN Wednesday. Authorities had said Tuesday that they were seeking an eighth suspect in the case, although they would not identify the person, who is described as a U.S. citizen and North Carolina resident in an indictment. Seven men already arrested in the case face charges of supporting terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder abroad. They are scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd, 39, -- who according to the indictment had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as ""Mohammed,"" and Zakariya Boyd, 20. The four others are: Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan, also a U.S.-born citizen; Hysen Sherifi, identified as a native of Kosovo who is a legal permanent resident of the United States; and Hiyad Yaghi and Anes Subasic, both naturalized U.S. citizens. Sabrina Boyd, the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds, said the allegations against her family are false. ""I know that my husband and my sons are free of guilt,"" she told CNN Tuesday. ""I'm hopeful that the truth will come to light.""  Watch as Sabrina Boyd says she's proud of her husband and sons » . She said she had not spoken to her husband or to her son Dylan, but had spoken to Zakariya. ""He seemed OK,"" she said. ""He said, 'They're innocent, the truth will come out.'"" Learning about the arrest of her husband and sons had been particularly distressing because of the manner in which she found out, she said. She said federal authorities sent a person the family knew to her door this week to tell her that her husband and three sons had been sideswiped by a tractor-trailer. The person was wearing a shirt that appeared to be covered in blood, she said, and told her ""it was grave and they were bleeding, and I needed to be rushed immediately to Duke Hospital,"" she said. For Sabrina Boyd, the news was all too familiar: In 2007, her 16-year-old son, Luqman, was killed in a car crash. ""I had already been through this two years prior,"" she said. She said authorities took her, her daughter and pregnant daughter-in-law to the hospital, where she learned that her husband and sons had not been in a car accident. ""When we got to the hospital they brought us around back, separated us, handcuffed us, including my 8-month pregnant daughter[-in-law], and were very rude and then told us, 'They're not dying, they're detained. And you better cooperate with us.'"" She added, ""They used the death of my son to trick me into getting out of my own house so they could just serve a warrant with nobody there."" All eight suspects are accused of plotting ""violent jihad"" overseas, according to the indictment, and are charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people. The indictment makes no reference to a direct threat to individuals or property in the United States, but said the men had practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia. The court document also mentions overseas trips taken by several of the men. According to the indictment, Daniel Boyd and his sons left the United States for Israel in June 2007 to ""engage in violent jihad, but ultimately returned to the United States after failing in their efforts."" It said Yaghi and Hassan also traveled to Israel in June 2007, and that Daniel Boyd lied to Customs and Border Protection agents at the Atlanta, Georgia, and Raleigh airports about intending to meet the two men in the Jewish state. The indictment also said Daniel Boyd traveled to Gaza in March 2006 ""to introduce his son to individuals who also believed that violent jihad was a personal obligation on the part of every good Muslim."" Sabrina Boyd said her husband flew to Israel in 2007 with Zakariya after Luqman's death. Both sons were to have gone, she said. ""They'd always wanted to go to the Holy Land,"" she said. However, she said, Zakariya and Daniel Boyd were detained by Israeli authorities and were deported to France. She offered no details. About a year earlier, Daniel Boyd had taken the couple's youngest son, Noah, to Jerusalem to visit holy sites, she said, saying the trips were not unusual for Muslims, Christians or Jews. The indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan during 1989 to 1992, and learned military-style training in terrorist camps there. He also fought the Soviets in Afghanistan, the indictment says. According to The Washington Post, Daniel Boyd and his brother, Charles, had been sentenced in 1991 in Pakistan to have their right hands and left feet cut off after being convicted of bank robbery. The newspaper reported in October 1991 that the brothers and their families had moved to Peshawar to work with a Muslim relief agency. The country's Supreme Court overturned their convictions, the newspaper reported. CNN's David Mattingly, Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: Eighth suspect named in North Carolina group's 'jihad' plot .

"Zurich, Switzerland (CNN) -- As rail travel grows ever more popular in Switzerland, the country's most important rail station is undergoing a bold transformation to keep up with increasing demand. The Swiss are among the world's top train travelers, second only to the Japanese. Last year, the average Swiss person traveled about 2,000 miles by rail; most of those journeys happened during the morning or evening rush hour. Passenger flows have increased by 30% over the last seven years and 350,000 people now use Zurich's central train station every day. ""You can say the Swiss are train addicts,"" says Daniele Pallecchi, of Swiss Railways. He adds: ""Within the last seven years we had a big increase of passengers using the trains in Switzerland and here in Zurich as well and we need more capacity on the rails and on our trains. So we are building now the cross-city link. ""The cross-city link ensures bigger capacity and shorter time of traveling."" More video: How Swiss trains run like clockwork . When finished, Zurich's cross-city railway line will be over six miles long and will form an integral part of the Swiss network's inter-city axis. It is Switzerland's biggest urban project. At its heart is the new underground ""through"" station -- or ""LÃ¶wenstrasse"" -- built beneath the main station. Here, two new platforms will serve four tracks that will eventually be connected to the main train station. Over the past four years men and machines have been digging under two rivers and a fully functioning rail hub, creating a hole the size of two football fields. ""It's the most challenging job you can imagine,"" says project director Roland Kobel. ""It's not only railways ... almost every section of engineering is realized here: we have tunneling, we have open cuts, we have deep borings."" Kobel says between 500 and 700 people are working on the project at any time, building below ground while the old station continues to function above. Swiss Railway reps say that while work on the cross-city link continues full bore, 98.5% of passengers still reach their destination on time. It's estimated that as many as half a million people will use the station each day by 2020. That's why the cross-city link is crucial: once completed, in 2014, it will match that increase by doubling the capacity of the station.","Last year, the average Swiss person traveled about 2,000 miles by rail .

"(CNN) -- I have been fortunate to have lived and experienced two worlds: My childhood in India -- which in many parts is a world of poverty, infrastructure problems, and a paucity of qualified health-care personnel, a world of many preventable deaths. The other world is the United States, where my time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology exposed me to amazing technologies, tremendous resources to build ""things,"" to build businesses, and where -- for the most part -- there exist reliable systems, processes and medical technology which enable us to save lives, whenever they can be saved. Watch Myshkin Ingawale's TED Talk . The opportunity that exists, one might well be told multiple times, by multiple very enthusiastic and entirely well-meaning people, is to take the best of the West and put it to good use in the so-called East. So, that would mean that, to improve health care in the so-called Third World -- we should take lifesaving medical technologies that the West has developed and transplant these to countries like India. The poster child for this kind of transplant is the mobile revolution in many developing nations like India, which have leapfrogged the rather expensive wired telephony phase altogether, and jumped straight to mobile phones. In India today, about half the population already owns mobile phones. It is not only their primary means of voice communication but also becoming their most important source of all forms of information -- business, media, health ... So can we replicate this kind of success story in health care delivery? TED.com: The universal anaesthesia machine . Can we take the cool technologies developed in Route 128 and in Silicon Valley, put them on Indian soil, amidst lower resource settings, and expect a similarly spectacular outcome in health care? There might be a case to made for this approach, but to date my experience suggests that the problems in health care in the developing world are too complex, too entangled with other issues (social, political, economic) and -- in some cases -- too alien altogether from the Western world perspective -- to have a simple ""tech-transfer"" fix. Also, a similar problem emerges when the best brains in the West, with all the best intentions, design new products intended to solve the problems of the developing world, while not having a full knowledge or context to the problem the product is designed to solve. The story I told in my TED talk was my personal narrative of a team of doctors, engineers and designers who were thrown into the midst of a severe problem -- anemia in children and pregnant women in a rural, underserved part of India. As many as 1 million or more children and pregnant women are dying as direct or indirect result of undiagnosed, untreated, unmonitored anemia. The treatment for anemia is not only well understood, but also widely available -- iron tablets, folic acid, iron injections, supplements and in extreme cases -- blood transfusions. TED.com: Touring a hospital in Nigeria . Many government and WHO-backed schemes (e.g. ""Janani Suraksha Yojana"" in India) exist that provide subsidized health care -- free treatment. In rural India, there is a village health worker (Accredited Social Health Activist) in every village -- a ratio of one for every 1,000 people. The implementation of these health-care schemes is largely on the shoulders of the ASHA workers. In India there are more than 500,000 -- a really big (if not highly qualified medically...) force for doing good. Having experienced the conditions in a village in India, my group of friends -- who eventually set up the startup Biosense Technologies -- developed a simple, hand-held device that the ASHA worker could use to diagnose and monitor anemia noninvasively (without needles) and at the point of care (she could carry the hand-held device door to door). The ToucHb is designed for low-resource settings, requires no medical expertise and is perfect for the quick and affordable anemia screening it is tasked to do. The device emits three wavelengths of light. The light passes through the tissue, and from understanding how much of it is transmitted, how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed, we can figure out how much hemoglobin there is in the blood. Our insight behind the ToucHb product was not merely that anemia needed diagnosing -- this is obvious to every person in public health care. Our insight was not merely that the ASHA worker needed to be empowered to solve problems in her community, and that she was the real centre of the public health system, rather than the doctors sitting in cities and towns -- again, obvious to folks in the development world. Our insight was not merely scientific -- how to develop a product that could measure blood hemoglobin and diagnose anemia all without needles and in the form of a device no bigger than a TV remote control -- there are other scientific approaches and technologies available for noninvasive hemoglobin estimation. TED.com: Your health depends on where you live . Our real insight was that we needed to not only build something that works from a scientific standpoint but also makes sense from a commercial and cultural and political-adoption angle. This was not easy and I cannot point to any single glorious ""aha"" moment in time when it all clicked. All I have are a series of failures -- monuments to our own stupidity, ideas and prototypes and commercial models failing in the lab, in the field, in a government office, at the VC (venture capital) meeting, failing due to some reason from a plethora of reasons in the complex entangled mesh that is India. Slowly, over three years, our team and ToucHb stumbled our way to making the beginnings of impact. We are still stumbling forward, but have been told we are going the right way! I want a thousand stories like ToucHb to emerge to solve the pressing health care needs of the 3 billion underserved people in the world, dying or suffering from completely preventable diseases. I believe neither the ""First World"" or the ""Third World"" can do this alone. The best researchers sitting at MIT or Stanford do not always understand the context and nuances of the developing world's problems they sometimes set out to solve, and the best field people in the developing world do not have the resources and scientific expertise to create robust and cutting-edge technology solutions that scale to the levels of the problem. TED.com: The promise of research with stem cells . There are ways around this impasse, but none are quick or simple: Either technology innovators from the West who propose solutions for the East must follow through and stick it out in the field, to design and implement their vision to the end, or the developing nations must wait for a few more years while their indigenous tech innovation ecosystems mature... In the face of this complexity, I have personally found three simple rules that I have internalized, for tech innovators to create real impact: . 1) Experience the problem: Don't assume you understand the problem. 2) Fail early, fail often: Don't fall in love with your ideas -- expose them as early as possible to data, to real life, and hence to failure. 3) Build a team: Surround yourself with people smarter than you, with very diverse skill sets ... and have fun!

"(CNN) -- The shooting of 26 innocent children and teachers in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, is more horrific than any of us can ever imagine. We ask, like many times before, how such a brutal and irrational act could have happened. Why would anyone do something like this? President Barack Obama wants to take action; our neighbors want to take action. We all want to convince ourselves that the world has not gone mad. We want to find and address the core of the problem. So we look hard for explanations. Some say evil has shown itself -- a simplistic salve. In our hearts, we know that the shooter, Adam Lanza, was not evil personified. We know at this point that he was a withdrawn, socially awkward young man, reportedly with Asperger's syndrome, living with his mother. We would like to think that if only professionals could identify any shooters before they commit any violence, then we could prevent these tragedies. If they had been locked up, then they couldn't have killed anyone. Or if they had been forced to take their medicine, then they wouldn't have gotten to a point of no return. If we can find these people, keep guns away from them, restrict their civil liberties and monitor them closely enough, then we would have solved the problem. This approach won't work. Hindsight is not foresight. The picture is much more complex than simply developing ""profiles."" Knowing this young man's profile wouldn't have told us how likely he was going to walk into a classroom and open fire. Opinion: After tragedy, don't obsess, heal gently . There are a large number of withdrawn, socially awkward young men in our society; some have mental disorders and some don't. We simply cannot predict which ones will go on a shooting rampage. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack; you will probably only know where it is when it pricks your finger. Of those who do have a mental disorder, few of them reach the level of extreme desperation that they want to die and hurt others (very dramatically) in the process. People fluctuate in how distraught or likely they are to commit violence, depending on either deterioration of their mental condition, or, like all of us do, in reaction to events in their lives (a disparaging remark from a co-worker, a lost romantic relationship, etc). We cannot readily determine who might become so desperate as to see mass killings as reasonable. Striking out at others is often a combination of giving up mixed with rage. In one young man whom I knew, it could have gone either way. He walked in front of a train, but he could have as easily hurt many others to relieve his pain and despair. Getting support and services to the people who matter to those with mental disorders is where the answer lies. We will only know what is happening in a troubled person's mind by talking to them regularly before they are desperate. The idea of identifying, ostracizing and restricting them is not only inhuman, but impossible. We need to embrace them as members of our community who are facing immense struggles. But most people with mental disorders aren't in treatment. About 1 in 4 adults in the United States suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year. We aren't, however, willing to invest the resources to provide ongoing outpatient care to them. Besides they may be afraid to reveal problems to professionals who seem out of touch with their lives. Parents of disturbed, struggling children and adolescents need to know and talk to parents in similar situations. These parents know that they may get the telephone call at 2 a.m. with news of some tragic incident, and they need the support of others who understand what they are facing on a daily basis. Opinion: Get serious about mental health care . Looking for individuals with mental illness and their parents only subverts what we all want -- to find out in advance about these incidents and to keep them from happening. By staying in touch with those who are suffering with mental disorder, we are in the best position to help them -- and their parents -- to forestall any possible slip into violence.

"Washington (CNN) -- For parents who are mystified by drugs with names like Spice and bath salts: There's now a kit to help you out. The Partnership at Drugfree.org on Thursday unveiled tools available online to help adults understand synthetic drugs and urged them to talk to kids about their dangers. ""These are threats that were not around when they, themselves, were teenagers,"" said Steve Pasierb, president and CEO of the drug education organization. The kits include a podcast and video, a slide cast and a printable guide with information on street names for drugs, what kinds of medical problems they can cause, and tips on how to tell whether their children might be using synthetic marijuana or stimulants. Pasierb and Gil Kerlikowske, director of National Drug Control Policy, met with officials from government and anti-drug groups to discuss how to combat the synthetic drug problem. Among those participating were officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Department of Health and Human Services; the State Department and the Defense Department. ""The use of synthetic drugs like Spice, K2 and bath salts are a serious threat to the nation's public health and safety,"" Kerlikowske told reporters after the meeting. ""Make no mistake, these drugs are dangerous and can cause serious harm."" Users of the illegal substances can experience seizures, nausea, elevated blood pressure, and paranoid behavior. Poison control centers were among the first to sound the alarm about synthetics. ""In 2010 our centers responded to 3,200 calls about synthetic drugs,"" said Deborah Carr, executive director of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. ""In 2011 that number increased to 13,000. Sixty percent of the cases involved patients under the age of 25."" Amy Stillwell of Bowling Green, Kentucky, said in August her daughter, Ashley, took just one hit of 7H, a type of potpourri often smoked as a marijuana substitute, that some friends had bought at a hookah bar. According to Stillwell, her daughter told her she became temporarily paralyzed and unresponsive, and her friends tried to revive her by pouring water on her head. The recent high school graduate told her mother she was conscious enough to hear what her friends were saying, and she claimed they discussed the possibility of having to dispose of her body. Ashley eventually came around enough to talk to her parents on the phone and they came to get her. She was briefly hospitalized. Kerlikowske called on Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the substances. The House of Representatives has passed such a bill, but it's stuck in the Senate. The DEA used emergency powers to temporarily ban the drugs, but Kerlikowske said that's not a long-term solution. In December the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported one out of nine high school seniors had used K2 or Spice in the past year, making it the second-most commonly used illegal drug after marijuana.

"(CNN) -- Sony Corp. lost a record $5.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in March, the company announced today -- lower than beleaguered electronics giant's previous estimates of finishing the year $6.4 billion in the red. Still, it was the fourth straight year the company finished the year with a loss. Sony is not the only Japanese electronics giant struggling: On Friday, Panasonic Corp. is expected to announce nearly $10 billion in annual losses, according to estimates released by the company earlier this year. Both companies have struggled with ailing television manufacturing divisions, which have lost to lower cost rivals like Samsung and LG, and are hampered by a rising yen which has cut repatriated profits from overseas sales. Sony's television division has lost money for the past eight years. The search for Sony's soul . Earlier this week, shares of Sony stock slipped to its lowest level in 25 years. Both Sony and Panasonic have announced restructuring plans and have new leaders running the company. New CEO Kazuo Hirai took the helm on April 1 and promised last month to cut 10,000 jobs -- about 6% of its workforce -- in the next year. The company predicts a 30 billion yen ($376.5 million) net profit in the current fiscal year. Kazuhiro Tsuga was appointed new CEO of Panasonic earlier this year. Both Tsuga and Hirai have announced plans to cut the volume of televisions the companies produce. The Japanese economic newspaper Nikkei reported Wednesday Panasonic may swing to a $626 million profit this fiscal year, causing the company's share price to rise nearly 5%. The company wouldn't comment on the report, saying in a statement it would release figures on Friday.","Sony lost a record $5.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in March .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If new is a necessity, tech is your god and money no object then a $10,000 Vertu smartphone will probably catch your eye. The British-based luxury mobile phone maker unveiled the Vertu Ti this week. Its sapphire-crystal screen is virtually scratchproof, says the company, while a titanium casing helps keep data safe and sound. But in this 21st century mobile phone paradigm in which consumers buy a new phone every few years -- and where new products roll out every year (or even less) -- does it make sense to splurge on a swank smartphone with a price tag closer to that of a small car or several months' apartment rent? ""If you are interested in something which is different, unique"" then this device might be for you, said Vertu CEO Perry Oosting to CNN's Nina dos Santos. The Vertu Ti (pronounced ""tee-eye"") emphasizes the value of ""durable"" over ""disposable"" materials that a consumer might expect from the luxury category, added Oosting. ""More the touch and the feel and the sensory experience."" And with the sensory experience comes luxury services that go beyond that of a mainstream smartphone including a concierge service at the push of a button and encrypted voice calls to protect your company trade secrets. Yet another selling point is the software that powers the Ti. Former Vertu phones ran on the now-passÃ© Symbian software. The Vertu Ti, meanwhile, runs on an Android operating system in a sign of its separation from former parent company Nokia. The flailing Finnish mobile giant lost $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2012 and announced last June that it would sell Vertu to private equity group EQT VI. ""We live in a world where there's open operating systems that are quite open to use,"" explained Oosting on the new angle to Android. ""Android is just delivering great software. It's very democratic."" But while the operating system is open to all, the costly Vertu clearly is not. Around the world, only about 320,000 Vertu smartphones have been sold, said CNN's dos Santos, a number that pales in comparison to Samsung and Apple, the global smartphone market leaders. For all of 2012, Samsung sold more than 215 million smartphones for a 30.3% global market share and top ranking, according to IDC Worldwide. Apple sold nearly 136 million smartphones in 2012 for a 19.1% slice of global market share. Even Vertu's former parent company Nokia sold more than 35 million smartphones last year. But Vertu's CEO simply says he does not envisage the masses talking and texting on a Ti. ""Absolutely not. That's never our drive. We're not after market share. We're not after high quantities,"" said Oosting. ""We want to deliver an authentic, made in Hampshire, made by one person, a unique proposition that is a true sensory experience in terms of the experience of the device."" And consumers who buy the Ti will surely want to avoid losing their pricy purchase. Then again, if they can afford one, they might be well-positioned to afford a replacement.","Vertu Ti boasts sapphire-crystal screen, titanium casing .

"(CNN) -- Heavy flooding in Australia caused by torrential rains has forced mass evacuations from towns along the country's east coast, with critically-ill patients and newborns from one hospital being airlifted to safety. The floods, which came in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Oswald, have killed four people so far, including a three-year-old boy who died after being hit by a falling tree in Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Bundaberg, a coastal town about 360 kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Brisbane, was particularly hard hit, with more than 2,000 homes inundated with water and a similar number of people evacuated, said mayor Mal Forman. ""We're like a little island. We have water either side of us and the water is flowing rapidly,"" Forman told CNN by telephone from his office in Bundaberg's town center. ""People are very bewildered."" Some of the town's roads were under six or seven meters of water and some one-storey houses were completely covered, Forman added. Bundaberg's hospital was also evacuated as the flood waters continued to advance. A spokeswoman for Australia's Department of Health said that about 130 patients were being airlifted to hospitals in Brisbane as a precaution. If the floodwaters reached 10.1 meters, it would affect the hospital sewage system, making the hospital clinically unsafe, the spokeswoman said. ""I think they are expected to rise to 9.8 meters and that's a bit too close for comfort. We started transferring the most critical patients last night. The rest will be evacuated today."" Around 10 newborn babies and at-risk patients were taken to Brisbane in the early hours of Tuesday, while two C-130 aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force arrived in Bundaberg later that morning to evacuate the remaining patients and some pregnant women nearing full term. Evacuations have also been ordered in the town of Grafton in New South Wales, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Sydney. In Brisbane, residents were being asked to limit water use after a water treatment plant was clogged up by silted water. But the city appeared to escape major flooding after waters peaked at a lower level than forecast. An aerial photo taken above Bundaberg posted by Queensland State Premier Campbell Newman on his Twitter account showed vast swathes of land under water. ""Extent of the flooding is staggering,"" he said in the post. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that 100 Australian military personnel had been deployed to Bundaberg, where the Burnett River is expected to peak at around 9.6 meters on Tuesday, breaking a 1942 record. ""Currently it's sitting at 9.525 meters, we believe it has just peaked half an hour ago. It's a record for us,"" Forman said. A dozen helicopters, some equipped with night vision, were used to rescue 1,000 stranded residents, many plucked from their rooftops. ""There's debris everywhere, the trampolines are everywhere, all the kids stuff is everywhere -- it's just gone,"" Melissa Smith, who was among those winched to safety, told ABC News. Residents and officials are being particularly cautious, after flooding caused by heavy rains in late 2010 and 2011 left much of Queensland, known as the ""Sunshine State"", under water. Those floods killed 35 people. More areas are expected to face flooding later in the week as swollen rivers and tributaries make their way toward the coast. Extra police have been deployed in flood-hit regions to prevent looting.","Thousands evacuated as flood waters continue to rise in Australia .

"(CNN) -- A defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was arraigned late Monday night after being accused of having a semiautomatic weapon in his suitcase at New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. Da'Quan Bowers, 22, was charged with second-degree criminal possession by Judge Toko Serita in New York Criminal Court late Monday night, according to Meris Campbell of the Queens District Attorney's Office. Bail was set at $10,000, Campbell said. Video recorded outside the courthouse Monday night showed Bowers getting into a car and driving away after the arraignment. Bowers was arrested at an airport ticket counter with a .40-caliber handgun, according to Rudy King, a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport. Campbell said there were no bullets in the gun, but there were bullets near the gun in a separate location. According to New York firearms law, if bullets are found next to the weapon, it is considered loaded, Campbell said. Bowers was headed to North Carolina and was flying on US Airways, Campbell said. In a statement CNN obtained from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Monday, General Manager Mark Dominik said: ""We are aware of the situation and are gathering information. We will withhold comment until we know all the facts."" Calls were not immediately returned Monday from Bowers' defense attorney, Dennis Coppin. Campbell said that if bail is posted, Bowers will be able to leave New York if he chooses. His next court date is April 25. It was unclear Monday night whether Bowers had a permit for the gun.

"(CNN) -- Greg Mortenson, under fire for allegedly fabricating details in his best-seller ""Three Cups of Tea,"" agreed in a settlement to give the charity he co-founded more than $1 million, nearly a year after Montana's attorney general began investigating the organization's financial affairs. The report issued Thursday notes the ""accusations of inaccuracies and falsehoods in the narratives"" of his books ""were not the subject"" of the investigation. But Attorney General Steve Bullock said his office's investigation did find ""serious internal problems in the management"" of the Bozeman, Montana-based Central Asia Institute that Mortenson helped create. Under the terms of the deal, Mortenson must repay more than $1 million to the charity within three years. This comes after state investigators determined Mortenson was ""double-dipping"" when he didn't reimburse the institute for travel expenses he got from sponsors. Their report also stated he did not pay the charity promised royalties and charged it ""substantial personal expenses"" -- like ""L.L. Bean clothing, iTunes, luggage, luxurious accommodations and even vacations."" ""When employees challenged him by attempting to get him to provide documentation to substantiate expenditures or otherwise to comply with sound management practices, he resisted and/or ignored them,"" the report's authors wrote. ""Some of them ended up leaving."" While he can remain an employee of the Central Asia Institute, Mortenson can ""no longer oversee financial aspects of the charity or serve as a voting member of the board of directors,"" according to the attorney general's office. The Central Asia Institute's two other board members will step down after a transitional period of 12 months and a new seven-member board will be appointed in its place, according to the settlement. Its interim director, Anne Beyersdorfer, a ""longtime family friend of Mortenson,"" will eventually give way to a new chief executive, Bullock told reporters Thursday. In addition, the charity faces ""more organizational and financial controls"" and will be monitored by the attorney general for three years. This comes after the attorney general concluded that Mortenson ""failed to fulfill some of his responsibilities"" as executive director, and gave a similar assessment of the institute's board. Mortenson shot to worldwide fame with ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Fight Terrorism and Build Nations ... One School at a Time."" The book describes his getting lost in an effort to climb the world's second-tallest mountain, K2, being rescued by Pakistanis in the village of Korphe and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls. About 4 million versions were sold of the paperback version alone, which spent 57 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list, the attorney general's report said. The riveting story led to the creation of the Central Asia Institute, an organization that endeavors to improve girls' education in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last spring, however, the charity and Mortenson found themselves on the defensive against accusations of mismanagement and exaggeration, if not outright fabrication, of key sections from the book. This followed a critical report on CBS ""60 Minutes"" in which Jon Krakauer -- the author of the best-selling ""Into Thin Air,"" who said he had donated $75,000 to the Central Asia Institute -- said Mortenson's account is ""a beautiful story, and it's a lie."" Days after that report, Montana's attorney general announced he was launching an investigation amid ""concerns ... raised about the management and financial affairs of the Central Asia Institute."" The organization recorded income of $14 million in 2009, the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals, many of whom were no doubt inspired by Mortenson's books. However, in 2009, less than half that money actually went to building schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and $1.7 million went to promote Mortenson's books, according to the institute's board of directors. Mortenson resigned as his charity's executive director last November. His successor in that post, Beyersdorfer, acknowledged in a statement on the Central Asia Institute's website that ""this past year brought unprecedented challenges for all of us."" She said that the charity is ""pleased"" that an agreement has been signed ""resolving"" the attorney general's investigation. ""While we respectfully disagree with some of the analysis and conclusions in the (attorney general's) report, we look forward to moving ahead as an even stronger organization,"" Beyersdorfer wrote. She spoke highly of the work the charity has continued to do, as well as the role that Mortenson has had -- and may continue to have on its operations going forward. ""Greg and our overseas managers have dedicated their lives to helping fulfill countless dreams and aspirations, and we are honored to continue our life-changing work together,"" said Beyersdorfer. Montana's attorney general stressed Thursday that he believes the charity has and can continue to do ""good things,"" adding he hoped the settlement agreement will help restore ""donor confidence."" ""I think it's a fair settlement that it's in the best interests not only of the charity, but of the children of Afghanistan and others that the Central Asia Institute serves,"" said Bullock.","NEW: Montana's attorney general says the settlement can restore ""donor confidence""

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy sent residents along the East Coast running for cover this week. For those households that count animals among their family members, the storm brought an extra worry: What do I do with my pet? The Swobodzien family of Wall Township, New Jersey, was faced with that potentially life-altering question as the storm approached. The Swobodziens' 5-year-old cockapoo, Penny, is black with a white chest and, at only 12 pounds, the runt of her litter. ""She is also my fourth daughter,"" said Arletta Swobodzien. The family's neighborhood was one of the first in the area to evacuate before Sandy hit, so they searched for options to keep Penny with them while they cleared out. ""We went to the first shelter and I told them, 'We have a dog at home, can she come here?' They said no. Make sure she has food and water, leave her,"" said Arletta. ""When they said leave her, I just couldn't help it, I cried."" Include pets in your emergency plan . Gulf Coast residents faced the same dilemma seven years ago. Hurricane Katrina left countless family pets dead, stranded or homeless. When faced with the decision to leave their animals behind, some people decided to stay, and some may have perished because of that choice, said Tim Rickey of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""People would never evacuate a home and leave behind their children or their spouse,"" said Rickey, senior director of field investigations and response at the ASPCA. ""Pets are family members. Society continues to evolve, and local governments know now that if they don't consider the animals, they may be putting residents in danger."" Lessons learned on the Gulf brought about the 2006 Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act. The PETS Act made it mandatory for local and state governments to include plans for pets in their emergency procedures and opened the gates for FEMA funds to be put toward the welfare of animals in disaster zones. ""After Katrina and with the PETS Act, we have tremendous support now from the USDA, FEMA and the federal government that just did not exist in 2005,"" said Rickey. Niki Dawson of the Humane Society of the United States said local governments have been encouraging people to take pets with them when they evacuate, which helps prevent some of the dangers pets faced during Katrina. Both animal welfare agencies applauded New York City for mandating that all city shelters and transit allow pets entrance leading up to and during the superstorm. ""It is a model that we hope the rest of the nation follows in the future,"" said Rickey. The PETS Act gives first responders and pet owners more to work with, but ultimately local governments must decide what provisions to put in place. That could mean anything from relying on local animal shelters to investing in mobile pet rescue units. Katrina, Joplin survivors offer advice to Sandy victims . ""Most animal shelters run at 100% capacity even when it is not a disaster situation, which means they couldn't possibly take in private pets. But under the PETS Act, that state will have fulfilled their obligation,"" said Dawson. The second line of defense comes in the form of volunteer networks and non-government groups. The ASPCA, in partnership with Petsmart Charities, has set up a distribution center in Syracuse, New York, and contributed more than 4,000 supplies to local rescue groups, primarily in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. In New York City and on Long Island alone, the ASPCA now has more than 400 owned animals sheltered in 40 evacuation centers. In addition to shelter assistance, helping animals means getting out in the field. The ASPCA has two transport trailers and three water rescue teams on standby. The Humane Society has responders in New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Delaware. They are joined by hundreds of other organizations and many dedicated volunteers. When animal rescue groups can't get out in the field, they increasingly turn to social media. In Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, storm refugees could find pet-friendly shelters by following the Humane Society on its media platforms. Twitter has allowed for quick communication. When the Humane Society found out via Twitter that a Connecticut town instructed residents to leave pets behind during a mandatory evacuation, the society sprung into action and persuaded local officials to open up an animal shelter to owned pets and change the evacuation notice. ""That community and those officials should be commended for turning on a dime to accommodate the needs of their community,"" said Dawson. Local response to the PETS Act may vary, but there are universal guidelines that all pet owners should follow during a storm, said Rickey: ""Keep your pets on a leash and close to you. There may be contaminated water and spoiled food. It is critical that pet owners should have a backup number outside of your region available.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department is countering Russian criticism of how American authorities are handling of case of a 3-year-old adopted boy who died in Texas. ""What is very troubling about this case is that the Russians are making very wild accusations against the (adoptive) parents before they have information,"" a senior State Department official told CNN. ""I think it is irresponsible of the Russians to say the parents did x, y or z before we find out what happened. In West Texas, the Ector County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating because of the ""suspicious"" nature of the boy's death, investigator Kim Harrington said. Russian officials Tuesday met with the boy's unnamed adoptive parents and his surviving brother, also adopted from Russia, after the State Department coordinated the session through Texas Child Protective Services. U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, a Russian governor halted the foreign adoption of orphans in his region after the boy's death. ""If we know the facts and they are as the Russians claimed, they have every right to be upset just as we would be upset if an American child was adopted in Russia and the same thing happened. But there shouldn't be a rush to judgment when these parents might be in terrible pain over what happened to their son,"" said the State Department official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive issue. The case of the 3-year-old's death has aggravated State Department efforts push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. That pending law would ban adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. ""This is a very difficult case for us and the timing couldn't be worse,"" the State Department official said. ""We are trying to revolve the rest of these cases, but having a case like this makes it more difficult."" Officials said, including the death in Texas, 20 of about 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two decades have died in the United States. ""We share one hundred percent the Russian concerns about these cases of death and abuse,"" another senior State Department official said. Acknowledging that 20 Russian children have died with U.S. families, the official added, ""We do not disagree this is unacceptable."" State Department officials said they hope to travel to Moscow to discuss the pending adoption cases. Adoptions halted in one Russian region . The governor of Russia's Pskov region is not waiting for the national ban to take effect, and announced Tuesday that all orphan adoptions to foreigners would be temporarily stopped. ""Another cruel crime against a child was committed in the United States,"" Pskov Gov. Andrey Turchak said. The boy was born on January 9, 2010, and died on January 21, said Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights. Dolgov said the child suffered injuries to his head and legs, as well as to his abdomen and internal organs. The wounds, he said, ""could only be caused by strong blows."" Authorities in Texas have not released such details. But they have offered some specifics. The child was found unresponsive at his residence and his mother called 911, Ector County Forensic Death Investigator Sondra Woolf said. The boy was transported to the emergency room by the fire department, then pronounced dead by an emergency room doctor, she said. The body has been sent to Fort Worth for an autopsy, and results could take weeks, she added. Patrick Crimmins, of Texas Child Protective Services, said his office is investigating allegations including physical abuse and neglectful supervision, or neglect. Sgt. Gary Duesler, a spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said his office also is investigating. No arrests have been made, and officials are waiting for autopsy results, he said. Governor wants brother sent back to Russia . The boy's death is confirmation of Russia's decision to ban U.S. adoptions, the Pskov governor said. ""We need to do everything and create all necessary conditions for the orphans to find families here in our Pskov region and in Russia,"" he said. Tuchak said his office is working to bring the brother back to his native Russia, even though the American parents have not been charged with any crime or publicly named. ""You need to start taking the necessary procedures today,"" Turchak said. The brother ""can't stay in the United States. With American legislation, he would be transferred from one hand to another. It's an additional trauma for the kid. He's not a dog or a cat."" Texas Child Protective Services says its top priority is the surviving child or children at the home, Crimmins said. ""At any time, if we feel the surviving child or children may be at risk, we can remove immediately,"" he said. A call seeking comment to a number listed for the boy's adoptive parents was not immediately returned. A voice message told reporters the parents would have no comment. In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law the measure that would ban the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families. It is scheduled to take effect in January 2014. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions. The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, Russia's semiofficial RIA Novosti news agency said. And it imposes sanctions on U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. The move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on December 14. That law, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center. Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing what they say are the 20 deaths of adopted Russian children since the 1990s. The Russian public supported the bill, with 56% of respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation saying they backed the ban, RIA Novosti reported. In 2010, an American woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister David Cameron visited the site of the infamous 1919 Amritsar massacre by British troops in India on Wednesday -- but those hoping he might apologize for the atrocity were disappointed. Cameron, the first serving British prime minister to visit Amritsar, a Sikh holy city in the northwestern state of Punjab, laid a wreath at a memorial to the hundreds killed in the massacre. Writing in a book of condolences at the Jallianwala Bagh memorial, he described the massacre as ""a deeply shameful event in British history."" He added, ""We must never forget what happened here."" However, he did not give a formal apology for the atrocity, which occurred while India was part of the British Empire. A spokesman for Cameron said the British state had always described the massacre as monstrous, but that ""we need to be careful about going around apologizing for things that happened 40 years before the prime minister was born."" Cameron's trip to India is focused on promoting closer trade and business links. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, previously visited Amritsar in 1997. In 1920, then-cabinet minister Winston Churchill condemned the massacre as ""an episode which appears to me to be without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire ... It is an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation."" The atrocity occurred when a British Army general ordered troops to open fire to disperse a crowd of unarmed protesters who had gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar. A report by a British-led committee in the wake of the massacre put the number killed at close to 400, with three to four times as many people injured. Indian observers put the number killed at more than 1,000.","David Cameron visits a memorial to a 1919 massacre in the Indian city of Amritsar .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian authorities added murder charges Saturday for suspects in the brutal gang rape that led to the death of a 23-year-old woman and sent outraged protesters to the streets. The suspects already faced rape charges. Six people, including a minor and a bus driver, have been arrested in connection with the rape that occurred in New Delhi this month. Throngs of people have protested for days, demanding more protection for women and punishment for those behind the assault. The woman was airlifted to Singapore earlier this week after she was treated for injuries in a New Delhi hospital. Singapore doctors said she died ""peacefully"" early Saturday, surrounded by her family and Indian embassy officials. Read more: Doctor: Young woman gang-raped in India dies . The woman had been in ""extremely critical condition"" since her arrival Thursday and took a turn for the worse, said Dr. Kelvin Loh, chief executive officer at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. ""She had suffered from severe organ failure following serious injuries to her body and brain,"" Loh said. ""She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds, but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome."" The victim's body was returned to India, where it was cremated Sunday in a private funeral, Home Ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi expressed its condolences Saturday. ""As we honor the memory of this brave young woman, we also recommit ourselves to changing attitudes and ending all forms of gender-based violence, which plagues every country in the world."" Authorities have not released the name of the woman, but Indian protesters are calling her Damini, which means ""lightning"" in Hindi.

Attackers assaulted the woman and her male companion on a bus December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said. The male companion was eventually discharged from a hospital. Last week, police said the woman recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed. But she had more surgery to wash out infection in her abdomen, her doctors said. The death spurred an outpouring of sadness and calls for action to ensure change and punishment of her rapists.

Fearing massive protests following the death, police tightened security in the capital and barricaded some sites of previous rallies. Authorities said demonstrations are only allowed at Jantar Mantar observatory and the Ram Lila grounds. Police banned protests in Raisina Hills and closed roads leading to the area, fearing a possible repeat of the furious, large-scale demonstrations that occurred last weekend. Ten metro stations also were ordered closed, authorities said. Additional protests were planned Sunday in several cities, activists told CNN affiliate IBN. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered his ""deepest condolences."" ""We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated,"" he said, referring to the widespread protests. ""It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel ... these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.""

Reported rape cases in India -- where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have increased drastically over the past four decades, from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone had 572 rapes reported last year and more than 600 in 2012. One such recent case involved a 17-year-old girl who said she was gang-raped during the Hindu festival of Diwali on November 13. A formal case wasn't registered by police until 14 days later. The girl committed suicide Wednesday by ingesting poison, according to authorities in the Patiala district of Punjab, in northern India. In her suicide note, she blamed her alleged rapists. Three suspects -- including a female accomplice -- have been arrested. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation, on the streets and elsewhere, said Seema Sirohi of the Indian Council on Global Relations. ""There are a lot of reasons why this happens, but the patriarchal system is one, a lack of policing is another and general treatment of women is not equal to men, even though it may be so under the law,"" Sirohi said. Human Rights Watch said the gang rape highlights the widespread problem of sexual violence in India. ""The government needs to act now to prevent sexual assault, aggressively investigate and prosecute perpetrators, and ensure the dignified treatment of survivors,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for the organization. The Indian government announced plans Thursday to ""name and shame"" convicted rapists by posting their names, images and addresses on official websites, according to the Times of India. And the Cabinet plans to set up a commission to look into rape cases and suggest measures to improve women's safety. This group has three months to submit its report to the government.

"London (CNN) -- The extradition of honeymoon killing suspect Shrien Dewani to South Africa was temporarily halted Friday on mental health grounds, the High Court in London said. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa, while they were on honeymoon in 2010. The businessman, from Bristol, has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing. British Home Secretary Theresa May ordered Dewani's extradition in September, but he appealed to the High Court, saying it would breach his human rights under European law. His appeal was based on ""the effect of his extradition on his mental illness and the lack of facilities for its treatment, but also on the high risk of HIV/AIDS infection and attack, particularly sexual violence, from other inmates,"" according to the High Court. The court heard from psychiatric experts that Dewani was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and was considered to have tried to take his own life early last year. The judges' ruling said, ""In our view, the medical evidence as to the unusual combination of PTSD and depression to such a severe degree and the appellant's other conditions was clear that extradition would present a real and significant risk to the life of the appellant."" However, Dewani should be extradited to face criminal proceedings in South Africa once he recovers, which seems likely to happen in a reasonable time, the ruling said. ""His mental illness apart, it is plainly in the interests of justice that the appellant be tried in South Africa as soon as he is fit to be tried,"" it said. The judges dismissed the argument relating to the risk of sexual violence and HIV/AIDS infection after hearing from experts on the South African prison system.

"(CNN) -- The death of actor Jeff Conaway was ruled accidental by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office on Monday. Conaway, who was in the TV series ""Taxi"" and the movie ""Grease,"" died May 27 after being found unresponsive 17 days earlier, his manager said. The accidental death came as a result of the drugs found in his urine when he was admitted to the hospital on May 10, according to the report. It also stated that it is not known how long Conaway's brain was without oxygen before the actor was taken to the hospital, and that he ""may have aspirated on his own vomit."" Pneumonia was initially ruled the cause of death, and the doctor who treated him for drug addiction for years said his dependence on prescription painkillers eventually cost him his life. ""Jeff was a severe, severe opiate addict with chronic pain, one of the most serious and dangerous combination of problems you could possibly interact with,"" Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist, said during a taping for a May ""Dr. Drew"" show on HLN. ""The pain seemed to be motivating him back to the opiates, and I told him for years that it was going to kill him,"" Pinsky said. In the weeks before his death, Conaway, 60, suffered from pneumonia and sepsis. He was in a medically induced coma in an Encino, California, hospital for two weeks, manager Phil Brock said. His family surrounded Conaway in his hospital room on May 26 when he was taken off life support, Brock said. Conaway's struggle with alcohol and drug addiction was chronicled in 2008 on the TV reality show ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew."" ""What happens is, like with most opiate addicts, eventually they take a little too much, not much more than usual, and they aspirate, so what's in their mouth gets into their lungs,"" Pinsky said. ""That causes a rapidly progressing and overwhelming pneumonia that they usually don't know that they have, because they're sort of too out of it because of the drugs. And by the time they get to the hospital, it's too late. That's what happened with Jeff."" There was no evidence he ever intentionally overdosed, Pinsky said.

"London (CNN) -- As the scandal over the discovery of horse meat in products labeled as pure beef widened, the European Union's health chief vowed Wednesday to put in place a plan to restore consumer confidence. ""The issue before us today is therefore overwhelmingly one of fraudulent labeling rather than one of safety,"" Tonio Borg said in a statement after an emergency meeting in Belgium with authorities from France, Romania, Holland, Luxembourg and Britain. He noted that EU legislation allows horse meat to be used for the production of minced meat and meat preparations, ""however, it has to be declared on the label."" It is the responsibility of EU member states to check on whether a product presents a risk and complies with the law, Borg said. In the case of horse meat, the commission has checked on whether member states have complied with requirements about hygiene and residues of veterinary drugs, he said. ""Analyses are under way to identify the possible presence of residues of veterinary drugs, especially where unlabeled horse meat has been found,"" he said. A meeting of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health is scheduled for Friday, he said. ""This meeting will provide a forum to ascertain the precise state-of-play of the ongoing investigations in the member states, and enable discussions on a possible coordinated response,"" he said. The commission will recommend to the standing committee a plan that will include widespread testing ""to restore the confidence of all European consumers,"" he said. The plan ""should be communicated by member states by 15 April,"" he said. The plan will recommend that member states ensure that ""any misleading labeling practices"" be identified, and will ask, ""as a preventive measure,"" that member states ensure that any residues of the veterinary drug phenylbutazone be identified in establishments handling raw horse meat ""so as to unearth any related safety concern."" The member states should then report their findings back to the commission, he said. The talks in Brussels came a day after British police and health officials raided a slaughterhouse and meat company as part of the investigation into how horse meat ended up in products identified as beef. The slaughterhouse, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, is believed to have supplied horse carcasses to Farmbox Meats Ltd., a Welsh firm that then sold the meat as beef for kebabs and burgers. Authorities have suspended operations at both facilities and seized all remaining meat and company files, which include a client list. Neither company was immediately available for comment. ""I ordered an audit of all horse-producing abattoirs in the UK after this issue first arose last month and I was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers,"" Andrew Rhodes, Food Standards Agency director of operations, said Tuesday. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson called the revelations ""absolutely shocking."" ""It's totally unacceptable if any business in the UK is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef,"" he said. ""I expect the full force of the law to be brought down on anyone involved in this kind of activity."" In a written statement to parliament, Paterson said Wednesday that both the raided businesses had a legitimate trade in horse meat, ""but investigations so far indicate that horse meat has been used in UK produce as though it is beef."" Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. They included lasagna sold by frozen food giant Findus and spaghetti bolognese sold by UK supermarket giant Tesco, both made by French supplier Comigel. The industry was already reeling from a bombshell last month, when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in a number of hamburger products. Investigations are under way in France, Sweden and Britain. In Romania, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Monday that the two slaughterhouses in the country that were initially suspected to have links to the horse meat scandal never had direct contact with Comigel and have done nothing illegal. ""This tendency to throw the responsibility as far away as possible, eventually to the new members (of the European Union), to countries that might have a weaker PR policy, is something that bothers me,"" he said. Minister of Agriculture Daniel Constantin said there was no evidence of mislabeling in Romania. Comigel has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. But CEO Erick Lehagre told French news agency Agence France-Presse on Sunday that a French supplier ""fooled"" his company. ""We were victims,"" he told AFP. This month, Britain's National Beef Association called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that labels bear the words ""United Kingdom origin."" British food companies have been told to test their beef products for ""authenticity"" and report back to authorities by Friday. British supermarket chain Waitrose said Wednesday that it had ""in recent weeks"" removed from its shelves frozen meatballs labeled as beef after tests indicated that two batches may have contained pork. But tests revealed no horse meat in its meatballs or frozen beef burgers, it said. In the United States, Congress effectively prohibited the slaughtering of horses for human consumption in 2007, by denying the use of federal funds to inspect horses destined to become food, a 2011 Government Accountability Office report said. The legal maneuver does not preclude horse owners from selling to slaughterhouses in Canada and Mexico, and the GAO said in a report that many Americans have taken advantage of that opportunity. ""From 2006 through 2010, U.S. horse exports for slaughter increased by 148 and 660% to Canada and Mexico, respectively,"" the report said. ""As a result, nearly the same number of U.S. horses was transported to Canada and Mexico for slaughter in 2010 -- nearly 138,000 -- as was slaughtered before domestic slaughter ceased."" CNN's Kat Kinsman in New York, Susannah Palk and Kendra Wates in London and journalist Liliana Ciobanu in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report.","NEW: EU's Tonio Borg says the issue is about fraudulent labeling rather than safety .

"(CNN) -- Two of the most influential papers for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire -- the first two states to weigh in at the polls in 2008 -- both endorsed John McCain in the Republican presidential race, but differed in their choice in the Democratic contest. The Des Moines Register backs Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picks Barack Obama. The Des Moines Register backed Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picked Barack Obama, in excerpts of Sunday's editorials posted on their papers' Web sites Saturday night. The Iowa caucuses are January 3, and New Hampshire's primary follows five days later. The Globe's editorial board dismissed concerns over the Illinois senator's relative lack of Washington experience. ""It is true that all the other Democratic contenders have more conventional resumes, and have spent more time in Washington,"" the board wrote. ""But that exposure has tended to give them a sense of government's constraints. Obama is more open to its possibilities."" But the Register's editorial board -- which noted that Obama ""demonstrates the potential to be a fine president"" -- still gave the edge to the senator from New York, saying it made the nods in both parties' primaries based on competence and readiness to lead. ""When Obama speaks before a crowd, he can be more inspirational than Clinton,"" the board wrote. ""Yet, with his relative inexperience, it's hard to feel as confident he could accomplish the daunting agenda that lies ahead."" The Iowa paper's endorsement is widely viewed as a major boost for Clinton, and a blow to the campaign of former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, whose Register endorsement during the 2004 race was followed by a surprisingly strong showing in the state's Democratic caucuses. Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN's Mike Roselli that the campaign was ""not surprised"" by the Register's decision, adding ""that it was a bigger surprise to get the Globe's,"" and noting that the Des Moines paper ""said good things about us."" Obama told CNN, ""I think we are doing pretty good. We split it today between the Globe and the Register."" The Clinton campaign immediately sent out a news release containing the full text of the paper's endorsement, which took Edwards to task for recent campaign trail rhetoric, writing that ""We too seldom saw the 'positive, optimistic' campaign we found appealing in 2004."" ""Obama, [Clinton's] chief rival, inspired our imaginations,"" the Register board wrote. ""But it was Clinton who inspired our confidence."" Clinton spokesman Mark Daley told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux that the campaign is incredibly pleased and honored. ""But we know we have a few weeks left to go before the caucuses and a lot of work to do,"" Daley said, adding that after Clinton's Thursday debate performance, her Friday endorsement by Iowa's Democratic Rep. Leonard Boswell and Saturday's Register nod, ""we feel good about our campaign heading into the final weeks."" The three Democrats are battling for the lead in Iowa, placing within just a few points of one another in most recent state polls.  Watch a report about who might win in Iowa » . On the Republican side, the Register's board wrote that the endorsement went to the senator from Arizona because ""time after time, McCain has stuck to his beliefs in the face of opposition from other elected leaders and the public. ""The force of John McCain's moral authority could go a long way toward restoring Americans' trust in government and inspiring new generations to believe in the goodness and greatness of America,"" they wrote. Meanwhile, the Globe's board passed over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, saying that while McCain's views might differ from theirs, his ""honesty has served him well."" ""As a lawmaker and as a candidate, he has done more than his share to transcend partisanship and promote an honest discussion of the problems facing the United States,"" the board wrote. In 2004, the newspaper stuck with the native son on the ballot, giving the nod in the Democratic primary to Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, who went on to win the New Hampshire primary. The Boston Globe's endorsements are influential in neighboring New Hampshire, especially the southern part of the state, where many residents make the daily weekday commute to work in Boston. And the endorsement weighs even greater with Democratic voters there, since the state's main newspaper -- the New Hampshire Union Leader -- has a conservative editorial board and makes only one primary endorsement, which is almost always a Republican. McCain's Globe endorsement follows a recent nod from the New Hampshire Union Leader. Political pundits almost left McCain for dead this summer, after his campaign nearly ran out of cash and hemorrhaged staff, and the candidate sank in the polls. Now, the senator is in second place or tied for second in the most recent Granite State polls. McCain won New Hampshire's Republican primary during his 2000 presidential run. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Memo to Kathie Lee Gifford and the ""Today"" show from the Queen of Soul: Do some research before you talk about me! During the fourth hour of NBC's morning show on Monday, co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford were talking with E! correspondent Jason Kennedy about Aretha Franklin wanting to be a judge on ""American Idol,"" a story which CNN first reported. Gifford emphatically said today's generation of music lovers don't know who the 18-time Grammy Award winner is. ""If they are looking for a younger demographic, there are a lot of kids out there (who) actually don't know who Aretha Franklin is. It's sad, but they don't,"" Gifford said. Then, Kennedy poured more cold water on the idea of Franklin doing the show, saying she doesn't like to fly and that will make it hard for her to travel across the country for auditions. ""She does not fly. She needs to get over that (doing 'Idol'),"" he said. A few hours later, Franklin responded in an e-mail, exclusively obtained by CNN. In it, she set the record -- and her critics at ""Today"" -- straight. ""While I enjoy Kathie Lee and Hoda daily, her assessment is totally wrong!"" Franklin wrote. ""I've been to California from Detroit four times this year and Florida. I go wherever I choose to go comfortably on my custom bus. ""Further, my audience and fans span the age of 8 to 90! And are multi-ethnic, and I am very well known to young adults, tweens and teens. Their parents play my music and I take care of my business whenever I sign on the dotted line! ""I'm surprised Kathie Lee did not research my worldwide celebrity audience! She's usually right on top of things with a great sense of humor, but she's totally wrong this time. She should research me before she speaks about me. I'm sure she thought she was right; still enjoy Hoda and Kathie Lee!"" As for be a judge on ""Idol,"" Franklin made it clear she's up for the task.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard sank a Japanese fishing trawler off the coast of Alaska on Thursday, more than a year after it was swept away by a tsunami off the east coast of Japan, authorities said. The trawler capsized hours after the Coast Guard set fire to it, causing it to begin taking on water, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman. The sinking of the Ryou-Un Maru brought about the end of a journey for the rust-stained ship that drifted across the Pacific Ocean as part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck Japan following a 9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The Coast Guard determined the trawler posed a threat to other ships navigating the area, and had been broadcasting the unmanned, unlit vessel's location to mariners to alert them to the hazard. The U.S. Geological Survey advised the Coast Guard where the ship's sinking would have the least environmental impact. ""The potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time, but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Coast Guard opened fire on the Ryou-Un Maru at 1 p.m. Thursday. The ship drifted from Canadian waters into U.S. waters on Saturday, and was located about 180 miles west of the Dixon Entrance in Southeast Alaska, the Coast Guard said. The trawler was first spotted floating near British Columbia by a Canadian military air patrol, and it was then determined that it had been adrift since the tsunami, Canadian officials said last month. The Japan Coast Guard identified the owner of the vessel after being contacted by Canadian officials, who were provided the identification number on the hull. The vessel, which was used for squid fishing, was moored at Hachinohe in the Aomori prefecture when the tsunami hit, Japanese authorities said. A Canadian vessel, the Bernie C, had expressed an interest in salvage, which delayed the operation, but officials deemed that it would be too unsafe to tow or attempt to salvage the vessel, said Coast Guard spokesman Kip Wadlow. CNN's Leslie Tripp, Tina Burnside, Jake Carpenter, Jack Maddox and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Coast Guard official says Japanese trawler has capsized .

"(CNN) -- Ayen Kuol is a woman with a mission: to get men into the kitchen. Kuol, a Sudanese woman, was working as a health worker in Australia, visiting newly-arrived refugees, when she came across single men going hungry because they had no idea how to prepare simple meals. In response, she set up a cookery school for young Sudanese refugee men in Adelaide, Australia. She is the subject of a documentary, ""Ayen's Cooking School for African Men,"" which was shown in London on Sunday as part of the Film Africa festival. In the film, Kuol talked about a health assessment she did with newly arrived refugees. ""One day I came across these four boys,"" she said. ""They were just lying on mattresses and I said 'guys, what's wrong?' ""They said, 'we're hungry.' There was plenty of food, but they didn't know what to do with it. I opened the fridge and there was meat, vegetables, apples, grapes. I said 'there's plenty of food, why are you hungry?'"" Sudanese refugees began arriving in Australia around 2001, and more than 20,000 came in 10 years, according to the Australian government. Around 2,000 of those settled in Adelaide, South Australia. Also on Inside Africa: Film shines light on Obama's Kenyan sister . ""Adelaide was quite a monoculture and then suddenly there was a rush of Sudanese refugees,"" said Sieh Mchawala, who directed the film about Kuol. Mchawala who grew up in Tanzania with a Tanzanian father and an Australian mother. Many of the new arrivals were young single men who had lost their parents in Sudan's civil war and had grown up in refugee camps, such as Kakuma Camp in northern Kenya. ""These boys are called the 'Lost Boys of Sudan,' said Kuol in the film. ""They don't know where their parents are, they grew up in refugee camps. ""They were lost boys in refugee camps, but they could be lost men here in terms of not knowing what to eat or how to cook or anything."" Read more: Sudan's 'Lost Boys' reunited with the past . Deeply entrenched labor divisions in the Dinka culture of South Sudan made Kuol's task a tough one. Not only were the men reluctant to try what they considered to be women's work, but the women refused to let men in their kitchens and made fun of any who tried. Kuol's own mother Koko Agot believed it was taboo for men to cook. ""She has been telling me what I'm doing is against the law and if we were in Sudan I would be charged for it,"" Kuol said in the film. Kuol initially struggled to persuade men to take part in her cookery classes. No one turned up to her first class, and only two to her second. Alier Ateny, a youth worker who spent 14 years in refugee camps in East Africa, said before joining the class: ""I'm quite confused about whether to go or not to go. ""If you go to a cooking class, you may end up not getting a woman to marry you in the community. If you cook you are a woman, you are weak."" Ateny did end up going to the classes, along with around 10 others, aged between 13 and 30. Mchawala heard about Kuol's project after deciding he wanted to make a documentary about Sudanese refugees in Adelaide. ""I liked the idea of making a film that wasn't a sob story about hardship. It was a great opportunity to make something that was more uplifting,"" said Mchawala, 33. He said he had come across men's reluctance to cook in his own upbringing, but was surprised by how deeply held the views in the Dinka community were. ""After hearing Ayen's story about finding a lot of men who were struggling to feed themselves, I thought there would be a lot of enthusiasm for the cooking school,"" he said. Also on Inside Africa: Artist joins Nigeria's 'cultural explosion' After around three months of classes, Kuol persuaded the men to hold a feast for the women in the community to prove their worth in the kitchen. Mchawala said: ""By the end, they weren't going to be on Masterchef, but they gained a bit more confidence and were a bit more open to trying."" ""Ayen's Cooking School for African Men,"" released last year, was Mchawala's first film and throughout the making he continued working in two jobs, as a laborer and a barman. He has since made a film called ""Barefoot in Ethiopia,"" about an Australian brother and sister traveling to Ethiopia. He also takes part in the ""Big Stories, Small Towns"" project, in which film-makers work residencies in small towns. The project won a community interactive award at South by South West 2012.","Health worker found African men going hungry in Australia because they didn't know how to cook .

"(CNN) -- Monday night's third and final presidential debate was a bittersweet occasion for the Twittersphere. The previous two presidential debates, and one equally entertaining vice presidential debate, have provided rich material for the wits of Twitter. Their rapid-fire commentary turned what could have been dry television into deeply entertaining multi-screen experiences. As many pointed out on Twitter, the micro-blogging service is like Mystery Science Theater for live television. This debate, which took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, is the last for the current election cycle, which will end when voters go to the polls on November 6. The meme of the evening did not stem out of one candidate's gaffe, but from a well-executed zinger (the words ""gaffe"" and ""zinger"" will officially be retired on November 7). Responding to a criticism from Romney about the size of the U.S. Navy, Obama said: ""You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them."" Obama foreceful in final debate, Romney plays defense . The hashtag #horsesandbayonettes and parody account @Horsesbayonette quickly followed. Other popular moments included moderator Bob Schieffer slipping up and saying ""Obama bin Laden,"" the repeated use of the word ""tumult"" and whether or not the U.S. should ""divorce"" Pakistan. The volume of tweets was a bit lower this round, with 6.5 million tweets sent during the hour and a half event, according to Twitter.

"(CNN) -- A Russian government child advocate said Wednesday he may have spoken too soon when he said a 3-year-old adopted boy who died in Texas was ""killed"" or ""murdered."" At a press conference Wednesday, Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death. With the investigation still going, he's now simply saying the boy ""died."" Still he said, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children. Astakhov's statement echoes others who have blasted the United States recently, and it continues an ongoing adoption battle between the once-Cold War foes. Russians meet with adoptive parents of dead boy . The 3-year-old's death has also thrown into jeopardy America's efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families had already begun the process before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions by U.S. citizens, the State Department has said. That pending law would ban adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But critics say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. The boy was born on January 9, 2010, and died on January 21, 2013, Russian officials have said. They have also implied that the boy may have been beaten. Authorities in Texas have not released such details but have called the death ""suspicious."" They have also offered some specifics. Russia decries death of adopted boy in Texas . The child was found unresponsive at his residence and his mother called 911, Ector County Forensic Death Investigator Sondra Woolf said. He was pronounced dead by an emergency room doctor, she said. Autopsy reports are still pending. While softening his language about the boy's death, Astakhov made more demands at the news conference Wednesday. The child advocate asked that the boy's younger brother, who was adopted by the same Texas family, be returned to Russia. Moscow: Americans can adopt Russian kids until 2014 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A series of explosions in eastern Afghanistan killed at least one person and wounded six on Sunday, officials said. In the first attack, a car bomb targeted a building belonging to National Directorate of Security, near the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, a government spokesman said. The early morning blast killed one person and wounded two others, provincial spokesman Ahmad Zia Abdulzai said. In a second attack, a minibus packed with explosives targeted a police checkpoint in Logar province, said Den Mohammad Darwish, provincial government spokesman said. That blast wounded three people, he said. And in a third attack, a suicide bomber detonated his vest at the gate of a police headquarters in the Baraki Barak district of Logar province, police said. One police officer was wounded, said Raees Khan, chief of security for Logar police. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the group was responsible for all three attacks, but gave different casualty tolls for each. He said the attack in Nangarhar province killed 14 people, the minibus blast in Logar province wounded 20, and the suicide bombing in Logar province killed 13. The Taliban are known for claiming responsibility for attacks and inflating casualty numbers. Separately, a would-be suicide bomber was shot and killed in Kabul before he could carry out an attack, police said. The man was driving a car packed with explosives and tried to enter the area of the Internal Security and High Peace Council offices in Kabul, Deputy Police Chief Daoud Amin said. He was also wearing a suicide vest, Amin said. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said the group was not responsible for the planned attack in Kabul.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York woman who pretended to have terminal cancer to pay for an extravagant wedding and honeymoon has been ordered to give back thousands of dollars she received from sympathetic donors. Jessica Vega, 25, pleaded guilty last month to the scheme and was indicted on fraud and grand larceny charges as well as one misdemeanor. After spending eight weeks in jail, Vega was ordered by Orange County Court Judge Robert Freehill to return the $13,368.48 she gained in gifts and donations while posing as terminally ill. She was also sentenced to 300 hours of community service and five years of probation, according to a statement from the New York Attorney General's Office. ""I am pleased that the community members, who felt so compelled to generously help a neighbor in need, will be given back their hard earned money,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. Victims of Vega's scam are expected to begin receiving compensation in the coming weeks. Officials say the scheme lasted from January 2010 to June 2010 and involved eliciting gifts from a bridal couture shop and a high-end restaurant. Vega was married in May 2010 after claiming she only had a few months to live. She allegedly ""went to Aruba for her honeymoon with expenses paid for by people touched by her story,"" according to the indictment. The man Vega married, who was not named in the indictment, is not facing charges. Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Jennifer Givner said the man says he was not involved in the scheme.","Woman feigned terminal cancer to get donations for extravagant wedding and honeymoon .

"(CNN) -- The past three weeks of U.N. Security Council meetings have culminated in the sanctioning of the three men accused of being part of the M23, a rebel group accused of recruiting child soldiers to commit massacres and rapes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Two of the men were hit with sanctions on Friday, the other one got the penalties on November 12. The three men, Innocent Kaina, Baudouin Ngaruye and Sultani Makenga are part of the leadership of the M23 rebel group, the United Nations says, and are currently entrenched in the far eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area not only known for its immense beauty but also immense store of raw materials, such as copper, diamonds, and gold. According to Human Rights Watch, the three are responsible for recruiting child soldiers, some as young as eight years old. They are also known for leading massacres, rapes, and attacking civilians, the advocacy agency said. The sanctions on the three men include freezing assets and travel bans. Makenga is responsible for ordering rapes and sexual assaults against women and children in an effort to, ""consolidate control,"" the U.N. said. He headed campaigns of forced recruitment of children that led to ""killing, maiming, and injuring scores of children,"" the U.N. said. He was also involved in the Kiwandja Massacre in November 2008, where 67 civilians, mostly young men, were murdered in north eastern Congo, the United Nations says. Ngaruye ""has committed killing, maiming and abductions, often targeting women"" and ""he gave the orders to kill all men in Shalio village of Walikale,"" the United Nations says. Kaina is accused of a series of abuses, mostly in 2004. The sanctions come as a new cycle of unrest continues in eastern DR Congo. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions.","The sanctions include travel bans and freezing assets .

"(CNN) -- As you can imagine, college life can be very eventful. Balancing classes, internships, and a life away from home is enough to keep anyone busy. As a 20-year-old living with a chronic illness, I have skillfully learned the balancing act of college life. My name is Marquita Gaines, and I have sickle cell disease. I was first diagnosed at birth. The doctors performed a newborn screening test and when I was 10 days old they called to inform my mom. Because she and my father both have the sickle cell trait, she was aware that I may have the disease. At the age of 8 months I began having fevers over 101 consistently for a year. When I was 5 years old, I was riding the new bike I had just gotten for Christmas when I fell off and the handle bars hit me in the ribcage. That night I began having difficulty breathing. I was rushed to the local hospital and within hours I had stopped breathing. I was moved to intensive care, revived, and placed on a respirator. The critical care doctors and the hematologist worked day and night to figure out what was happening to me. My health continued to decline, and my parents were told to go pray because if I continued to not receive enough oxygen I would only have two hours to live. Around the seventh day, my condition stabilized and it was learned that I was suffering from an acute chest syndrome, a condition common among sickle cell patients. Shooting survivor says blood donations saved her life . Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder affecting the red blood cells. It causes the cells to lose oxygen very easily, turning them from round shapes to crescent shapes that cause painful episodes known as pain crises. At first glance, no one would know that I am a patient living with sickle cell disease. On any given day I can feel great, but I never know when the pain will come or how long it will last. A pain crisis can cause severe pain in my joints, my bones and my muscles. Sometimes it lasts for hours or even for days. At my worst it is difficult to walk and I have to use a wheelchair. To help reduce the number and severity of these episodes, I take daily medications and, with the help of the American Red Cross, I receive red blood cell transfusions every six weeks. The first time I received donor blood from the American Red Cross, I was in the 11th grade. I arrived on an outpatient basis, and a trained nurse from the American Red Cross came to administer the procedure. I was nervous, but the possibility of having little to no pain was exciting. First, my blood was typed and cross-matched with donor blood. Then, with my family by my side, the transfusion began. A machine filtered out my sickled red blood cells in exchange for roughly 10 pints of normal red blood cells. The American Red Cross nurse administering the transfusion was very knowledgeable and friendly, which helped me remain calm. Everything was a success, and within a week and a half I felt like a brand new person! My bones no longer ached and I was able to stop taking the heavy pain medication. Once my senior year began, I was able to attend school more often. I also was able to run the mile in eight minutes with the rest of the gym class -- and I wasn't the last person to finish! Cancer survivor's challenge: Give the gift of life this season . Now in my junior year at Howard University, I am still managing school work and my illness. I am involved in campus life as a member of student government and other organizations. I am young and full of life, with many goals and aspirations. The American Red Cross provides the opportunity for me to feel better more often. Transfusions allow me to have an easier, pain-free life. During this holiday season, my hope is that everyone will realize the importance of being a blood donor. For people like me who need regular transfusions, blood is often best matched among people of the same ethnic group, so donations from anyone who is a minority or has a rare blood type such as U- or Fy(a-b-) are especially important. You could help someone like me live a healthier, happier, pain-free life. I am a testament to the importance of blood donation and the services that the American Red Cross provides on a daily basis. Without both I wouldn't be able to be a happy and successful young lady. I realize that sickle cell disease is a part of me, but it will never define who I am. With treatments like this and a strong support system, which I have from my family and the American Red Cross, there is no excuse not to succeed with this disease.

"Dhibet, Tunisia (CNN) -- The border crossing at Dhibet in southern Tunisia is not much to look at. A small police post, another for the Garde Nationale, a customs shed -- and beyond that 200 meters of no-man's land. In between here and the Libyan border, a dog -- presumably of dual nationality -- lies in the sunshine. Behind the red-and-white-checkered barrier on the Libyan side, a handful of soldiers pace up and down. Another peers down from a roof. A truck with a large green Libyan flag draws up. A smiling Colonel Moammar Gadhafi looks down from a mural and a large banner bears the legend ""Congratulations to the brother leader."" Several days ago, Libyan soldiers abandoned this remote frontier post as anti-government groups took over the town of Nalut, 70 kilometers from the border along a twisting mountain road. But on Monday Libyan troops loyal to Gadhafi returned to reclaim control of the frontier. A Tunisian man at the border -- one of several attracted from the nearby town to witness this rare burst of activity -- excitedly shows a CNN crew cellphone video of a Libyan military helicopter that had landed with reinforcements. Another murmurs that if we want to enter Libya, he knows smuggling trails through the mountains -- forbidding ochre-colored cliffs that rise on either side of the border. Unlike the crossing 150 miles to the north, the border at Dhibet has no crush of foreign workers desperate to escape the violence in Libya. There is a trickle of Egyptians, a few from Mali coming over, but the loudest noise is the chirping of sparrows in the customs shed. One young Egyptian who worked in a Libyan aluminum plant, talks of an odyssey from Tripoli, where he worked. Threatened by Libyan soldiers, he says he and a few friends fled south and tried to enter Algeria. When that didn't work, he ended up here. He and others say Nalut remains in the control of anti-government groups, but there is anxiety that pro-Gadhafi forces nearby will launch an assault. Like much of Libya, the fate of this area is far from decided. In the late afternoon, there is a shift change among the handful of Tunisian soldiers deployed at the border. The new arrivals lounge against the border gate, chatting and smoking -- oblivious to the drama playing out a few miles away. A Berber shepherd swaddled in rough brown cloth minds his flock of goats just beyond the razor wire. There is sudden movement on the Libyan side. The gate goes up and several 4x4 vehicles, caked in dust, pass through. They are, bizarrely enough, part of a rally - - ""Libye 2011."" The sun slips behind the mountains, the sparrows fall quiet -- and the border at Dhibet waits for its next arrivals.","At a lonely crossing on the Tunisia-Libyan border, all is quiet .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- The deaths of 26 victims in the latest wave of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo might constitute war crimes, a United Nations spokesman said Saturday. A Congolese girl cries as she walks with her mother near Kibati on Friday. It is unclear who was responsible for the deaths in the village of Kiwanja or how many of the victims were civilians. But if some of the victims are found to be non-combatants, their deaths could be handled by a war crimes tribunal, said Madnodje Mounoubai, U.N. mission spokesman in Kinshasa. ""Some were combatants, and some were not,"" he said. ""If it is determined that they were not just caught in the crossfire -- that they were pulled out of their homes or singled out for questioning and killed -- that would make it a war crime."" Mounoubai made the remarks one day after leaders at a regional summit called for an immediate cease-fire and the creation of humanitarian corridors in areas plagued by bloody attacks. Fighting broke out at the end of August between the Congolese army and rebel forces led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda. Despite a unilateral cease-fire declared by Nkunda last week, fighting has continued, and there are reports of heavy civilian casualties in recent days. Mounoubai also said that a U.N. team in Kiwanja had confirmed reports of 26 bodies in 11 graves in the village. Residents told the U.N. team that rebels killed the victims amid accusations that they collaborated with government troops, Mounoubai said. In a communique released at the end of Friday's African Union-hosted summit, regional leaders asked for a strengthening of the mandate for peacekeeping forces in the country. There are 17,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Congo, the largest U.N. peacekeeping force in the world, but U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the forces have been ""stretched to the limit."" He said Friday that the recent violence, which the United Nations estimates has displaced 252,000 people, must be prevented from spilling into the wider region. ""Neither the DRC nor Rwanda nor the rest of the Central Africa region can afford to be dragged back into conflict. The international community cannot allow this to occur,"" Ban told the leaders. ""For far too long, peace and security in your region has been threatened by armed groups, domestic and foreign, present on the soil of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They have been operating from there with impunity, aggravating strains between your countries and between your peoples."" The fighting has aggravated an already serious humanitarian crisis, the United Nations and aid groups say. Nkunda was not present at the summit. Congolese President Joseph Kabila and the presidents of Congo's neighboring countries -- Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania, and Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda -- were among the leaders there. Ban implored the leaders to use their influence in restoring stability to eastern Congo. ""As leaders of Africa, you have a historic responsibility. This is a critical moment for the Great Lakes region and for Africa as a whole. We must put the cycle of violence behind us,"" he said. ""We must build a shared future of stability, peace, development and human rights for all citizens of your countries."" In particular, Ban said, they should urge Nkunda not to resume fighting, prevent him from getting support and urge him to pull back his rebels. Human Rights Watch reported Thursday that Nkunda's rebel forces and the opposing government-backed Mai Mai militias deliberately killed civilians in Kiwanja, in North Kivu, on Tuesday and Wednesday in violation of Nkunda's declared cease-fire. ""Eyewitnesses in Kiwanja told Human Rights Watch that at least 20 persons were killed and another 33 wounded during a battle for the town and in the cleanup operations by Nkunda's forces that followed,"" the group said in a written statement. Nkunda denied Thursday that his soldiers were involved in any civilian killings and said the Mai Mai were dressed in civilian clothing. ""These Mai Mai, these militia were in civil dress. ... We asked the civilian population to get behind the front lines. So, the population were behind the front line,"" he said. ""We cannot kill a civil population."" Human Rights Watch said U.N. peacekeepers in the area were unable to protect civilians. After the rebels re-established control of Kiwanja on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said, they ordered all 30,000 residents of the town to leave. They then sought out and killed civilians, particularly men, whom they accused of supporting their enemies, the groups said. ""People in Kiwanja said they heard screams into the night and saw bodies on the streets the following morning,"" Human Rights Watch said. One of those killed was a journalist working for a local radio station, the group said. Witnesses said Mai Mai militias targeted civilians in Kiwanja, including those they accused of supporting Nkunda's forces, Human Rights Watch said. The conflict in Congo is complicated by outside forces and a variety of armed groups fighting both the government and each other. Some analysts say Rwanda is Nkunda's principal supporter. Rwanda denies that. For several years, it has called for the disarming of Rwandan Hutu rebels, many of whom are in eastern Congo.","NEW: If civilians were killed, deaths may constitute war crimes, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Friday that it has filed doping charges against champion cyclist Lance Armstrong. This month, the agency announced that it was opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. ""USADA can confirm that the independent three person Anti-Doping Review Board (ADRB) has conducted a full evaluation and has made a unanimous recommendation to move forward with the adjudication process in accordance with the rules,"" it said in a statement. Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong . If Armstrong and the others choose, the case will move next to an arbitration panel, where ""all evidence would be presented, witness testimony would be given under oath, and an independent group of arbitrators would ultimately decide the outcome of the case,"" the agency said. Armstrong has always insisted that he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Other riders accused him of using such drugs, but he has never failed a drug test. ""There is not one shred of credible evidence to support USADA's charges,"" Armstrong's attorney, Robert Luskin, said in a statement. He described the agency's decision as ""wrong"" and ""baseless."" ""In its zeal to punish Lance, USADA has sacrificed the very principles of fair play that it was created to safeguard. It has compiled a disgraceful record of arrogance, secrecy, disregard for its own protocols, shabby science, and contempt for due process,"" Luskin said. When the proceedings were announced this month, Armstrong said the Anti-Doping Agency intended to ""dredge up discredited"" allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. ""Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,"" Armstrong wrote on his website. ""That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence."" According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. The World Triathlon Corporation suspended Armstrong this month from competing in WTC-owned and -licensed races while he's under investigation for doping. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. In February, Justice Department prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs.

"London (CNN) -- The venomous attack on the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge by author Hilary Mantel calling her bland and ""machine made"" is a cheap publicity stunt. Her remarks saying her impression of our future queen is that of a ""jointed doll on which certain rags are hung,"" with a ""plastic smile"" and ""only purpose being to give birth,"" is mean spirited in the extreme. Where does the double Man Booker Prize winner get this impression? Has she ever seen Kate up close or seen her interact with people at home and abroad? I doubt it very much. If she had she would not have been so rude and inaccurate. The darling of the literary establishment I fear is playing publicity seeking games; raising her profile on the back of one of the most famous women on the planet right now. I respect Hilary Mantel as a writer. I like her books too. But she clearly knows very little about modern princesses -- or duchesses even. Perhaps all that time writing about Tudor princesses has led her to lose her head -- like so many Tudor heroines. Mantel has never met the duchess. She has never seen her at work. I have, and I have been impressed by the speed and ease with which she has taken to the job of being a front line royal. People who meet Kate warm to her. She has a winning smile and easy charm. Yes, she has a long way to go, and is not the new Princess Diana as many in the media are hoping for. But I think she is slowly but surely carving out a role for herself. Even Diana took years in the job before growing into the global icon who was so admired before she was taken from us so tragically. For somebody who is relatively new to royal engagements, Kate has performed with aplomb. On foreign assignments too, I have seen her at close quarters in Canada, America, Singapore and Borneo. She is professional and warm, complimenting her husband Prince William as they carry out their royal duties together. Kate and William are a great double act. There is her wifely strength, like the Queen Mother, and as a Queen Consort she does not try to steal the limelight from her husband. The Palace and Kate have kept a dignified silence over Mantel's rant. It's a wise stance. I know the team around Kate and far from her being a ""machine-made doll"" or ""designed by a committee"" she has a hands-on role in everything she does. They follow her lead. She has chosen to be patron of charities in which she has a deep personal interest. Kate, in the coming months and years, will let her actions speak for her. Today she was back doing royal duties for her charity Action on Addiction at Hope House in Clapham, South London. She looked fabulous as she stepped out of the royal car, happy to show her baby bump to the media gathered outside. She was well briefed and knew her stuff. She is a beautiful, educated and stylish young woman, who has embraced her role with ease and injected much-needed glamour to the British royal family. The Palace will step up the number of patronages in the coming months and claims that Kate is a plastic princess will soon fade. Kate has her detractors -- many Internet trolls label her work shy -- but I am surprised someone of Mantel's stature has joined in this pastime, attacking Kate for no apparent reason. In my view she has abused her position among the novel-writing elite to launch this astonishing attack on a woman half way through her pregnancy. Mantel, whose latest books are set in the Tudor court, is lucky she is not a character in one of her own books. If she had attacked the wife of a future king back then with such vitriol she may have soon lost her head in a more literal sense.","Royal correspondent Robert Jobson says Hilary Mantel's attack on Catherine is a venomous publicity stunt .

"(CNN) -- It was not a blanket of snow that fell on the Northeast this past weekend. It was more like a futon of snow. A stack of futons. And not the light foam futons, but old-fashioned futons stuffed with horsehair or maybe potting soil. Sodden futons stacked 3 feet high with no place to shovel them. But ignore my bitterness. I'm old and I just got in from shoveling the part of our driveway that the next civic-minded city plow is going to refill. In truth, New England handled this snow emergency like a champ -- so much better than the Blizzard of '78 in which people died stuck in their cars on the highway. But before we break out the cocoa and self-congratulations, we might want to listen to Espen Andersen, a Norwegian in Oslo who lived in Boston for nine years. I blogged on Saturday about how well-prepared the Northeast was, and Espen jumped in with a ""Yeah, but ..."" comment. ""I just can't get used to the New England oh-my-God-here-it-comes-again-flip-to-channel-5 attitude,"" he wrote. He explained: ""The fact that New England panics every time there is a flurry is due to lack of preparedness at the infrastructure level. In most of Norway, power and telephone lines are underground, it is illegal not to have snow tires on your car after December 1st or thereabouts (if you go in the ditch, you are fined) and during my own and my children's school days we have never had a snow day or any other interruption due to the weather (and we have plenty of weather). I have never been to the store to stock up on batteries and water. ... Our airport does not close down for snow, though there can be delays."" My pride makes me want to push back on the idea that we New Englanders ""panic"" in the face of blizzards, not to mention that referring to this past weekend's unpleasantness as ""a flurry"" goes beyond Nordic stoicism. On the other hand, I remember being amused as a grad student watching the recent immigrants from sunny Mediterranean climes spinning their tires in a modest Toronto snowfall. What goes around comes around, and those Mediterranean tires were going around at an unmoving 60 mph. But Espen raises a valid question: ""Why doesn't New England harden the grid and communications systems, put winter tires on school buses, mandate winter tires in snowy conditions and just get rid of this stupid idea of snow days? It is winter; it happens almost every year."" I'd suggest there are two reasons we don't. We'd all like to see the poles and wires that blight our landscape come down. Not only would this reduce power outages due to downed trees, it might also give us an opportunity to pull some optical fiber into our homes and businesses so that the United States could stop falling behind the developed world in high-speed Internet access. So let's do it. Except, it's expensive. All those trenches to dig. All those rights of way to clear. All those transformers to move indoors. The bullet to bite is so large that we're more willing to dribble out the price of sending out repair crews, and to put up with the far more substantial costs borne by individuals and businesses that go without power for hours, days and sometimes weeks. The aggregated cost of being without electricity for the 655,000 people plunged into the cold and dark by the so-called Nemo storm, are distributed among the sufferers, and thus that cost is invisible, as is everything if one closes one's eyes hard enough. Besides, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick estimated that it would cost $1 trillion to bury all the power lines throughout the commonwealth. Various experts I consulted (via the advanced knowledge network known as mailing lists) supplied counter guesstimates of $45 billion to $200 billion, but with caveats about everything from the frequency of buried rocks to the increased difficulty of fixing broken underground cables. Still, that's between three and 70 Big Digs, to use our local unit of currency. Not chump change, no matter how you measure it. Which brings us to the second reason we don't bite the bullet and snow-proof our infrastructure: We think of snowstorms as emergencies that inevitably bring with them power outages and snow days, so we don't demand a snow-proof infrastructure. Yes, this is circular reasoning. We don't demand a fix because we don't see the system as broken. It takes a Norwegian to have us wonder why we're shutting down our cities as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Even if we overcame both reasons and buried our power and communication lines, I doubt that we would escape all snow-caused work stoppages. Maybe I'm just being a panicky New Englander, but when 2 to 3 feet of snow drops on your city so fast that you can practically hear the thump, I can't imagine how we'd get our streets and trolley tracks cleaned fast enough to avoid a day when it's better if everyone just stays at home, does some shoveling and watches ""Buffy"" seasons 1-4. For, as Espen points out, if we didn't treat snow as an emergency, we wouldn't get our snow days. And we love our snow days. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","David Weinberger: Blizzard not the worst, but why isn't New England better prepared?

"(CNN) -- When I was a child I had an illustrated chart of all the kings and queens of England on my bedroom wall. I loved that poster: There was moody King Alfred sighing over burnt cakes, fat, arrogant Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth I with her inscrutable half-smile, Charles II hiding in the tree. They were live and vivid stories of heroism, frailty, failure, fealty, attached to real ruins that real families (including ours) seemed to trudge off to engage with at weekends -- thanks to the National Trust. To me they were a kind of half-fantasy. Factually real, but entirely constructed in my imagination. No wonder then, that historical novels have such an enduring appeal -- the latest blockbuster on the life of Katherine Parr is about to hit our shelves. For the writer imagining what it must have been ""really like"" back then is a huge part of the appeal. The late author Christopher Hitchens called the royal family our ""national fetish."" Shrunk now from the awesome Tudor kingdoms, the current royal family now has a largely ""soft"" social and tabloid power, and any negative mention of the royals, especially by someone who has been as handsomely rewarded as Mantel by the establishment, is met with screams of utter hysterical disapproval. Read more: Author's description of Catherine as 'machine-made' doll sparks angry reactions . If you read the original article it's an erudite, writerly essay that speculates about the national drama that is the royal family, and acknowledges -- much like the spectacle that is playing out at the Vatican -- that the royal family is pure theater with real living human beings playing out these arcane rituals stuck in the middle. Mantel is not actually calling Kate a ""jointed doll,"" she is suggesting that the duchess's public image -- the role she plays in the collective psyche -- has overtaken the real person, much like it did with Diana, Princess of Wales. But the fact that the Daily Mail and other conservative commentators have broken out in such a bad case of shrill hysteria in the face of this examination of the author's mixed feelings about the royal family is quite amusing, actually, because it sounds so utterly insincere. Aside from the fact that Kate is pregnant and the Mail needs to keep her in the headlines, such is their fawning need to be seen as the courtiers-in-chief, there is also a question of why Mantel's essay has caused such a fuss. It's almost like someone has just told all the children that Santa is not real. Mantel is merely pointing out that Catherine is not really a duchess, just a woman who agreed through marriage to play this role, which few would wish to have for all the kingdoms in the world -- all that suffocating attention. Read more: Duchess of Cambridge -- from college sweetheart to queen in waiting . Mantel, like all good novelists, understands the power of the imagination to create reality: all she is doing is pointing out the drama that the royal family play out on a national stage. We agree as a nation, to believe in the royal family -- why? Because we always have? This is the really interesting question and the one that Mantel was asking. That she should be met with such opprobrium for asking it suggests something interesting about the national psyche. In the absence of any real national culture the royal family is increasingly the obsession of the English -- the Scots and the Welsh would take independence if they could have it. They are expensive, anachronistic, a sentimental link in a chain to a collective history -- a bit like a living breathing monument. But the issue about whose nation they represent, and what they are really for remains louder than ever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Juila Bell.","Award-winning novelist Hilary Mantel described the Duchess of Cambridge as ""machine-made""

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court on Tuesday acquitted a Congolese man accused of brutal war crimes in 2003. It is the first such acquittal for the court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands. Prosecutors accused Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui of responsibility for the 2003 massacre of hundreds of villagers in Bogoro, Democratic Republic of Congo. Witnesses and testimony recounted brutal slayings and rapes against the residents, including women, children and people burned alive in the resource-rich village in the central African nation. He was charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and seven counts of war crimes. The court decided prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence that Chui had personally led the attacks or ordered child soldiers to carry out war crimes. In a statement, the court said its judgment did not mean it believed no crimes were committed in Bogoro, or even that Chui was necessarily innocent; only that prosecutors hadn't proved their case. Rights advocates criticized the judgment. ""The acquittal of Ngudjolo leaves the victims of Bogoro and other massacres by his forces without justice for their suffering,"" said Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner, the international justice advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. ""The ICC prosecutor needs to strengthen its investigations of those responsible for grave crimes in Ituri, including high-ranking officials in Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda who supported the armed groups fighting there,"" she said. Bogoro is in Ituri province. Prosecutors said they may appeal the decision. Chui remains jailed pending a hearing Tuesday afternoon, the court said. The case against Chui is one of five brought by the court involving the conflict in Congo. In the only other case so far concluded by the court, judges in July found Lubanga Dyilo guilty of forcing children to fight and sentenced him to 14 years in prison. The court dismissed charges against one man. The verdict against another, Germain Katanga, is pending, the court said. Two other men, Sylvestre Mudacumura and Bosco Ntaganda, both accused of war crimes, have not been captured, according to the court. Read more: Prosecutor seeks new Congo war crimes warrants .

"New York (CNN) -- The family of Sarai Sierra, an amateur New York photographer recently killed during a vacation in Turkey, is selling her photographs online to help support her sons. The images went on sale Tuesday on a marketplace website called Instacanvas, and proceeds will go to her two sons, ages 9 and 11, according to family friend Marjorie Ryan. The money was originally intended to pay for Sierra's funeral services, but ""the funeral home has now agreed to take on the costs,"" Ryan said. Sierra traveled alone to Istanbul on January 7. She was reported missing after she did not arrive on a return flight January 22. An estimated 9 million people travel to Istanbul each year.

Turkish police have detained a Turkish man with whom she had been in contact, identified only by the first name Taylan, according to CNN Turk. Authorities have also collected DNA samples from 21 people, including three foreigners. Her body has since been transferred to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport for a Thursday departure to New York.

"(CNN) -- Armed men attacked a displaced persons camp in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo early Sunday, raping women and looting at a facility where tens of thousands of people have taken refuge, a U.N. official said. Simplice Kpandji, a spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency, said it was unclear whether anyone had been killed at the camp, which is about 10 kilometers from Goma, the border city that has been a flashpoint for fighting between government troops and the M23 rebel group. The Mugunga III camp houses more than 30,000 displaced people, many of whom fled to the camp when rebels advanced on Goma, Kpandji said. The attackers' identity was unknown, he said, and officials were working on gathering more information. Word of the attack came as U.N. monitors confirmed that rebels had withdrawn from Goma, more than a week after they seized the city from government forces. Fighters from the M23 rebel group boarded trucks and other vehicles to head north to outside of the 20 kilometer buffer zone stipulated by regional leaders, U.N. peacekeepers in Congo said in a statement. Earlier they had begun leaving Sake, a town to the west of Goma. M23 rebels also left their posts at the border crossing with Rwanda. Tensions mounted in Goma as several disputes arose. The M23 wanted to take a large cache of ammunition left by fleeing Congolese soldiers, according to a reporter on the ground who was not named for his safety. The U.N. peacekeeping prevented the rebels from doing so, and also stopped the rebels from taking vehicles donated to the government by the European Union, the reporter said. The rebel group has been accused of widespread looting by the United Nations and Goma residents. Government forces also looted as they fled last week, witnesses said. The United Nations welcomed M23's move, but said the group must cease military activity and stay outside of Goma. ""We welcome this withdrawal, but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile,"" said Kieran Dwyer, spokesperson for U.N. peacekeepers. Regional leaders and the African Union had called for the rebels' withdrawal from Goma, supposed to have been completed by Thursday, as a condition of starting negotiations. The regional leaders' plan foresees an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport, Ugandan Gen. Aronda Nyakairima said earlier this week. It would include a 100-strong neutral force, which would be in command, 100 troops from the Congolese army, and 100 members of the M23, Nyakairima said. Two military observers would also be deployed from each of the neighboring regional powers, while MONUSCO would be responsible for securing the buffer zone outside Goma, he said. The regional leaders also called on the rebels to ""stop all war activities,"" and ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government."" The latest violence has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region. And aid groups warn the conflict risks triggering a broader humanitarian crisis. Why Congo needs our help . The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern DR Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country.

"(CNN) -- Doctors for several people in New York suffering from a mystery disorder that led them to develop tic-like symptoms say their patients are starting to feel better. Out of more than a dozen who developed uncontrollable twitching and verbal tics, three say they feel completely better and six say they are significantly better, according to Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, medical director at DENT Neurologic Institute in western New York. ""The media focus, the questions on whether it is environmental or toxins, all that adds confusion, anxiety and difficulty,"" said Mechtler, who has treated some of his patients with psychotherapy and behavioral therapy, as well as prescribed medication for anti-anxiety, depression and headaches. A second doctor from New Jersey, Dr. Rosario Trifiletti, diagnosed some of the patients with PANDAS -- Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections -- and has been treating them with antibiotics. Lana Clarks, mother of one of Trifiletti's patients, told HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" that her daughter, Lauren Scalzo, has fewer ""headaches, stomachaches, no tic-ing and she's been more energetic."" Marge Fitzsimmons, 36, who is among those who came down with the mysterious symptoms, says she is still experiencing some symptoms but feels much better and is soon expected to return to work full time. The incidents occurred in the small town of LeRoy beginning in mid-October. All of the patients -- with the exception of Fitzsimmons -- are students at LeRoy Junior-Senior High School. Doctors have diagnosed most of them with conversion disorder, saying that stress is the likely root of their physical problems. ""What happens is there is traditionally some kind of stress or multiple stressors that provoke a physical reaction within the body,"" said Dr. Jennifer McVige, a neurologist who has evaluated several of the teens. ""This is unconscious, it is not done purposefully and it's almost like ... the stress wells up in your body has to come out in some way shape or form."" The medical mystery in LeRoy has attracted the attention of activist and investigator Erin Brockovich, who came to the village of 8,000 people in western New York after learning about a 41-year-old toxic spill a few miles from the school. Brockovich and an associate suspect that the illnesses are related to the cyanide and trichloroethylene (TCE) that was spilled during a December 1970 train wreck.

"(CNN) -- How do you know if your YouTube video is funny? Google says you can start by counting the ""LOLs."" Always fond of an ambitious algorithm, Google, which owns the Web's top video-sharing site, has set out to try to determine scientifically which videos are the funniest, and what makes them so. There's a certain irony to the degree of wonkish jargon needed to explain the things that make us laugh in a blog post from Sanketh Shetty, a Google researcher and member of the Web giant's amusingly titled ""Slam Team."" He said identifying, and ranking, comedy is harder than a previous Google music project. ""We noticed a few audiovisual patterns across comedy videos on YouTube, such as shaky camera motion or audible laughter, which we can automatically detect,"" Shetty wrote on the Google Research Blog. ""While content-based features worked well for music, identifying humor based on just such features is Al-Complete. Humor preference is subjective, perhaps even more so than musical taste."" And, in a way, that's the thing with humor, isn't it? Who can say, for example, whether the Honey Badger is funnier than a guy on a buffalo? What's worth a bigger laugh -- snooty British actors reciting lines from ""Jersey Shore,"" or the Dramatic Chipmunk? So how does the rating process work? First, Google's speech-recognition technology lets it scan videos for cues such as laughter. Also factored in are key words the uploader uses in the video's description (""funny,"" ""hilarious,"" etc.) and language viewers use in that video's comments section. So if people type ""Ha! Ha! Ha!"" (or cultural equivalents such as ""jajaja"" or ""kekeke""), that earns a point in the video's favor. Same for webspeak such as ""LOL"" or ""LMAO."" Then the algorithm kicks in. It awards extra credit when people put extra emphasis in their responses. So, an ""LOLOL"" is worth more than an ""LOL,"" and the more exclamation points, the better. Hah!!!!! Google's coders taught the algorithm how to use that information to rank the site's videos. Or, in Shetty's delightful jargon: ""We then trained a passive-aggressive ranking algorithm using human-annotated pairwise ground truth and a combination of text and audiovisual features."" Got it? The final step is where you come in. Top-ranked videos have made it into what Google is calling its ""Comedy Slam."" Users see two videos side by side and vote on which they think is funnier. So far, 75,000 people have cast 700,000 votes, Shetty said. He didn't mention when results might be announced. When the ""slam"" is done, maybe we'll finally know -- which is funnier, the Double Rainbow Guy or ""David After Dentist.""","Google has created an algorithm that scores videos based on user feedback, other info .

"(CNN) -- Chingaiz Khan was an unknown quantity when he arrived for a junior weightlifting tournament in South Waziristan nine years ago. Chaotic and intensely religious, the Pakistani region is known by locals as ""the most dangerous place in the world."" The 12-year-old Chingaiz, with his short, jet-black hair and smooth, unblemished skin, looked younger than the other boys. But, despite it being his first ever tournament, he was still stronger than everyone else. For his father Shams-Ul Wazir, a local college lecturer, the decision to register his son for the tournament paid off handsomely. Chingaiz was crowned the junior boys' weightlifting champion, the first step on a journey that would take him into the world of professional sport. Except Chingaiz wasn't really his name. Chingaiz was actually called Maria Toor Pakay. Chingaiz was a girl. ""I suggested the name of Chingaiz Khan for her since she had always been like a boy,"" explained Al Wazir in an interview with HBO. ""She liked the name very much."" Girls and boys . This isn't a story of deception, but rather a tale of necessity. Maria Toor Pakay is Pakistan's number one squash player, ranked 49th in the world. She also comes from an ultra conservative region in Pakistan that is home to the Taliban. Female participation in any form of public life is strongly discouraged, by both words and deeds. Education, working, sports; anything involving women leaving the house unaccompanied by a male relative was seen as the work of the devil. Teen athlete fled Taliban stronghold to pursue dream . But Pakay had talent. Her weightlifting triumph gave her access to a world of sporting options that would otherwise have been out of bounds to her as a female, and she discovered the discipline where she would make her name. Squash is one of Pakistan's most popular games and Pakay excelled at it. By the age of 21 she had gone pro and broken into the world top 50, an incredible rise up the world rankings. She is one of only three Pakistani women in the top 200; by contrast the nation has 15 men in the same strata. Yet her success has come at a price. Pakay and her father have been threatened with retribution by the local Taliban for insulting their culture and their religion. ""My area, my tribal regions are called the hub of terrorism and extremism,"" said Pakay. ""It's the home to the Taliban, and it's called the most dangerous place in the world. But I have a big vision for my country, and for my people it will be stopped. I always thought that maybe I'm the chosen one."" Standing up . Pakay realized at a young age that she was different to other people she saw in her community. ""When I was four and a half, I told my parents that I want clothes like my brother,"" she said. ""I want to play with boys, there's more freedom, I felt. And I am not like girls who play with dolls. I want the toy guns and things like that."" Such behavior was anathema to the deeply conservative community she was born into. But her father agreed. Rather than forcing his daughter to conform, he thought about how best to realize his daughter's talent. It was he who came up with the plan to cut his daughter's hair and enter into competitions with the boys. ""They (religious elders) sent me to a mental asylum 'cause they thought that I had deviated from the culture, and that I was crazy supporting women's rights,"" he recalled. ""They said I was spoiling the whole environment and that all women would want the same rights."" With the boys' junior weightlifting title under her belt, Pakay decided to enter a boys' squash tournament. Her disguise was scuppered by bureaucracy. ""My dad said, 'This ... that's my son,' "" Pakay recalled of the moment her father presented her to be registered. But the official dropped a bombshell. ""He said, 'OK, we need the birth certificate, too.' "" Threat . Shams-Ul Wazir decided to come clean, and entered her in the girls' competitions. She destroyed the opposition and, at the age of 15, was national champion. It was then that the trouble started. ""I found a letter on the windshield of my car. It was signed by the name of 'Taliban,' "" her father said. ""They told me -- they threatened me -- 'Stop your girl from playing squash because it is bringing a bad name to our culture and to Islam.' They told me, 'If you do not do this then you will have to suffer very bad consequences.' ""I ignored that threat ... (but) we were very much concerned that she might get shot or she might get kidnapped."" The warning terrified Pakay. Scared for the safety of her family, she decided not play in public. ""I told my dad that I might need a gun. I don't know what to do,"" she said. ""He said, 'It's your decision. I never stopped you from anything. You wanna play or not?' ""Squash is everything for me. And I know that when a girl is kidnapped, it's the biggest dishonor. I'm not gonna bring dishonor for them, ever."" So Pakay played in the house, lonely and miserable. From dusk until dawn she hit the ball against the wall with her ""Jonathan Power"" racket. Her father knew that if he wanted his daughter to realize her potential, she had to leave Pakistan. ""He said, 'Okay, if you wanna play, just leave the country. That's all you can do.' "" The Power of persistence . Pakay agreed. For three long years she would write to everyone. Clubs, players, educational institutions. Nothing. But then, when she was 18 years old, she received her only reply. She recognized the name. It was the same name that graced her first racket: that of former world champion Jonathan Power. ""I couldn't believe that there was a woman squash player from Waziristan, let alone, one that could actually play,"" said Power of the day he received Pakay's email. Power retired at the top of his game, as number one in the world. He never left squash. Instead he set up a national academy in his home town of Toronto, looking to find talent in people from places squash rarely reaches. Pakay's letter melted him. It read: . Dear sir, . I'm Maria Toor Pakay Wazir. I belong to South Waziristan agency of Pakistan's tribal areas on the Pak-Afghan border. South Waziristan one of Pakistan's most turbulent tribal agencies and the home to Taliban is also my home. Here girls of my age are passing their lives in such miserable conditions. They are restricted to four walls despite having the desire to come out of the Stone Age and get assimilated with the rest of the world. I will be waiting for your positive response. Regard, . Maria Toor Pakay Wazir, professional squash player. Power was moved to reply, and soon Pakay was on a flight to Canada. ""It's unbelievable,"" he said. ""She left on just hope, on a one-way ticket and 200 bucks on an email promise from me."" World champion . The aim for Pakay is to be world champion. She works from morning to night with Power, moving up the rankings as she gets close to realizing her dream. Being away from her family is tough. She talks to them every day on the internet. She scours the news sites looking for information on suicide bombings and killings, praying they are nowhere near her home. So far, they haven't been. ""The timeline is 'till she's world champion and she goes home with a trophy,"" Power asserted confidently. ""There is no substitute."" Yet in a region where some revile a woman's sporting success, a world championship has extra problems. More publicity, greater exposure, increased danger. That doesn't matter to Pakay. Success could open up opportunities for others like her, playing squash or lifting weights or kicking a soccer ball in their bedrooms as they wait for the world outside to change. ""Someone wants to kill me? Kill me once I bring the change and I become a world champion,"" she said. ""But not before.""","Maria Toor Pakay is Pakistan's No. 1 squash player despite difficult circumstances .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- As outrage mounted over the assassination this week of an opposition leader, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali vowed Friday to press on with his plan to form a caretaker government composed of technocrats. Speaking from his residence in the Tunis suburb of Carthage, Jebali denied his moderate religious Ennahda Party had anything to do with the shooting death Wednesday morning of Chokri Belaid. Jebali said he hoped to get approval for his plan from the Ennahda Party and other parties ""because this is a guarantee or, let's say, more guarantees for the government. The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people, mainly among ordinary people. I hope that political parties will translate the view of our people."" Late Wednesday, Jebali sacked his Cabinet and called for new elections, leaving himself at the head of a caretaker government. However, a top Ennahda party official said Thursday that the call to dissolve the Cabinet and offer a new technocratic government was ""not binding."" The party's leaders were trying to decide whether to accept their prime minister's decision. As Jebali spoke Friday, thousands of Tunisians were demonstrating in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination, calling on Jebali to resign. Jebali denied that his party had anything to do with the killing -- the first assassination since Tunisia's ""Jasmine Revolution"" -- and urged his fellow countrymen to act with restraint. ""I already told them -- don't play role of the law, do not respond with violence,"" he said. ""Otherwise, we are trapped, because the goal of those who shot Belaid is to make us react violently."" Jebali said the weapons that killed Belaid were also taking aim at the Jasmine Revolution, which led to the ouster of President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali two years ago and spawned the Arab Spring. ""So, be careful of quick accusations, it will worsen the situation,"" he warned. Jebali defended the current leadership's role in supporting the changes effected by the revolution in this North African country of nearly 11 million people. ""Tunisian people made the Jasmine Revolution for two goals: revolution against dictatorship and revolution against corruption, and they also wanted social justice,"" he said. Those goals have not been betrayed, he said. ""The biggest proof is what is happening in the streets -- protests, free press. I don't think that another press in the world enjoys more than here in Tunisia. Beside, we are not corrupt people, but if people made a revolution against us, that's their right, and we will bow to the will of our people."" Earlier Friday, tens of thousands of mourners followed Belaid's funeral cortege as his flag-draped casket was taken through the streets of the capital to a cemetery. A phalanx of uniformed soldiers escorted the coffin bearers into the cemetery. Protesters had clashed intermittently along the route with security forces, who fired tear gas into the crowds. A private TV channel broadcast the procession showed a car burning. Many of those mourning Belaid expressed anger at the government, which they accuse of allowing a climate of political violence to spread unchecked. On the capital's central Habib Bourguiba Avenue, a flashpoint for protests, dozens of demonstrators fled as riot police fired tear gas. Sporadic clashes also flared on side streets. The military has been deployed alongside police to try to rein in the protests. Belaid, a prominent secular politician, was shot dead as he left his home Wednesday morning for work. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Weeping Thursday beside his casket, his widow, Besma Belaid, was among those pointing the finger at the climate fostered by the governing Ennahda party, which is led by moderate Islamists. ""It's an open invitation to violence,"" she said. ""I can only accuse this party."" Chokri Belaid had warned early this week that the government had given a green light to political violence. A general strike called by trades unions for Friday, the first such action in Tunisia in three decades, closed many shops, cafes and other businesses. The national airline, Tunisair, warned of possible flight disruptions. Protests have also erupted in the central towns of Gafsa and Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the revolution. Support for Belaid went beyond his party, the secular-leftist Democratic Patriots. He was also the voice of a coalition of secular opposition parties known as the Popular Front and decried violence. But Belaid routinely received death threats for his criticism of Tunisia's moderate Islamist-led government. He talked about the threats on his frequent television appearances but said he didn't fear for his life. Official investigators have yet to reach a conclusion on who may have been responsible. Amna Guellali, of the rights group Human Rights Watch, said the government itself bears some responsibility because of its ""laxity"" in failing to respond to a climate of rising political violence. ""We warned the government that these incidents of violence should be investigated thoroughly and that people who have perpetrated these acts should be punished ... but we haven't heard anything back,"" she told CNN in Tunis. She cited calls by preachers in some mosques in July for the killing of certain Tunisian political figures and personalities, including Belaid, she said. ""We didn't see the government reacting to these calls of clear incitement to murder,"" she said. ""A government has to protect its citizens ... especially if there are clear threats against this person."" Dan Rivers reported from Tunis, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Brian Walker contributed from Atlanta.","NEW: ""The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people,"" Jebali says .

"(CNN) -- The planet's most in-form golfer won't be lining up at Dove Mountain this month, but Tiger Woods has committed to playing the first of the season's World Golf Championship events. Sunday's Pebble Beach winner Brandt Snedeker has suffered an untimely injury blow and has been ruled out of the $8.5 million Accenture World Match Play Championship in Arizona due to rib soreness. The new world No. 4 has been replaced in the elite 64-man field by 66th-ranked Swede Fredrik Jacobson for the February 20-24 tournament. Snedeker, who went on holiday after playing his fifth tournament this year, has been advised to rest by his doctor but hopes to return for next month's WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. He has had finishes of 3-23-2-2-1 this season, having scooped the $10 million FedEx Cup jackpot after winning last September's Tour Championship in his final top-level PGA Tour outing of 2012. World No. 2 Woods has committed to both WGC events plus the Honda Classic, starting February 28, where he tied for second last year behind world No. 1 Rory McIlroy. ""The Honda Classic is a really good tournament, and it does a lot for the community,"" said Woods, who has already won one title this year, finishing ahead of Snedeker at Torrey Pines last month. ""I like the golf course, and I came pretty close last year. It's part of a busy stretch for me, and I want to continue playing well."" His three-tournament run comes in the lead-up to the Masters, where the former world No. 1 will seek to win his 15th major title but first since 2008. Jacobson tied for seventh at Pebble Beach, just his second start since October due to back problems. He lost in the first round of the Match Play last year, his first appearance since 2005 when it was still held in Carlsbad, California. ""I'm excited to come back,"" the 38-year-old said. ""I was there a few years before last year, and any of these tournaments, the WGCs, the majors -- if you're on the bubble for them, you want to get some kind of rhythm where you get to play a lot of them and get accustomed to the courses."" Phil Mickelson, who finished 60th in his Pebble Beach title defense the week after winning in Phoenix, will not be in the field at Dove Mountain. He withdrew to spend time with his family, and will be replaced by 65th-ranked Irishman Shane Lowry.","New world No. 4 Brandt Snedeker ruled out of Accenture World Match Play event .

"(CNN) -- In the middle of a shooting spree that killed three people and unleashed terror on Southern California motorists Tuesday morning, Ali Syed told one of his carjacking victims to walk away, police say. ""Mr. Syed ... said, 'I don't want to hurt you, I killed somebody. Today's my last day. Give me your keys,' "" Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan told reporters. According to preliminary accounts from police, Syed, 20, didn't intentionally spare another target. Police say they believe Syed, a part-time college student, fatally shot a woman at his family's Ladera Ranch home before killing two other people -- including a senior citizen executed outside his vehicle -- and wounding three others as he fired a shotgun at Orange County motorists on the Costa Mesa Freeway and committed three carjackings. The spree ended when Syed died after he turned his gun on himself as police approached on a road north of Tustin, authorities say. The Orange County Sheriff's Department says it was called to the Ladera Ranch home, where Syed lived with his parents, on a report of shots fired about 4:45 a.m. PT. A woman in her 20s was found dead there. Police said she wasn't related to Syed, but they didn't release her name, and they said they didn't know why she was at the home. Syed left the home in his parents' SUV, police said. About 25 minutes after that police call and 20 miles to the northwest, Syed drove into a Denny's and Big Lots parking lot in Tustin, exited the vehicle and shot a driver in the back of the head, Jordan said. The wounded motorist -- a man who was waiting for his son to carpool with him to work -- managed to drive away before stopping near an overpass, Jordan said. The victim was being treated Tuesday, police said. That's when Syed, whose SUV had a flat tire, approached the man he would spare. Syed ran toward the man at a nearby gas station, took his keys and drove the pickup truck away without firing at him, Jordan said. Syed then drove south on the Costa Mesa Freeway, exited onto a transition road, got out of the vehicle and fired a shotgun at southbound vehicles on the freeway, hitting three vehicles, police said. One of the freeway drivers was wounded in the hand and face, but investigators don't know whether the wounds were from shotgun rounds or debris, according to Jordan. Police said Syed then drove to nearby Santa Ana, crashing the pickup into a curb on a freeway off-ramp. There, he pointed the shotgun at Melvin L. Edwards, 69, of Laguna Hills, who was in a BMW at a stop sign. ""Syed ... got (Edwards) out of the car at gunpoint, walked him across the road and executed him -- shot him three times,"" Jordan said. Syed drove Edwards' BMW to the parking lot of a Tustin-area Micro Center computer store, where police said he found his next two shooting victims. Syed shot and killed Jeremy Lewis, 26, of Fullerton, who was in a vehicle in the lot, police said. Lewis had worked at a construction site across the street. People from the construction site then approached, and Syed shot and wounded one of them in the arm, Jordan said. Syed entered that person's vehicle and drove north on the Costa Mesa Freeway before exiting again. By that time, authorities had received many phone calls about the shootings, and California Highway Patrol officers found Syed driving at an intersection about 5 miles north of Tustin, Jordan said. Syed exited the vehicle as it slowly rolled near the intersection, according to police. ""There really wasn't a confrontation at that very end,"" Jordan said. ""As soon as he got out of his vehicle, before it actually came to a complete stop, he shot and killed himself,"" Jordan said. Syed was unemployed and taking one class at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, an Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Police said they're trying to determine what led to the shootings, and that they didn't yet know of a motive. CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.","Ali Syed killed three, wounded three during spree that involved carjackings in Orange County, police say .

"(CNN) -- Everyone's a critic; I get that. But does everyone have to be a historian, too? What audiences perceive as their inalienable right to challenge the accuracy and authenticity of movies seems to get much more exercised before the Academy Awards than at any other time of the year. The latest challenge came Tuesday from Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, who said Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" misrepresented the way his predecessors in the 1865 House of Representatives voted on the 13th Amendment banning slavery. Courtney looked it up online and found in his research that all four Connecticut representatives voted for the amendment -- the movie shows two voting against. So in a letter to Spielberg's DreamWorks production office in Los Angeles, he asked DreamWorks for some form of correction. (DreamWorks hasn't been heard from yet.) The film, considered a favorite for a best picture Oscar, places the back-and-forth struggle over the amendment in the forefront of its depiction of the 16th president, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Courtney, unlike most others who have complained about big-time Oscar contenders, isn't out to ruin anybody's chances. He says he likes everything else about the movie. He merely wants props restored to his home state. And he seems to have a good case. But you can bet your annual subscription to US Weekly magazine that the chatterboxes who gossip about and/or handicap the Academy Awards are going to try using his complaint as further indication of ""Lincoln's"" slipping stature as a best picture shoo-in. Some of these pundits claim ""Argo"" is charging hard from behind since its unexpected wins at both the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards. And yet ""Argo"" has truthiness issues of its own. Director-star Ben Affleck even admitted before the movie's release last fall that his movie about the 1979 CIA rescue of State Department employees from Iran stretched certain details for dramatic effect. (Spoiler alert!) There was, for instance, no last-minute car chase on a Tehran tarmac as Americans tried to escape on a plane, and their check-in at the terminal wasn't in real life nearly the white-knuckle sequence of events you see in the film. Others have said the movie misrepresents the Iranian people as completely unified in their support of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy. ""Thirty-three million Iranians ... did not commit acts of murder and terrorism,"" Iranian commentator Kambiz Atabai wrote on The Daily Beast. ""Thirty-three million Iranians did not chant 'Death to America!' or take Americans hostage."" But neither ""Lincoln"" nor ""Argo"" has reaped the whirlwind of criticism of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" for its depiction of events leading up to the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. Even before its limited release in December, the movie couldn't be discussed without referring to those accusing the movie of glorifying waterboarding of suspected terrorists or, at best, misleading audiences into believing that such so-called ""enhanced interrogation"" played a key role in guiding the United States to bin Laden. Whatever critics or defenders say, the dispute alone is enough to make academy voters skittish about rewarding something that causes so much trouble. You have to wonder: What is the big deal? None of these films are documentaries and thus do not have the same obligations to fact. Yet one could argue that taking too many liberties with real life (whatever that means) could distort for generations the true story; that, indeed, what is enhanced for dramatic purposes becomes what everyone believes is what actually happened. It's not so cut and dried. Consider D.W. Griffith's 1915 ""The Birth of a Nation,"" regarded as the first great American film epic, whose glorification of the Ku Klux Klan makes contemporary audiences uneasy at best, infuriated at worst. Despite protests by the NAACP and other civil rights organizations, audiences generally agreed with President Woodrow Wilson's purported assessment of the movie: ""It's like history written with lightning."" But society can change perception of art over time to the point of neutralizing, even transfiguring its original intent. No one now mistakes Griffith's movie as anything close to historic fact, but it could still be seen as a representation of a racist viewpoint that once held sway over much of America . Then there is John Ford, the great American director of such classic westerns as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""The Searchers"" (1956) and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962). It was in the latter movie that Ford's aesthetic credo was put forth by a minor character, a journalist who discovers that the career-making triumph of a U.S. senator over an outlaw didn't happen as originally believed. The journalist chooses to keep things status quo. ""This is the West, sir,"" he explains. ""When legend becomes fact, print the legend."" He might have added: ""Because it makes a better story."" Or consider ""My Darling Clementine,"" Ford's 1946 version of the Wyatt Earp saga. As the movie opens, the Earp brothers are herding cattle to Tombstone, Arizona, in 1882 when the youngest brother James is shot dead (in the back, of course) by the rustling Clanton family. Three things, right off the bat are wrong: James was the eldest of the Earps, not the youngest, the Earp brothers never had any cattle either heading toward or ensconced within Tombstone's city limits and, though James' death is depicted as the spark that eventually led to the Earps' confrontation with the Clantons at the OK Corral, that famous gunfight actually occurred in 1881 -- if you're scoring, that's one year earlier. And the inaccuracies only begin there. And yet the movie endures as one of Ford's best even after four movies about the same legend have been made, each claiming to be more faithful to historic fact than ""Clementine."" But ""My Darling Clementine,"" a dream about a past that didn't exist, endures in collective memory. It may not be factual, but it's true to something; a vision, a state of mind, an aspiration to something we wish had been, or could be. The most recent film about the legend, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994), is so faithful that you can barely remember anything about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: ""Lincoln"" error on emancipation vote shines light on how films tell history .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- Ten people were killed Saturday after a cargo plane crashed through a fence surrounding an airport in Accra, Ghana, and slammed into a bus, municipal and national officials said. The Boeing 727 cargo plane -- operated by the Nigerian-based Allied Air company -- touched down around 7 p.m. Saturday on a runway at Accra's Kotoka International Airport but was not able to stop, officials said. ""The cargo plane ... shot the runway, broke through a wall and (that) resulted in the death of 10 people who were traveling on a commercial vehicle,"" Deputy Transport Minister Dzifa Attivor said. There were no survivors aboard the mangled mini-bus, officials said. By 10 p.m., those killed had been put in body bags and moved from the scene, which was crowded with emergency, security and government officials. As to the crew of the cargo plane, which took off earlier in the day from Lagos, they were transported to a local hospital for treatment, said Attivor. Their airliner was lying across the road from the airport, on a parcel of land abutting an Accra football stadium. Its wings and nose were severely damaged, while its tailfin had broken off. It was raining in Accra at the time of the crash.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A former foreign minister joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's future governing coalition and has been tapped to lead peace talks with the Palestinians. Tzipi Livni and her centrist Hatnua party will be part of a government headed by Likud-Beitenu, the political movement headed by the prime minister. Livni, a former opposition leader, foreign minister and justice minister, will again serve in the justice minister post. Hatnua, which means ""movement,"" is the first party to join a Netanyahu's coalition. There has been a lot of political jockeying among a range of movements since last month's national elections. Among those are centrists, rightists, and ultra-Orthodox groups. Netanyahu, who was chosen to pick a government after his party won the most votes in the election, wants to build a broad coalition -- one that easily surpasses the 60-seat majority in the 120-member Knesset, Israel's parliament. ""The threats coming from Iran, Syria and the Hezbollah have not stopped for a moment and in order to give an answer to these threats we need to form a wide and stable government,"" Netanyahu said. Livni, who campaigned on the importance of the peace process, thanked Netanyahu. ""The obligation to the diplomatic process and the confidence that has been bestowed on us led to this partnership, a partnership that came about after we had talks and I received the appropriate powers to be the negotiator of the State of Israel to get to the end of the conflict with the Palestinians on the basis of the two-state solution,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Not your typical Valentine's Day release, ""Die Hard""'s fifth is Hollywood's counterpunch to chocolates, roses and romance. It's an anti-date movie. Well, unless your date is also your dad. Bruce Willis has been playing John McClane, off and on, for a quarter century now, and while he shows no inclination of throwing in the towel, it's hard to see much future for the geriatric action film he and his former Planet Hollywood cronies are peddling these days with ""The Expendables."" ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a more lavish demolition derby than ""Bullet to the Head"" or ""The Last Stand,"" but it's also more slavish in its adherence to a formula that's all but spent. No one's heart seems to be in it, they're just going through the motions. Why 'Die Hard' is the perfect Valentine's Day movie for guys . A New York cop who scarcely seems to spend any time in the Big Apple, McClane heads out to Moscow to bail out a deadbeat son, Jack, who I don't recall featuring in the earlier movies. Jai Courtney, from ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" is what they call ""fresh meat"" and a more conventional action hero than Justin Long was in McClane's last escapade. But on this evidence McClane junior hasn't inherited any of his father's charisma or wry wit. Mostly he just looks put out, understandable as screenwriter Skip Woods makes sure senior always has the last word. Not that any of Willis' wisecracks are anything to write home about. That trademark smirk is stretched pretty thin. It's only after Jack has bust out of his trial, dragging a political prisoner with him (Sebastian Koch) that John finds out his boy is with the CIA. By then the extraction is blown, and father and son have a rogue militia wing tearing up the streets gunning for them. This is male bonding with a capital ""B,"" but comparisons with the reinvigorated 007 series only show how far behind ""Die Hard"" has fallen. A lengthy chase on the Moscow ring road throws entire fleets of Russian commuters under the proverbial bus, but still feels like an inferior copy of a similar sequence in ""Skyfall,"" while director John Moore (""Max Payne"") defaults to the ADD editing style that's only good for disguising how thinly-imagined this show really is. Even a climactic showdown in Chernobyl, a potentially fascinating location for any movie, proves a damp squib. Moore gives us an abandoned industrial plant at night, and any radiation barely even registers as a factor (the McClanes don't need hazmat suits; they're indestructible). If there's something crassly opportunistic about exploiting a real life disaster on the scale of Chernobyl for cheap thrills, that's part and parcel of the film's cynicism. There's always been an undercurrent of xenophobia in the ""Die Hard"" series, but this movie's crude insistence on a corrupt, morally bankrupt Russia betrays simple-minded nostalgia for those Cold War days when the Berlin Wall demarcated good and evil. Do I ask too much from an action film? If so it's only because I haven't forgotten how good the first ""Die Hard"" was (and still is). The producers keep throwing more money at the franchise, but in this case more is less. Less attention to character, coherence and suspense, the very qualities that made ""Die Hard"" stand out in the first place. ""A Good Day to Die Hard""? A good time to call it a day.","Bruce Willis is back for the latest installment in the ""Die Hard"" franchise .

"(CNN) -- Russian scientists briefly pierced the two-mile-thick veil over a freshwater lake hidden beneath Antarctica's ice sheet for millions of years, polar researchers announced Wednesday. Scientists hope samples of Lake Vostok, a body the size of Lake Ontario, will yield signs of previously undiscovered life and new clues about the history of the planet. The lake is believed to have been covered by ice for up to 30 million years. Russian researchers completed the drilling effort Sunday, reaching the lake at a depth of 3,769 meters (2.3 miles) into the ice, the St. Petersburg-based Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute reported. When the ice above the lake was breached, lake water was sucked up into the bore and froze, the Russians said. That will allow researchers to take samples back to the surface without contaminating the lake below, they said. Columbia University geophysicist Robin Bell said the Antarctic ice sheet has covered the lake for an estimated 15 million to 30 million years. The Russians have been trying to reach Lake Vostok for more than a decade, and the institute said Russian Natural Resources and Ecology Minister Yuri Trutnev was on hand for the final steps. ""They consider it the equivalent of getting to the moon,"" Bell told CNN. The lake's existence was confirmed in 1996. Earlier drilling by scientists from multiple nations produced ice cores that contain trapped atmospheric gases, which scientists have used to measure changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide over time. Bell said former Vice President Al Gore cited Vostok ice cores in the 2006 documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" about the threat of global climate change. And peering into the long-hidden waters could give scientists a glimpse of primordial life forms never before catalogued. ""Every place we've looked on Earth, we've come up with life,"" Bell said. ""So it would be kind of surprising if we didn't find life there."" The earlier drillings stopped short of the lake, in part because scientists weren't confident about getting to the water without contaminating it. University of Hawaii oceanography professor David M. Karl said areas of those cores that were near the lake -- accreted ice, or ice derived from the lake itself -- contained a few viable bacteria that became active under incubation. ""There were a very few microorganisms, but in fact there were microorganisms,"" said Karl, who found them in a half-meter sample of the accreted ice in the late 1990s. He said that could mean viable microorganisms exist in the lake. It's also possible nothing is alive there, in part because no sunlight gets to the lake through ice that thick. But fossil microorganisms may be found, and microorganisms could be living off other sources of energy, such as geothermal, he said. ""There also could be living microorganism living off of previously stored energy from sediments,"" Karl said. Bell said that to reach the water, the Russians drilled to within about 10 meters (33 feet) of the bottom of the ice, then withdrew the drill bit and used a heat probe to bore the rest of the way. The effort was designed so that when the ice sheet was breached, lake water was drawn upward a short distance. That water quickly froze, closing off the lake and allowing scientists to take samples without introducing any contaminants, Bell said. ""The international community has tried to work collaboratively to try to make sure things are done as safely as possible, and it's in the Russians' interests to do it right,"" she said.","NEW: Scientists hope samples will yield previously undiscovered life, clues of planet's history .
Russia says its scientists have reached the lake under 2 miles of ice .

"(CNN) -- Who -- or what -- is ""War Horse"" for? Steven Spielberg's second movie of the season is a very different kettle of fish from ""The Adventures of Tintin,"" which is unpretentious escapism aimed directly at the family audience. ""War Horse"" is his pedigree picture, the tipsters' front-runner for the Academy Awards. But the marketing materials are also at pains to stress that this is ""an epic adventure for audiences of all ages,"" and it's based on a children's novel by Michael Morpungo (by way of Nick Stafford's acclaimed stage adaptation), so I guess the ideal audience would be a teenage Academy voter, a history buff with a thing for horses. Set in and immediately prior to World War I, the movie chronicles the experiences of a feisty colt, a thoroughbred who's named Joey by the tenant farmer's son (newcomer Jeremy Irvine), who cares for him and coaxes him to drag a plough through a rock pile. Sold into the army by the boy's drunken and penurious father (Peter Mullan), Joey passes from one rider to the next: a British cavalry officer (Tom Hiddleston), a German hospital orderly (David Kross), a young French girl (Celine Buckens), and so on, in the narrative equivalent of a relay race -- the horse being the baton. Inevitably this episodic story hits highs and lows. Spielberg invests a great deal in the first act, an agrarian melodrama shot in the rosy, romantic style that David Lean brought to ""Ryan's Daughter."" Mullan plays one of those proud working-class types who will outbid his landlord for a pretty horse just because he likes its spirit (and has drunk too much spirits himself). The plot builds to a ploughing sequence so overwrought you would think the colt had parted the Red Sea. John Williams' lush symphonic score is a constant presence, while Janusz Kaminski's artful lighting is another self-conscious throwback, this time to the classical style of 1940s studio filmmaking. (Almost as clearly as ""The Artist,"" ""War Horse"" is Hollywood pastiche, with bits and pieces of Elia Kazan and even ""Gone with the Wind"" whipped into the mix.) The prologue evokes a rudimentary class consciousness that evaporates as soon as Joey comes into the possession of Hiddleston's gallant cavalry captain -- whose fateful battle charge is one of the film's most impressive flourishes, and a striking expression of another of the story's obvious themes, the industrialization of warfare. But the movie loses its footing badly in the next two episodes, when the focus shifts away from the horse and on to his minders: two German deserters, and then a French farmer and his granddaughter. This last is an especially ill-judged interlude, and seems only to have been included as an olive branch toward any young horse-lovers of the female persuasion who may have found themselves at this war movie by mistake. The scrupulously neutral and fundamentally banal screenplay by Lee Hall (""Billy Elliot"") and Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"") reaches its nadir shortly afterward, when Joey apparently ""volunteers"" to drag heavy artillery through the mud in order to relieve a four-legged comrade he recognizes from their cavalry unit. Such blatant Disneyfication sits very strangely alongside Spielberg's real piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, a nightmarish, expressionist mad dash across the trenches into the barbed-wire hell of no man's land. The animal's terror and anguish is vivid and horrific, and this long sequence is reason enough to concern parents of preteens. We are promised ""no animals were harmed"" during the filming, but there's no such guarantee for the little beasts sitting beside you. (The film is sensibly rated PG-13.)","""War Horse"" chronicles the experiences of a feisty colt, a thoroughbred named Joey .

"New York (CNN) -- A Lufthansa jumbo jet nearly collided with another plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport Monday after an EgyptAir flight apparently veered into its path just as the jet barreled down the runway, according to air traffic controller tapes. The near miss was captured on audio recordings, revealing an air traffic controller communicating with the Lufthansa pilot, yelling ""Cancel takeoff! Cancel takeoff plans!"" as the two planes moved toward each other. The pilot of the Lufthansa jet acknowledged as the plane rolled to a halt. Lufthansa Flight 411, an Airbus 340 packed with 286 passengers and crew, was cleared for takeoff by air traffic control shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. EgyptAir Flight 986, a Boeing 777, was issued instructions to taxi from the ramp area to the airfield for departure. The plane was instructed to turn onto another taxiway, but instead went straight, the statement said. A spokesman for EgyptAir said the flight was delayed 40 minutes because Lufthansa's departure was delayed. The plane did not move until the tower issued clearance, spokesman Mohamed Rahma said. After a brief inspection at the gate, the Lufthansa flight continued on its flight to Munich, Germany, and arrived safely, according to Lufthansa spokesman Martin Riecken. The FAA is currently investigating the incident. Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","A spokesman for EgyptAir said the plane did not move until the tower issued clearance .

"(CNN) -- If you want to bring a piece of Camelot home to your castle, Presidents Day weekend will bring a rare opportunity. You could win a piece of presidential history -- actually, hundreds of them. Amesbury, Massachusetts-based John McInnis Auctioneers says it is auctioning off 723 lots of documents, photographs, letters and gifts from the estate of David Powers, longtime friend and special assistant to President John F. Kennedy. The auction will be held at 11 a.m. on Sunday, February 17. Potential buyers can view the items online now or by visiting the auction house from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. daily from Saturday, February 9, through Saturday, February 16, and starting at 8 a.m. on the auction day. Powers' family members discovered the memorabilia locked away last year as they prepared to sell the family home, the auctioneer's website says. McInnis appraiser Dan Meader told CNN that the family engaged McInnis last May. Powers traveled with JFK from 1946 to 1963 and was the curator of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum until he retired in 1994. He died in 1998 at the age of 85. ""The auction is in chronological order, from the earliest to the latest stuff, to follow the lives of Dave Powers in relation to the Kennedy family,"" Meader said. Lower-numbered lots include candid snapshots of the strapping young Kennedy and his siblings enjoying themselves in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm Beach, Florida. The mid-numbered lots focus on one-of-a-kind photographs from the 1960 campaign and JFK's ensuing presidency, some signed by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The president's personal Air Force One bomber jacket, given to Powers in 1962 or 1963, gets its own catalog page, as does a May 29, 1963, birthday card signed by JFK's young son, John Jr. Another item is a marked-up itinerary for the fateful trip JFK took to Dallas 50 years ago this November. While McInnis previously has auctioned off individual lots related to Kennedy, the house has never hosted an auction ""of this scope or magnitude or personal connection,"" Meader says. ""This is a truly unique opportunity. Dave Powers is not a member of the family, but he really was... he was as close as he could be."" ""Growing up in Massachusetts, every family had a picture of JFK on the wall. These are not like that. These are things that belong to the president's close, close, close friend,"" Meader says, noting the inscriptions are sometimes ""heartbreaking"" and tell a story. Items span several generations of Kennedys, from patriarch Joseph, to brothers Robert and Edward, to niece Maria Shriver and her estranged husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Aficionados can get some of the limited live auction seating by purchasing the print 124-page catalog for $50. Meader says a portion of that charge will be donated to the Kennedy Library, though he isn't sure how much. The catalog has been scanned onto McInnis' website, where potential buyers can see the artifacts in their full-color glory before deciding on bidding online. Meader expects bidders around the world to compete in real time via phone or computer, along with the people in the room. Online winners will have to pay a slightly higher commission on winning bids.

"Zapata, Texas (CNN) -- The wife of an American man missing since a reported pirate attack on a U.S.-Mexico border lake said Thursday it's ""hard being judged"" by people who have questioned her story, but ""I know what happened that day."" Tiffany Hartley told authorities her husband David was shot and killed by pirates on Falcon Lake during a sightseeing trip last week. His body has yet to be found, leading to questions about the accuracy of her account. But Hartley told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" on Thursday that ""I know what I know."" ""It's hard being judged and thought of that I might have done something to him,"" she said. But she added, ""As long as I know the truth, God knows the truth. And other than that, it almost doesn't really matter to me, because I know what happened that day."" Mexican authorities said earlier this week that they could not verify the shooting, and Hartley was asked point-blank on NBC's ""Today"" show Wednesday whether she had anything to do with her husband's disappearance. Pam Hartley, David Hartley's mother, said Tuesday that any suggestion that her daughter-in-law's account was inaccurate is ""insane."" Investigators have found some evidence that backs up Hartley's account, including blood on her life vest, Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. said Thursday. And the incident was similar to other attacks reported by boaters on Falcon Lake, about 70 miles west of the Hartley's home in McAllen. Gonzalez has said the gunmen are typically teenagers hired by a drug cartel in the neighboring Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Mexican authorities have said the lake is controlled on their side by ""organized criminals,"" and the sheriff called on the Zeta cartel to turn over Hartley's remains if they have them. ""We just want a body,"" he said. Tiffany Hartley said she believes the attackers took her 30-year-old husband's body after he was shot in the head and fell off the personal watercraft he was riding. She said she suspects her husbands' remains are more likely to have been dragged onto land than to have been left in the lake. ""We do believe if they would just go ahead and give us David's body back, it would be done. It would be concluded. We could go on with our lives,"" she said. Authorities from both nations are conducting separate searches and are coordinating and holding regular meetings, State Department spokeswoman Virginia Staab said. But because the alleged crime happened on the Mexican side of the border, the United States cannot prosecute or make arrests in the case, the sheriff said. Tiffany Hartley, 29, told HLN that the couple set out across the lake on personal watercraft for a sight-seeing trip to Guerrero Viejo, a half-submerged ghost town on the Mexican side of the lake. Though there had been warnings about previous robberies on the lake, she said they had heard of no problems for several months, ""So we figured eveyrthing had kind of calmed down."" Instead, she said, they were pursued by men in three boats as they left the site's historic church. At first, ""They just waved at us like we were friendly, a very friendly wave,"" she said. But then, as the couple passed, she said they began chasing them and firing shots. David Hartley was shot in the head and fell off his personal watercraft, and he was unresponsive when she turned back to try to retrieve him, his wife said. While she was trying to haul him onto her craft, their attackers pulled up alongside, she said. ""They didn't say anything to me, so I don't know what they were trying to do think or they were doing, but they left,"" she said. ""They just left me there. Thankfully they didn't shoot at me. They had a gun pointed at me."" Unable to pull her husband's body out of the water, Tiffany Hartley headed back across the lake to U.S. waters. She said the gunmen fired ""a few more"" times on her way back. ""Once I started to get going, I just went as fast as I could and didn't look back until I couldn't see them anymore,"" she said. A man who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity this week said Hartley appeared shaken and upset when she came ashore and asked him to call sheriff's deputies. Rolando Flores, lead investigator for the Tamaulipas state police, described the area as ""a conflict zone."" The state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence, and there have been at least four cases of gunmen in Mexican waters robbing or threatening boaters on Falcon Lake since April, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. David Hartley worked for an oil company in Reynosa, Mexico, and the couple had lived on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before moving back to the United States earlier this year, family friends said. His aunt, Alice Harrod, told HLN's ""Prime News"" the family had concerns about their safety in the area, ""and we were all thrilled to hear that they were moving back to Colorado,"" where they grew up. ""We're all very devastated. It's hard to even believe something like this could happen. We're hanging in there, but it's very, very difficult for the whole family,"" Harrod said. According to Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, 60 Mexican personnel, three boats and a helicopter have taken part in the search. Investigators resumed their work Thursday despite threats to their lives, and Cuellar suggested that the Mexican navy might need to be called in to help. Despite the dangers on the Mexican side of the lake, Texas officials on Thursday said that the U.S. side of the body of water remains safe. "" It is just as safe now as any other time. However, there is a threat,"" said Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas. CNN's Justine Redman, Nick Valencia, Dave Alsup and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Wife tells HLN, ""I know what I know""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli soldier faces a manslaughter charge in the death of a Palestinian waving a white flag during a three-week incursion into Gaza, the Israeli military said Tuesday. The criminal indictment is one of three legal actions taken by the Israeli military for incidents that occurred during Operation Cast Lead. More than 1,100 Palestinians died during the operation, which began late in 2008 and ended early in 2009. It was intended to halt the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel. The manslaughter charge was filed after an investigation into the shooting, the Israel Defense Forces said in a news release. ""This decision is based on evidence that the soldier, who was serving as a designated marksman, deliberately targeted an individual walking with a group of people waving a white flag without being ordered or authorized to do so,"" the IDF said. Conflict between the testimonies of Palestinian witnesses and military personnel made it ""impossible to make a criminal connection"" between this incident and an incident described by those Palestinian witnesses in which Israeli soldiers allegedly fired at people waving white flags, the IDF said. In another incident, a battalion commander authorized sending a Palestinian man into a house sheltering terrorists next to his own house in order to persuade them to leave, the news release said. The commander was indicted ""because he deviated from authorized and appropriate IDF behavior"" and ignored rules on the use of civilians in military operations, it said. But the release did not appear to say what charges he faces, and the IDF did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking clarification. Tuesday's news release also said a criminal investigation has been ordered into an incident in which a residence holding about 100 members of a family was struck from the air. In a separate case, an investigation into an assertion that the Ibrahim Al-Makadma mosque had been attacked concluded that that did not happen, but that an aerial strike near the mosque had occurred. ""The aerial strike targeted a terror operative involved in the launching of rockets toward Israel who was standing outside of the mosque,"" the news release said. ""Injuries caused to civilians inside were unintentional and caused by shrapnel that penetrated the mosque."" But the investigation concluded that the officer who ordered the attack had ""failed to exercise appropriate judgment"" and, as a result, will not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command. Legal measures were deemed unnecessary, however. ""The military advocate general decided that the attack did not violate international laws of warfare because the attack did not target the mosque, rather it targeted a terror operative, and when the attack was authorized, no possibility of harming civilians was identified,"" it said. Israeli investigators looked into more than 150 reports and conducted nearly 50 probes of incidents during Operation Cast Lead. Earlier this year, the Israeli military disciplined two officers -- a brigadier general and a colonel -- for allowing artillery shells to be fired into a populated area of Gaza. But Palestinians said Israel's actions were unsatisfactory. ""I think Israel should take all responsibility for all the war crimes that it is responsible for during its unjustified war in Gaza, and what they just announced is too little too late,"" Palestinian spokesman Ghassan Khatib told CNN. The IDF news release said that Israel carried out the operation after enduring eight years of rocket attacks from Gaza. Israel, it said, had ""practiced a policy of restraint for a long period of time."" It accused the Palestinian movement Hamas of terrorizing the population and said the crowded urban centers of Gaza created a complex security situation. More than 1,400 Palestinians died in Israel's incursion, according to officials in Gaza. The Israeli military said 1,166 people were killed, 60 percent of whom were ""terror operatives."" The 575-page Goldstone report -- approved by the U.N. Council for Human Rights in 2009 -- accused both Israel and Hamas of ""actions amounting to war crimes, possibly crimes against humanity"" during the three-week offensive that ended in January 2009. The report, known for its author, South African jurist Richard Goldstone, called on both Israel and Hamas to independently investigate the alleged human rights violations cited in the report.","Evidence indicates that a Palestinian waving white flag was shot and killed .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled a new college affordability plan Friday, proposing to further expand student financial aid while providing more assistance to schools that hold tuition down and cutting aid to those that do not. The plan is part of a populist White House pitch to middle class families that promises to play an integral role in the Democrats' 2012 campaign. Appearing before a raucous student crowd in Michigan -- a potentially critical swing state this year -- Obama outlined plans to boost total federal spending on Perkins loans from $1 billion to $8 billion. He also announced plans to push for the creation of a $1 billion competition encouraging states to contain public tuition rates, among other things. ""We want a country where everybody has a chance,"" Obama declared while visiting the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor. America should be a ""big, bold, generous country where everybody gets a fair shot."" Noting that student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt, the president said Washington is ""putting colleges on notice. You can't assume you'll just jack up tuition every year."" ""We should push colleges to do better,"" he said. ""We should hold them accountable if they don't."" Obama also proposed establishing a $55 million competition to spur new college strategies encouraging greater educational productivity and student outcomes. The president said he wants to create a ""college scoreboard,"" giving families easy-to-read information about individual college costs and graduation rates, among other things. Finally, the administration announced plans to push Congress to keep interest rates low for current student loan borrowers while doubling the number of work-study jobs over the next five years. Obama warned Friday that rising tuition costs are now threatening to surpass the ability of government to help pay for them. Between 1999 and 2010, inflation adjusted prices for undergraduate tuition, room and board rose 37% at public schools and 25% at private colleges, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Education Department. ""We can't keep subsidizing (skyrocketing) tuition,"" he said. ""Sooner or later we're going to run out of money."" College affordability has been a recurring theme for Obama. In 2010, Congress approved a bill that restructured the federal student loan program and redirected $61 billion towards post-secondary education spending, according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Obama's 2009 stimulus plan also included a temporary $2,500 tax credit for higher education expenses, which the president has now proposed making permanent. The trip to Michigan capped a three-day presidential tour that also took Obama to Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, and Arizona -- all states that are likely to be hotly contested in November. On Thursday, Obama hit another key reelection theme -- clean energy. At the same time, he also discussed plans to sell off oil and gas leases on 38 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico seafloor as part of a sweeping new domestic energy push. The leases could yield as much as 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the Interior Department estimates. The sale scheduled in June will be the second since the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010 when nearly 5 million barrels of crude spewed into the Gulf. Obama mentioned the planned lease sales in his remarks at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, which has a 1-megawatt solar array and last year test-piloted jets that run on advanced biofuels. Republicans have been fiercely critical of Obama's energy stance, questioning investments in certain clean energy companies as well as the recent rejection of a permit to build a pipeline to transport oil from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. Obama, however, insisted Thursday that his energy plan is an ""all-out, all-in, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy."" Among other things, the president also promised more federal assistance for local governments to upgrade their automotive fleets while also pushing new tax incentives for cleaner corporate vehicles. Obama said the administration is working to develop up to five highway natural gas corridors, and he announced a new competition to encourage the development of breakthroughs for natural gas vehicles. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Obama says he is ""putting colleges on notice"" that they can't keep raising tuition rates .

"(CNN) -- Democracy is a universal value and aspiration, unbound by region, ethnicity, culture or religion. In the last two decades, it has spread across the world in unprecedented ways. Elections are fundamental to the ethos and principles of democracy. They provide citizens with a say in the decisions that affect them and governments with a legitimate authority to govern. When elections are credible, free and fair, they can help promote democracy, human rights and security. But when elections are fraudulent, as we have seen in a number of countries, they can trigger political instability and even violence. This means that for democracy to fulfill its potential as a means of peacefully resolving social and political conflict, the integrity of elections is crucial. Threats to electoral integrity are not limited to poor, divided or war-torn countries. They can be found in every democracy. Many of the countries that embraced democracy in the last 20 years now struggle to entrench democratic governance. In some long-standing democracies, citizen trust and confidence in democratic institutions have dropped precipitously. Opinion: Politics by mob in China and Mideast . Global recession and rising inequality are putting pressure on older democracies to show that they are relevant to their citizens' concerns. The infusion of money in politics, for example, threatens to hollow out democracy. And recent events in the Middle East and North Africa demonstrate that revolutionary transitions hold both opportunities and dangerous pitfalls. In response to these concerns, a group of former political leaders and leading figures have come together to create the report, ""Deepening Democracy,"" which stresses the crucial importance of integrity in elections in advancing democracy, security and development. Elections with integrity by themselves will not build citizen trust in democracy. But they can be an important step in achieving the goal. Our report identifies five challenges for countries to overcome. First, the need to strengthen the rule of law so that elections and the rights of voters and candidates can be protected. Second, professional and independent national bodies should manage elections so that they are credible and the results are legitimate. I saw for myself in Kenya the catastrophic impact of the failure of the country's electoral commission to deliver these goals in the 2007 disputed presidential contest, when 1,300 people were killed and over 600,000 displaced in waves of unprecedented post-election violence. We must prevent this kind of tragedy from ever repeating. Third, greater efforts are needed to build the institutions, processes and behaviors that are vital for genuine multi-party competition and division of power. They would bestow legitimacy on the winner, provide security for the losers, and end the ""winner-takes-all"" politics that discourages democratic practice. Fourth, the integrity of elections requires political equality. The barriers that prevent voting and wider participation in political life must be removed. Too often, women, young people, minorities and other marginalized groups are not given a full opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. Finally, unregulated money in politics undermines voters' faith in elections and confidence in democracy. Vote buying and bribery of candidates, including by organized crime, have to be prevented in both aspiring and mature democracies. And we must tackle the explosive growth in campaign expenditures that is damaging confidence in electoral equality by strengthening fears that wealth buys political influence. These are all, of course, political challenges. But politicians cannot resolve them alone. Civil society and the media play their roles and have responsibilities as well. Opinion: What if U.S. stops policing the world? In addition, international funding ought to support democratic reform and electoral integrity rather than, as happened too often in the past, prop up authoritarian regimes. This entails increased efforts to prevent abuse throughout the political and electoral cycle and not just around a particular ballot. Our report provides a strategy on a global level. Governments need to regulate political donations and spending, and require full transparency and disclosure of donations with penalties for non-compliance. Organizations that manage elections in each country must come together to create international standards of professionalism, independence and competence against which they agree to be measured. A new transnational organization should be created to grade countries on their elections and to sound the alarm about electoral malpractice. The international community can then agree clearly on ""red lines"" of extreme electoral abuse, which would trigger condemnation and, if necessary, sanction. Such a program for delivering elections with integrity -- with its emphasis on inclusion, transparency and accountability -- can promote better governance, greater security and human development. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kofi Annan.","Kofi Annan: Democracy is a universal value and aspiration, unbound by region or culture .
Annan: For democracy to fulfill its potential, we must have fair and credible elections .
He says threats to democracies -- both old and new -- must be overcome .

"(CNN) -- Racist abuse, fan violence, attacks on players -- on the face of it, English football seems to be experiencing a return to the dark days that led to its clubs being banned from Europe in the 1980s. One respected English newspaper declared the sport to be ""toxic"" and ""spinning out of control"" following Sunday's tumultuous Manchester derby. ""Disturbing ... deplorable ... unacceptable"" was how Football Association chairman David Bernstein described the pitch invasion, coin throwing, allegations of racist abuse and 13 arrests made during and after United's 3-2 victory at City. That the Premier League's two leading clubs could be involved in such a poor advert for one of the world's most popular and lucrative sporting competitions has led many to question its leaders. The headlines point to a descent back down the slippery slope that resulted in the 1989 Hillsborough and 1985 Heysel stadium tragedies. The latter occurred when fighting fans at the European Cup final caused a crush that killed 39 supporters of Italian club Juventus. English team Liverpool was also involved at Hillsborough, where 96 people died during an FA Cup match -- an independent review this year found that the fatal crush was caused by the way British police penned rival fans into small enclosures as part of its anti-hooliganism strategy. But there is another view to counter this week's media hysteria -- namely that football is only now facing up to realities deep at the heart of its foundations to which society has turned a blind eye for years. What's more, this could be a vital turning-point in trying to eradicate behavior that would not be tolerated in everyday life. ""Previously there were behaviors that we have just passed off as 'Ah, that's football,' "" said Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the English Professional Footballers' Association. ""Aggressive behavior in crowds, aggressive chanting, throwing things onto the pitch, certain levels of abuse -- people have been all too happy to say 'It's at a football match,' "" he told CNN. ""Now the tolerance levels for behavior like that are coming right down. That's why we're seeing increased numbers of incidents reported, of fans making monkey gestures in isolation, small numbers of people throwing things on the pitch. ""It has been happening for a while but now we are clamping down on these anti-social behaviors."" Arrests at Premier League matches actually dropped by 30% last season, but conversely the numbers for race-related transgressions have been steadily rising. The world is watching . The images of blood dripping from the face of Rio Ferdinand after the former England captain was hit by a coin thrown from the crowd on Sunday, and then of the Manchester United defender being confronted by a pitch-invading City fan -- all broadcast worldwide -- have been a lightning rod for criticism after a year of damaging controversies both in the Premier League and the lower divisions. But Carlisle, a former top-flight player now plying his trade in the fourth tier, believes it has just highlighted something that has been a regular occurrence for years. ""There have been many televised games where guys go to take corners and you see projectiles coming onto the pitch, but it's only on a rare occasion that they actually hit someone,"" said the 33-year-old, who in a television documentary explored the racist abuse his father suffered as a black player in a semi-pro English league. ""There's been a shift in people's acceptance of these behaviors,"" said Clarke. ""We're expecting people to behave far more reasonably at football matches, we are expecting the football authorities to take control of the situation with all the technology they have available, and we are expecting repercussions for those behaviors, for people to be accountable whether it's a player, a referee, club official or a fan."" Moral vacuum? However, there is a growing perception in Britain that those in power are not doing enough -- despite strongly worded statements by the likes of Bernstein. Herman Ouseley, chairman of the anti-racism group Kick It Out, has criticized the FA and the Premier League in their handling of the John Terry/Luis Suarez cases in the past year, labeling it ""12 months wasted in hypocrisy."" Terry lost the England captaincy before being cleared in court in July of racially abusing an opponent, but was then banned for four matches by the FA almost a year after the original incident. ""There is very little morality in football among the top clubs,"" Ouseley told British newspaper the Guardian. ""Leadership is so important; you have to send a powerful message that racism is completely unacceptable. But there is a moral vacuum. ""The big clubs look after their players as assets. There was no bold attitude from them, to say that they would not put up with it."" CNN asked the FA to respond to these accusations, but was told the ruling body would make no further comment on the Terry/Suarez cases. Clarke agrees that clubs should not just look out for their own short-term interests. ""There has to be individual responsibility and accountability at the football clubs for the behavior of their employees,"" he said. ""There's an element of responsibility that needs to be addressed. The FA's sanctions for players, for entry-level discrimination, need to be far sterner."" The FA has said it will review its sanctions, but no changes can be implemented until the start of next season. Clarke's PFA said on Twitter this week that it had agreed to an FA proposal of five-match bans for racial abuse. Growing problem? The Manchester incidents completely overshadowed Saturday's events at another EPL game hosted by Swansea, where a man was arrested and charged after Norwich defender Sebastien Bassong complained of being racially abused. Norwich revealed later that police are investigating four cases of racial attacks on the Cameroon international in the past fortnight, three of them on social networking website Twitter. Coming soon after two West Ham fans were arrested for alleged anti-Semitic abuse of Tottenham supporters last month, and several other troubling incidents this season, it doesn't paint a healthy picture of English football --- but shows the size of the challenge faced by the authorities. Clarke said the question of suitable punishments requires an all-inclusive approach. ""It's easy for me to say a fan should get 'X' punishment, just as it's easy for a fan to say a player should get 'Y,' "" he said. ""If we have some kind of consultation across the board to establish acceptable parameters or unacceptable behavior then we will be seen to be putting something into place that everyone has had an input in."" Guidelines needed . The FA is working with the British government to work out ways of dealing with football's problems, and Clarke says this will only be effective if there is a clear set of guidelines laid down for all areas of the game. ""The biggest change we need in football is some kind of protocol for issues that have come to pass over the past year,"" he said, when asked about club managers such as Kenny Dalglish and Andre Villas-Boas publicly defending their players Luis Suarez and John Terry while racism investigations were ongoing. ""We haven't got any definitive outlines on what should happen when there are incidents of discrimination, especially racial abuse. It's very much a gray area. The defenses go up at the club, they have their own brand and their own assets to protect. ""This is all before official investigation and procedure is taking place to ascertain whether that is valid support of the player or club. I think the first thing we need to do is to have a protocol where everyone knows exactly what should happen in these incidents, exactly what behaviors are expected of the people involved, of the club employees and of the press, as well."" He said the incident involving referee Mark Clattenburg, who was accused of racially abusing a Chelsea player before being cleared, showed both the improvements football has made and yet how far it still has to go. ""Procedurally it was a real step forward: something was claimed, it was reported, it was investigated and conclusion was drawn. I think that was outstanding, it was done promptly as well,"" he said. ""But because the whole issue went into the press and speculative domain instantly, there were questions that were being proffered and answered that people didn't really have the grounds to answer. ""A lot of speculation was drawn and it's possible and plausible that Mark Clattenburg's character had been tainted on the back of that. I believe we need a definitive outline on the protocol in such incidents."" Cultural differences . It has emerged that the FA is considering cultural lessons for foreign players in order to prevent a repeat of the Suarez-Patrice Evra case last season, where the Liverpool striker was banned eight matches for constantly taunting the Manchester United defender with the term ""negrito"" during a match. Liverpool's lawyers argued that it was an acceptable, and often affectionate, term in Suarez's native Uruguay -- but the FA ruled that it had much more negative connotations in Britain. ""There is very much a line of thought that we expect people to know what the levels of acceptability and tolerance are over here when it comes to abuse, discrimination etc. I don't think we should do that,"" Clarke said. ""There shouldn't be any gray areas. If we're expecting people to adhere to certain values and a disciplinary schedule then it's our duty to ensure they know what those values are. It's an excellent idea to get rid of any ambiguities for players coming from overseas who may not be familiar with our values."" A new era? Ouseley, the first black person to lead Britain's Commission for Racial Equality, is planning to stand down from his role on the FA Council, according to the Guardian. The 67-year-old has been frustrated by an apparent lack of progress by the ruling body. He would be ""a big loss"" to football's anti-racism cause, Clarke said. ""But that opens the door for somebody else to fill that space. His experience will definitely be a loss, but it doesn't have to be a loss to the initiative -- the ideals and the ethos can still be carried forward. It's an opportunity for the FA to carry on their diversity principles.""","English football's ruling bodies face criticism after increase in bad behavior by fans .

"(CNN) -- A Boeing 787 Dreamliner -- the model grounded last month amid concerns over fire risk -- is being allowed a one-time, special flight Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration says. The 787 took off around 10:25 a.m. (9:25 a.m. CT) from Fort Worth, Texas, bound for Everett, Washington. The plane was in Texas for a paint job, Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said. A federal probe into electrical fires led to the grounding of all 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliners around the world last month. Dreamliner battery type requires safeguards, safety advocate says . Two recent incidents -- a fire aboard a Japan Airlines aircraft at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7 and a smoke alarm aboard a plane flying over Japan on January 16 -- prompted the FAA to ground all Dreamliners in the United States, and other nations quickly followed suit. Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said federal investigators had not been able to determine the causes of fires in two plane batteries or the electrical shorts that occurred. The NTSB said it was trying to determine which problem happened first and caused the other. With the exception of Thursday's ""ferry flight,"" the $200 million planes remain grounded until the manufacturer can demonstrate that the problem is fixed and the plane safe to fly. Japan's ANA replaced faulty batteries on Dreamliner last year . FAA spokeswoman Brie Sachse said the special flight Thursday must adhere to certain conditions: . -- Before flight, the crew must perform inspections to verify that the batteries and cables show no signs of damage . -- The pre-flight checklist must include a mandatory check for specific status messages that could indicate possible battery problems . -- The plane must fly directly from Fort Worth to Everett . -- While airborne, the crew must continuously monitor the flight computer for battery related messages and land immediately if one occurs . Only the people needed to operate the flight will be on board, Sachse said. What's wrong with the Dreamliner? CNN's Charles Riley, Yoko Wakatsuki and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","A 787 that was in Texas for a paint job will return to Washington Thursday .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four suspected militants were killed and seven arrested in Pakistan in a security forces operation targeting those responsible for a devastating weekend bombing on the outskirts of the city of Quetta that left scores dead, authorities said Tuesday. Police said a suicide bomber rammed a water tanker laden with explosives into a crowded marketplace Saturday, setting off a huge blast that killed at least 89 people and wounded at least 180 others. Shiite Muslims in Quetta had refused to bury those killed in the devastating bombing until authorities responded to their demands to take military action against Sunni extremists thought to be responsible. Following Tuesday's operation, they announced that the burial will begin at 9 a.m. Wednesday. The macabre protest, now in its third day, is an expression of the anger and frustration among Shiites in the southwestern province of Balochistan, whose capital is Quetta, over the government's failure to shield them from bloody sectarian attacks in recent months. ""We want the military to protect Shiites and want it to take control of law and order in the province,"" Syed Dawood Agha, president of the Balochistan Shiite Conference and the organizer of the protest, said Monday. ""Civilian government has failed to maintain law and order in the province."" The outlawed Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has said it carried out the Saturday attack. The bodies of about 80 of the victims -- some in coffins, others wrapped in sheets -- have been laid out on the street in Hazara Town, the Shiite suburb of Quetta where the attack took place, said Naseebullah Bazai, the health secretary in Balochistan. Authorities are still trying to identify the other bodies, he said. Hundreds of demonstrators in Hazara Town have braved the winter cold to stay out day and night with the victims' bodies. ""What is our sin? Why are our people being killed?"" said Hina Ali Hazara, a teenager at the protest who said her brother was among the dead. ""Why are we being killed for our faith?"" she continued, breaking into tears. The bombing, which has prompted demonstrations in cities across Sunni-majority Pakistan, follows a day of bomb attacks targeting Shiites in Quetta last month that killed at least 85 people. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi also claimed responsibility for those attacks. Desperate protest . The Shiite community's decision to delay the burial of the bodies this week, a form of protest they also adopted after the January bombings, is a sign of its desperation after repeated requests to authorities for better protection. Not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in Islam; a person's soul is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground. The Pakistani government in Islamabad said Tuesday that it would carry out ""a targeted operation aimed at eliminating those responsible for playing with lives of innocent civilians and restoring peace and security in Quetta."" And a senior Quetta police official, Wazir Khan Nasir, said security forces carried out a raid in the city Monday night in which four militants were killed and seven were arrested. It was not immediately clear if any of these announcements were enough to satisfy the Shiite community's demands. Balochistan security officials were negotiating with the protesters to try to persuade them to end their demonstration and bury the dead. The government had vowed Monday to catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice. But human rights groups say authorities have a bad track record of prosecuting those who carry out and incite attacks on Shiites. Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf has sent a delegation of lawmakers to Quetta to assess the situation and make recommendations. He has also requested that intelligence agencies explain how the suicide bomber managed to breach security measures. Ashraf's announcements Monday came as protests over the attack spread beyond Balochistan to other parts of Pakistan, including major cities such as Karachi and Islamabad, local media reported. A persecuted minority . The Shiite community primarily targeted by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in Balochistan are Hazaras, an ethnic minority from neighboring Afghanistan. Amnesty International said Monday it had documented 91 separate attacks on Shiites across Pakistan since January 2012 that had resulted in the deaths of about 500 people. At least half of those killed were Hazaras, Amnesty said, even though they are one of the smallest ethnic groups in Pakistan. ""The last two months have been the worst on record for Quetta's beleaguered Hazara community,"" said Isabelle Arradon, deputy Asia-Pacific director at Amnesty. ""In fact, the attacks in January and February constitute some of the worst killings in Pakistan's recent history."" Amnesty urged Pakistani authorities to ""immediately carry out an impartial and independent investigation into the persistent failure of civil and military authorities to end such attacks."" A lack of prosecutions . The rights group said that to its knowledge, ""no one has been prosecuted for the January 2013 attacks or other targeted killings of Hazaras in recent years."" The bombing Saturday also drew condemnation from the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The commission said it was ""at a loss for words at this latest catastrophe to befall the long-suffering Hazaras of Balochistan."" Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has tried to justify its attacks by arguing that according to its interpretation of Islam, Shiites are not Muslims. It claims Shiites insult close companions of the Islamic prophet, Mohammed. But human rights groups are scathing in their criticism of the group. ""These attacks demonstrate Lashkar-e-Jhangvi's utter disregard for human rights and basic principles of humanity,"" Arradon said. Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong. Nasir Habib in Islamabad contributed to this report.","NEW: Shiite Muslims in Quetta say the burial of victims will begin at 9 a.m. Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- France has too many foreigners and is not integrating them properly, President Nicolas Sarkozy said in an interview on French television. ""Today we have a problem,"" Sarkozy said Tuesday night on France 2 TV. ""Our system of integration is working worse and worse because we have too many foreigners on our territory, and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school,"" he said. France places a premium on national identity, pressing the population to put ""Frenchness"" before religion or national background. Sarkozy is running for a second term in office, with voting set for April 22. He faces a strong challenge from Francois Hollande of the Socialist party and a range of candidates from smaller parties, including the far-right Marine Le Pen. Sarkozy, a conservative, offered cautious praise for Hollande, but said he could not imagine his rival as president. ""Francois Hollande is an intelligent man,"" Sarkozy said. ""I do not have a problem with him. The only thing is, he has never held office at the state level. Honestly, can you imagine Francois Hollande as president of France? Imagine it!"" He said peace in the Middle East would be a top priority for him if he were re-elected. ""I hope that France -- and all of Europe -- we would take an initiative for the year 2012 to be the year of peace between Israel and the Palestinians,"" he said. And he said if he won a second term he would ""celebrate with those I love -- my wife and daughter."" Issues surrounding immigration and integration have troubled French politicians for years. Last year, a controversial French law went into effect banning Islamic face coverings in public places. In 2010, hundreds of Muslim youths rioted after a man died in a shootout with police. France has had an influx of about 130,000 people from other countries each year for the past several years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The country also had about 48,000 asylum seekers in 2010. The French population is about 66 million, according to the CIA World Factbook.","NEW: France has an influx of about 130,000 people a year .

"(CNN) -- The case of a 12-year-old girl who reportedly received a transfusion of HIV-positive blood has sparked outrage across Saudi Arabian society, with angry calls for the health minister to resign. In this ultraconservative Islamic kingdom, where HIV and AIDS remain taboo subjects and open criticism of government officials is relatively rare, the case of Reham al-Hakami has prompted unprecedented widespread discussion of both issues. Mohammed Almadi, of the government-backed Human Rights Commission that is investigating the case, said Reham, who has sickle cell anemia, received a blood transfusion on February 12 at the main hospital in Jazan, her village. A few hours later, a team from the hospital came to her house to tell the family that the blood was HIV-positive. She was then airlifted to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. It remains unclear whether Reham has tested positive for HIV. ""This was a case of negligence,"" Almadi said. Widespread online chatter and subsequent discussions in the Saudi media prompted the Health Ministry to issue a statement Monday calling the incident a ""critical error"" and apologizing to the girl, her family and Saudi society. The ministry says it is investigating the matter. On Twitter, it said it was ""acting on behalf of the family as the legal guardian in seeking compensation and to ensure that the legal procedures and the decisions made by the legal health councils will be carried out in her case."" In a widely circulated six-second online video, Reham, wearing a bright pink T-shirt, says, ""I need you to stand by me and pray for me."" Seven ministry officials were sacked and some were fined, including the coordinator of the region's AIDS program, said the statement, which does not mention HIV. It is an unusual move in the heavily bureaucratic kingdom where government institutions usually remain silent in the face of criticism. Daoud al-Sharian, a well-known television presenter on the Saudi-owned MBC channel, called on Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah to resign. ""I wish, just once, that a minister would resign over (his ministry's) mistakes"" al-Sharian said Sunday on his talk show, which hosted the girl's father and uncle as well as a Health Ministry official. ""If a case like this happened in other countries, not just one minister but several ministers would resign."" A local Saudi paper reported that the minister visited the girl in a hospital Saturday and gave her an iPad, a gesture that sparked mocking comments on social media. The line ""hey sorry about what happened so take this ipad and download some apps while you're waiting to die"" was posted multiple times by various Twitter users. An Arabic tweet by Saudi preacher Adel Al-Kalabani said, ""this should go into the Guinness Book (of world records) as the cheapest compensation ever."" It has been retweeted almost 4,000 times. Al-Rabiah defended himself on a television program Tuesday, saying the gift was not compensation. ""I couldn't go empty-handed to the hospital to visit her for the first time,"" he told Saudi news channel Al-Ekhbariya. He said he asked ministry officials who visited Reham every day at the hospital what she wanted, and they told him she wanted an iPad so she could listen to the Quran, Islam's holy book. ""So I asked my colleagues to prepare an iPad and put some games on it as well as the Quran. As a father, if I visited her without bringing anything with me, I would have blamed myself,"" al-Rabiah continued. Ibrahim al-Hakimi, the family's lawyer, said the family plans to sue the Health Ministry ""starting from the most senior official and including all employees involved in this medical mistake."" He said the family was still in shock over what happened.","Family was told that 12-year-old girl received HIV-positive blood, Human Rights Commission says .

"New York (CNN) -- Criminal charges will not be filed against the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year, according to Connecticut State's Attorney David Cohen. At a news conference Monday, Cohen explained that criminal prosecution against Sandra Herold, 77, was not warranted because she was not aware of the risk her pet posed. On February 16, Herold had called her friend Charla Nash, 55, for help in getting her pet chimpanzee Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford home of her friend, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. Cohen explained that the dangers of keeping a pet chimpanzee were never fully explained to Herold by the Connecticut State Department of Environmental Protection. While the agency was aware that the chimpanzee was living with Herold, there is no evidence that they ever reached out to her to detail why the primate posed a threat to her and others in the community. Furthermore, Herold had never had any problems with Travis in the past. Although Travis had escaped once before in 2003 and ""wreaked havoc"" on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, the chimp had never exhibited any violent behavior, especially towards Nash, with whom he had interacted with regularly. Nash, Cohen stated, had specifically been called that day because Herold thought she could help in controlling the escaped chimpanzee. In the state of Connecticut, criminal prosecution would have to determine that Herold acted recklessly, disregarding the risk that Travis would attack and cause serious injuries to another person. Because of the chimp's familiarity with Nash, his previously placid behavior and the lack of contact by the Department of Environmental Protection, Cohen determined that Herold would not be held criminally responsible for the attack. ""This does not in any way minimize the horror that we all feel with what occurred and with the horrendous injuries suffered,"" he said. ""Our prayers go out to the family and to the victim."" In March, shortly after the attack, the family of Charla Nash filed a lawsuit seeking $50 million in damages from the owner of the primate. The court papers, filed in Stamford Superior Court in Connecticut, alleged that the owner was liable for the attack, negligent and reckless in her ownership of a wild animal. Following the attack, Nash was transported to the famed Cleveland Clinic, where the nation's first face transplant was performed. In a written statement the Cleveland Clinic said that Nash had lost her nose, upper and lower lips, eyelids and both her hands in the attack, as well as the ""bony structures in her mid-face."" The attack has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has stated that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals citizens are not allowed to own. When asked if there was anything to be learned from the attack, Cohen said, ""I think the public will have to draw their own lessons from what was a very tragic incident.""","Chimpanzee mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford took command Sunday of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, where he will oversee the final two years of the war and the withdrawal of nearly all troops. ""Today is not about change, it's about continuity,"" Dunford said at a change-of-command ceremony in Kabul attended by his predecessor Marine Gen. John Allen and other senior NATO and Afghan officials. ""I'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of Afghanistan as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future."" Dunford replaces Allen, whose final days as ISAF commander were marred by an investigation linked to the scandal that led to the resignation of his predecessor David Petreaus as the director of the CIA. Allen, who has been nominated as NATO's supreme allied commander, was cleared in January of allegations he wrote potentially inappropriate emails to a Florida woman who claimed she was being threatened by Petreaus' mistress Paula Broadwell. Allen oversaw perhaps one of the toughest periods for U.S.-led NATO troops as they battled an ever-evolving insurgency while balancing combat with diplomacy. Reports routinely emerged of prickly relations between Allen and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who did not attend the ceremony. It not uncommon for a head of state to skip a military handover ceremony. Meanwhile, Afghan Defense Minister Bismillah Mohammadi credited Allen for a drop in civilian casualties in Afghanistan, saying it helped to restore public confidence in the government. Until Dunford's name emerged in August as the nominee for the top job in Afghanistan, few people outside of the military community, had heard of him. Dunford has a reputation among Marines as a thoughtful, calm leader with more than 22 months under his belt of commanding troops in Iraq. The general has no real Afghanistan-ground experience. But his is not the first ISAF commander to be in that position. Before then-Army Gen. David Petreaus took over ISAF command, he had overseen the war in Afghanistan from his perch as chief of Central Command in the United States. Chief among the issues Dunford faces is an Afghan government that has, at times, been critical of NATO forces and their actions in Afghanistan. Afghan security forces, considered the key to the country's success when troops withdraw by the end of 2014, still have a long way to go before they are able to handle some operations without the help of the international forces. He also faces the issue of Afghanistan's ongoing insurgency, including the attacks that continue to be carried out by Taliban militants and the Haqqani Network. But officials close to Dunford have told CNN that the general is not going into the job blind. Since August, he has been studying the history of Afghanistan as well as the military operations since the war began in 2001, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. CNN's Mike Mount and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford replaces Gen John Allen as ISAF commander .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The United States and Afghanistan signed a landmark deal Sunday that affords Afghan authorities an effective veto over controversial special operations raids. A bid to end visceral Afghan anger over raids on private residences, the deal prevents NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of Afghan officials, said a senior NATO official. It was not clear, however, whether the deal ceded 100% of U.S. capabilities over special forces operations, ISAF's key tactic against the insurgency. From now on, an Afghan review group will have to authorize an operation before it goes ahead, the official said. And special operations forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from the presidential palace. Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and ISAF commander Gen. John Allen signed the agreement at the Afghan foreign ministry Sunday afternoon. ""The Afghan special operations unit has developed at extraordinary speed"" and is ""manned by courageous and capable operators,"" Allen said at the ceremony. ""Today we are on an important step closer to our shared goal of a secure and sovereign Afghanistan. Together we will realize this vision."" U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said the agreement was an ""important illustration"" of partnership. ""We are making sure this transition is not abrupt, but a path marked by benchmarks and steps that build Afghan capacity,"" Crocker said in a statement. ""This (agreement) marks another major step towards our goal of ensuring a stable, secure and sovereign Afghanistan and of forging an enduring partnership with the government and people of Afghanistan."" The key deal comes after months of recriminations against special operations raids, particularly at night, that deeply offend Afghans, as they involve foreigners entering their homes. U.S. officials say the raids are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents. The complex system will fully ""Afghanize"" the operations, putting Afghan commandos in the lead and giving American special forces a ""training and support role,"" a senior Afghan official said. The official said the deal mandates a committee of Afghan officials with U.S. input, known as the Operational Coordination Group, to review U.S. intelligence on a target before a raid. If that target is approved, that will constitute authority for the operation under Afghan law, the official said. Afghan officials have insisted the raids be conducted in compliance with Afghan law. A senior Afghan official with sight of the agreement said the search of ""residential houses or private compounds"" can now only be conducted by Afghan special forces. U.S. special forces will be on the ground in all special operations, but they will not enter the home of an Afghan unless specifically asked to do so by the Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, the senior NATO official added. In the year since February 2011, 22% of special operations had occurred at night, the NATO official said. The Afghan official said a new bilateral group will also be established, led by Wardak, the defense minister, and NATO's Allen. It will have oversight over the ""Afghanization of special operations"" and resolve any disputes. A U.S. military officer involved in the negotiations declined to discuss whether Americans would still carry out any special operations unilaterally, without Afghan approval. Last week, the Pentagon said 97% of night raids were joint between Afghan and U.S, special forces, leaving open the possibility that some were just performed by U.S. commandos. Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi told CNN Sunday that the 97% figure was accurate. He said the remaining 3% referred to cases when U.S. forces acquire intelligence on foreigners like al Qaeda members or other senior foreign militants that ""need special and quick reaction."" The Obama administration has previously stated that the United States will go after key al Qaeda targets and militants, regardless of where they are. Talks have been going on for weeks on this key memorandum of understanding to address what is perhaps the most difficult issue in the partnership between Kabul and Washington. The agreement removes one of the obstacles in the way of a highly symbolic Strategic Partnership Document, outlining the basis for U.S.-Afghan cooperation for the years after NATO's 2014 drawdown. Night raids also present a particular challenge to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Their strong unpopularity has forced the president to demand they stop, or at least no longer involve foreign troops, despite their operational significance to NATO. Allen told Congress last month how vital and frequent those raids are. In 2011, 83% of the raids succeeded in detaining or striking either their primary target or an associated insurgent, he said. ""This last year, we had about 2,200 night operations,"" Allen told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""Of those 2,200 or so night operations, on 90% of them we didn't fire a shot. On more than 50% of them we got the targeted individual, and (in) 30% more we got the next associate of that individual as well."" As for civilian casualties, in the 10% of the night raids where shots were fired, ""less than 1.5 % civilian casualties"" resulted, Allen said. Karzai has said Afghanistan's homes and villages need to be safe and protected. ""What we are asking for, in very specific and clear terms, (is that) no foreign forces should enter Afghan homes,"" he said last year.","NEW: A U.S. officer declined to say whether Americans would still carry out any special operations unilaterally .

"(CNN) -- Mechanical problems aboard Boeing's new Dreamliner 787 airliner seem to be happening far too often for some. Fliers are concerned. ""They transport people, you, me, our loved ones... I think some of the strategies (how fast they are built and how thoroughly they are tested) should be more carefully examined,"" wrote CNN.com commenter disqus_L4S9enTRgr. The Federal Aviation Administration is worried, too. On Wednesday, the FAA announced plans to ground U.S.-registered Dreamliners until they pass an emergency airworthiness inspection addressing the potential risk of battery fire. The Japanese government also ordered them out of service, and other nations where 787s were in service have followed suit. United Airlines is the only U.S. carrier operating the 787, with six Dreamliners . Since September, the growing list of reported troubles aboard the Dreamliner include a fuel leak, an oil leak, two cracked engines, a damaged cockpit window and a battery problem. FAA grounds Dreamliners . In the most serious incident so far, a battery alarm prompted an emergency landing in Japan on Wednesday of an ANA 787 carrying 129 passengers. Those on board reported a burning smell in the cabin, officials said, and the alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment. A few hours later, ANA and JAL airlines announced they were grounding their Dreamliners pending an investigation. The incident comes about a week after the FAA announced a broad safety review of the aircraft. Related: Japan carriers ground 787s . Consumer concerns are legitimate and understandable, say airline safety and engineering experts, but most of the troubles are relatively minor. However, they say, if the Dreamliner has a battery system design problem, that would raise larger concerns. Lithium ion batteries . ""Any time you've got smoke or fire or odor of smoke and fire on an aircraft, that's a very serious situation,"" said Kevin Hiatt, a veteran airline pilot and head of the Flight Safety Foundation. ""You've got very little time to get an aircraft on the ground safely if something like that occurs in flight."" The batteries are critical to the plane because the 787 is thirsty for electrical power. The Dreamliner uses electricity to run more systems than any other Boeing airliner, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. It takes lots of battery power to run electricity through those systems. The 787 is unique because its batteries are lithium ion batteries. The batteries hold more energy for longer periods than the standard nickel cadmium airliner batteries. ""These kinds of batteries,"" Ordonez says, ""are slightly more likely to cause problems."" It's unclear whether the Dreamliner battery trouble in Japan was a charging problem or a battery overheating problem, says John Goglia, a former airline mechanic and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. A charging problem wouldn't require an immediate landing, ""but if I had a battery overheating -- given the history -- I'd be looking for the nearest place to put my butt on the ground."" Cracked engines and windshields, oil and fuel leaks . Other problems linked to the Dreamliner -- such as oil and fuel leaks or damaged cockpit windows -- are operational issues that occur aboard ""every airliner out there flying today,"" says Hiatt. ""It just so happens that this aircraft is under such intense scrutiny."" For an oil leak in flight, a pilot responds depending on how much oil is leaking. ""If it's a problem, you've got procedures to either put the engine in idle and land the aircraft or continue and monitor the amount of oil on board until you reach your destination."" ""Fuel leaks -- whether they happen in the wing or near the engine or near the fuel tank area, those happen every day."" When mechanical problems occur, pilots rely on what's known as the Quick Reference Handbook -- an electronic checklist for troubleshooting. ""One guy flies while the other guy fixes, and then you make a decision,"" says Justin Schlechter, a 13-year airline pilot. Schlechter remembers a problem aboard his aircraft in 2004 when a passenger looking out a window spotted a minor fuel leak near the wing. After referring to the checklist, Schlechter diverted the airliner and landed in nearby Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution. Another time, a crack appeared in Schlechter's cockpit windshield. ""It was a complete nonevent,"" he says. The flight continued to its scheduled destination. ""Windshields crack all the time,"" says Goglia. Measuring inches thick and multilayered, airliner windshields are designed to take a beating from weather and the occasional bird. The cracked engines reported on Dreamliners in 2012 were likely isolated incidents, Ordonez says. As for random window cracks and fuel and oil leaks, Boeing can solve these kinds of problems without much difficulty, he says. Worldwide, Dreamliners fly 150 flights daily, Boeing said last week. In a statement released Wednesday, Boeing reacted to the FAA grounding. ""We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity. We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service,"" said Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Jim McNerney. ""I still would get on the airplane,"" Hiatt says. It may be the most watched airliner in the world now. ""That airplane is being looked at so closely both before and after every flight that it borders on the ridiculous."" ""Now, I guess people should be a little concerned,"" says Ordonez. But bottom line, he says, ""I'd fly it.""","NEW: FAA grounds all U.S. Dreamliners over battery fire concern .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Public toilets in China's capital are coming under new rules, including ""no more than two flies allowed."" Other rules for Beijing's public toilet sanitation and staff include waste collection every half hour and bilingual instructions in English and Chinese, according to state-run China Daily. The new standards, announced Monday by the Beijing Municipal Commission of City Administration and Environment, cover public toilets in parks, tourist areas and hotels, bus stops, train stations, airports, hospitals, shopping malls and supermarkets. Jack Sim, founder of the World Toilet Organization (WTO) and whose work has earned him the nickname ""Mr. Toilet,"" suggested a ""No Fly Zone"" would be better. ""If there is one fly, it simply means there are other flies,"" said Sim, adding that the disease-carriers ""breed very fast."" His Singapore-based WTO, which aims to improve sanitation conditions and toilets around the world, held its last annual summit in November in China's Hainan province. The problem of sanitation is a worldwide one, with some 2.6 billion people -- or half the developing world's population -- without access to improved sanitation, according to the United Nations, which recognizes it as a human right. Halving that number is one of the United Nations' eight Millennium Development Goals for the world to achieve by 2015. China's toilet problem -- notorious for a pungent smell -- has hindered tourism growth, Sim said, one of the reasons the Beijing Tourism Administration hosted the World Toilet Summit in 2004 and Hainan, a popular tourist destination, was China's choice for the last gathering. ""A lot of places in China are rare, so beautiful, but tourism agents cannot get people there because there are no proper toilet facilities,"" Sim said, adding that he's met people who smoke in public toilets just to avoid the smell. The WTO worked with Beijing to set toilet standards before the 2008 Olympics, a ""coming-of-age"" event for China, Sim said, adding that China's National Tourism Administration now wants the WTO's World Toilet College involved in training professional cleaners. According to China Daily, Beijing invested 400 million yuan ($57 million) on public toilets in the four years leading up to the Olympics. ""The toilet cleaner has been treated as an unskilled person but should be treated as a tradesman, a technician,"" Sim said, pointing to the critical need for cleaning public toilets to prevent outbreaks of contagious diseases and viruses like the H1N1 strain of influenza. Proper ventilation was also key, he added. ""If we don't clean toilets, we pay a lot more,"" Sim said. Officials at the China National Tourism Administration and the Beijing Commission of City Administration and Environment could not be immediately reached.","New standards cover public toilets in areas tourists frequent .

"(CNN) -- San Francisco residents who like to relax around town naked will have to keep their pants on. The city's Board of Supervisors approved a public nudity ban Tuesday in a 6-5 vote. As soon as the measure passed, some protesters inside City Hall tore off their clothes. Authorities draped them in blue blankets and led them away. Supervisor Scott Wiener, who introduced the ordinance, disputed claims that the measure violates freedom of expression. ""We're a city that believes in freedom, and we've always believed in freedom and free expression,"" Wiener told CNN affilite KGO. ""But taking your pants off at Castro and Market and displaying your genitals to everyone, that's not free expression."" But some nudists have filed a lawsuit claiming the ban violates their First Amendment rights. ""Is the First Amendment more powerful and more important than the passions of an intolerant mob and the ambitions of one or more city supervisors? We would contend that it is, and that's what our case is based upon,"" the nudists' attorney, Christina DiEdoardo, told KGO. The ban does not apply at ""permitted parades, fairs and festivals."" Otherwise, those caught naked in public could face fines of $100 to $500, depending on the number of prior offenses. A person who violates the ordinance three times in a year could also face one year in jail.

"(CNN) -- It was a tough job, but someone had to do it. 34-year-old Briton Ben Southall, winner of Queensland Tourist Board's ""Best Job in the World"" competition has now completed his six-month stint looking after Hamilton Island on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Having to cope with turquoise waters, miles of white sandy beaches and more sunshine than most Brits see in a decade of summers must have given him sleepless nights? Surprisingly, they didn't, but the job was more strenuous than at first it might appear. Southall points out that the competition advertised in the world's press said the winner would have to ""feed the fish, clean the pool, deliver the mail and watch the whales."" But during the interview process he says it became clear to him and other applicants that it was going to be a full-on job with lots of interviews and writing. ""Every day I've gone to a new island and explored what's on offer there. Then I've sat down in the evenings and usually worked quite late putting videos and photos together and writing blogs. That's the key part of it,"" Southall told CNN. And with 300 islands in his section of Great Barrier Reef he was clearly kept busy. But as he readily admits being paid nearly $140,000 to look after an island has been an amazing experience. ""I think I've done more in these six months than I've done in the previous 34 years of my life. To be able to do this sort of thing, in this location, and report on it can't really be classed as work,"" he said. But there was one moment of trouble in paradise shortly before Christmas. After enjoying a jet ski ride Southall joyfully leapt off the back and into the water only to be stung by a deadly Irukandji jellyfish. A fever rapidly engulfed him before doctors were able to ease his symptoms. ""For six hours I was pretty bad,"" he recalled. ""Next morning however, after I had my morphine, I came through the other side."" So now that his work is done on the island, where does he intend to go on holiday? ""It's a difficult one that,"" he says, ""but the white Christmas that the UK enjoyed almost made me a bit jealous."" Despite the allure of distant snow Southall says he will probably take a holiday in the southern hemisphere. ""I've discovered a few parts of Queensland and a few places dotted along there that I would go back and relax on."" He says the hardest part of leaving the island has been moving out of his $4 million villa. ""I lived on top of a Land Rover as I drove round Africa on a charity expedition in 2008. So I went from living in a tent to living in this amazing house. Closing the door on the Blue Pearl [the villa] was probably the toughest bit.""","Ben Southall talks to CNN about his job as caretaker of Hamilton Island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

"(Mashable.com) -- Hop into this Ego Compact Semi Submarine, and without any extensive training you can be on your way to exploring the deep blue sea in no time. Why is this called a semi-submarine? The entire boat is not submerged, but it's more like a pontoon boat with a transparent waterproof compartment hanging from its middle. That means James Cameron is not going to be using one of these subs for that deep-water shoot for his Avatar sequel, but it's still suitable for giving you an eye-popping view of the undersea world. Think of it as more akin to snorkeling than scuba diving. Photos: Raonhaje's Ego Compact Semi Submarine . The little boat cruises along at a leisurely sightseeing pace that's unspecified by its maker, which will only say that its batteries will last eight hours at cruising speed or four hours at top speed. It's built by South Korean company Raonhaje, which plans to sell fleets of these Ego Semi-Submarines to resorts, and single units to individuals and yacht owners. The company offers to build custom moorings for the craft, as well as hoists for yachts. We're thinking super-safe leisure subs like these would be a huge hit at a resort, especially seaside marinas near coral reefs, with their colorful and bustling underwater wildlife.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will travel to Myanmar, where he will meet with President Thein Sein and activist Aung San Suu Kyi, on a trip to Asia later this month, the White House said Thursday. Obama will stop in Myanmar, also known as Burma, during a November 17-20 trip to ""speak to civil society to encourage Burma's ongoing democratic transition,"" according to a news release. It will be the first time a U.S. president visits the country. Aid group warns of difficulties treating victims of Myanmar violence . The historic trip comes as Myanmar's new reformist president has created a opening for further democracy there. Under Thein Sein, the Myanmar government has released hundreds of political prisoners in the past year, part of a series of reforms that have followed decades of repressive military rule. Western governments have responded to the efforts by starting to ease sanctions put in place to pressure the military regime. Myanmar authorities have also engaged in peace talks with rebel ethnic groups and allowed Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, to successfully participate in special elections for the national parliament in April. Suu Kyi, a democratic freedom activist who spent 15 years under house arrest, traveled to Washington earlier this year to accept the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal . Myanmar fighting kills 84, displaces at least 22,500 . She was kept for the better part of two decades under house arrest for advocating for democracy in Myanmar. The country's former military rulers ordered her detention, and in recent years her case has received an international spotlight. She paid a hefty personal price for standing up for freedom in Myanmar, which suffered under 50 years of autocratic, repressive rule. Suu Kyi, who was awarded the medal in 2008, freed from house arrest two years later and elected to the Myanmar parliament this year, a historic moment in the country. More recently, Myanmar has faced unrest between majority Buddhists and the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority. The unrest began five months ago and has tested the efforts of Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance.

"(CNN) -- The 5-year-old son of country music singer Mindy McCready has been recovered and is in good health in the custody of officials in Arkansas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families told CNN Friday. ""We're working with local law enforcement and the Arkansas (Division of Children and Family Services) and we're going to bring him home to Florida to his legal guardian as soon as possible,"" Terri Durdaller said about the boy, Zander. Mindy McCready's assistant said the singer turned Zander over to the Arkansas authorities and that he would be returned to her on Monday. ""She's looking forward to having her case heard in front of an unbiased courtroom,"" the assistant said. ""She has a 99% chance of her child leaving with her on Monday morning."" She described Zander as ""very OK."" But Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, have legal custody of the boy and the singer has only visitation rights. ""We're relieved,"" they told CNN. ""We feel sorrow for Zander because he's traumatized, and for Mindy. We just hope she does the right thing from here on out and that this is a wake-up call for her."" The boy was located hours after Gayle Inge made a public plea for her daughter to obey a court order to return her son to the care of the Inges. The imbroglio started when McCready, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, took her son from her father's Florida home. This week, a Florida judge ordered McCready to return the boy to authorities. When she did not comply, another judge issued an emergency ""pickup order,"" authorizing officers to pick up the boy. The singer was ordered to produce Zander and failed to do so. Though McCready said that the boy was with her, authorities considered him to be missing. McCready's publicist issued a statement, saying McCready ""has not been charged with illegal wrongdoing."" ""Ms. McCready's No. 1 priority has always been, and continues to be, the safety of her son,"" publicist Kat Atwood said. McCready has asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety, Atwood said. McCready burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album ""10,000 Angels"" and the chart-topping country hit ""Guys Do It All the Time."" Her website biography says she's had romances with musician David Malloy and actor Dean Cain, and touches on her career stalling, as well as her having an ""explosive relationship"" with Billy McKnight, the boy's father, who is himself a country singer. McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.""

"Seoul (CNN) -- Oh Kil-nam refuses to keep a single photo of his family in his home. He says it's just too painful. For more than 25 years, Oh has lived with the guilt of knowing his wife and two daughters are being held against their will in North Korea because of a choice he made. ""I made such a foolish decision,"" Oh says, ""which has caused my family to suffer such hardship in the hands of an outrageous criminal organization. It doesn't help even if I repent, my heart is torn with sorrow."" Oh, a native of South Korea, moved his family to Pyongyang in 1985 despite his wife's reservations on the promise of a good job and free medical treatment for his wife's hepatitis, but when they arrived he realized he had been tricked. He says there was not a job nor medical help for his wife, just three months of what he calls, ""lectures from day to night on North Korea ideology, history and brainwashing."" He was then forced to work in a radio station broadcasting propaganda. Oh was sent to Denmark the following year to lure more South Koreans to the communist state. But when he arrived at customs, Oh handed them a piece of paper asking to defect. Held for two months in detention in Germany, he was questioned by different intelligence agencies, including he says the CIA. He was then freed and moved to South Korea. But his nightmare had only just begun. Oh learned his wife and daughters, only aged 6 and 9 when they first moved to North Korea, were sent to a concentration camp as punishment for his defection. In 1991, he received the first and last message from them. Three black and white photos and recorded messages from his family. Oh and the human rights workers believe they were recorded by North Korean officials as a trap to lure him back. His youngest daughter says, ""I miss you dad, I don't know you and I need to grow up fast so I can help mum and I feel regret but now I can lift water buckets and wood very well."" Studying the photos, some defectors have told Oh they believe they were taken in the notorious Yodok concentration camp. His eldest daughter tells him, ""Hi dad, it's Haewon, I dreamt the other day that I was celebrating my birthday with you. I miss you. It's been a while since I said the word father and my tears are falling."" On the tape, his wife wonders when she will see him again. Oh looks at the photos of his family. Thinking back to when he first received them he shakes his head. ""I am ... psychologically and physically, totally destroyed,"" he says. ""I have literally no feeling."" He says he feels helpless and all his hopes now rest with the United Nations and the South Korean President. The UN body on arbitrary detention has petitioned North Korea to release the family, saying their detention is ""arbitrary,"" but the response has not been positive. Pyongyang claims Oh's wife has already died from her hepatitis and his daughters want nothing to do with him as they say he deserted them. Oh refuses to believe either claim. South Korea has increased diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. President Lee Myung bak asked the Swedish King, Carl Gustav for assistance. Sweden has an embassy in Pyongyang and has, in the past, acted as a neutral broker for countries with no presence there. All Oh can do now is wait -- as he has for the past quarter of a century. And hope he will live to see his daughters freed. ""Every night I have nightmares,' he says. ""I'm more than 70 years old now and exhausted but I will stay alive until I can hold my two daughters again."" CNN'S K.J.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of dancers jammed a major London train station in a Facebook-driven ""flashmob"" mimicking an advertisement for a phone company. And the event last Friday evening was so successful that another is planned for next Friday in Trafalgar Square in central London. Plus, a group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later. Videos posted on the social-networking site showed Liverpool Street Station completely filled with people, counting down the seconds until the clock showed 7 p.m., then dancing to music on their mp3 players as the hour struck. The sheer scale of the event came as a complete surprise to the organizer, a 22-year-old Facebook user who identified himself only as Crazzy Eve. ""I was watching TV and the T-Mobile advertisement came up and I thought, hm, let's get my friends down to Liverpool Street and do a little dance,"" he told CNN by phone. He posted the event on Facebook and invited his friends, who invited their friends, he said, and so on until thousands of people had been told of the plan. ""At a quarter to seven people just flocked into the station like someone opened a plughole and the water went out,"" he said. ""They just kept coming in like sheep. As it grew and grew, I just thought, 'This is going to be huge.'"" iReport.com: Were you there? Send your photos and video . His main memory of the event is ""the volume of people -- you couldn't see the floor,"" he said. He left after 15 minutes -- the scheduled ending time -- for fear of the police, he said, adding that he had deleted his name from the event Web site and refused to identify himself to CNN for the same reason. ""The entire main concourse was packed full of people dancing, cheering and screaming,"" said CNN's Simon Hooper, who was passing through the station on his way home. ""There were camera flashes going off constantly. There were also loads of people crammed around the edge of the upper level of the station, looking down at the scene below. ""There were a lot of bemused commuters wandering around the edges, trying to get to their trains but nobody seemed to mind too much. Everyone seemed pretty good humored,"" he said. ""I think a lot of people who pass through Liverpool Street regularly are getting used to this sort of thing."" British Transport Police also described it as ""mainly a good humored event,"" adding ""No arrests were made and no crimes were reported."" Police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size, but more than 14,000 people joined the Facebook group ""Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance."" ""It was both good cause we all stuck like a group didn't stop dancing inside and outside but bad cause of the people who could get anywhere but hey I love it WE MADE HISTORY RIGHT THERE!!"" one Facebook user said on the event's Web site. ""Yeah I agree, there wasn't any bad feelings there. Everybody just had a good time, apart from my friend being groped by some guy, but you'll always get one,"" another wrote. The T-Mobile commercial which inspired the event shows several hundred people dancing in the station. The dancing in the advertisement appears to be spontaneous but was actually choreographed. It was filmed January 15 and has been widely broadcast since then. The success of the event has prompted Crazzy Eve to call for another silent dance at Trafalgar Square in central London on February 13. A group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later. The station has a large open space with a balcony surrounding it. User videos shot from the balcony and posted on Facebook showed every available inch of space filled with people, many of them cheering, though the event was billed as ""silent."" Flashmobs -- groups of people meeting and all doing the same thing together in public, from dancing to freezing in place -- have become increasingly regular events around the world. iReport.com: See an organized mass pillowfight in Taiwan .

""In the process we bring excitement to otherwise unexciting locales and give strangers a story they can tell for the rest of their lives.

"(CNN) -- As Chicago prepares to host all-out golfing war in the form of the Ryder Cup, there is more reason than you might think to remember the city's most infamous son. ""Scarface"" Al Capone was not a man to be in competition with. The murderous mob boss ruled Chicago to the rattling sound of heavy machine-gun fire in the 1920s and took out anybody -- make that pretty much everybody - who stood in his way. But it was not all bootlegging and brutality for the life of Capone. Photos: American gangsters . Away from the bloody battles of prohibition-era America, it turns out he loved nothing more than a good walk spoiled and target practice of a very different kind. As unlikely as it seems, the gangster was a golf nut. ""Al Capone was an avid golfer,"" John Binder, academic and author of The Chicago Outfit: Images of America, told CNN. ""Some of the guys around him were, too. ""The hoods loved sports. Capone and a few others managed some fighters, and they went to baseball games together a lot, too."" Capone liked golf, but that is not to say he was very good at it. ""At first, he seldom broke 60 for nine holes; he eventually elevated to 18 holes though there is no evidence he was anything but a hacker on the golf course,"" wrote Luciano Iorrizo in Al Capone: The Biography. Iorrizo continued: ""His rounds were devoted to having fun with his gangster friends who drank plenty each hole, gambled recklessly on the stroke of a ball and carried loaded weapons in their golf bags for use in emergences."" Ryder Cup revolutionaries: Seve and Ollie . During his 1920s heyday, Capone was a regular at Burnham Woods golf course - a facility 20 miles south of Chicago that is still in operation today, though Capone's memory has long since been erased. It was there he hosted regular games with his associates and acquired the services of a wide-eyed, eight-year-old caddie named Tim Sullivan. In a 1972 article for Sports Illustrated, Sullivan recalled his first round on the bag for Capone. The stakes were $500 a hole and Capone was partnered with ""Machine Gun"" Jack McGurn in a foursomes match against Fred ""The Killer"" Burke and Jake ""Greasy Thumb"" Guzik. McGurn and Burke were both implicated in the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre -- the gangland hit on his mob rivals that made Capone a household name. Neither faced charges, but McGurn -- a talented golfer -- was assassinated almost exactly seven years later in a suspected revenge attack. Burke was convicted of the murder of a policeman in 1931 and died of a heart attack in prison. Guzik was the Chicago mob's lawyer of choice. You might call them the original 'group of death'. And there were we thinking Europe's Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell were a frightening pairing to come up against. ""Capone teed off first,"" said Sullivan. ""He fetched the ball a whack that would have sent it clear down the fairway, only he hooked it and it curved way off to the left into a clump of trees. ""I scrambled around on all fours for about 10 minutes trying to find it, scared to death Al would lose his temper and hit me or maybe shoot me, but all he did was grin, pat me on the head and call me Kid. 'It's O.K., Kid, So we lose a stroke, that's all. Just gimme another ball.' And I thought: 'He can't be as mean and rough as he's cracked up to be.'"" Sullivan paints a picture of wild, booze-fuelled matches where cheats prospered and arguments frequently spilled over into violence. There was the time Capone accidentally shot himself in the foot by setting off a revolver in his golf bag as he rummaged for a club. And the time Guzik, maddened by his inability to escape a bunker, ran after Sullivan wielding his driver and ready to use it. This was golf the way gangsters play it, with etiquette very much afterthought. ""There was a crazy game called Blind Robin,"" Sullivan wrote. ""One guy would stretch out flat on his back, shut his eyes tight, and let the others tee off from his chin. They used a putter and swung slow and careful. Otherwise they would have smashed the guy's face. On the putting greens they'd throw down their pistol holders -- clunk - and hold a wrestling match."" Taking the first tee on day one of the Ryder Cup suddenly does not seem such a nerve-wracking proposition after all. Phil Mickelson won't be armed and we won't see Sergio Garcia swigging whisky and ready to beat his caddie over the head with a hybrid (at least we hope not). There will be bodyguards, though, especially surrounding Tiger Woods. McIlroy to hunt down Woods at Medinah? But to disregard Capone's golfing exploits as drunken folly is to do his infatuation with the sport a disservice. According to a new book written by the mobster's niece, Deirdre Marie Capone, her uncle was so hooked he escaped under a false name and made a golf pilgrimage to Scotland during the height of his reign -- traveling with a caddy who doubled as his bodyguard and buying a handmade set of clubs, which he had engraved with his initials. ""He was in love with the game and with Scotland,'' Mrs. Capone told the Daily Express newspaper. ''I remember seeing his bag of clubs in the house in Miami. He told me they'd been made for him in Scotland.'' Capone, with his crime syndicate bringing in an estimated $100 million a year at the peak of its operation, had no problems funding his habit . According to Billy Kay, author of The Scottish World: A Journey Into The Scottish Diaspora, Capone's Chicago outfit saw golf as yet another avenue for making money. Most people paid to play, but -- as with everything with Capone -- golf found a way of paying him. ""Every city had gangsters but the country clubs were built and financed by the social elite and gangsters were not allowed near,"" Kay told the Daily Record in 2009. ""But Chicago was a unique set-up. Al Capone and his gang ran the golf clubs in Chicago. There, mobsters like Capone, drew protection money from the country clubs and they had access to the golf courses."" Binder has yet to find evidence Capone used golf to make money. He does accept, though, that criminal activity was likely in the planning on the fairways. ""Golf was a pastime for them (the Chicago outfit),"" he told CNN. ""It wasn't until the 1950s and 60s that the mob in Chicago started controlling golf clubs. But if they're on the course and nobody's around, they're talking business. Many normal people in the business world use golf that way."" The one thing Capone could not control was his game. He died in 1947, aged 48, and having never mastered how to hit a straight drive or sink a putt. There is just not a racket to get you from tee to green, it seems, which goes to show there really are some things in life that money cannot buy. If he was still with us there is no doubt Capone would have scored VIP Ryder Cup passes for his golfing buddies. Watching on with cigars in mouth, hipflasks in hand and guns at the ready, the Chicago outfit would have been in their element at Medinah Country Club. They would, quite literally, have owned the place.","Infamous gangster Al Capone and his associates were keen golfers .

Popular downloads include ""Boulder Dash,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" and ""The Great Giana Sisters."" ""It may have not been the most sophisticated computer, but it did have a lot of personality and it was lovable and remains loveable,"" said Harry McCracken, vice president and editor in chief of PC World. Often overshadowed by the Apple II and Atari 800, the Commodore 64 rose to great heights in the 1980s. From 1982-1993, 17 million C64s were sold. The Guinness Book of World Records lists the Commodore 64 as the best-selling single computer model. The computer featured 64 kilobytes of memory (a lot for 1982), a huge index of games, a sophisticated sound chip, and a relatively parent-friendly price -- $595. On Monday, the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, will celebrate the C64's 25th anniversary. Computer pioneers will reflect on the C64's achievements and contribution to the industry. Jack Tramiel, the founder and CEO of Commodore, will attend, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and William C. Lowe, father of the IBM PC. ""It was the right machine for the time,"" said McCracken. ""The Commodore 64 did a lot to popularize computers."" Sold in shopping malls and discount stores and not just small computer stores -- the norm for the time -- the C64 became many people's gateway into the world of computers, said Brian Bagnall, author of ""On the edge: The spectacular rise and fall of Commodore."" ""It was so new,"" Bagnall said. Users could play many games and also learn the programming language of computers -- BASIC. Jim Park, 39, a software developer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, got his start on a C64 in 1984 when he was 16. Park learned to program motion-graphics synchronized to dance music and ran a BBS, an electronic bulletin board system, the precursor to the Internet. ""I really lucked out that something so obscure and nerdy has turned into the modern business and pop-culture phenomenon that it has,"" he said. Wallstrom said it was the simplicity of the C64 that made it so great. ""You switched it on and it was there, ready for input in a second. Programming on the C64 was straightforward because you got to command the processor directly. You had full control of the whole computer...that is something you don't have with any modern PC."" Still, the C64 had an uneven reputation. It was widely considered clunky, its BASIC outdated and graphics weak in comparison to the Apple II and Atari 800, according to McCracken. And then there was the quirky floppy drive. ""It was pitifully slow,"" Bagnall said. ""It was big and noisy. It sounded like a Gatling gun when it was trying to load stuff."" The floppy drive took so long to load, the music would play before the game did, recalls Rob Kramer, artistic & business director of Productiehuis ON, a production company based in the Netherlands. ""These tunes would get stuck in your head,"" he said. In 2006 Kramer came up with the idea of having an orchestra play the music from the games. ""We found this crazy orchestra that plays on the street. It's full of young people in music school. They are in their 20s and they'd never played a Commodore 64. For them it was like 'Wow, this is great stuff.' "" The 12-piece C64 Orchestra has played at churches, musical venues and festivals. The compositions run 4-6 minutes. The crowds are mostly fans of the C64. ""They really dig it,"" Kramer said.  Watch how I-Reporters are using the C64 today » . Kramer described the music as haunted. ""There's a lot of tension, and it repeats itself. It takes you places where normal classical music doesn't.""  Watch as the orchestra plays » . The classical ensemble released a CD in Europe featuring the original computer and orchestral versions of ""Delta,"" ""Commando,"" Monty on the Run,"" ""International Karate"" and more. The CD will be available in the United States on January 15. By 2007 computing standards, the Commodore 64 is a dinosaur. A relic of the past, long made obsolete by the march of time. But the C64 isn't dead. It's very much alive -- on gaming Web sites, through music and in the memories of millions who owned and loved them. ""Computer nostalgia is something that runs pretty deep these days. The memories that people have of this machine are incredible,"" McCracken said. Twenty-five years ago computers were an individual experience; today they are just a commodity, he said. ""I don't think there are many computers today that we use that people will be talking about fondly 25 years from now.""

"(CNN) -- They are widely considered among the top in the U.S. military. But for three Army Rangers who got stuck in trees while parachuting Thursday afternoon in Washington state, their only aim was to get down. The members of the 75th Ranger Regiment -- a U.S. special operations force -- were training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord when they jumped from a plane and got entangled in towering evergreen trees that canvass the sprawling military installation between Tacoma and Olympia. Video from CNN affiliate KOMO showed rescue workers climbing the trees to reach the stranded soldiers. They were ultimately brought down safely and with only minor injuries, said base spokesman Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield. ""(The soldiers had) a couple of bumps and bruises,"" Dangerfield said. Dangerfield noted that this was the second time in the past year alone that parachutists have gotten hung up in tall trees around the base. The Rangers were training on the West Coast facility, nearly 3,000 miles from the regiment's home base in Fort Benning, Georgia. According to the regiment's website, its members make up ""the Army's premier raid force"" and they are ""always combat ready.""","3 Army Rangers get stuck in tall evergreens while parachuting at Joint Base Lewis-McChord .

"(CNN) -- Now that President Obama has taken a public stand on the warlords and militia gangs tyrannizing DR Congo, there is a sense that the next chapter in the human tragedy that has been raging there over the past decade and half is about to be written -- or so we can hope. In the DRC -- Africa's largest sub-Saharan country -- invasions, proxy wars and humanitarian crises have senselessly shut down millions of lives, displaced millions more from their homes and left countless women and young girls brutally raped with the world barely raising an eyebrow. The latest murderous attempt by the M23 militia gang to besiege Goma, the strategic regional capital of Congo's eastern province of North Kivu, seems to have backfired. The United Nations says Rwanda has helped to create and militarily supported M23. Although Rwandan President Paul Kagame denies backing M23, the accusation has taken off some of the international gloss he had long enjoyed in the West, and precipitated cuts and suspension of aid money that goes directly to the Kagame regime by the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Britain and the European Union. The United States, which gives no money directly to the Rwandan government, suspended its military aid. In a baffling expression of a refinement of the U.S. position, President Obama made a rare telephone call to Kagame to emphasize ""the importance of permanently ending all support to armed groups in the DRC."" That set a firm red line on the situation in that region, the first one by President Obama since becoming president in 2008. Watch video: Kagame on Congo . This was certainly right and good. Kagame is no fool; the diplomatic but emphatic content of that telephone call, monitored by White House's National Security staff and published thereafter for public consumption, speaks volumes. He clearly understood the implicit threat. But it was not good enough. Left unsaid is that withholding aid money that goes directly to the Kagame regime has not changed many realities on the ground -- a painful reminder of the limits of what previous half-hearted, ambivalent international attempts to halt the crisis in that country had achieved. However, the situation is not hopeless. President Obama can help to halt the wars engulfing the Congo. It is both economically and politically affordable. Here is my suggestion -- a three-point road map, if you like, for President Obama, should he choose to put the weight of the United States squarely on the side of the Congolese and engage much more robustly to help end the world's bloodiest war and human tragedy. Read more: Why the world is ignoring Congo war . 1. Changes in Kinshasa . If we are to be blunt with ourselves, Congo's major problem today -- the chief reason that country remains on its knees -- is its president Joseph Kabila. Paul Kagame is just a symptom, at least in theory. The crisis of leadership in the capital Kinshasa, the disastrous blend of lack of political legitimacy and moral authority, mixed with poor governance and vision deficiency, then compounded with dilapidated state institutions, has become the common denominator to the ills and wrongs that continues to overwhelm the Congo. In other words, peace will never be secured in Congo, if the moribund status quo is still strutting around Kinshasa. Obama's minimum objective in regard to ending the wars and human tragedy engulfing the Congo should be to push for changes in Kinshasa. He must make this one of the ""10 Commandments"" of the Obama Doctrine. Circumstances demand it to re-energize Congo's chance of success and to enable the renaissance of a ""New Africa."" And given the effects of Congo's mounting death toll and the speed at which HIV/AIDS is spreading because of the use of rape as a weapon of war, the sooner the better. 2. Keep Kagame in the naughty corner . The wars and human tragedy engulfing the Congo have many fathers and many layers. Rwanda, and to some extent Uganda -- run by Africa's two dearest autocratic but staunchly pro-American regimes -- are, as they have been many times in the past, despite their denials, continuing to provide support to warlords and militia gangs terrorizing the Congolese people. This is not an apocryphal claim, it's an open secret in Kinshasa, Kampala and Kigali as much as it is in Washington or White Hall, and as real as Charles Taylor's role in Sierra Leone or Iran's support to Hezbollah. Indeed, reporters across Congo and across the region would testify to this. Kigali has been, one can safely argue, the sole shareholder in the M23 militia gang -- and its elder sisters CNDP and RCD-Goma. It cannot wash its hands in Pontius Pilate fashion of either the ICC-wanted M23 warlord Bosco Ntaganda, also known as The Terminator, or Laurent Nkunda, who is wanted by the Congolese government for war crimes and is under house arrest in Kigali. Read more: Prosecutor seeks new Congo war crimes warrants . If President Obama is remotely serious about saving lives in Congo, then fracturing Rwanda's ability to directly or indirectly harbor warlords, support militia gangs, militarize or ethnicize the wars in Congo for control of Congo's easily appropriable but highly valuable natural resources is critical, however politically disgruntling it may be to some in the State Department. It would reduce the scale, scope and intensity of the killing, raping and uprooting of the Congolese, it would crush Kinshasa's ability to use external support to warlords and militia gangs as an alibi for a lack of progress and, above all, decrease the growing unease of the Congolese towards Rwanda over the crimes of FDLR and the role played by their government in Congo. 3. FDLR . The continued existence in Congo of FDLR, a Rwandan militia gang made up largely of Hutus -- whose leadership took part in the 1994 genocide of Tutsi -- remains one of the most persistent and serious threats to stability in Congo and the region. Addressing this crisis is of significant importance from both a political and humanitarian viewpoint. Though there are no definitive statistics on the exact numbers of FDLR fighters, the good news is that experts tell us that the vast majority of its rank and file are in their 20s and early 30s, which means they were too young to have taken part in the genocide in 1994. The United States, together with the U.N., the EU and African Union, should appoint a special envoy for the African Great Lakes region to midwife a conducive political arrangement in Kigali that could see them returning home -- and see their leaders and fundraisers in Europe arrested. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vava Tampa.","President Obama can help end the Congo conflict for good, says Vava Tampa .
Obama has asked Rwanda to end all support to armed groups in the Congo .
FDLR militia gang is a threat to stability and must leave Congo .

"(CNN) -- Vampires that sparkle, a human/vampire hybrid baby and something called a Volturi -- even a fan would admit that ""The Twilight Saga"" gets complicated toward the end. What begins as a pretty standard girl-meets-vampire love story quickly evolves into a girl/vampire/shape-shifter love triangle, one that eventually includes a memorable (as in, we're still trying to forget) at-home birth scene. All of that leads up to the final ""Twilight Saga"" installment, ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2."" With the final chapter now in theaters, some of you might be in need of a brief refresher. You can always speed-read Stephenie Meyer's four novels or spend at least eight hours watching the first four films, but why do that when we've broken it all down for you here? Let's start with basics -- what's a Bella Swan? First, you're forgiven if you have absolutely zero firsthand knowledge about this character. Honestly, it's admirable you've been able to avoid ""Twilight"" for this long. Slow clap for that. Isabella ""Bella"" Swan (Kristen Stewart) is the heart, eyes and voice of ""Twilight."" At the start of the series she's a 17-year-old girl who relocates from Arizona to Forks, Washington, to live with her dad when her mom remarries. Bella is awkward and accident-prone and never really feels in step with everyone else, but these are qualities that make her endearing in the ""Twilight"" world. She quickly falls for .... The vampire Edward Cullen . Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is a vampire who's been around for the past century, but he's also eternally 17. He lives with his vampire ""family"" that's been cultivated over the years by ""Twilight's"" HVIC (head vampire in charge), Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli). They eat animals rather than humans -- their version of vegetarianism -- and being a vampire for them means sparkling ""like diamonds"" when in sunlight. Edward can also read minds, with Bella's being the exception, and Alice (Ashley Greene), gets visions about the future. Meyer certainly puts her own spin on vampire lore, but Edward's still a would-be killer, and he does want to kill Bella at first. (Romance!) When Bella figures out Edward's secret, she remains pretty calm about his vampirism -- even though he admits to thirsting for her blood, which to him basically smells like doughnuts to a dieter. Life after 'Twilight': Readers pick new teams . Bella + Edward = 4ever . Edward gets over the ""I want to eat you"" thing as he gets to know Bella and as she's constantly put into life-threatening situations. The ever-present vampires out to kill Bella are problematic, considering that these two say they can't live without one another. They're each other's ""personal brand[s] of heroin,"" if you will, and they're both strung out. As best we can tell, this sentiment is established after an impromptu dinner date, some chaste sleepovers and Edward saving her from the natural -- an out-of-control car -- and the supernatural -- vampires, including his own brother at Bella's 18th birthday party. By then, Edward can't deal with endangering her all the time and he bails. Bella falls into deep despair, but soon realizes she can conjure visions of Edward rescuing her if she puts herself in dangerous situations. This leads to a cliff-jumping and near-drowning incident that causes Alice to believe that Bella's dead, and word works its way back to Edward. Share your review of 'Breaking Dawn Part 2' Enter the Volturi . The Volturi, which in the movies includes the lovely Dakota Fanning and esteemed Michael Sheen, are a group of lethal (and nattily dressed) vampires who instill a sense of order in ""Twilight's"" vampire universe and shield it from being exposed. Going against their laws is a great way to get killed. Since Edward can't bear living without his soulmate Bella, he goes to Volturi home base in Italy on a suicide mission, ready to expose himself as a vampire and attract the Volturi's wrath. Bella shows up in time to stop Edward, but the Volturi consider her a risk thanks to her extensive knowledge of the vampires' ways. Alice saves her life by revealing a vision that Bella will soon become a vampire, a transformation Bella's wanted since the first movie, anyway. That way she would be with Edward for eternity and never age to boot. Edward, however, is against it -- as is Jacob, the other guy. Here's where the girl/wolf/vampire triangle comes in . Jacob Black, played by the supremely sculpted Taylor Lautner, is Quileute and has a gene that causes him to shape-shift into a wolf when vampires are in town. His friendship with Bella deepened when Edward left, and his feelings turn romantic. He makes a strong case for Bella's affections, and by ""Eclipse"" has the girl so confused she winds up kissing him. To be fair, she was worried about what would happen to him in a standoff between the Cullens and a new army of vamps created by a vengeful Victoria. (She was out for Bella's blood ever since Edward killed her lover James in ""Twilight."") But even after that, Jacob still gets second place to Edward, whom Bella agrees to marry. The birth from ""Twilight"" hell . Bella and Edward didn't have sex until after they got married because of Edward's old-fashioned ways (the guy's been around since 1901, after all). Plus he was worried he'd crush her to death in the heat of the moment. (Again, with the romance.) The deal was to turn Bella into a vampire after she tied the knot, but they hold off a bit so she can experience her wedding night without the distraction of unquenchable bloodthirst. After Edward swept Bella away to a family-owned island for their honeymoon, the sex ""Twilight"" fans devoured three books and three movies for finally happens. Bella's bruised, but satisfied ... and also pregnant. Through some technicalities that were never covered in our sex education class, Bella and Edward made a hybrid baby, which means the part-vampire fetus slowly kills her from the inside. In what some have read as an anti-abortion plotline, Bella insists on keeping her baby against the wishes of loved ones, including Edward. The majority of ""Breaking Dawn -- Part I"" chronicles Bella's torturous pregnancy, which demands that she drink a steady diet of blood .... even before she actually becomes a vampire. OK, you're caught up now . Giving birth to a vampire/human child is a spine-breaking horror show, one so gory that Edward had no choice but to turn Bella into a vampire to save her. But before they can be a happy, mostly vampire family with their new baby Renesmee -- who ages at a much faster rate than a human child -- the threat of the Volturi rises once again. And that's where we pick things up in ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2."" The last installment has not only promised us an epic battle and a twist ending, but Bella finding out about Jacob's ""imprinting,"" when he becomes uncontrollably attached to baby Renesmee on sight and completely devoted to her for life. Like we said -- it gets complicated.","""The Twilight Saga"" gets a bit complicated toward the end .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russian military aircraft flew just 500 feet over two U.S. Navy ships this week as the ships participated in a joint military exercise with South Korea in the Sea of Japan, according to U.S. military officials. Two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew only 500 feet above a U.S. aircraft carrier. On Monday, two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft, known as ""Mays,"" overflew the U.S. aircraft carrier Stennis while it was in international waters in the Sea of Japan. The Russian aircraft flew about 500 feet over the ship, lower than other flights the Russians have made over U.S. ships in the past year. The USS Stennis was about 80 miles east of Pohang, South Korea, participating in the joint military exercise when the flyover occurred. On Tuesday, the USS Blue Ridge, a lead command and control ship, and the Stennis were overflown by two Russian ""Bear"" long-range bombers multiple times, according to U.S. military officials. The Bears overflew the ships at about 2,000 feet, officials said. U.S. military officials said that in both cases, U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighters met up with the Russian aircraft about 70 nautical miles from the U.S. ships and flew alongside them until they left the area. On both days, U.S. aircraft tried contacting the Russian planes on international air frequency radio channels, but the Russian pilots did not respond, officials said. The last time Russian planes flew over a U.S. Navy ship was February 2008, when two Bears flew 2,000 feet over the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz south of Japan. Russian long-range flights skirting U.S. or other nations' boundaries have also been common over the last year. Although the Pentagon does not often talk about the overflights, there is nothing illegal about the actions, and they are generally seen by the United States as nothing more than muscle-flexing by the Russian military.","Two Russian planes flew within 500 feet of U.S. Navy aircraft carrier .

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire jury on Thursday convicted a Rwandan woman of lying about her role in a 1994 genocide in her home country to acquire U.S. citizenship. Beatrice Munyenyezi, 43, had her citizenship revoked and will face sentencing in June for two counts of lying on U.S. government applications, authorities said. She faces up to 10 years behind bars, a $250,000 fine on each count and possible deportation, according to the Justice Department. Munyenyezi, who was not on trial for war crimes, was found guilty of intentionally lying on a refugee questionnaire and naturalization documents about her role in the infamous slaughter in which ethnic Hutu militants butchered their Tutsi counterparts over a three-month period.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan said Tuesday that it would hand over to Australian authorities three Australian anti-whaling activists being held aboard a Japanese vessel, but that it would press on with its annual whale hunt in the seas near Antarctica. The activists had illegally boarded the ship, a patrol vessel supporting Japan's whaling mission in Antarctic waters, to protest the hunting of the giant marine mammals in the area. The three men will be released without charge after being questioned by Japan's Coast Guard, an official at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday. The official declined to be identified as is customary in Japan. ""They have not been violent after getting on board and had no record of joining past destructive actions by Sea Shepherd,"" the official said, referring to the anti-whaling group that has clashed several times with the Japanese fleet. He said the Japanese whaling fleet needed the patrol boat to continue with its hunt. Australia engaged in diplomatic discussions with Japan to ensure the well-being and safety of the three men, the Australian attorney-general, Nicola Roxon, said Monday. She said that while Australia steadfastly opposes Japan's whale hunt, the incident did not occur in Australian territorial waters, meaning that Australian law did not automatically apply to the case. Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Each year, environmental groups like Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. Japan has lodged a protest with the Australian government through diplomatic channels, asking it to prevent such boardings in the future, the Japanese foreign ministry official said Tuesday. Video footage released by Sea Shepherd showed the three men, from the environmental group Forest Rescue Australia, boarding the Japanese vessel from a small boat on Sunday. Sea Shepherd had described the three activists -- Geoffrey Owen Tuxworth, 47, Simon Peterffy, 44, and Glen Pendlebury, 27 -- as ""prisoners."" The organization said the men boarded the vessel to force Japan's fleet to stop hunting whales. This is the third time activists have boarded ships involved in the Japanese whaling fleet. In 2008, two Sea Shepherd activists sneaked aboard a Japanese vessel. They were released back to the anti-whaling group. In 2010, Pete Bethune, a New Zealander, also boarded the Shonan Maru #2. Bethune was arrested, taken back to Japan, and tried in a Tokyo court. He spent five months in prison and was released on a two-year suspended sentence. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","Japan has lodged a protest with the Australian government over the boarding .

"(CNN) -- Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, the bass player who laid the musical floor beneath soul legends like Booker T. and the MGs, Sam and Dave and Otis Redding, has died at age 70, his family announced Sunday. Dunn was part of the house band at Memphis, Tennessee's Stax Records, the R&B powerhouse that turned out hits like ""(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,"" ""In the Midnight Hour"" and ""Soul Man."" He was also a member of the Blues Brothers, the band that backed up comedians John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in their ""Saturday Night Live"" appearances and film. ""Duck Dunn was the backbone of the Stax/Volt era,"" Aykroyd said in a written statement. ""He was and will remain universally loved by all that knew him. His talent, knowledge and warmth, and especially his humor will be greatly missed."" Dunn died in his sleep in Tokyo after playing dates that had been postponed after the 2011 Japanese earthquake, his son told CNN. ""They were over there doing five shows in a row, two shows every night -- and for a 70-year-old guy, that was quite a bit of work,"" Jeff Dunn said. The musician had gone back to his hotel after their last show and died before catching a flight back to the United States, his son said. Dunn was touring Japan with two fellow Stax veterans, singer Eddie Floyd and guitarist Steve Cropper. In a statement on his website, Cropper said, ""Today I lost my best friend, and the world has lost the best guy and bass player to ever live."" Cropper and Dunn were high school classmates who joined Stax in the early 1960s to play with Booker T. and the MGs, which underpinned the label's lineup. The group's leader, Booker T. Jones, mourned Dunn in a statement on his own website, saying, ""It was totally unexpected, and I've rarely had tears come so quickly."" When Stax folded in the mid-1970s, Dunn and Cropper became top session players, Dunn played with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and Levon Helm, the former lead singer of The Band, who died in April. Dunn was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Booker T. and the MGs in 1992, and they received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2007. Jeff Dunn said the family had no information about the cause of death. A memorial service will be held in Memphis at a yet-to-be-determined date, he said.

"(CNN) -- Oscar-winning actress Celeste Holm died at her home in New York on Sunday at the age of 95, her niece, Amy Phillips, confirmed. Holm, a star of the Broadway stage and movies, was admitted to New York's Roosevelt Hospital a week ago, but her husband took her home to her Manhattan home on Friday, Phillips said. ""She passed peacefully in her home in her own bed with her husband and friends and family nearby,"" she said. Holm won the best supporting actress Academy Award for ""Gentleman's Agreement"" in 1947. She was nominated for the same honor in 1949 for ""Come to the Stable"" and 1950 for ""All about Eve,"" according to the Academy database. Holm's stage career began in 1936 in a Deer Lake, Pennsylvania, stock company, which led to an understudy role in a touring production of ""Hamlet"" with Leslie Howard, according to her official biography. Her Broadway debut in ""The Time of Your Life"" in 1939 was a small part, but it brought her to the attention of New York critics. Four years later, she was cast as Ado Annie in the smash ""Oklahoma!"" because of her ability to ""sing bad,"" the biography said. She signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox that began her film career in 1945, after she toured Europe entertaining troops with the USO. Her first Fox movie was ""Three Little Girls in Blue"" in 1946, a supporting role that earned her star billing for the musical ""Carnival in Costa Rica"" in 1947. Holm's stardom took off in her third film, ""Gentleman's Agreement,"" in which she won the best supporting actress Academy Award for playing fashion editor Anne Dettry. Her official biography said she was challenged in ""finding parts appropriate for this intelligent blonde who didn't fit their Betty Grable 'pin-up girl' mold."" In 1949, however, she was cast as a ""tennis-playing French nun in ""Come to the Stable,"" which earned her another best supporting actress Oscar nomination, it said. Fox briefly suspended her in 1950 ""for refusing other roles she felt were beneath her."" But she was brought back that same year to play the role of Karen Richards in ""All About Eve."" She was again nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar. She shocked Hollywood by buying out her Fox contract after ""All About Eve"" to return to Broadway, despite her rising big screen stardom. Once back in New York, Holm also began a long career acting in television. Her TV resume includes dozens of series, starting as a guest actress with ""All Star Revue"" in 1950 and concluding with an episode of ""Whoopi"" in 2004. In between, she had her own short-lived series ""Honestly, Celeste!"" in 1954. She is also remembered as the Fairy Godmother in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella,"" a 1965 television show. She played Hattie Greene in both the ""Touched by an Angel"" and ""Promised Land"" TV series in the 1990s. The last decade of her life was overshadowed by a bitter legal dispute between one of her two sons and Holm's fifth husband, Frank Basile. She married Basile, who was 46 years younger than her, in 2004. Neither of her two sons was there in her Central Park West apartment when she died, Phillips said. She first married director Ralph Nelson in 1938, but the couple divorced the next year after the birth of a son, Ted, according to her official biography. Her second marriage, to English auditor Francis Davies, in 1940 also ended quickly, the biography said. Holm married airline public relations executive A. Schuyler Dunning in 1946. Her second son, Daniel, was born that year, but that marriage did not last, it said. In 1961, Holm married her fourth husband, actor Wesley Addy, whom she met while co-starring in the 1960 Broadway production of ""Invitation to the March."" They often acted onstage together during their marriage, which lasted until Addy's death in 1996. Holm was appointed to the National Arts Council by President Ronald Reagan, knighted by King Olav of Norway, and inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame, her family said.

"(CNN) -- Anthony Shadid, who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting from Iraq, died Thursday while reporting in eastern Syria, apparently of an asthma attack, The New York Times said. He was 43. Tyler Hicks, a Times photographer who was with Shadid, carried his body over the border to Turkey. Hicks said Shadid, who was carrying medication for his asthma, displayed symptoms Thursday morning, when they joined guides on horseback for the trip out of the country. The animals may have triggered the asthma, Hicks said. He had suffered an asthma attack the week before, when they entered the country and met with guides on horseback, Hicks told The Times. The Syrian government, which limits international journalists' access to the country, had not been told by The Times that Shadid was there, the newspaper said. He had been inside Syria for a week collecting information for a story on the Syrian resistance, it added. Shadid, who was fluent in Arabic, had covered the Middle East for nearly 20 years as a reporter for The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Associated Press. ""I was afraid of bullets and bombs before and to find out that he died of an asthma attack was a shock,"" Shadid's father, Buddy, told CNN. ""The world lost an amazing journalist and I lost a beloved son."" ""Anthony Shadid was one of the finest and most courageous journalists of our time,"" said Mark Whitaker, executive vice president and managing editor of CNN Worldwide, who worked at the Washington Post with Shadid before the late journalist went to The New York Times. ""All of us at CNN mourn his loss and grieve for his colleagues and loved ones."" Shadid had been working on a book about his family's ancestral home in Lebanon. He traveled there after years of covering conflict to rebuild his grandmother's home, according to his website. ""He found a story of hope, healing, but perhaps most powerfully, loss, in a Middle East whose future rests in understanding its past,"" it said. The book, ""House of Stone,"" is to be published next month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He wrote two other books, ""Legacy of the Prophet: Despots, Democrats and the New Politics of Islam"" and ""Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was a follower of Shadid's work. ""I also want to extend on behalf of myself and our government our sympathies to the family of Anthony Shadid and to The New York Times for his untimely death,"" she said. ""He was somebody I always turned to and read very carefully ... he had his pulse on what was happening."" In an interview last December on NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" Shadid recalled entering without a visa the Syria ruled by President Bashar al-Assad. Anthony Shadid: A reporter's storyteller . ""I've done things that maybe I wouldn't have done in hindsight, and this maybe would have been one of them,"" he said. ""It was scarier than I thought it would be. I had had a bad experience in Libya earlier in the year, [but] I did feel that Syria was so important, and that story wouldn't be told otherwise, that it was worth taking risks for. But the repercussions of getting caught were pretty dire."" After several days in Hama, he crossed safely back across the border. ""I don't think I'd ever seen something like what I saw in Syria,"" he said. ""You're dealing with a government that's shown very little restraint in killing its own people to put down an uprising. ... And I got to spend a lot of time with [the activists] because I spent a lot of time in safe houses. And it reminded me of an old story in Islamic history, when the Muslim armies are crossing to Gibraltar. And the general who was leading them burned the ships after they crossed into Spain. And the idea was there was no turning back. And that story, I felt, resonated [with] almost every conversation I had."" He did not always emerge unhurt from his reporting. In 2002, while working for The Boston Globe, he was shot in the shoulder in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Last year, Shadid and Hicks and two other Times journalists, Stephen Farrell and Lynsey Addario, were arrested by pro-government militias in Libya and held for almost a week, during which all were physically abused. Their driver, Mohammad Shaglouf, died. In its 2004 citation, the Pulitzer Board praised ""his extraordinary ability to capture, at personal peril, the voices and emotions of Iraqis as their country was invaded, their leader toppled and their way of life upended."" In 2010, the board praised ""his rich, beautifully written series on Iraq as the United States departs and its people and leaders struggle to deal with the legacy of war and to shape the nation's future."" His last story for The Times, on Libya, ran on February 9. At 1,600 words, it was long, which was typical for him, the newspaper said. ""It was splashed on the front page of the newspaper and the home page of the Web site, nytimes.com, which was also typical,"" it said. Overheard on CNN.com: Remembering Shadid . ""Anthony died as he lived â€” determined to bear witness to the transformation sweeping the Middle East and to testify to the suffering of people caught between government oppression and opposition forces,"" wrote Jill Abramson, executive editor of the Times, in an email to the newspaper's staff. Survivors include his wife and two children, his parents, a brother and a sister.

"(CNN) -- Triple Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel has warned his 2013 title rivals that Red Bull are in better shape than this time 12 months ago. Red Bull driver Vettel edged out Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the final race of the 2012 season to clinch a third successive drivers' title by just three points, while his team celebrated a third constructors' crown in a row. Vettel, the sport's youngest ever three-time champion, insists the whole team is focused on matching last year's achievements. ""What we have is more or less the same car that we had in Brazil (the final race of the 2012 season) -- with some steps forward,"" the 25-year-old told F1's official website after taking to the track at a preseason testing event in Barcelona. ""But from a personal level I can say that I am much happier now than I was one year ago."" The German also dismissed suggestions he might struggle for motivation ahead of the 2013 season. ""Thank God I don't have to think about something like 'finding motivation!'"" added Vettel. ""Sure it was nice what we've achieved in the last three years and it makes us all proud, but I would say that I am still in a phase of my life where I look forward, and that's the right direction to go."" Last season began in unpredictable fashion, with an unprecedented seven different drivers winning the season's opening seven races. It was an uncharacteristically slow start to year from Red Bull, with Vettel winning the year's fourth grand prix in Bahrain but then not picking up a second success until September's race in Singapore. ""I don't think it will be much different from what was important last year -- again it will be very close, so it will not be a case of two or three drivers fighting it out,"" continued Vettel. ""In the first half of the season I expect a very similar situation to 2012 where we saw many different winners. Then, in the second half, some favourites will become visible. ""To be one of them you have to score points at every race and be consistent -- that was what got us the title in 2012."" Alonso, a two-time drivers' champions, made first appearance of preseason in Catalunya on Tuesday, but Vettel remains focus on ensuring Red Bull arrive at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 17 in the best possible shape. ""When you drive and you see another car on the track it is almost impossible to notice details, from whatever car,"" said Vettel. ""This is much easier when you look at photos. To be honest right now we are still in the phase where we are fully concentrating on ourselves, not looking left and right.""","Sebastian Vettel is motivated to challenge for a fourth straight F1 world title .

"(CNN) -- Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, who designed and unveiled to the world the first Porsche 911, has died in Salzburg, Austria, a spokesman said. He was 76. The death was announced Thursday by Matthias Muller, president of Porsche AG, who credited the late designer with establishing a ""design that is a legacy."" Porsche gained worldwide recognition at the age of 27 when he unveiled the first Porsche 911 at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1963. Recalling the design process, Porsche said: ""Right from the start the specification was that the car had to be instantly recognizable as a Porsche from its silhouette."" The two-door luxury coupe initially was called the Porsche 901, until a patent issue with Peugeot forced a change in name. In addition, Porsche also designed the Porsche 904 Carrera GTS, a Formula One racing car that has been praised for its sleek, forward design. Porsche was born in Stuttgart, Germany, on December 11, 1935, to Dorothea and Ferry Porsche. He was named for his grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche, according to the company. As the story goes, he spent much of his time in the engineering and development offices of his grandfather, who is credited with the original design of the Volkswagen Beetle in the 1930s. F.A. Porsche, as he was referred to by his colleagues, joined the company at the age of 22 and soon developed one of the first clay models of the successor of the Porsche 356, the company's first production automobile, according to Muller. In 1962, he took over as the head of the Porsche design studio and one year later unveiled what became the Porsche 911. Porsche, who later served as president of the company, is credited with playing a major role in reshaping it in the 1990s and guiding it through an economic turnaround, according to Porsche AG. Porsche will be buried in a private ceremony in Zell am See, Germany, the company said. An official service will be held in Stuttgart at a later date.

"(CNN) -- With Washington stuck in gridlock, tied up in the latest battle to rescue the federal budget, the last thing many people might want to do is watch a two- or three-hour movie about politics. Unless you're in the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. From ""Argo"" to ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to ""Lincoln,"" politically focused films are battling it out for the Best Picture Oscar this year, and many have done well at the box office, too. So, with the Oscars coming up on Sunday, here is a roundup of politically inspired movies that have been nominated or won, past and present: . THE 2013 NOMINEES . ""Argo"" Nominated for seven Academy Awards, ""Argo"" may be considered Ben Affleck's biggest achievement as a director. But although the real-life rescue thriller is nominated for Best Motion Picture, Affleck himself failed to get a nomination for Best Director -- seen as a slight by many critics and an omission that could affect the film's chances for the big award. The movie takes place in 1979 revolutionary Iran, where, after 52 Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, six other American diplomats try to escape the country with the help of the CIA, the Canadian government and a Hollywood film team. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director with ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2008, a film about a U.S. Bomb squad in the Iraq war. Bigelow continued her theme of post-9/11 politics in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" an account of how Osama bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan. However, she has faced criticism for her depictions of torture in the film. Sen. John McCain called the movie ""misleading"" and ""grossly inaccurate"" for what he felt was the suggestion that torture helped lead to finding bin Laden. He, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Carl Levin even wrote a letter to the CEO of Sony Pictures, expressing their disagreement with what the movie portrayed as fact. And, like Affleck, Bigelow was not nominated for this year's Best Director award, even though the film received five other nominations. ""Lincoln"" Daniel Day-Lewis appears to be the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Honest Abe in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln."" The film, which received 12 Academy Award nominations, has been touted as a history lesson about what actually took place in the days leading up to the passage of the 13th Amendment. But the congressional delegation from Connecticut has challenged the film's depiction of history. In the key scene where Congress votes on whether to end slavery, two members from Connecticut are depicted as voting against the amendment. But current Rep. Joe Courtney says that is wrong, that the state's lawmakers actually voted unanimously in favor of ending slavery. He sent a letter to Spielberg expressing his dismay and hopes the movie will be changed ahead of its release on DVD on February 26. And in case it doesn't get changed, just for the record: Connecticut wasn't cool with slavery. Now, Mississippi on the other hand ... PREVIOUS WINNERS AND NOMINEES . ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939) This 1939 film, which won one Oscar and was nominated for 10 others, is probably the one movie you've heard grandparents talk about when they complain that today's Hollywood isn't like what it used to be. Jimmy Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, the everyman who is suddenly thrust into the U.S. Senate. In the movie's climatic scene, Stewart's character launches into an actual filibuster (sound familiar?), a favorite tactic among current GOP senators. Stewart's fictional filibuster, where he talked for 24 hours straight, was done to stop a bill that would have stolen land intended for a boy's camp. That's a slightly different crusade than, say, holding up the Chuck Hagel nomination. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962) ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" nominated for two Oscars, debuted at the height of the Cold War. Frank Sinatra played Maj. Bennett Marco, who discovers that one of his fellow American POWs was brainwashed by the communists. Although the story is more than a half-century old, the political intrigue and paranoia over communism could easily be replaced with the current fear over Islamist terrorism. ""All The President's Men"" (1976) There's nothing more exciting for Hollywood than movies about young people trying to upset the system. When ""All The President's Men"" -- which won four Oscars and was nominated for four more -- came out in 1976, just about everyone had heard of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters responsible for uncovering the Watergate scandal and forcing the resignation of President Richard Nixon. The film, which provided context and drama about how the reporters brought down the most powerful man on Earth, also inspired countless young men and women to become journalists in the pursuit of truth. ""JFK"" (1991) Since this is an Oliver Stone project, most didn't expect a Lincoln-esque biopic of the nation's first and only Catholic president. ""JFK,"" which won two Oscars and was nominated for another six, centered around New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner, and his investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In typical Stone fashion, history gives way to conspiracy. ""Malcolm X"" (1992) Director Spike Lee rarely shies away from difficult subjects such as race in America. His 1992 film ""Malcolm X,"" considered one of his best films, told the story of one of America's most complicated and controversial civil-rights icon. It was also a statement on the state of American race relations. Denzel Washington, who played Malcolm, was nominated for Best Actor. The film's only other nomination was for Best Costume Design. ""Nixon"" (1995) Anthony Hopkins' performance as ""Nixon"" in this 1995 film was one of his best, helping the movie earn four Oscar nominations. Oliver Stone followed up the success of JFK with this biopic in which he tries to understand Nixon's psyche, from his days as a young man to his eventual resignation as president of the United States. ""Bowling for Columbine"" (2002) With the recent shootings in Aurora, Oak Creek and Newtown, the debate over gun violence has been reignited. But before those tragedies, there was the 1999 shooting in Columbine, where 15 people died. Michael Moore directed the documentary ""Bowling for Columbine,"" which took a hard look at the gun culture in America and won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" (2005) Before Affleck got his taste for directing, it was actor-turned-director George Clooney who was receiving praise for his work behind the camera. With Clooney as director, this 2005 film -- nominated for six Oscars -- tells the true story of journalistic icon Edward R. Murrow in his battle against Sen. Joseph McCarthy during McCarthy's red scare. McCarthy was a senator who wanted to root out what he suspected as communist elements in the U.S. Murrow was one of the most visible TV journalists to stand up to McCarthy and his tactics, and he represented the beliefs of those who felt McCarthy was on a political witch hunt. Recently, some Democrats compared Texas freshman Sen. Ted Cruz to McCarthy  for his unsubstantiated claims that defense secretary nominee Hagel had received money from Saudi Arabia and North Korea. ""Syriana"" (2005) Before 9/11, many Americans weren't typically interested in politics abroad. But after that tragic event and the subsequent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, everything changed. The 2005 film ""Syriana"" -- which won Clooney a Best Actor award and was nominated for another Oscar -- was a gripping political thriller based around the No. 1 currency in the world: oil. ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008) Richard Nixon's term as president has been great fodder for Hollywood. Maybe it's the jowls. Or maybe it's the fact that someone so powerful could have fallen so far. In ""Frost/Nixon,"" nominated for five Oscars, Frank Langella plays Nixon after he resigned from the presidency. Langella squares off against talk-show host David Frost, played by Michael Sheen, and reveals Nixon at his most cunning and vulnerable. ""Milk"" (2008) Harvey Milk was California's first openly gay elected official, serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Sean Penn plays Milk in this Gus Van Sant film about the late gay rights advocate and leading figure in the LGBT movement. The movie won two Oscars and was nominated for another six.","This year, three politically themed films are up for Best Picture .

"(CNN) -- Keyboard player Jon Lord, who fused classical and heavy metal to make Deep Purple one of the biggest rock bands in the world, died Monday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 71. Lord suffered a fatal pulmonary embolism, or a blockage of the lung artery, according to a statement posted on his website. Born in Leicester, England, on June 9, 1941, Lord took classical music lessons as a child, and as a teen became enamored with the sound of the blues organ. Later, he was among the first musicians to successfully and seamlessly blend the two influences using a Hammond C3 organ, distorting the sound, and routing it through amplifiers. Fleetwood Mac's Bob Welch dies at 66 . While best known for co-writing the Deep Purple hit, ""Smoke on the Water,"" Lord never strayed far from his classical roots. The band's ""Concerto for Group and Orchestra"" in 1969 was one of its first chart successes. Combining his dazzling virtuosity on the keyboard with the equally virtuosic Ritchie Blackmore on the guitar, the band left behind a string of rock classics that showcased their musicianship: ""Space Truckin,"" ""Highway Star,"" ""Child in Time."" At its heyday in the 1970s, Deep Purple was as big as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, selling more than 100 million albums. ""We're as valid as anything by Beethoven,"" Lord said in an interview with NME magazine in 1973. He retired from the band in 2002, and spent the following years working on solo material and collaborating with others, including work last year on a single by the supergroup WhoCares, featuring Purple singer Ian Gillan, Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain and former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted. Actress Celeste Holm dead at 95 . Last August, Lord posted a message to fans where he revealed he was fighting cancer and would be taking a break from performing. ""I shall of course be continuing to write music -- in my world it just has to be part of the therapy -- and I fully expect to be back in good shape next year,"" it said. He canceled a July 6 show in Germany where he was scheduled to perform with the Hagen Philharmonic Orchestra, with his website attributing it to ""a continuation of his regular treatment."" He died Monday at The London Clinic, surrounded by family members, the site said. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived . Do you have a memory associated with Jon Lord or Deep Purple?

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Australian-Israeli dual citizen who died in an Israeli prison gave Australian intelligence details of his work with Israel's Mossad before his arrest, an Australian television network reported Tuesday. The fate of the man dubbed ""Prisoner X"" is now the subject of an investigation by Israel's parliament. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pleaded over the weekend for details to be kept quiet, warning ""overexposure of security and intelligence activity"" could harm Israel's security. But the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has identified him as Ben Zygier, and it reported Tuesday that he had reported ""every aspect of his work"" for the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Zygier reportedly committed suicide in Israel's Ayalon Prison in December 2010, about 10 months after his arrest, according to ABC. His incarceration was a state secret, and Israel has never confirmed the prisoner's name or how he died. ABC, citing unnamed sources, reported Tuesday that Zygier gave Australia ""comprehensive detail about a number of Mossad operations, including plans for a top-secret mission in Italy that had been years in the making."" Zygier helped Mossad set up a European communications company that sold electronics to Arab countries and Iran, according to the network. He met with Australian intelligence during a trip back to Australia, ABC reported. It wasn't clear who approached whom -- but ABC said it ""believes"" Zygier was arrested after Mossad discovered his contact with ASIO, fearing he had given up Israeli secrets. A committee of Israel's Knesset announced Sunday that it would look into all aspects of the case, much of which remains under a gag order. Details about what happened to ""Prisoner X"" -- and why -- remain elusive. 'We are not like other countries,' Netanyahu says . In his weekly Cabinet address Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Israel is committed to freedom of expression. ""However, the overexposure of security and intelligence activity could harm, sometimes severely, state security,"" he said. ""We are not like other countries,"" Netanyahu added. ""We are an exemplary democracy and maintain the rights of those under investigation and individual rights no less than any other country. However, we are more threatened and face more challenges; therefore, we must maintain proper activity of our security agencies. And therefore, I ask all of you, let the security forces do their work quietly so that we can continue to live in security and tranquility in the state of Israel."" Israel's 'Prisoner X': Death of man with alleged spy agency ties . For two years, a government gag order prevented local journalists in Israel from telling the story. But after ABC brought the case to light last week, an Israeli court appeared to publicly confirm details about the case for the first time. A statement from the court described a ""prisoner who was both an Israeli citizen and a foreign national."" ""The inmate was registered under a false identity for security reasons, but his family was notified immediately upon his arrest,"" the statement said. The court lifted part of the gag order, saying local media could quote foreign publications' reporting on the case -- but they could not do their own reporting on the story. Criticism within Israel . Some Israeli lawmakers sharply criticized the government's handling of the matter. ""When unknown prisoners commit suicide and nobody knows who he is, how does that fit with a democracy with law which is proper?"" Zahava Gal-On, leader of the Meretz Party, asked last week. Pressed for answers by another lawmaker, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman said that the matter should be investigated. But he said he could not answer the questions ""because the subject is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Ministry."" Dan Yakir, chief legal council for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, sent a letter to Israel's attorney general about the case, criticizing the censorship and calling for the gag order to be scaled back further. ""What is far more concerning, of course, is the fact that a man was held in detention under heavy secrecy, and nothing was published about the reason for his arrest or the circumstances surrounding his death,"" Yakir wrote. A culture of censorship . All journalists who apply for a government-issued Israeli Press Card must sign documents agreeing to the military censorship. According to the agreement, journalists will not publish security information that could benefit Israel's enemies or harm the state. Breaking the rule could result in card revocation, and foreign journalists could lose their visas to work there. In recent years, the censorship mechanism for checking scripts and pictures has rarely been practiced. Controls over content have faded more and more with the Internet as more freedom of information passes into the public domain. Recent news of Prisoner X's case prompted Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr to request an internal report. ""I'm advised in the form of an interim report that the Australian government was informed in February 2010, though intelligence channels, that the Israeli authorities had detained a dual Australian-Israeli citizen, and they provided the name of the citizen, in relation to serious offenses under Israeli national security legislation,"" Carr told a Senate committee Thursday. He did not mention what the alleged ""serious offenses"" were. Carr said Australia sought specific assurances from Israel, such as that the detainee would get legal representation of his choosing and that he would not be mistreated. ""At no stage during his detention did the Australian government receive any requests from the individual or his family to extend consular support,"" Carr said. ""The Australian government was advised through intelligence channels on December 16, 2010, (of) this individual's death on the previous day, and the deceased's family had been notified by Israeli authorities."" The Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv assisted in returning the body to Australia, Carr said. Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem, and Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Sara Sidner also contributed to this report.","NEW: Australian network says 'Prisoner X' shared Israeli secrets with Australia .

"New York (CNN) -- Broadway's bright glow will dim for a moment on Wednesday in memory of the late Marvin Hamlisch, a prolific American composer who died this week after a more than four-decade long career that spanned film, music, television and theater. Manhattan's 40 Broadway theaters are expected to turn down their lights at 8 p.m. ET for a total of 60 seconds in symbolic tribute to the man who composed acclaimed scores for the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""A Chorus Line,"" as well as ""They're Playing Our Song"" and ""The Goodbye Girl."" His musical ensembles and ""old-fashioned"" style made him a favorite with Hollywood elites, theater-goers and dignitaries, and earned him three Oscars, four Grammys, four Emmys, a Tony and three Golden Globe awards -- one of only 11 people ever to do so, according to The Broadway League, a trade group for the industry. On the silver screen, Hamlisch composed more than 40 scores for films like ""The Way We Were"" and ""The Sting."" ""His legacy leaves us with a treasury of songs and stories that will always be familiar to theater-goers as they stir up meaningful and heartfelt emotions,"" said Charlotte St. Martin, League Executive Director. He died Monday at the age of 68. ""Music is truly an international language,"" Hamlisch said on his official website. ""And I hope to contribute by widening communication as much as I can."" Share your memories of Marvin Hamlisch . Social media was abuzz Tuesday with reflections of the legendary composer and his legacy. ""The evenings we spent with you and the Pittsburgh Pops are memories that will last forever,"" Jean Elliot Boyer wrote on his official Facebook page.""Your banter with the audience and your down-to-earth style will stay with me forever."" ""The world will miss your gift,"" wrote Gail Dwyer. Lauded as a child prodigy, Hamlisch was the youngest student ever accepted into Manhattan's prestigious Juilliard School of Music at the age of 7. Later in life, he held principal pops conductor positions at various American orchestras, including the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Pasadena, San Diego and Seattle Symphonies. His passing drew comments Tuesday from a galaxy of Hollywood stars and others who sought to pay him tribute. ""I will miss his talent, our laughter (and) friendship, but mostly I will miss Marvin,"" said actress and singer Liza Minnelli. ""My heart is with his wife Terre always."" Nancy Reagan said she had been shocked to learn of his death, calling Hamlisch ""a dear friend"" whom she and her late husband, President Ronald Reagan, were drawn to by way of his ""old fashioned"" charm. ""I'll never forget that he wrote a special song for Ronnie's surprise 77th birthday party in 1988. My heart goes out to Terre at this difficult time,"" said the former first lady.

"(CNN) -- Nora Ephron, the screenwriter and director whose sharp, edgy romantic comedies featuring strong women took her to the top ranks of a film industry mostly dominated by men, has died. She was 71. Ephron died Tuesday surrounded by relatives at a New York hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for acute myeloid leukemia, her family said in a statement. The best of Nora Ephron . She wore many hats: essayist, playwright, journalist, novelist, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and a movie director. An accomplished screenwriter, her romantic comedies featured strong but appealing characters who tackled relationship issues with a comic insight into their situations. They included box office hits ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" both of which earned her screenwriting Oscar nominations. Ephron mourned as 'brilliant' writer, humorist . She also received an Oscar nomination for ""Silkwood,"" the story of anti-nuclear activist Karen Silkwood. ""An amazingly talented girl who was able to accomplish everything she set her mind to with great style and will be missed enormously,"" actor Martin Landau said in a statement. Ephron also wrote and directed ""Julie & Julia,"" which earned Meryl Streep a best actress Oscar nomination in 2010. ""What a loss. A magnificent spirit and voice. She changed romantic comedy forever,"" actress Debra Messing said. Ephron was born on May 19, 1941, into a family of writers. Her parents, Henry and Phoebe Ephron, wrote screenplays for ""Carousel,"" ""Desk Set"" and ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" From the archives: Nora Ephron's best advice . While her parents' works live on through movie rentals and classic film channels, perhaps the elder Ephrons' true legacy is their daughters. Nora Ephron made her directorial debut with the 1992 comedy, ""This Is My Life,"" which she co-wrote with her sister, Delia. Both sisters also put together a production fashioned around Ilene Beckerman's best-selling book ""Love, Loss and What I Wore."" Ephron believes her parents' humor was a big part of her productions. ""They were funny and they believed that everything was copy,"" Ephron said in 2009. ""They believed that anything in life could be turned into a story, which is really the first rule of humor. I don't think you can get through almost anything without humor."" She married screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi in 1987, eight years after she divorced investigative reporter Carl Bernstein. Her failed marriage to Bernstein was the basis of her book and movie, ""Heartburn."" From the archives: A story told through clothes and Ephrons . ""I feel bad for the people who don't at some point understand that there's something funny in even the worst things that can happen to you,"" Ephron said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Ephron's stories set in his city are classics. ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" her romantic comedies starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, were among her movies that featured a lot of the city's iconic buildings as a backdrop. ""The loss of Nora Ephron is a devastating one for New York City's arts and cultural community,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""From her earliest days at New York City's newspapers to her biggest Hollywood successes, Nora always loved a good New York story, and she could tell them like no one else."" Female writers to Nora Ephron: 'I'll have what she's having' In addition to making movies, Ephron also tackled writing in many other forms. Her essays include ""I Remember Nothing"" and ""Crazy Salad."" She also wrote the 2002 play, ""Imaginary Friends."" Three years ago, Ephron provided a list of some of the best advice she's ever got. It included ""life is too short"" and ""location, location, location,"" an appropriate sentiment for a director whose romantic comedies focused on seizing the moment in major metropolitan cities.

"Washington (CNN) -- Four former officials of the now-closed Peanut Corporation of America were indicted Thursday on charges related to salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut products, the Justice Department said. A 2009 salmonella outbreak that prompted a massive recall of peanut goods led to nine deaths and more than 700 illnesses in more than 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 76-count indictment, unsealed in Georgia, alleged mail and wire fraud, the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead, and conspiracy. A plant in Blakely, Georgia, roasted and processed raw peanuts. Its peanut paste was sold to customers nationwide and used in crackers, cookies, and other items. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the company shipped tainted product it knew had tested positive for bacteria linked to the salmonella outbreak. U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Macon said the accused are expected to appear in court in Albany next week. The defendants were identified as Stewart Parnell, 58, of Lynchburg, Virginia; Michael Parnell, 54, of Midlothian, Virginia; Samuel Lightsey, 48, of Blakely; and Mary Wilkerson, 39, of Edison, Georgia. Three of the four were also charged with obstruction of justice, Justice Department officials said. Authorities said Daniel Kilgore, 44, of Blakely pleaded guilty to similar counts this week. Food recalls are common, but criminal indictments around them are not. Charges in this case appear to have been prompted, in part, by the defendants' alleged knowledge of the salmonella-tainted product shipment and an alleged cover-up. Those charged could face stiff jail terms, if convicted.","Indictment charges four former officials of Peanut Corporation of America .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona may be licking their wounds after a 2-0 European Champions League defeat to AC Milan but on Thursday they received a boost that star midfielder Xavi described as ""the best news of the year."" Eric Abidal, who has spent nearly a year out of the game after having a liver transplant, has been declared fit enough to rejoin Barca's first team squad. It is positive news for Barcelona whose manager Tito Vilanova is currently in New York receiving treatment for throat cancer. The French defender last played for Barca on February 26 last year and underwent surgery in April. He also had a tumor removed in March 2011. Abidal spent two months on a specific training program designed by club physio Emili Ricart before training with the rest of the squad from the middle of December. But now he is back in contention for a first team place. A statement on Barca's official website read: ""Following training Eric Abidal received the wonderful news that he is in good enough condition to play for the first team in what remains of the current season."" The club's players were delighted the 33-year-old had completed his recovery. Xavi, who has spent his entire career at the Spanish giants told the website: ""It's the best news of the year. ""It's not a great day coming back after a 2-0 defeat, but seeing Abidal, how he trains and gives it everything and that he's now able to return to playing is a source of motivation.

"(CNN) -- Fans of English football club Tottenham Hotspur found themselves on the receiving end of vicious attacks for the second time in six months on Wednesday after three people were injured during an incident in the French city of Lyon. Tottenham supporters have traveled to France for the second leg of the club's Europa League tie with Olympique Lyonnais and were confronted by a group of roughly 50 people while gathered at a pub. ""Club officials attended an incident last night in Lyon,"" read a statement from Tottenham, who are based in North London. ""A group of around 50 people confronted fans. ""The situation was dealt with and arrests were made within the hour. Three fans sustained minor injuries and received prompt medical assistance. ""Spurs officials and stewards will be in the city throughout the day, along with matchday French police ahead of kick-off."" The Press Association reported masked attackers made Nazi salutes as they descended on approximately 150 Spurs fans outside the Smoking Dog pub. Lyon issued a statement expressing sympathy for Tottenham's supporters while also distancing the club from the perpetrators of the attack. ""Olympique Lyonnais deeply regrets the incidents that took place last night in the neighborhood of Saint-Jean between supporters of Tottenham and so-called supporters of Lyons who absolutely do not represent the club,"" read the statement. ""Olympique Lyonnais apologizes to Tottenham and its fans, for these unacceptable acts that degrade the image of the city of Lyon.

"(CNN) -- M13 was the only bear known to have been living wild in Switzerland, according to the Swiss national broadcaster. Despite that status, the young male was shot Tuesday morning in Poschiavo Valley, in the Alps near the Italian border, by authorities who feared he was a threat to people. The brown bear had become dangerous because he regularly sought out food in inhabited areas -- including a school -- and had started following people during the day, the Swiss Federal Environment Office said. The creature also showed little fear of humans despite several attempts to get it away from villages, it said. There was so much concern about the bear's behavior, he was fitted with a radio collar so he could be closely monitored. And in November of last year, he was classified as a ""problem bear."" When M13 emerged from his winter hibernation recently, that pattern of behavior was repeated, pushing authorities to act, the environment office said in a prepared statement Wednesday. ""The bear M13 had certainly never showed any aggression toward man, but the risk that an accident might happen and that people might be badly injured or killed had become intolerable,"" it said. Nonetheless, news of his death prompted grief and outrage on a Facebook page set up by supporters of M13. Some questioned why he wasn't relocated or placed in a zoo rather than being shot by wildlife officers. The Swiss branch of the World Wildlife Fund environmental campaign group said it was ""extremely disappointed"" that the bear was killed. Joanna Schoenenberger, an expert on bears at the WWF, said it was far too soon to shoot M13. M13 ""was in no way a problem bear,"" she said, adding that wildlife officers should have continued efforts to make him more frightened of humans. ""His death is the result of a lack of acceptance of bears in Poschiavo, which is a direct consequence of a lack of information among the population,"" she said. The risk remains that other bears might follow in M13's paw prints and stray into Switzerland's Grisons area. According to the Swiss Federal Environment Office, M13 was one of about 40 individuals originating in the Trentino Alto Adige area of Italy, where a reintroduction program is under way. The bear's name comes from the system of identifying bears from that Italian population, with M standing for males and F for females, said WWF spokesman Philip Gehri. M13 was the 13th male from that group to be born in the wild. Faced with the migration of these bears, Swiss authorities have the dilemma of whether to try to protect the population as a whole or a few individuals, the environment office said. ""In order to give the bear population a chance to reestablish itself in Switzerland, circumstances sometimes arise when unfortunately an individual must be killed,"" it said. Eight bears have entered Switzerland since 2006, the WWF said. If others follow, they should not be killed ""simply because we haven't done our homework,"" said Schoenenberger. The WWF advises that people in areas where bears may be present safeguard livestock, put garbage in bear-proof trashcans and protect beehives. And for the brown bear to survive in the Alps, its human neighbors must accept it, Schoenenberger said. Switzerland is not the only country to struggle with the question of how to help humans and natural predators coexist without friction. In the United States, lawmakers in Minnesota voted last year to allow limited hunting of wolves, after they were removed from federal protection. Conservation groups, including the Humane Society, opposed the decision, but the Minnesota-based International Wolf Center argued that wolves are a threat to domestic animals wherever the two coexist.","NEW: Bear called M13 ""was in no way a problem bear,"" says conservation group expert .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Drug Enforcement Administration agent stationed in Cartagena, Colombia, arranged for a prostitute to have an encounter with a U.S. Secret Service Agent only days before a visit there by President Barack Obama, the Justice Department's inspector general has found. In a December 20 letter to the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, the inspector general said the agent admitted his role in hiring the woman, while a second DEA agent said he was intoxicated that night and was unable to ""recall specifically his involvement."" A third DEA special agent was present for a dinner with the Secret Service agent but was not present at a residence where the sexual encounter took place and played no role in facilitating it, the report said. All three DEA agents eventually admitted they had paid for sexual services in Colombia, the inspector general said. The inspector general and a U.S. Attorney determined there was no basis for bringing a criminal charge in the case, but the agents could still face disciplinary action. Scandal: Systematic problem or abberation? The details of the DEA agents' actions were spelled out in a summary that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, on Wednesday forwarded to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, expressing concern and demanding to know what was being done. In a letter, first reported Thursday by NBC News, Collins said she found the matter ""troubling."" ""Why haven't the administrative actions been completed given that the ... extremely serious findings ... were relayed to DEA more than three months ago?"" Collins asked. The inspector general had no comment, but the Justice Department report indicated the DEA had been informed of the alleged misconduct in September. Late Thursday, the DEA issued a brief written statement saying, ""This matter is currently under review by the Board of Professional Conduct."" The DEA said it takes these matters ""very seriously."" The Secret Service had no comment. Escort in scandal says her life is 'ruined by this' As part of the advance detail before Obama's arrival to attend an April 2012 summit, a dozen Secret Service agents hit the clubs of Cartagena, for a night of drinking that ended with them bringing women back to their hotel rooms. Some of the women received money, and others did not ask for any, but in one case, an agent refused to pay, and the woman summoned a police officer. Nine Secret Service agents implicated in the case resigned or retired. Three were cleared of serious misconduct. Prostitution is legal in Colombia. But the news that some Secret Service agents were drinking heavily and taking prostitutes back to their hotel rooms raised security concerns and tarnished the reputation of the agency charged with protecting the president.","Justice Department inspector general investigated allegations .

"(CNN) -- It's logical -- especially when it has the support of Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. Residents of Earth and other planets have until Monday to weigh in on new names for two of Pluto's moons, by voting on a website set up by the SETI Institute. Based on those votes, the Northern California scientific research organization will then propose names to the International Astronomical Union, which makes the final call. And the runaway top pick, as of Friday evening, is Vulcan. Roman mythology aficionados may see that as a tribute to the god of fire. But for others -- most notably, for legions of Star Trek fans -- it is better known as the home planet of Spock, the ever rational, ever loyal member of the starship Enterprise. None other than Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in the long-running Star Trek television series and string of movies, endorsed as ""logical"" the idea of naming one of the moons Vulcan. Spock's former captain has been even more relentless. Kirk -- or more accurately his human facsimile, William Shatner -- started his effort by urging Trekkies to write the SETI Institute to get Vulcan added as an option. ""It apparently made a difference as they now have added it as an official name,"" Shatner wrote on his Facebook page on February 13. ""Isn't that wonderful."" Since being added as one of 21 alternatives -- and with the help of regular online proddings by Shatner, urging fans to vote Vulcan -- Spock's home has rocketed up the official online vote tally. It had about 140,000 votes by 6:30 p.m. ET Friday, far ahead of its next two closest competitors, Cerberus and Styx, both of which had about 80,000 votes each. There's not much time for them to catch up, as the balloting ends at noon on February 25. But the second-place finisher has a nice consolation prize, since the SETI Institute will be proposing two names. Whatever happens, the moons that until now were only known as P4 and P5 are already lavishing in unprecedented attention -- as evidenced by the volume of votes and the shout-outs from sci-fi legends like Shatner and Nimoy. Earthlings didn't even know about the two orbiting spheres until 2011 and 2012, thanks to images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Naming one of Pluto's moons Vulcan isn't entirely out there. As the SETI Institute notes, Pluto's moons have long been derived from terms from Greek and Roman mythology and stories about Hades and the Underworld. Hence the inclusion of contenders such as Acheron and Sisyphus. That said, Spock and his fellow Vulcans could use a new home. In a 2009 Star Trek film, after all, Vulcan was obliterated by a villain named Nero. Absent another such calamity, though, Vulcan may once again be circulating in the heavens. That would give it a timelessness beyond the two hours or so of any such Star Trek film, allowing the beloved sci-fi franchise's fans to rest easy knowing that Vulcan itself might ""live long and prosper"" for centuries, if not eons to come.

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI prayed for peace in Syria, reconciliation in Myanmar, and comfort in flood-stricken Thailand and the Philippines in his annual Christmas message ""To the City and the World"" on Sunday. Addressing a packed St. Peter's Square on a glorious sunny day, the pope pleaded with God to ""bring an end to the violence in Syria, where so much blood has already been shed."" More than 5,000 people have died in Syria since President Bashar al-Assad began a brutal crackdown in mid-March on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster, the United Nations said earlier this month. In his Christmas morning speech, Benedict also urged the international community to help those suffering hunger and insecurity in the Horn of Africa, a reference to famine and violence in Somalia and Kenya. The pope's reference to the Philippines came as the death toll from flooding there last week topped 1,000, with more than 1,000 more missing. He also prayed for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians, and in Iraq, Afghanistan and South Sudan, and wished ""renewed vigor"" to those striving for the common good across the Arab world after this year's revolutions. The speech, called ""Urbi et Orbi"" in Latin, came a day after the pope delivered a homily that focused on the ""essence"" of the holiday rather than the ""commercial celebration"" it has become. ""Today Christmas has become a commercial celebration, whose bright lights hide the mystery of God's humility, which in turn calls us to humility and simplicity,"" the pope said during Mass on Christmas Eve. ""Let us ask the Lord to help us see through the superficial glitter of this season, and to discover behind it the child in the stable in Bethlehem, so as to find true joy and true light."" The 84-year-old pope, presiding over his seventh Mass as pontiff, also conjured up an image of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, explaining that visitors must bend down to enter its low opening, drawing a tie to what followers of Christ must do to find their faith. ""If we want to find the God who appeared as a child, then we must dismount from the high horse of our 'enlightened' reason,"" he said. ""... In this spirit let us celebrate the liturgy of the holy night, let us strip away our fixation on what is material, on what can be measured and grasped."" The pope started off Saturday's celebrations by lighting a peace candle in the window of his study during the unveiling of a larger-than-life Nativity scene in St. Peter's Square. The scene, at 23 feet high and 82 feet wide, is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, according to the Vatican's news agency. Thousands poured into the square and St. Peter's Basilica ahead of the midnight Mass, which was actually held at 10 p.m. this year. Before his homily, the aging pontiff rode down St. Peter's long aisle on a wheeled platform, waving to worshippers.","NEW: The pope urges the international community to help the hungry in Africa .

"(CNN) -- For the past 49 years French animal trainer, Thierry Le Portier, 63, has been a calm handler of wild felines. Growing up he had originally wanted to be a gym teacher, but after catching a glimpse of a lion tamer during a trip to the zoo in Marseille, Le Portier decided to give up his hobbies -- rugby and judo -- to spend every free afternoon watching the tamer at work. On his 17th birthday, Le Portier was finally given the opportunity he had patiently been waiting for when before the show began, as the lights dimmed, the trainer surprised the teenager by forcing him on to center stage. ""He grabbed me by the shoulders, pushed me in the cage just before a show with a lioness and said, ""go!"" And I did the whole show,"" he said. The show was so successful that Le Portier was confident he had found his vocation and was soon touring Europe with his act. So remarkable was his skill that Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini called on the talented young tamer for a scene involving a lion in his 1974 film ""Arabian Nights."" Le Portier quickly became a specialist of big-cat scenes and after Pasolini came other famous screen directors such as Jean-Jacques Annaud with ""Two Brothers,"" Ridley Scott with ""Gladiator,"" and more recently Ang Lee with ""Life of Pi,"" which stars a digital tiger. The trainer -- along with his three tigers -- was flown out to Taiwan for four months and filmed extensively for reference. During this time he developed a close bond with the film's director. ""Every time we went somewhere [film producer] David Womack called me the quality control and Ang Lee would say 'and inspiration,'"" Le Portier said. Read more: Director finished film using phone . Le Portier believes he and Lee struck up a close friendship because of a shared work ethic. ""I work with tigers for the same reason Ang Lee is in the movie business: because we can't do anything else."" It's this passion for taming which makes Le Portier arguably the best animal trainer in the world. When talking about his work, his whole body becomes animated. ""Training is an art; it takes time and an understanding of the animal you are with."" Read more: 'Life of Pi' is bold and wondrous . Le Portier doesn't use food as a means of enticing the animal, or a whip to control it. He simply uses his brain. ""You don't train with physical abuse because he's so strong, it's a mental arm-wrestle,"" he explained. ""It's a real psychology, mental manipulation."" In fact, Le Portier said he was only scared of one type of animal, the kind which has been raised by humans as an exotic ""pet,"" the one that ""looks dead behind the eyes."" Le Portier believes these are prowling ""time bombs."" He warns that one day their natural instincts flood back and without warning they turn aggressive -- these wild animals were never made to be patted. ""I'm not meant to be his friend; you are never his real friend. You have to intimidate him,"" Le Portier said. Read more: What's the buzz on 'Life of Pi'? In the cage Le Portier is the boss.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Afghan President Hamid Karzai America's ""new strategy"" in Afghanistan will focus on reconstructing the war-battered country and maintaining strong counter-terrorism measures, his office said. Members of the U.S Army 1-6 Field Artillery division distribute aid to villagers in Tupak, Afghanistan Saturday. Karzai's office passed along a statement with details of a meeting Saturday between Karzai and a Pelosi-led congressional delegation visiting Afghanistan. Both sides discussed bilateral relations, counter-terrorism strategy, Afghan-U.S. bilateral relations, counter-terrorism strategy, economic improvements, and America's long-term security commitment to the country. ""Ms. Pelosi during the meeting said that the process of democracy in Afghanistan was on the right track and she assured President Karzai that the new American strategy for Afghanistan, which also has the views of the Afghan government included, will consider every necessary measure for a better coordination of the counter-terrorism effort in the region and have achievable goals. ""Ms. Pelosi also reaffirmed her country's continued commitment to the reconstruction process in Afghanistan and said that the new strategy would concentrate on reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan as well."" The statement said Karzai thanked the American people for their help and noted a ""recent consensus between the Afghan Government and NATO, which gives more authority to the Afghan security forces"" during operations, a move that Afghanistan says will aid in the reduction of civilian casualties. Pelosi's trip comes during a resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and along the Afghan-Pakistan border and a rise in violence. On Friday, three coalition soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing in Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan. U.S. President Barack Obama asserts that the war in Afghanistan is the central front in the war on terror and has ordered the deployment of 17,000 more American troops to the country. About 38,000 U.S. troops are currently serving in Afghanistan. That number will increase to 55,000 once additional forces are deployed. Coalition forces from 41 other mostly NATO countries total about 31,500. The congressional delegation to Afghanistan met Friday with U.S. Forces at Camp Eggers in Kabul and were briefed by U.S. Ambassador William Wood, and U.S. and allied military commanders.","Taliban currently resurgent in Afghanistan and along the Afghan-Pakistan border .

"(CNN) -- With a father who is a toppled Communist leader and a mother accused of murder, the son, Bo Guagua, is now under scrutiny over reports of a lavish student lifestyle that have raised questions about where China's top cadres find their money. Photographs of him bare-chested with his arms around female students at an Oxford college party and urinating against a college fence have gone down badly in China, where his father, Bo Xilai, has been accused of corruption and stripped of his political post. Bo Xilai reacted furiously to questions about his 24-year-old son's lifestyle last month. ""A few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family,"" Bo said at the time. ""They even say that my son studies abroad and drives a red Ferrari. Sheer rubbish! I feel really furious. Sheer rubbish!"" Despite the denials, rumors over his son's allegedly flamboyant college lifestyle have added to the woes of the former Chongqing kingpin who promoted a revival of 'red culture' and pushed efforts to bring back Maoist slogans. While Bo family friends have defended Guagua's college record and behavior, one family associate told CNN there was little sympathy in China for what many regard as the typically spoilt offspring of the Communist Party elite. ""He (Bo Guagua) had tried to explain himself, saying the pictures showed him attending school parties which encouraged students to socialize and let their hair down,"" the source said. ""One picture showed him with an unbuttoned shirt and his arms around foreign students. He said it was quite normal there, but no one in China would buy that. Here 90% of people do not get the cultural differences."" The source added that the images had not played well in China, where Guagua's antics have been grist for the country's gossip-hungry microblogs. ""Many Chinese admire and support Bo Xilai, but few like Bo Guagua,"" the source said. What does Bo scandal mean for China? A fellow student at the Harvard Kennedy School -- where the cost for the average international student the school puts at $71,000 a year -- told CNN that Bo skirted attendance requirements at the college, making his first appearance at one seminar class on its final day when he was scheduled to make a presentation. ""Let me tell you how we've been going about this all year,"" the seminar's instructor said to Bo, explaining the class's protocols since he had not attended previous classes, the student recounted. ""He more than anyone else that I know really pushed it to the boundaries,"" the student said. ""Not attending seminars, not getting any feedback."" The student described Bo's presentation as ""slapdash and put together at the last moment."" The seminar's instructor declined to comment, citing student privacy policies. Bo was one of 21 students awarded a research grant from the school's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation for the current academic year. A school spokesman declined to say how many students competed for the grant which is awarded on ""the quality of the proposal, the research focus, and travel requirements."" Harvard Kennedy School spokesman Doug Gavel said he could not comment on specific students, citing privacy concerns.

"(EW.com) -- In ""Stand Up Guys,"" Al Pacino and Christopher Walken play second-rate Baltimore gangsters in their late 60s who make no bones about what grumpy old sociopaths they've become. Yet neither one is nearly as slow or creaky as the movie itself. Pacino, eyes burning with life beneath his electric thatch of hair, is Val, who has just gotten out of prison. Walken, whose own gravity-defying mane is practically a character of its own, is Val's old chum Doc, a guy with secret orders to rub out his pal before the next morning. The two sit around diners, cappuccino joints, and a cruddy apartment, talking about the bad old days. They go to a brothel and crack wise about threesomes and Viagra. Pacino, showing off any way he can, gets onto a dance floor, and Walken commands attention his own way, by staring off into space. 'World War Z' Super Bowl trailer: Watch . Directing his first dramatic feature, Fisher Stevens does his best to give these gravel-voiced legends room to strut their stuff. But that's the problem: The movie is too much of a wide-eyed, ramshackle homage to '70s-acting-class indulgence. It needed much more shape and snap. 'Idol': The Anthem of Zoanette Johnson . Still, when Alan Arkin joins the party as a dying colleague, his antics â€” at least once he gets behind the wheel of a stolen car â€” give the film a fuel injection.

"Washington (CNN) -- A long-haul bus plying the nation's highways can carry as many passengers as a domestic airline flight and a crash could be equally catastrophic. But key safety regulations and oversight for buses, especially for drivers behind the wheel of a coach with up to 80 people aboard, lag behind those for airlines and their pilots, according to a leading safety advocate and a trade group calling for action. The issue has crystallized in recent weeks around different incidents involving the grounding of the vaunted 787 Dreamliner produced by the world's largest aircraft maker and deadly crashes involving buses owned by obscure private companies. Although a battery fire aboard a Boeing Dreamliner in Boston and a related incident over the skies of Japan resulted in one minor injury, the case has received enormous public attention and robust investigative scrutiny over two continents. Over roughly the same timeframe, 17 people were killed and more than 80 others hurt in West Coast crashes of two tour buses. Those generated a few headlines and little, if any, public outcry. Federal and state authorities are investigating both incidents. The most recent crash east of Los Angeles last weekend killed eight people and attention has focused on the vehicle's brakes. A December 30 accident in Oregon that killed nine people has raised questions about tired drivers. The driver of that ill-fated bus had worked 92 hours in the seven days leading up to the crash -- far exceeding the allowable 70 hours, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the government agency that regulates bus safety. In both cases, regulators previously cited the private bus companies for violations and put them under increased surveillance. But the government let them continue operations. Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, highlighted gaps in bus safety with a comparison to more rigorous rules for airlines. ""You would never see hours-of-service violations in aviation,"" she said in reference to the potential fatigue issue in the Oregon bus accident. ""Pilots would not bust their hours, but (we) see it routinely on the highways."" Hersman said drivers are ""asked to carry loads to places that they can't possibly get to within their hours of service"" and ""people driving longer"" than they should and winding up tired behind the wheel. ""And so these are the same issues. We see them over and over again,"" Hersman said. ""We've got to have regulations with teeth and the penalties have got to be a deterrent."" Commercial aviation has remained remarkably safe over the past decade following a push to improve safety. The crash of a commuter jet near Buffalo that killed 50 people has been the lone major airline accident in the past four years. The rapidly growing motor coach industry, which carries about as many passengers as domestic airlines annually -- 700 million -- has experienced several fatal accidents in recent years, including notable crashes in New York and Virginia. The most recent federal government figures, in 2009, show roughly 300 people are killed annually in bus crashes, but the figures do not distinguish between mass transit and private motor coach accidents. The head of a motorcoach industry association concurs that the government needs to focus on industry standards, and crack down on companies that don't measure up. Private bus lines have grown rapidly in recent years. ""At the end of the day we think the regulators need to focus as much attention on motorcoach travel as they do on the airlines and they should focus more attention on motorcoaches than on a truck,"" said Peter Pantuso, president and chief executive of the American Bus Association. ""We want a safe industry, plain and simple. There's nothing that can or should trump safety in our opinion,"" the trade group chief said. ABA officials say responsible bus companies that uphold industry standards are being hurt by fly-by-night companies that violate those rules. Hersman said truck and bus inspections show rampant violation of federal safety rules. Approximately 20 percent of trucks and buses that are inspected are pulled out of service for mechanical issues, and 7 percent of drivers are pulled off the road because of hours-of-service, record-keeping or other issues, Hersman said. ""In the end we see companies that are not put out of service until after they have a fatal accident,"" she said. The motor carrier safety agency prohibited the Canada-based bus company, Mi Joo Tour & Travel, from operating in the United States following the Oregon accident. The agency, part of the Transportation Department, defended its practices. It said federal and state inspectors conduct more than 3.5 million truck and bus inspections across the United States each year. ""In any instance where the driver or the vehicle or both are found to be in serious violation of any federal safety regulation and thus pose an imminent hazard to public safety, the driver, the vehicle or both are immediately placed out-of-service by the inspector,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Even if a violation is not severe enough to place a company out of service immediately, companies are required to correct all violations for which they are cited, and minor violations can result in increased frequency of roadside inspections by state and local law enforcement,"" the statement added.","Concerns raised about gaps in airline and tour bus safety .

"(Wired) -- That's the argument John Timpane made in the Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday: that our hypermetabolic, Twitter-fueled media culture allowed the remarks from General McChrystal 's crew to spread so far and so fast, Obama had almost no choice but to relieve him. Think of it as information blitzkrieg. ""Fast, overwhelming, decisive: It's a case study in how tightly connected 21st-century media can whip a story into a full-on tsunami, with startling consequences for individual careers and national policy ... Noah Shachtman, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and a blogger at Wired magazine, says: 'The fact so many of us are networked together enabled the information to spread speed-of-light fast. That turned what might have been a slower-burning flame into an instant conflagration.' [Okay, okay. That sounds a little pretentious. But you get the idea -- ed.] How fast? The Rolling Stone article that started it all ... doesn't hits newsstands until today."" Obviously, the content of the story -- and the progress of the Afghan campaign, and the political environment back home -- mattered more than the speed of the news. The story tapped into a lot of latent anxiety and hostility about the war in Afghanistan that hadn't been given an outlet yet. Combine that with the 24-second news cycle, and ... Well, you see the results. Update: Stars and Stripes ace and Twitter fanatic Kevin Baron doesn't buy the Inquirer's argument. ""Every reporter in the Pentagon news room, and many beyond, had a copy of the Rolling Stone article by late Monday night. I had it about 6 p.m., which from what I read is before even Obama saw it, yes? Then at about 10 p.m. I got a copy of the McChrystal apology from ISAF which was even more stunning than the article for its total lack of a denial. So before most of Twitterdom went to bed not knowing anything of it, we were already doing reporting on it, and writing -- with a few posting it, obviously. Before I finished my morning joe (lowercase) I saw NBC news' Samantha Guthrie's Tweet that the WH had summoned McC to the flagpole, which hit every cable station about a millisecond later. THEN the story went viral,"" he e-mails Danger Room. ""I love Twitter, but it wasn't the golden goose this time."" Hendrik Hertzberg contends the troops' connectivity -- not just the civilians' -- played heavily into McChrystal's fall. ""Frontline troops nowadays are also online troops. They are plugged in to the Internet, to Facebook, to blogs, to e-mail and Skype. They talk to each other in chat rooms with little or no supervision from the brass. It's all instant and it's all in their face. And that, I hasten to add, is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. But it makes the morale of the troops that much more fragile, that much more apt to be affected by relative trivialities. The fact that General McChrystal, along with his 'Team America' posse of adjutants, understood none of this was reason enough to send him packing. His 'conduct' wasn't just a disservice to his President; it was a disservice to the men and women under his command."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- Alex Karras, the burly defensive lineman turned actor in the ABC sitcom ""Webster,"" died Wednesday surrounded by his family in their Los Angeles home following a hard-fought battle with kidney disease, heart disease, dementia and stomach cancer, according to a family spokesman. He was 77. ""Alex was known to family and friends as a gentle, loving, generous man who loved gardening and preparing Greek and Italian feasts,"" his family said in a written statement. The Gary, Indiana, native was an All-American at the University of Iowa who was thrust into professional football in 1958 with a first-round draft pick by the Detroit Lions, where he played until 1971. It was in Detroit where he helped the team's defensive line become one of several through the years to bear the nickname ""Fearsome Foursome,"" earning a reputation for his formidable presence on and off the line. But in 1963, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle suspended Karras and Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung for gambling on National Football League games, prompting the All-Pro tackle to try his hand at professional wrestling. SI: Karras helped revolutionize the NFL in the 1960s . The following year, after he returned to the gridiron, Karras reportedly refused to take part in a pregame coin toss. ""I'm sorry, sir,"" he quipped to the official. ""I'm not permitted to gamble."" But Hollywood was calling. And according to his family, he ""had always dreamed of being an actor"" and got a boost when Lucille Ball ""took him under her wing and allowed him to train in small parts."" After various appearances on television shows, Karras landed breakout movie roles, including spots in ""Porky's"" and ""Victor Victoria."" He also played ""Mongo"" in the Mel Brooks 1974 satirical western ""Blazing Saddles,"" slugging a horse and uttering the memorable phrase, ""Mongo only pawn in game of life."" He later joined the long-running television show ""Webster,"" where he played George Papadapolis, the guardian of the newly orphaned Webster, played by actor Emmanuel Lewis. Karras also co-wrote autobiographies called ""Even Big Guys Cry"" and ""Alex Karras by Alex Karras,"" and sat in the broadcast booth along with Howard Cosell and Frank Gifford during ""Monday Night Football"" broadcasts. ""While his legacy reached far beyond the gridiron, we always will fondly remember Alex as one of our own and also as one of the best to ever wear the Honolulu Blue and Silver,"" Lions President Tom Lewand said. In April, Karras -- who had been battling dementia -- joined more than 3,000 other former NFL players who are suing the league for not better protecting them from head injuries. The players, who say they suffer from a variety of debilitating and potentially life-threatening concussion-related injuries, got a high-profile boost when the former Lion joined their ranks. His family said he also was a strong supporter of the environment. ""His love of nature and most especially of the ocean, where he spent many happy days on his fishing boat, led him to support numerous organizations committed to protecting our environment for future generations,"" his family said. ""In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to one of the organizations Alex Karras ardently supported: Natural Resources Defense Council, Bioneers, Greenpeace Foundation or the Pesticide Action Network."" Memorial services are being planned and will be announced soon, his family said. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"Fort Mill, South Carolina (CNN) -- Standing amid pallets of bottled water, suntan lotion and boxes of candies, Roy Tidwell says he is providing a service that can't be duplicated: shipping needed goods to dozens of charities at a low cost. ""Well, my portion of it is getting goods to help people who are suffering, goods that I can deliver for pennies on the dollar,"" he said. ""And most places that get them are very appreciative."" Tidwell runs Charity Services International, which he says has 50 clients, all charities, including the Disabled Veterans National Foundation and SPCA International. His business is in the middle of a debate over how charities put a monetary value on the items they donate. In one instance, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, using Tidwell's organization as a broker, shipped what it claimed were more than $800,000 worth of goods including chef's coats, hats and football pants to a small charity called U.S. Vets in Prescott, Arizona, in 2009. But a U.S. Vets spokesman told CNN the total value of the goods was a fraction of that amount. U.S. Vets officials also told CNN that they neither asked for nor wanted the shipment and that it arrived without their knowledge. Tidwell insisted U.S. Vets knew in advance exactly what was in the shipment. Last year, the veteran's foundation -- again using Charity Services International as a broker -- sent what it claimed was more than $500,000 worth of goods to a Veterans Administration facility in Little Rock, Arkansas. Miles Brown, a spokesman for the VA in Little Rock, questioned whether the donations were worth that much. He said the donations, sent in two shipments, consisted of hand sanitizer bottles, bottled water and tote bags. ""At no time did we provide (Disabled Veterans National Foundation) with any documentation regarding the 'fair market value' (or) our assessed value of the donations,"" he wrote. The foundation is under congressional investigation to determine whether it deserves its tax-exempt status after doling out millions of dollars to a direct-mail company. There's an even bigger opportunity to overvalue donations provided to other countries. That's because of the different market values of items from one country to another, particularly when one of the countries is impoverished. ""If a product can be purchased at one level and the charity, for whatever reason, or the intermediary raises the value significantly, then one can say there's a potential for overstatement of value,"" said Luke Hingson, president of Brother's Brother, a Pittsburgh-based charity that ships donated goods worldwide. Hingson says he believes some charities are purposely overinflating much of what they distribute to help their bottom line. ""They can declare a lower overhead cost (and) they can claim that they are more effective to the public than their real numbers might indicate,"" Hingson said. SPCA International - also a client of Tidwell's Charity Services International -- claimed it sent $816,000 worth of de-worming and antibiotic medicines to an elephant charity in Nepal. But the customs declaration for the shipment, obtained by CNN, showed that its total stated value was $2,500. Little of charity's money going to help animals . While agreeing that the difference in the price of the medicines is ""outrageous,"" Tidwell explained that the value of the shipment varies depending on the ""exit market."" ""It would be what you would have to pay for it in the place that it's exiting,"" Tidwell explained. ""And that fact that they might ... be able to purchase similar medicines made in a back room in Nepal for a far lower price doesn't change the value of the medicines that are U.S. produced."" SPCA International told CNN it follows ""industry standards and accounting regulations"" in placing values on donated goods. De-worming medication has proven very tricky for many nonprofits because they say there is no uniform standard for determining their fair market value. Operation Blessing International, a charity run by Pat Robertson and the Christian Broadcasting Network, decided to stop including the value of anti-parasite medications in its donations ""until industry standards for the recognition and valuation of these medications become clearer,"" the charity said in its most recent IRS tax filing. But CharityWatch president Daniel Borochoff says determining the worth of gifts-in-kind donations is simple: Charities should report what they paid for the items. ""Rather than wasting ten thousand dollars to purchase 'market data' in order to come up with inflated valuations of pharmaceuticals, charities need to value the drugs that they purchase at the price they paid for them,"" Borochoff wrote. Last year, CharityWatch spotlighted the issue of how and why many charities overvalue their non-cash donations, or gifts-in-kind, in an article titled ""The Alice in Wonderland World of Charity Valuation."" That article called out charities that ""place high values on GIK (gifts-in-kind) donations"" in order to ""falsely appear to be spending a higher percentage of their funds on programs than other groups that receive mostly cash contributions."" On top of that, many times these charities ""do not buy drugs but actually receive them as a donation"" and then ""wildly overstate their value,"" Borochoff notes. And then, Borochoff said, charities are allowed to ""hide ... what specific drugs they claim to be distributing and at what price they value them."" That, he said, is the heart of the problem. ""Until charities start disclosing this information, the public and media should rightfully continue to doubt the reported values of in-kind goods,"" he said. And it's not just a few errant charities. The issue of overvaluing donations is ""industry-wide,"" Borochoff told CNN. He said the executives of different nonprofits actually work together to determine how certain gifts-in-kind should be valued. ""They conspire and say, 'Oh let's value it this way ... we'll come up with this rationale' ... and then they'll say it's an industry standard,"" he explained. But Borochoff said things are starting to change now that the IRS is becoming more aware of the problem. Why do charities purposefully overvalue their donations? Pretty much because everyone else is doing it, Borochoff said. He compared the situation to sitting in the audience at a baseball game or concert. When one person stands up and blocks your view, you have to stand up, and then the person behind you stands up. ""It's all gotten so out of hand because in order to compete you need to exaggerate,"" he said. ""They have to exaggerate their revenues so they look good... 'Hey we're in the philanthropy 1000 or on the Forbes list... like somehow bigger is better... which it's not if the numbers are exaggerated."" Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Operation Blessing International made the decision to stop including the value of anti-parasite medications in its donations ""as the IRS investigated its finances."" CNN's reporting was inaccurate, since no IRS investigation was launched. CNN regrets the error.

"(CNN) -- Unseeded Italian Roberta Vinci prolonged the best week of her career to date by dumping No. 7 seed Samantha Stosur out of the Dubai Tennis Championships to take her place in the last four. But her second scalp of the week has set up an uncomfortable semifinal, against best friend Sara Errani, who also happens to be the doubles partner she's claimed three grand slam titles alongside. Having disposed of Angelique Kerber in the third round on Wednesday, Vinci was in solid form again as she took just an hour and 18 minutes to beat her Australian opponent 6-2 6-4. Errani, the No.5 seed Sara, disposed of Russia's Nadia Petrova 6-4 0-6 6-3 to set up a clash that will bring forward mixed emotions for both players. ""It will be different mentally because I know her, she's like a sister for me and we play doubles together all the time,"" Errani told the Tour's official website. ""Normally she's with me on my side of the net and not on the other one, so to see her on the other side is tough because one of us will lose. ""She's an amazing person outside the court. Outside the court she will always try to help you when she can. She's like a sister to me. We stay together maybe 300 days a year. Of course we have had a lot of good moments together. ""I will have to think about it as just another tennis match, and not that it's against her. I just have to go on the court and do my best. The good thing is one of us will be in the finals here."" Elsewhere, Agnieszka Radwanska, the No. 3 seed from Poland, was knocked out by Petra Kvitova who grabbed her first win over a top five player since the 2011 season. Czech Kvitova hit 37 winners compared to Radwanska's six and will now face Caroline Wozniacki in the semis. The Dane edged a grueling match with Marion Bartoli, of France, to win 4-6 6-1 6-4. ""It was disappointing to lose that first set after I had been up; I'm happy I turned it around,"" Wozniacki said. ""In the third set I was down 2-0 and it could have been 3-0, and all of a sudden it wasn't looking good, but I kept fighting and every game was close, and I'm happy I ended up winning it.""

"(CNN) -- In a place that does not exist -- a black site -- Maya (Jessica Chastain) watches as her colleague Dan (Jason Clarke) interrogates an Arab prisoner. ""If you lie to me, I hurt you,"" Dan says to the prisoner, who is bound, bruised, and not telling the Americans what they need to know. Soon, the prisoner will be held down on the floor with a cloth over his face and will have water poured into his mouth until he is half-drowned. This is waterboarding, and it leaves the prisoner gasping like a dying fish. But he does not give up his secrets, and will not until later in the game. We can imagine this scene played out in different ways. Imagine it, for example, with Eastern European heavies playing the interrogators and Scarlett Johansson as the prisoner. Or we could see it with Kiefer Sutherland demanding answers in ""24."" Scenes of torture are not rare in TV and movies, and it's not like the old days when the hero was always on the receiving end. Yet even before ""Zero Dark Thirty"" opened, these scenes have stirred controversy, with outspoken critiques accusing director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") of endorsing torture. And although controversy is nothing new to the director of ""Strange Days"" and ""Near Dark,"" these complaints seem off base. Bigelow has never shied away from violence or the vicarious pleasure of sadism, but that's not the same thing as condoning it. Look at how she filters the torture scenes through Maya's reactions: Maya is clearly out of place and uncomfortable with what she must witness, though she will also participate in it. Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden? The movie -- which is utterly gripping -- is an authoritative, precise, largely dispassionate account of how a CIA analyst in Pakistan worked for a decade tracking down Osama bin Laden. That work involved torture in the years immediately following 9/11, as a matter of historical record. Bigelow throws us in at the deep end, and rightly so. The scenes are painful to watch (but also impossible not to), and the intelligence gleaned is at best partial. Whether partial intelligence is better than none is an open question, but it's also evident in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" that it wasn't torture that eventually led us to bin Laden, but clear thinking, sophisticated surveillance and the determination and resources to follow every lead. Bigelow has rarely focused on women as active protagonists (""Blue Steel"" is the most notable exception), but it is significant that Maya is a woman in a predominantly masculine world, compelled to renounce her sexuality to get the job done. Maya's resolve, smarts and conviction that borders on obsessive make her a fascinating and impressive character, and Chastain delivers one of the must-see performances of the year. Bergen: A feminist film epic and the real women of the CIA . Bigelow keeps the focus on process -- in a way it's like a police procedural or a detective story, but played out in foreign lands and interspersed with eruptions of violence and bomb blasts. The climax -- the SEALs raid -- is nail-biting stuff, even though we know the outcome, with exceptionally vivid nighttime photography by Greig Fraser. What's striking is the absence of triumphalism -- Bigelow doesn't shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim, dark episode in our history, a rite of passage almost, but a passage into an unknowable future, leaving scars that may never heal.","The film follows how a CIA analyst worked for a decade tracking down Osama bin Laden .

"New York (CNN) -- A 60-foot-long finback whale that washed ashore in the Breezy Point neighborhood of Queens and that was determined dead Thursday morning will be buried in the sand dunes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whale could not be moved on Thursday because the National Park equipment that would ordinarily be used was ""destroyed by Hurricane Sandy,"" said NOAA spokeswoman Allison McHale. The plan now is to transport the carcass on Friday with the joint effort of the National Park Service and New York City Sanitation. Both agencies have reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers, which has the type of heavy equipment that needed, according to McHale. The National Park Service has agreed to let the whale be buried on the beach where it is currently located, up in the sand dunes where the high water line will prevent erosion, McHale said. ""The necropsy will then be conducted either tomorrow or Saturday,"" McHale said, ""depending on when the whale is moved."" The whale was first discovered Wednesday morning on a beach in Breezy Point, a community still reeling from Superstorm Sandy, and biologists had been closely monitoring the status of the whale since its discovery. ""What we will do next is determine where the animal will remain, if we are able to bury it on the beach, or if it will need to be moved,"" Rob Digiovanni, executive director and senior biologist for the Riverhead Foundation, a Long Island-based marine research and preservation group, said earlier Thursday. ""That would be a discussion we need to have when we get there. Our plan is to do a necropsy on the beach to find out why it died."" Disposal of the carcass remained a challenge. ""In the past they (have) been buried on the beach, disposed of in a landfill, or towed out to sea,"" said McHale. Late Wednesday, the whale was still alive but it was ""emaciated and in poor physical condition so there is nothing that can be done to save the whale,"" she said then. ""We thought it was dead when we arrived, but then it started moving,"" Nick Ecock of Point Breeze Volunteer Fire Department said Wednesday.","NEW: The 60-foot-long finback whale was determined by experts to be dead .

"(CNN) -- Preliminary lab results show two oil samples taken on the Louisiana coast are from BP's 2010 Gulf spill, state officials said Thursday. The oil was discovered on Elmer's Island, said spokeswoman Olivia Watkins of the state Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. ""There are additional samples in the testing pipeline. However, the proximity of these other oil mats is very close to those that tested positive for BP oil,"" she told CNN in an e-mail. Samples also are being taken at other locations on the coast, according to Watkins. In the wake of Hurricane Isaac, state officials reported tar balls and a large oil mat along the Gulf shore south of New Orleans. It's not clear whether the hurricane swept tar balls ashore or exposed them under the sand, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Colclough said. The U.S. Coast Guard reported finding three oiled birds in the area on Monday. BP said Wednesday it was heading to the coast to test whether tar balls and oil are from the 2010 spill. BP spokesman Ray Melick said the area is one where BP teams were already helping with cleanup from the 2010 spill before Isaac arrived. ""There's a lot of oil out there that may not be ours,"" Melick said. The coastal protection authority is coordinating with other state agencies to test the contents. The area is near Fourchon Beach and Grand Isle. The same area was heavily affected by the spill, which happened in April 2010 after an explosion aboard the Transocean Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. BP had contracted the rig, which had 126 workers on it, 11 of whom are presumed dead.

"London (CNN) -- Three men were found guilty of plotting a terror attack they hoped would be bigger than the July 7, 2005, bombings that rocked London, UK prosecutors said Thursday. Ashik Ali, Ifran Khalid and Ifran Naseer, all from Birmingham, England, were convicted at Woolwich Crown Court on 12 counts of committing acts in preparation for a terrorist attack. The three men planned to set off up to eight backpack bombs in crowded areas, and had traveled to a terror training camp in Pakistan for expert training and preparation, the court heard during a 14-week trial. ""Had they not been stopped, the consequences would have been catastrophic,"" said Karen Jones, a specialist counter-terrorism prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service. ""These men had dangerous aspirations."" While their precise targets remained unclear, ""the potential for damage and loss of life from their plot should not be underestimated,"" Jones added. ""The evidence we put to the court showed the defendants discussing with awe and admiration the attacks of 9/11 and 7/7. These terrorists wanted to do something bigger, speaking of how 7/7 had 'gone a bit wrong.'"" West Midlands Police said Naseer, 31, talked of ""spilling so much blood you'll have nightmares for the rest of your lives."" The three men posed as bogus charity collectors within their local community to raise money to fund their plans, the police statement said. Naseer was also found guilty of helping four younger men travel to the terror training camp after he, Khalid and Ali, both 27, returned from Pakistan, it said. ""The link to training camps demonstrates the international dimension of the threat we continue to face,"" said West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale. ""The numbers involved in terrorism are small but the potential impact they could have if successful is huge."" The men are due to be sentenced later this year. The judge told them all to expect life sentences with substantial minimum terms, the police statement said. The July 7, 2005 bombings in London, which targeted buses and the subway, killed 52 people and injured more than 700.

"(CNN) -- She's the latest teen prodigy to emerge from golf's conveyor belt and if she keeps producing stellar performances like this 15-year-old Lydia Ko may well shelve her plans to stay an amateur. The Kiwi stormed to the top of the leaderboard at the Australian Women's Open in Canberra with a ten-under-par round of 63 that included 11 birdies, one eagle and, astonishingly, three bogeys. Ko's round meant she eclipsed her playing partners, world No. 1 Yani Tseng and American Michelle Wie, another player who grabbed worldwide attention when she qualified for the Women's U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship aged just 10. The teenager, who was born in South Korea, won her third professional tournament last week in her native New Zealand and leads by a shot in Canberra from Colombian Mariajo Uribe. And despite giving notice of her intentions, even if she were to win the Â£1.2 million tournament, she won't be able to claim any prize money as she still is still an amateur. ""After my bogey on my first hole, which was the 10th, I thought 'what's today going to be like?' But after a couple of birdies, I started to feel pretty comfortable,"" she told the tournament's official website. Ko needed just 30 shots to complete her front nine holes and her illustrious playing partners thought she could be on course for a record-breaking round of 59. But Ko played down that it was on her mind during her round: ""I've played good before and gone triple, par bogey or whatever. I didn't really think about what I was going to shoot. It was one shot at a time.'' Her performance certainly made a lasting impression on her partners. ""Playing with Lydia, five-under (par) is like nothing,"" said Tseng, from Taiwan. ""She still looks like 15. I don't know how she hits the ball that well. I'm not even close to her at 15. ""She is only 15 but she looks like a pro, so I mean I treat her like a pro, but I treat her like a child, too. I feel I'm getting old,"" the 24-year-old added. Ko might now shelve plans to go to college and hone her game there in favor of turning professional. Her coach and mentor Guy Wilson hinted at the prospect after her victory at the New Zealand Open. He told Fairfax Media: ""Realistically she's probably going to look to turn pro next year, only because the opportunities now are pretty obvious. Wasting two years at college could be a disadvantage,"" The Australian Women's Open has a purse of $1.2 million but as an amateur, Ko won't be able to share in the spoils even if she ends up winning. But she does look set to improve on her official world ranking of 30. Ko's tally of ten-under is the lowest score ever recorded at the Women's Australian Open, trumping Karrie Webb's nine-under 64 in Melbourne 13 years ago. But due to preferred lies being in operation, where a player can clean and place their ball as long as it is on the fairway, due to several parts of the course being wet from over watering, Ko's 63 will not go into the record books.","Fifteen-year-old Lydia Ko fires an opening round of 63 to lead Australian Women's Open .

"(CNN) -- Here's what CNN readers are saying on health stories from the past week: . 'It's horrible what they've had to endure' Our weekend piece on Rafi Kopelan's struggle with a rare disease called epidermolysis bullosa, or EB, and her neighbors' social media-driven efforts to help raise money for a cure, got nearly 400 comments. Some discussed efforts by the government and others to help find cures for disease; others recounted their health struggles or those of people they know. ""I can't say how happy I am to see this on the CNN front page,"" commenter RumMonkeyMama wrote. ""I have a good friend whose husband and son both have EB. It's horrible what they've had to endure. Every small milestone is such a huge accomplishment. My friend's son is 5, and only started walking last year. It brought tears to my eyes when she posted a video of him running not long ago. It's been such a long struggle, and one with no foreseeable end. I'm happy to see this on the CNN front page, because more people will become aware of EB, which will hopefully drive more (research and development) money into finding treatments or a cure!"" 'If you're just working out and not altering your diet, it's an uphill battle' The story on Brittni Garcia, who dropped 107 pounds after realizing her ""fat shorts"" no longer fit her during her college years, also garnered nearly 400 comments, many of them expressing support for Garcia and sharing similar weight loss struggles. ""Congrats to Brittni,"" wrote commenter focusmm. ""I firmly believe in taking personal accountability for your health. I lost 65 pounds and went from a size 18W to a size 6 last year, cut my body fat in half, lowered my visceral fat from 11 to 4 and got my cholesterol totally in control. But my focus was more on the eating aspects and adopting a new way of eating for life. I work out, but I think it is an 80/20 rule, where 80% is all about what you eat. I now teach weight loss classes online to pay it forward for the health and renewed energy I have."" Responding to focusmm, commenter Guneun wrote, ""The best description I've heard is 'You lose ounces in the gym, but you lose pounds in the kitchen.' If you're just working out and not altering your diet, it's an uphill battle. Do both and you can shed weight in no time."" 'Nothing in medicine is absolute' A story on the flu vaccine being less effective, especially for the elderly, than previously stated sparked a debate on vaccines in general. ""The military forces this on the troops (firsthand experience),"" wrote commenter tinytall. ""Each year that I got this silly 'vaccination' while serving, I got the flu. Since separating (1999), I've never gotten the flu, including this year. Huh, go figure."" In response, commenter DrDougFC wrote in part, ""That doesn't mean the vaccine doesn't work, it just means that nothing in medicine is absolute. I know someone who didn't smoke, yet got lung cancer, and a couple people who wore their seat belt, yet still died in a car crash. That doesn't mean that I should take up smoking or stop wearing my seat belt. Like the flu vaccine, not smoking and wearing a seat belt improve my odds, but aren't guarantees."" 'We have more failures by far than successes' A story on a new breast cancer drug receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration triggered a discussion on the role of the FDA in safeguarding public health and on drug prices. ""You have no idea how much it costs to bring a drug to market,"" commenter rs1201 pointed out. ""As a senior research scientist working in the R&D division of a major pharmaceutical company, I can tell you that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to come up with a drug. We have more failures by far than successes. To succeed, the company hires the best of the best scientists and has to pay them accordingly. To retain these scientists, the company does everything it can and that costs them dearly. It takes approximately 20 years from inception of the idea of a drug to FDA approval. There's no guarantee of approval. Pricing on a drug is a way to recoup a bit of all the millions that it took to get the drug to the FDA.""","A story on 5-year-old Rafi Kopelan got nearly 400 comments .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI is considering changing the Vatican constitution to allow a vote for his successor to begin before March 15, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Wednesday. Benedict, 85, shocked the world last week when he announced his intention to stand down effective February 28, citing the frailty of old age. Existing rules say the Roman Catholic Church's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from 15 to 20 days after the papal throne becomes vacant. With Benedict's resignation due to start February 28, the cardinals' conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than March 15. But Lombardi has said that because Benedict was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death, the Vatican would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed.","Existing rules say vote for replacement should begin 15 to 20 days after papal vacancy .

"(CNN) -- President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, needed a baby-sitter. It was April 18, 1864, and the Lincolns had planned to go to a fair in Baltimore, returning the next day. They needed someone to watch their 11-year-old son, Tad. A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else. The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection, a dealer in historical documents, valued at $15,000. It's not long -- just one line -- but the signed letter is in the first lady's hand. ""Hon. Mr. Harrington, We would like to have the services of Charles from today, at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M. Very Resp. Mrs. Lincoln."" ""Charles"" was Charles Forbes, a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president's valet, footman, messenger or attendant, according to the Raab Collection. George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes' boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns. ""Children in the White House have always held a great fascination with the American people,"" said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection. ""It shows the president and first lady at their most personal, their most human."" Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event, likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night, the final White House reception of the season, Raab says. Forbes' close family relationship soured a year later when President Lincoln was assassinated. Forbes was seated outside the president's box at Ford's Theatre and was the one who allowed the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, to enter. Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says. Mary Todd Lincoln ended up blaming Forbes for her husband's death. ""Lincoln,"" a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture.

"Cairo (CNN) -- A former Egyptian interior minister and his aides ordered the killings of anti-government protesters in the days before Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, according to testimony from an Egyptian security official, an attorney told CNN on Thursday. The allegation comes during the trial of Mubarak, now adjourned till Sunday. The former Egyptian leader is charged with ordering the killing of protesters to quash the uprising in February that ultimately ended his 30-year rule. In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Maj. Esam Shawky, who works in the administrative department in charge of anti-riot security forces, testified Thursday that Habib el-Adly and his aides ordered the killings and gave the order to cut Internet services on January 28 amid the unrest, lawyer Khaled Abou Bakr said. Bakr, who is attending the trial, is suing Mubarak on behalf of a victim who was shot and injured during protests. He said Shawky also told the court that he instructed the country's general prosecutor to save voice recordings between el-Adly and his assistants before they were destroyed. The assertions were based on a January 27 meeting between el-Adly and his aides. Mubarak, asked by the judge if he had any reaction, had no comment. El-Adly disputed the testimony and said minutes of the meeting show discussions revolved around containing the protests, not dispersing them. Another witness, Gen. Hussein Abdel Hamid, attended the meeting and testified that he objected to el-Adly's orders of arming the security forces and implementing a plan to ""handle the protesters at any cost."" Hamid said he was transferred to the Cairo security headquarters to take a course on ""the art of dispersing protesters."" Earlier this week, clashes erupted outside the courtroom between security forces and families of those killed in this year's uprisings. But Thursday, there were only a handful of victims' families and no sign of Mubarak supporters. Top Egyptian figures will be testifying next week behind closed doors in the trial. The prosecutor general banned media from reporting testimony that may emerge from those sessions because of ""national security matters."" Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, is set to appear Sunday, and Gen. Sami Anan, Armed Forces chief of staff, will go before the court Monday. The former vice president and head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, is scheduled to testify Tuesday. Interior Minister Mansour Essawy will appear Wednesday, and his predecessor, Mahmoud Wagdy, is set to testify the following day. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 were wounded in the 18 days of uprising that toppled Mubarak, according to Amnesty International. Mubarak is the first leader toppled in this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was tried in absentia after he was deposed in January and fled to Saudi Arabia. The trial is expected to last at least six months to a year, according to Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor.","NEW: The trial against ousted leader Hosni Mubarak is adjourned till Sunday .

"(CNN) -- How do U.S. wireless carriers expect their investments in new 4G high-speed networks to pay off? This shift is about more than simply providing mobile data -- and it could even bring some long-overdue improvements to the humble telephone call. At the Open Mobile Summit conference last week in San Francisco, a panel of carrier executives and wireless industry experts discussed the revenue-generating opportunities of offering 4G service. This is a big concern for carriers, since their costly move to 3G networks a few years ago appears to have financially benefited other players in the mobile industry (such as Apple) more than the carriers themselves. There are some obvious ways that carriers plan to make money from their 4G networks. First, these networks will allow wireless carriers to sell more data -- a key part of their business model as most U.S. carriers move away from offering unlimited data plans. Also, current FCC net neutrality rules allow wireless carriers to selectively ""fast track"" delivery of online content and services. Most likely content and service providers, rather than consumers, would end up paying for such paid prioritization. Still, despite heavy marketing, 4G phones and services haven't been easy to sell to the average mobile consumer. As Scott Devitt, a consumer Internet analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted: ""For most consumers, the value of 4G is not really clear at this point -- except for watching mobile video."" Consequently U.S. carriers are starting to look hard at less-obvious ways to demonstrate the value of 4G to consumers. ""The phone call hasn't been significantly improved or enhanced since the introduction of touch tone dialing,"" observed Rob Glaser, a partner with the venture capital firm Accel Partners."" 4G is already allowing people to do great things with their phones -- but most people still spend about 47% of their time on their cell phones making regular phone calls."" Sprint CTO Stephen Bye said, ""It is important to not lose sight of what customers see as important. Despite how much carriers are focusing on 4G data speed, most customers measure network success based on voice-call quality."" Improving the audio quality and clarity of voice calls is one reason why some U.S. carriers are working to implement ""voice over LTE"" (VoLTE) technology. Earlier this year Verizon announced plans to start selling VoLTE-enabled phones in early 2012. Earlier, Verizon director of ecosystem development Brian Higgins told CNN that ""high-definition audio fidelity will be a major selling point"" for Verizon -- implying that the carrier might be hoping to sell VoLTE as some kind of premium service, at least initially. That's another way to make extra money from a 4G network. The discount carrier MetroPCS may be moving faster than Verizon toward deploying VoLTE for its customers. Already, MetroPCS has begun migrating text and multimedia messaging traffic to its LTE network. (Traditionally, SMS/MMS messaging is handled over the same base carrier network as voice calls.) But Connected Planet notes that MetroPCS has less wireless spectrum access than Verizon. Also, MetroPCS never rolled out 3G technology as extensively as the major carriers. So, since 4G and VoLTE could help MetroPCS squeeze more mileage from its existing spectrum, this could mean that MetroPCS might offer these as basic -- not premium -- services. That would make for interesting competition in the consumer mobile market -- especially since MetroPCS focuses on the no-contract mobile market. If VoLTE calling becomes commonplace, it could change how people pay for cell phone service. If most mobile voice calls happen over data networks, then carriers may stop selling ""minutes"" altogether and shift to charging solely for data packages. But initially, as carriers first start marketing ""high definition calling,"" they may face some consumer pushback due to perceived value. Consumers who get VoLTE phones and service might not always experience clearer phone calls, since only calls placed between VoLTE-enabled phones are expected to sound better. Calls between a VoLTE-enabled phone and a regular cell phone are expected to sound the same. As the recent backpedaling by major banks on proposed debit card fees indicates, right now corporations are wary of consumer revolts against mounting bills. Right now wireless carriers generally bill customers for service for each mobile device they use (with the exception of cell phone ""family plans""). But these days, consumers also use tablets, gaming consoles and other devices over carrier networks. If consumers revolt against the cumulative sticker shock of multiple monthly bills for connectivity, carriers may begin to move away from device-specific billing -- which includes tethering charges. There is one more way that wireless carriers can make money from 4G: selling data about consumers. David Small, CTO for Verizon Wireless, raised the point that 4G will allow users to do even more with their cell phones and other wireless devices -- which means carriers will be gathering more consumer data than ever before via their networks. ""All that data, about all the facets of users' lives -- that's got value,"" Small said. ""And that's a revenue opportunity for us."" Sprint CTO Bye agreed, but cautiously: ""We know there's a fine line between monetization and trust for our customers. We think consumer data would be more useful in the aggregate, for machine-to-machine interfaces, without bringing it down to a particular person."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Cellphone carriers are trying to earn more revenue from offering 4G networks .

"(CNN) -- Smaller tablet computers that are significantly more affordable and portable than the iPad are finally starting to hit the United States -- and they could hit a crucial sweet spot in the consumer market. Recently Kobo announced the new Kobo Vox, which costs $200. That's the same price as Amazon's recently announced Kindle Fire. The Kobo Vox starts shipping Friday, while the Kindle Fire won't start shipping until November 15. The Barnes & Noble Nook Color, which costs about $250, is already available in stores and online. Although marketed mainly as e-book readers, all three of these consumer devices are actually small tablet computers (7 inches) that run the Android mobile operating system and use Wi-Fi -- no carrier data plan or contract required. So theoretically, they can do much more than just let you buy and read e-books. This makes them potentially powerful tools for people who want access to the Web, apps and more -- especially people who face economic or other barriers to using smartphones or computers. Small, inexpensive, easy-to-use tablets could become an important bridge to help people cross the digital divide and gain expanded access to education, jobs, community, and other resources. The grand vision of tablet computers is that, ideally, they'll allow the average, non-geeky person to do most of what can be done with a laptop computer -- in a way that's much easier to learn, use and carry around. Certainly this is the case with Apple's iPad, which sold 11 million units in the last quarter alone. But at this point, iPads start at $500 -- about what you might pay for a brand new 32-inch flat-screen TV at Best Buy, and twice or more what PC netbooks cost at most retail stores. From the perspective of typical consumers, especially given the current economy, that's a significant luxury investment. This month there are fresh rumors that Apple may be planning to introduce a smaller and less costly ""iPad mini."" But nothing is confirmed, so don't hold your breath. The tablet market is growing fast, and its dynamics are shifting quickly. According to a new report from Strategy Analytics, in the last year Android tablets grew from 2% of the global tablet market to 27%. Meanwhile, the iPad's global tablet market share has dropped from 96% to 67%. That doesn't reflect a decrease in the iPad's popularity, but rather that consumer demand for tablets is not one-size-fits-all. In fact, size is a key issue for people shopping for tablets. The iPad measures roughly 7-by-10 inches -- too big for a typical pocket or purse, and nearly twice the size of the basic Kobo Vox, Nook Color and Kindle Fire models. Digital devices that aren't as easy to carry around tend to mainly get used only at certain times of day, in certain settings. For this reason it's questionable how ""mobile"" larger tablets like the iPad really are. Aside from the Vox, Fire, and Nook Color, there are lots of other small Android tablets available. But so far these products have faced various challenges in the consumer market: . Cost: The Wi-Fi-only version of Samsung's 7-inch Galaxy Tab costs about $350, which is on the pricier side. The carrier-branded versions cost much less to buy up front if you agree to a two-year contract. For instance, Verizon currently sells the 7-inch Galaxy Tab for just $200, but data plans cost $30-$80 per month, and there's a $350 early termination fee. Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, is selling a small Android tablet by Arnova for just $99-$129 in a small pilot program -- but for that bargain-basement price you have to agree to a one- or two-year newspaper subscription, costing up to $13 per month. Device quality: This is an issue for the cheapest tablets. For instance, one reviewer noted that the touchscreen performance on the Philly.com tablet is less than stellar. In contrast, the Nook Color has been getting generally favorable reviews for device quality. The advance Kindle Fire reviews are also mostly positive. Android's learning curve: This can be an obstacle for some. The straightforward Android experience that comes with tablets by Samsung, Motorola, Lenovo, and other manufacturers can be daunting to typical consumers -- especially the majority of U.S. consumers who don't yet own a smartphone. A more constrained but dependable out-of-the-box user experience can be simpler to learn and can make the average consumer happier, at least initially. Gadgets that are more complex or open-ended tend to confuse or frustrate average consumers -- which generally isn't good for sales. Despite the high relative cost of Apple devices, and the fairly closed nature of the Apple ecosystem, there's a lot to be said for ""It just works."" However, most ""pure"" Android tablets do offer one key advantage over constrained e-reader tablets: direct access to Google's Android Market, where there's a virtually unlimited choice of apps. The Fire, Nook Color, and Philly.com tablets only offer apps through their own markets, not the Android Market, which means they can block the installation of competing apps, such those from other e-book vendors or publishers. Also, even though Kobo touts that its Vox will offer access to ""over 15,000 apps,"" the company has not clarified whether that will be through the Android Market or its own app store. Which means it's possible that you may not be able to install the Kindle e-reader app on the Kobo Vox -- at least, not without ""rooting"" the tablet to remove vendor controls, which can be a formidable technical hurdle. The coming year -- especially the 2011 holiday season -- will probably indicate whether smaller tablets will play a leading role in the U.S. digital media landscape. If these devices start becoming as commonplace as iPhones and Kindles, they may become popular and powerful tools for the delivery of mobile services for health, education, jobs, and more. Sure, you can use a small, cheap tablet to read books, watch YouTube, and play ""Angry Birds."" But maybe someday lots of people will be using these devices to get a college degree -- or perhaps to learn to read in the first place. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Tablets let people do what can be done on a laptop in an easier way .

"(CNN) -- Romania insisted Wednesday there was no evidence it had hosted secret CIA prisons as part of the United States' ""global war on terror"" after September 11, 2001. The country ""has no information whatsoever showing that there existed secret CIA detention centers on its territory,"" the Foreign Ministry told CNN. Two investigations also failed to find any evidence that the CIA used Romanian airports for ""rendition,"" the process in which detainees in American custody are transported for questioning to other countries where prohibitions on torture are not as strict and American laws don't apply. The Romanian denial comes in response to a plea from the human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe that countries that have hosted secret CIA prisons come clean. Thomas Hammarberg said Romania, Poland and Lithuania were among at least seven countries that hosted ""black sites"" for ""enhanced interrogation"" during the ""war on terror."" ""Darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on European territories,"" he said. ""The full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of co-operation will never be repeated."" CIA officials have acknowledged the rendition program, but refused to discuss details and denied violating any laws. Efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in U.S. courts have been turned aside. Hammarberg said the CIA had held ""high-value detainees,"" including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Poland between 2002 and 2003. The Polish site closed and a new secret prison opened in Romania in 2003, Hammarberg charged, and existed for more than two years. Lithuania also hosted two sites, he said. Polish prosecutors and Lithuanian lawmakers have investigated the phenomenon, but Romania has shown ""little genuine will to uncover the whole truth,"" Hammarberg charged. ""Effective investigations are imperative and long overdue,"" he said. Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would not comment while prosecutors in the country are still investigating. Lithuania has not responded to CNN questions about the issue. Hammarberg's statement comes as documents seized from Moammar Gadhafi's compound in Libya shed light on the program of extraordinary rendition. CNN saw a March 6, 2004, CIA letter to Libyan officials about Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a former jihadist with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and now a senior commander in the anti-Gadhafi forces. It concerned the Malaysian government's arrest of Abdullah al-Sadiq, Belhaj's nom de guerre for his rendition. A CIA officer said the man and his pregnant wife were being placed on a commercial flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to London via Bangkok and then on to Libya. ""We are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in Bangkok and place them on our aircraft for a flight to your country,"" the officer wrote. Belhaj fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, but left after their fall in 2001 and was arrested in Malaysia in 2004. After some questioning by the CIA, he was sent back to Libya and jailed. The Council of Europe is a 47-member group that promotes democracy and human rights on the continent.

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- A three-judge Aruban panel on Wednesday denied American Gary Giordano's appeal of a ruling keeping him behind bars for another 60 days as authorities investigate the disappearance of his American traveling companion, his attorney said. Attorney Michael Lopez said Giordano was sad and disappointed with the ruling. Giordano is being detained improperly, he said, and his rights are being violated. Giordano left the hearing with a shirt covering his head. On Tuesday, authorities on the Caribbean island questioned Giordano for an eighth time in connection with the disappearance of Robyn Gardner. Gardner, 35, was last seen on August 2 near Baby Beach on the western tip of the island. Three days later, police took Giordano, 50, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, into custody. Last week, an Aruban magistrate ruled that Giordano should be held for another 60 days while the investigation continues. The magistrate's brief order did not elaborate on the decision beyond saying the suspect, identified by his initials of G.V.G., was ""suspected of involvement in the possible drowning of the American woman,"" and that the custody extension ""was done on request of the Prosecutor's Office."" Gardner has not been found; search efforts are ongoing. The missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States, according to Aruban prosecutors. Giordano told authorities he was snorkeling with Gardner and signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said. According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. ""I only looked back when I hit a rock,"" the document quotes Giordano as telling investigators. ""Before that, I did not look back. I was only busy saving my life."" Giordano has told authorities that he is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to Gardner, a local official told CNN.

"(CNN) -- ""Real photographers don't take photographs, they make photographs,"" says Eileen Ramsay, who is widely regarded as one of the world's great yachting photographers. The feisty 96-year-old Brit should know. A pioneer in her field, she is credited with being the first yachting photographer to shun the safety of the tripod and compose her pictures while dangling off the side of a boat -- all in quest for the ultimate action shot. ""Other photographers would stand in the middle of their boats taking pictures of big yachts with plate cameras, so I developed my own style -- taking my pictures as close to the water as possible,"" recalls Ramsay. Water-level photography, now an industry standard, quickly became her signature shot, but it was neither easy nor cheap. While adamant that she never dropped one of her German-made Rollerflex cameras overboard, the saltwater took its toll on her equipment nonetheless. ""I used to make sure I shielded the camera under my buttoned-up anorak, but the saltwater would still get to it. Even though I cleaned them after each session, they would quickly get stiff because of all the salt,"" says Ramsay, whose career has been immortalized in a new book by fellow photo-journalist and Brit Barry Pickthall. Read related: $16m solar boat sails into record books . It has taken Pickthall over a year to complete the glossy hard-back book, regally titled ""Eileen Ramsay: Queen of Yachting"". ""It only took so long because Eileeen was so prolific. She kept immaculate records of her work and she remembers every photograph she's ever taken, which meant that she would immediately pick up on things if I didn't get it right,"" says Pickthall, a former yachting correspondent who now runs a photo agency that specializes in nautical photography. Drawn to picture-taking from a young age, Ramsay began her professional career in 1937 as a 22-year-old receptionist at a photography studio outside London. But as war clouds gathered across Europe and the call to arms began, the owner of the studio discovered that his personal services would be required to record the impending conflict, so he gave each of his staff a camera and told them to go out and take some ""interesting"" photographs. The one to come back with the best pictures would take over the studio in his absence during the war. ""I didn't know anything about cameras then, but my pictures were judged the best and I got the job,"" says Ramsay, who spent the war years honing her skills in portrait photography by taking pictures of soldiers and their girlfriends. After the war she decided to go at it alone and set up her own studio in London, taking on any commissions that came her way from magazines and newspapers. In 1953, she and her boyfriend decided to move closer to the ocean, and after purchasing a 28 foot (8.5 meter) ex-Royal Air Force boat that they moored at the end of their garden, she set out to make her mark in the nautical world. Sailing enjoyed a post-war explosion in Britain, and it was during the 1950s and 60s that Ramsay's yachting photography career really took off. It's this period that Pickthall has tried to capture in his book. More from Mainsail: When superyacht chic meets hybrid technology . ""I feel it's very important to save Eileen's archive. Her early pictures of our sailing pioneers have great significance when recording Britain's sailing history,"" says Pickthall, adding that grown men were ""moved to tears"" at the sight of her original photos, which he brought to a boat exhibition last year. ""All these people were gobsmacked, they couldn't believe these photos existed. They kept spotting themselves as children as they flicked through her albums,"" says Pickthall. As for Ramsay, she is not fazed by her new moniker as the ""Queen of Yachting"". ""I knew I was original back then,"" she says bluntly, before adding: ""You know, when you are 96 years of age, nothing can really faze you.""","Eileeen Ramsey began her professional career as a 22-year-old in 1937 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's doctor Tuesday heard dramatic opening statements and a startling recording of the pop singer, his words slow and slurred as he talks about his planned comeback concerts. Prosecutors portrayed Dr. Conrad Murray as motivated by money, while the defense contended Murray's superstar client self-administered a fatal mix of drugs. Witnesses gave varying accounts of Jackson's condition as he prepared for the shows in London. Murray abandoned ""all principles of medical care"" in attending to Jackson, prosecutor David Walgren said in his opening statement. Defense attorney Ed Chernoff countered, saying Jackson's death was ""tragic, but the evidence will not show that Dr. Murray did it."" Murray acquired massive quantities of the powerful surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep, giving him a final dose of the drug after a long, restless night when the singer begged for help sleeping, according to recordings played by prosecutors. Murray gave in to Jackson's demands not because it was the right medical decision, but because he was motivated by a $150,000 a month contract to serve as Jackson's doctor, Walgren said. ""The evidence in this case will show that Michael Jackson trusted his life to the medical skills of Conrad Murray, unequivocally that that misplaced trust had far too high a price to pay,"" Walgren said. ""That misplaced trust in the hands of Conrad Murray cost Michael Jackson his life."" Jackson fans create bizarre scene outside courthouse . Jurors heard a May 10, 2009, recording, captured by Murray's iPhone, of Jackson ""highly under the influences of unknown agents,"" as he talked about his planned comeback concert, according to Walgren. ""We have to be phenomenal,"" Jackson said in a low voice, his speech slurred. ""When people leave this show, when people leave my show, I want them to say, 'I've never seen nothing like this in my life. Go. Go. I've never seen nothing like this. Go. It's amazing. He's the greatest entertainer in the world.' I'm taking that money, a million children, children's hospital, the biggest in the world, Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital."" The tape, prosecutors say, is evidence that Murray knew about Jackson's health problems weeks before his death. Jurors also saw a video of the superstar rehearsing at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the night before he died. Jackson sang and danced to ""Earth Song,"" the last song he would rehearse on stage. Prosecutors also presented a photo of Jackson's lifeless body on a hospital gurney, about 12 hours later. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray, who wiped away tears during his lawyer's opening statement, could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license. Chernoff blamed Jackson's death on drugs that he said Murray had neither given to Jackson nor known about. Scientific evidence will show that, on the morning Jackson died, he swallowed a sedative without his doctor's knowledge, ""enough to put six of you to sleep and he did this when Dr. Murray was not around,"" Chernoff said. Jackson, desperate for sleep, then ingested a dose of propofol on his own, creating ""a perfect storm that killed him instantly,"" Chernoff said. ""When Dr. Murray came into the room and found Michael Jackson, there was no CPR, no paramedic, no machine that was going to revive Michael Jackson,"" he said. ""He died so rapidly, so instantly that he didn't have time to close his eyes,"" Chernoff said. Chernoff told jurors that Murray was trying to wean Jackson off propofol when Jackson died. Jackson was addicted to Demerol, prescribed by another doctor, and his insomnia was at least in part related to that, according to Chernoff. Jackson's inability to sleep on the morning he died was ""one of the insidious effects"" of Demerol addiction withdrawal, Chernoff said. Since Murray did not know about the Demerol, he could not understand why Jackson was unable to fall asleep that morning, Chernoff said. Jackson told Murray a day before he died that he needed to fall asleep in order to be able to rehearse for upcoming concerts, Chernoff said. ""I have to sleep, I have to get some sleep. They will cancel my rehearsals. I will lose that performance,"" Chernoff quoted Jackson as saying. Chernoff said Tuesday that he will challenge prosecution assertions that greed factored into Murray's treatment of Jackson. ""If the prosecution is going to tell you he is greedy, callous and reckless, you need to hear the full story,"" he told jurors, adding that Jackson was the only celebrity Murray had ever met. Jackson died June 25, 2009. ""Just make me sleep. It doesn't matter what time I get up,"" Murray quoted Jackson as telling him, according to a recording of a police interview played in court. He agreed to administer the drug and Jackson fell asleep. After he left to go to the bathroom, he discovered Jackson was no longer breathing. Walgren argued Murray was not a specialist with anesthetics and misused the drug, which he said can suppress proper function of the heart and lungs. ""It is not a sleep aid, it is not a sleep agent,"" Walgren told jurors. ""It is a general anesthetic."" Between April 6, 2009, and the time of Michael Jackson's death, Murray ordered enough propofol to give Jackson 1,937 milligrams a day, Walgren said. Murray told police he gave the entertainer doses of propofol virtually every night for two months, according to a recording played in court. Murray also used a cheap instrument to monitor oxygen levels in Jackson's blood, Walgren said. The device was ""utterly useless"" unless Murray constantly monitored it because it lacked an alarm that would go off if Jackson was not getting enough oxygen into his lungs, Walgren said. Murray ""repeatedly acted with gross negligence, repeatedly denied care, appropriate care, to his patient, Michael Jackson, and it was Dr. Murray's repeated incompetent and unskilled acts that led to Michael Jackson's death,"" Walgren told jurors. Prosecutors contend that Murray used a makeshift intravenous drip to administer propofol, a practice they argue violated the standard of care and led to the pop star's death. But Chernoff said Murray did not use a makeshift intravenous drip to administer the drug. Chernoff added that an expert on propofol will testify that Murray was not responsible for Jackson's death. Murray never told emergency responders or emergency room doctors trying to save Jackson's life that the musician had been dosed with the propofol, Walgren said. Producer Kenny Ortega, the first prosecution witness, said he was jolted by Michael Jackson's appearance when the latter arrived at a rehearsal, on June 19, less than a week before he died. ""He appeared lost and a little incoherent,"" said Ortega. ""I did not feel he was well."" Ortega said he gave the pop singer food and wrapped him in a blanket to ward off chill. Jackson watched the rehearsal and did not participate. Ortega was helping Jackson prepare for the ""This Is It"" world tour scheduled for London's O2 Arena in autumn 2009. In an e-mail written early June 20, Ortega wrote, in part, to AEG president Randy Phillips, ""My concern is, now that we've brought the Doctor in to the fold and have played the tough love, now or never card, is that the Artist may be unable to rise to the occasion due to real emotional stuff. He appeared quite week and fatigued this evening. He had a terrible case of the chills, was trembling, rambling and obsessing. Everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated. If we have any chance at all to get him back in the light. It's going to take a strong Therapist to (get) him through this as well as immediate physical nurturing. ... Tonight I was feeding him, wrapping him in blankets to warm his chills, massaging his feet to calm him and calling his doctor. ""I believe that he really wants this ... it would shatter him, break his heart if we pulled the plug,"" Ortega wrote. ""He's terribly frightened it's all going to go away. He asked me repeatedly tonight if I was going to leave him. He was practically begging for my confidence. It broke my heart. He was like a lost boy. There still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if get him the help he needs."" AEG was the concert promoter. Murray was unhappy that Jackson did not rehearse and told Ortega not to try to be the singer's physician, Ortega testified, adding Jackson insisted the next day he was capable of doing the rehearsals. Jackson was a full rehearsal participant in the days before he died, the producer said. AEG executive Paul Gongaware testified that after the 50 London shows sold out instantly, there were still 250,000 buyers wanting tickets. Gongaware said he negotiated with Murray, at Jackson's request, to work as the singer's personal doctor. Murray initially asked for $5 million a year, explaining that he would have to close four clinics and lay off employees. Gongaware rejected that deal, but later offered him $150,000 a month, an amount recommended by Jackson. The physician agreed. Both Gongaware and Ortega testified that Jackson on many occasions appeared fully engaged and excited about the impending concerts. The trial has attracted widespread attention. On Tuesday, a woman rushed toward Murray as he was walking to the courtroom, but she was stopped by three deputies guarding him. The woman said she just wanted to talk to Murray. Jackson's parents, brothers Tito, Jermaine and Randy, and sisters La Toya, Janet and Rebe filled a row in the courtroom for opening statements and the first witness Tuesday. Jackson's three children are not expected to attend the trial or testify, according to a source close to their grandmother, Katherine Jackson.

"(CNN) -- In an almost unbearably predictable recurrence of conflict between Israel and the Hamas-led Gaza, the two find themselves once again squaring off for another round in the never-ending vicious cycle of violence. Nearly four years after the deadly ""Cast Lead"" operation, Israel's military has embarked on a new operation, this time codenamed ""Pillar of Cloud,"" killing the most senior military Hamas commander and escalating pre-existing hostilities. The hundreds of rockets that have been fired from Gaza at Israel following the assassination and Israeli air and artillery attacks come as no surprise: It is all too familiar. However, this round of violence is taking place in a very different Middle East to the one in which both sides clashed on a similar scale at the end of 2008. From Tunisia and Libya to Egypt and Syria, civil uprisings and revolutions have rapidly changed the political and social landscape of the region. These changes, together with the ever-present Iran and Hamas's improving military capabilities, are creating new realities which also affect the environment in which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is conducted. The border between Gaza and Israel is never entirely peaceful, always on the verge of full-blown war. Trouble regularly flares as result of tit-for-tat attacks which spiral out of control, or because of military and political considerations. Like ""Cast Lead,"" this operation is taking place just a few weeks after Israeli elections were declared -- they will be held in January next year. Soon after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement, Israel allegedly bombed a military arms factory in Khartoum, Sudan, which supplied arms to the Hamas in Gaza. Notwithstanding the constant provocation of rockets fired on Israeli towns and villages by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, the proximity of Israel's attack to their impending elections doesn't seem to be a coincidence. There is almost a long standing political tradition by Israeli governments to avert attention from their social and economic failures. Launching a military campaign against an obvious, albeit not innocent, enemy will bring short term military and potential electoral success. However, it will only exacerbate the situation. Ahmed Ja'abari was long a marked man, considering his involvement in hundreds of deadly attacks on Israel. Nevertheless, he had also shown pragmatism in the protection of, and deal to release, the kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. According to Gerhson Baskin, an Israeli peace activist who was involved in the negotiations to release Shalit, Ja'abari was very seriously considering a permanent ceasefire with Israel. Bearing in mind his prominence within the organisation, this might have led to a significant and critical change in relations between these two sworn enemies. In the past, Israeli heavy-handedness with Hamas was met with either half-hearted protestations or even tacit approval from the Arab World. It remains to be seen if there will be a different reaction this time, and what the long term impact on relations between Israel and the newly shaped region will be. Secular regimes are quickly being replaced by Islamist parties which have both mandates and legitimacy, having been elected in free and fair elections. These governments' immediate instinct is sympathy, not only with the people of Gaza, but also with the Hamas government, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement which currently holds the presidency in Egypt. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi wasted no time, immediately recalling his country's ambassador to Israel to Cairo and vowing to stand by the people of Gaza ""until we stop the aggression."" On Friday, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil called on the world to stop Israeli ""aggression,"" describing Israel's actions as a disaster. Both countries have a strategic interest not to let the situation in Gaza endanger the peace treaty which was signed more than 30 years ago, even if the Muslim Brotherhood has always been critical of it. It is also an opportunity for Egypt to show its leadership and broker a ceasefire -- doing so would enhance the country's international credibility in the post-Mubarak era. Elsewhere, the Qatari foreign minister called the events in Gaza a ""filthy crime"" which should not go unpunished. This is strong language from one of Israel's less critical neighbours in the region. It is conceivable that events unfolding in Syria will bring more religious elements into government when, more likely than if, the Assad regime falls. This, coupled with ongoing disquiet in Jordan, makes Israel's position in the region seem more precarious than it has been for a long time. The current show of force by Israel may be aimed at sending a clear message to its neighbors that its policy of using its military might whenever it deems necessary hasn't changed, especially amid growing concerns that the civil war in Syria is gradually spilling over into the occupied Golan Heights. Moreover, Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Ehud Barak signal that despite elevating the containment of Iranian nuclear programme to the top of their priority list, they won't neglect strategic challenges closer to home. Israel's policy of the uncompromising use of force may prove counterproductive, both military and politically. No one questions the right of Israeli citizens to live free of rocket attacks from Gaza, yet time and again it has proven that the army can provide a very limited solution. Militarily, the first few days of hostilities have proved that the Iron Dome interception system is only partially successful, and Hamas rockets can reach as far as Tel Aviv and its neighboring cities, exposing Israel's vulnerability. However, even more alarming is the lack of political wisdom in learning from the past that the use of excessive force only leads to further radicalization of Palestinian society, a future of increasing bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians, and the deterioration of relations with the Arab world. This is increasingly so as a result of the Arab Spring. The answer to Israeli security challenges lies around the negotiation table. Unfortunately, the current government in Israel has no political plan that can bring about peace, and believes its ability to regain power at the next elections relies on a show of military force instead of diplomatic efforts and a genuine peace process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yossi Mekelberg.","Israel-Gaza conflict nothing new, but current violence is taking place in a very different Middle East .

"(CNN) -- An Omani yacht has made history by becoming the first Arabic yacht to cross the Atlantic Ocean during the KRYS Ocean Race. The competition, which features some of the world's fastest multihull yachts, started in New York City on July 7 and finished in the French maritime city of Brest less than a week later where they were greeted by hundreds of spectators attending the Les Tonnerres de Brest Festival. The crew of the 70 feet trimaran ""Musandam-Oman Sail"" managed to take the lead early on in the race and held their position at the front of the fleet for the first 24 hours, before being struck by bad luck. One of the boat's foils - the wing-like structure that lifts the hull up out of the water and increases its speed -- snapped off, and for the remainder of the race the yacht could only sail at 70% of its normal performance capacity. Despite this setback the crew managed to reach speeds up to 39 knots and finished the race in fourth place -- crossing the Atlantic in an impressive 5 days, 7 hours, 5 minutes and 38 seconds. See also: Is Middle East becoming international sailing capital . ""It was a real challenge to finish once we had lost the foil, our speed dropped so much so we knew we had to do something drastic to fix it,"" said Moshin Al Busaidi, the 37-year-old Omani sailor who shot to fame in 2009 when he became the first Arab to sail non-stop around the world in just 76 days. To stand a chance of finishing the race in a decent time the crew of the Omani yacht decided to try and move one of the working foils on the port side of the vessel to replace the broken one on the starboard side. Watch: Oman's princess of the sea . ""We gave ourselves one hour to try and fix the boat or we would have lost too much time, we didn't know if it would work but I am glad it did. We still don't know how the foil broke but it is swimming with the fishes now,"" he said. Al Busaidi, who had never sailed before joining the Sultan of Oman's Navy as young man, was joined aboard the ""Musandam-Oman Sail"" by his fellow 29-year-old countryman Fahad Al Hasni who has only been sailing for three years. Despite his limited experience, Al Hasni proved to be a very gifted helmsman. ""He made our MOD70 go demonstrably faster,"" said British record-breaking sailor Brian Thompson who was part of the boat's international crew. ""This was a major surprise for the rest of the crew. Fahad has only been sailing for three years but he has great control and the ability to concentrate for really long periods of time."" ""It was fantastic to discover this talent amongst us,"" added the British multihull legend, who in April was a member of the fastest crew to race around the world. Both Al Busaidi and Al Hasni are part of the ""Oman Sail"" project, which aims to encourage people across Omani society to take up the sport. In the past three years it has taught thousands of children how to sail and it is also helping to develop a women's squad in an effort to boost Oman's Olympic chances.

"(CNN) -- After conquering the race track, superstar colt Frankel is set to become one of the most sought-after gigolos on the planet -- and his rival's mum could be the perfect love match. In a plot reminiscent of a daytime soap opera, champion race horse Frankel would be an ideal mate to rival Black Caviar's mum, experts say. Frankel wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday with an unblemished 14-win record, while Australian mare Black Caviar also remains unbeaten in 22 races. The two highest-rated race horses in the world had been tipped to meet in the breeding sheds once six-year-old Black Caviar also retired. But the ""Brangelina"" of the racing world wouldn't necessarily produce champion bundles of joy. In fact, distance runner Frankel may be better suited to Black Caviar's mum -- 11-year-old Australian mare Helsinge. ""To be honest, Frankel and Black Caviar's bloodlines aren't ideally suited,"" Richard Andrews, of Racing Victoria in Australia, told CNN, when asked if the equine equivalent of Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie was on the cards. ""I would have their genetic make-up tested using the Equinome method -- this would ascertain if Frankel has any sprinting or middle distance genes in him. ""Otherwise a pure stayer to a pure sprinter could end up with a slow horse."" Black Caviar's co-owner Neil Warrett had hinted that Frankel may be a good match, telling Australian newspaper The Age: ""We would consider going to Frankel because he is clearly the best distance horse in the world."" But it seems Black Caviar's mother Helsinge may be better suited to the task. She has already proved herself to be a wonder mom, giving birth to successful racing horses Moshe and All Too Hard. Her recent foal, the half-sister to Black Caviar, sold for $2.6 million at auction in April. Four-year-old Frankel earned Saudi owner Prince Khalid Abdullah more than $4 million in prize money on the race track. But even greater returns await in his new life as a stud, with thoroughbred owners across the world sending in their mares' CV's in the hope of securing a date with arguably the greatest race horse of all time. The British horse is expected to start his new duties in February, commanding a fee of $160,000 each time he sires a foal. And with three to four mares falling under Frankel spell every day, the colt could notch up $16 million each year -- depending on his libido and fertility. Mating usually takes place in a special breeding shed, with handlers overseeing the union. The mare will have thick padding placed on her back and hind feet to guard against injury of the expensive thoroughbreds. Should he fail to rise to the occasion, Frankel may well return to the race course, as other champion thoroughbreds have done in the past. For now, Frankel will have a few weeks rest before he heads to pastures new -- at Banstead Manor Stud, Cheveley - part of the Juddmonte Farms breeding arm of Abdullah's racing operation. Frankel is quite the catch for equine cupids -- his father was 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo, while his mother Kind won six races during her career. ""As with most bluebloods, Frankel's colt would potentially be worth tens of millions of dollars,"" Andrews said. ""As a yearling (a race horse between one and two-years-old), it could be worth $3 million to $10 million -- depending on a potential bidding war between Ireland's Coolmore Stud Farm and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Darley Stud Farm."" There's no guaranteeing the quality of Frankel's offspring. But if his parents are anything to go by -- father Galileo had huge stamina, while mother Kind possessed speed -- older female Helisinge may prove to be a match made in heaven.","Champion race horse Frankel one of the world's most sought-after mates .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Asia's oldest hotel chain has waded into the debate on the slaughter of sharks for their fins by taking the Chinese delicacy off its menus. From January, diners won't be offered shark's fin products at the luxury Peninsula Hotels chain, due to a decision by its owners, the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels group. ""By removing shark fin from our menus, we hope that our decision can contribute to preserving the marine ecosystem for the world's future generations,"" the group's chief executive officer Clement Kwok announced in a brief press statement. Around 73 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year, taking one in three shark species to the brink of extinction. Their fins are hacked off at sea and the carcass discarded in the water in a practice referred to as ""finning."" Peninsula Hotels can be found in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Chicago, Beverley Hills, Tokyo, Bangkok and Manila. One is due to open in Paris in 2013. Shark's fin is only offered in its Asian restaurants, mostly on banquet menus for weddings and large business meetings. The group says its decision is not based on consultation with guests, but since last April the chain has been offering banquet clients an alternative menu, substituting shark's fin soup with another fish soup. The uptake has been ""quite good,"" according to group spokeswoman Irene Lau. However, she couldn't say whether the guests' decision was motivated by a desire to save the shark, or by the hotel's offer of one night's free accommodation if they took the second option. ""I think it's actually both,"" she said. Shark's fin is a popular dish among Chinese diners who appreciate its texture, if not its flavor, in soup. Once a delicacy favored by emperors, shark fin is often eaten at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple's extended families and friends. However, Lau says the hotel group has noticed a generational split between diners who want the specialty seafood and those prepared to do without. ""What we've found is that in recent years the younger generation, the couples who are getting married would prefer to steer away from shark's fin. But for their parents or in-laws would prefer to have the shark fin,"" Lau says. Hong Kong is a major hub for the global shark fin trade, handling at least 50% of the total haul, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Shark Specialist Group. Crusted, pointy fins can be seen in the windows of stores in the city's dried food sector. Most come from Europe, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, USA, Yemen, India, Japan and Mexico. Last year, World Wildlife Fund launched a campaign -- Alternative Shark-Free Menu -- to persuade Hong Kong restaurants and caterers to offer alternatives to shark's fin on their banquet menus. ""At first it was very difficult. They almost kicked us out when we went to meet them to explain the program,"" says Silvy Pun from the WWF. Just one year later, 97 caterers and hotels have signed up, with some going further and limiting their menus to sustainable seafood. Pun says the program's success, and the Peninsula's ban, indicates that a ""tipping point"" is being reached in the campaign against shark fin products. ""I'm quite confident that more and more restaurants will follow their lead. I'm quite optimistic because if such a prestige hotel chain can satisfy their consumers, I'm pretty sure that they see that the market is changing,"" Pun says.","Luxury hotel chain bans shark's find products .

"Washington (CNN) -- A big bird from the East is heading west, thanks to a second chance at life given by President Obama in the nation's capital Wednesday, a day before Americans sit down to Thanksgiving dinner. In a holiday tradition, the president pardoned the turkey at the White House, saving it from ending up as Thanksgiving dinner. This is the first turkey pardon for Obama. He appeared at the ceremony with his two daughters, Sasha and Malia. The president granted the pardon to a turkey from North Carolina named Courage. The North Carolina governor's office Web site says that after the ceremony, the turkey will fly west to Disneyland to participate in the 121st annual Rose Parade on New Year's Day. Obama thanked the National Turkey Federation for donating this year's turkeys, Courage and Carolina. Carolina is an alternate turkey who came along in case Courage was unable to fulfill his responsibilities. The president wished a happy Thanksgiving to the American people. ""When my family and I sit around the table tomorrow,"" he said, ""just like millions of other families across America, we'll take time to give our thanks for many blessings, but we'll also remember that this is the time when so many members of our American family are hurting."" ""There is no question this has been a tough year for America. We're at war, our economy is emerging from an extraordinary recession into recovery,"" Obama said. ""In more tranquil times, it's easy to notice our many blessings; it's even easier to take them for granted. But in times like these, they resonate a bit more powerfully,"" the president said. Later during the day, the president and his family will go to Martha's Table, an organization based in Washington that helps communities in need by donating food, clothing and offering other opportunities. There, they will donate two turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner. The poultry industry has given the White House a turkey each year since the presidency of Harry Truman, but the tradition of officially pardoning a turkey didn't begin until 1989, when George H.W. Bush took office and pardoned one. CNN's Paul Steinhauser and Jamie Crawford contributed to the report.","In a holiday tradition, president saves turkey from ending up as Thanksgiving dinner .

"(EW.com) -- Fox's ""New Girl"" returned on Tuesday, with Jessica Day (Zooey Deschanel) and Nick Miller (Jake Johnson) continuing to address the fallout of the Kiss Heard 'Round the Loft (and the Internet universe). Since all eyes have been on Johnson's character and his panic moonwalk lately, we caught up with the man himself to find out a little more about his musical tastes. (Hint: His co-star's band made the list.) Read on to see what's on Jake Johnson's iPod: . Bob Dylan, ""World Gone Wrong"" ""I'm going nuts for this these days. I got into Dylan when I was 15 at random, and every few months, I'll put a different Dylan on. And Dylan's the only musician for me that kind of sets a tone for how the world should be. You just get caught up in his view of Earth, and he's the only guy where I'm like, 'I think he's right. That weirdo's got it figured out.' I'm coming off of 'Blood on the Tracks' which is so great, but this is one of those albums I've never heard of. And I couldn't believe it. But 'World Gone Wrong' is early '90s, so I thought it was going to be terrible, but it is great Dylan. Because, you know, every once in a while Dylan would have an album where you're just like, pass. I'm not going down that road with you in the '80s, Bob. I'm not doing it! But this is awesome. It's becoming one of my all-time favorites."" 'Downton Abbey' casts actor? 'Not true' Mumford and Sons, ""After the Storm"" ""Olivia Wilde introduced it to me when we were shooting Drinking Buddies, which took place in a beer brewery, and we had to drink so much beer. And you know — as Nick Miller, I can't get too fat. I can get chubby, but no one's going to believe the Nick-Jess stuff if Nick weights 240 pounds. So I needed to exercise more, and when she put this album ['Sigh No More'] on, I just took to it right away. And it actually helped me jog — I would put that album to get fired up when I go running. Mumford and Sons: Will help fat boys get a little less chubby! In fact, my wife and I are actually about to go run up a mountain to it later today."" [Johnson spoke to EW from Hawaii, where he and his wife were on vacation.] . She & Him, ""Change Is Hard"" ""I think this song's one of the all-time greats. To be honest, when we first started doing the show, I didn't know Zooey's band at all. But I like knowing my cast members, so I started listening to it to get a feeling for who she was. And man, she's got an incredible voice. Now that I know who she is, and it's a year and some change later, that song's the one that still kind of makes [it] in the rotation it on a weekly basis."" JC Brooks and the Uptown Sound, ""Awake"" ""I know the lead guitarist, Bill Bungeroth. He's the director of Second City in Chicago. And actually, for my character on 'New Girl,' if you look at the posters, one of them is for this band. But JC Brooks, I got into them when I was in Chicago, and I got to see them live. It's such an unbelievable live show. It's one of those bands that's always on the road. They're kind of doing it old-school. They're not one of those Internet, free download bands. I'll text them asking where they are sometimes, and they'll be like, 'A small town in Maryland rocking out to 3 people!' And I'm like, you guys are doing what, when I was growing up, I thought that bands did. And they're a band that I never miss when they play in town. 'Awake' is from their original album — it's a little political. It's got a bite to it."" 'X-Men': Bryan Singer tweets new photo . Pass Kontrol, ""Twins"" ""They're a little group I saw when I was in Brooklyn a few years ago. They're just super weirdo, experimental, lots of fun, kind of newish sound. This song's from their first album, and it's just kind of awesome. I knew one of the members from years ago. We'd lost touch, and when I was in Brooklyn, and I got word from another friend that this band was performing at this place in Bushwick called the Bushwick Starr. And they put on the craziest show — in front of a packed house, too!"" Bob Seger, ""We've Got Tonight"" ""Bob Seger's the best. If this song doesn't do it for you, then you and I are from different planets. If this doesn't get you ready for life, love, and happiness — then I don't know who you are, Jack. Seger to me is another guy I have a poster of on Nick Miller's wall. Seger and Croce. Seger: very underrated. The Croce: very underrated as well, but I couldn't do both. I can't be that guy who picks both Seger and Croce. But those were the songs of my childhood, the sounds of driving in my mom's car, sitting in the back. Best childhood ever, man. Seger's just one of those great American rock guys that I just feel is underrated. For some reason, everyone's always talking about how Seger's not cool.

"Washington (CNN) -- White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs steps down from the post Friday, after two years as President Barack Obama's top spokesman. Jay Carney, the current communications director for Vice President Joe Biden, will succeed him at the podium. Gibbs announced his decision to leave in January. Gibbs called it a ""remarkable privilege"" to serve the president. But he said he wants to ""step back a little bit and recharge some"" after four years of campaigning and a hard-fought first half of the Obama administration -- ""probably the busiest years that Washington and the White House have seen in a couple of decades."" Gibbs said he will remain in the Washington area as a pundit, supporting White House positions on cable television and in speeches. ""It's a remarkable privilege. It is in many ways the opportunity of a lifetime,"" he told reporters at the White House briefing announcing his decision. But he added, ""We've been going at this pace for four years."" In a written statement, Obama hailed Gibbs as ""a close friend, one of my closest advisers and an effective advocate from the podium."" But he said it was ""natural"" for his longtime aide ""to want to step back, reflect and retool.""

"(CNN) -- You might think you're a big deal on Twitter. But unless you've got more than 20,000 followers there's a five-year-old horse out there tweeting you into a cyber hole. Their posts mostly involve eating carrots and racing, but that hasn't stopped champion thoroughbreds Frankel and Black Caviar amassing a legion of followers to rival most B-grade celebrities. The pair, along with Kentucky Derby and Preakness champ I'll Have Another, are some of the growing number of racing horses using Twitter to reach out to fans. Like any sports star, it's no longer enough to simply perform well on the turf. Today, the job of being a champ is an all-encompassing juggernaut of marketing, fanbase and legacy. Key is a presence on social media. And if it's good enough for our footballers, tennis players and athletes, then why not our winning horses? Marketing mare . Their reasons for setting up a Twitter account are overwhelmingly commercial. In short, Black Caviar's PR team did it so no one else would. ""Once we trademarked the name 'Black Caviar' we had to protect it and stop unauthorized use,"" marketing manager Stephen Silk told CNN. ""The brand 'Black Caviar' is one that's quality, stylish, feminine, fast, sleek. We wanted to stick to that brand. ""We also believed that this was a good way to communicate with a younger audience."" So there's a definite emphasis on self promotion in Black Caviar's feed, with the majority of tweets flagging up media appearances. And much like Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt urging followers to download the iPhone app named after him, race horses are also utilizing the marketing power of social media. The Royal Ascot winner recently promoted her own line of equipment: ""Win 1 of 10 Joseph Lyddy Black Caviar 9 piece Grooming Kits visit http://bit.ly/Oyt7WU."" Meanwhile Frankel urged fans to get behind him before racing at Goodwood on Wednesday: ""Thanks for all the tweets, as you can imagine I'm resting ready for tomorrow....10length victory tomorrow I can feel it..."" Tweet Lady . It's a platform that offers horses -- or at least their managers -- an interactive relationship with fans. When Racing Enterprises Limited set up an account for three-year-old bay filly Tweet Lady, it was in the hope of giving the public a unique insight into owning their own race horse. The British mare bills herself as ""The People's Horse,"" tweeting about everything from enjoying the sunshine to her rigorous training regime. Instead of the acronym LOL, the friendly filly ends her posts with NOL (nay out loud, for the uninitiated). ""It gives people a taster so they can experience what it's like to own a racehorse -- without forking out the money and paying for one,"" said Stephanie Jones, PR executive for Racing Enterprises Ltd, the commercial arm of the British Horseracing Authority. ""People follow her out of curiosity. It's an amusing way of bringing the horse to life."" Horsing around . So Tweet Lady isn't actually knocking her hooves against the keyboard for our reading pleasure, but according to social media expert Kate Bussman, that's half of the appeal. The author of ""A Twitter Year: 365 days in 140 characters"" points to the success of Sockamillion the cat and the Bronx Zoo cobra as irreverent animals endearing themselves to the cyber masses. Sockamillion, known simply as ""Jason Scott's cat,"" boasts almost 1.5 million followers. And all it took was posts like this: ""GAAHHH BLANKET roll roll roll LOVE YOU BLANKET snug snug snug GAH BLANKET roll roll roll RELATIONSHIP STATUS IT'S COMPLICATED."" As Bussman says: ""Twitter is a format that really does lend itself to humor. The whole point is to be pithy. ""It's just a funny way to kill a few minutes."" Paws for thought . With an estimated 6% of all pet dogs in the U.S. now boasting a Twitter account, who is behind their newfound digital prowess? ""We're seeing this parallel trend now of people setting up funny, jokey accounts,"" Bussman said. ""Twitter or Facebook are addictive and it's proven you get that endorphin buzz if people 'like' you or retweet you -- even if you're an anonymous celebrity."" Much like the cobra that went missing from Bronx Zoo last year, sometimes the simplest headline can spark a social media sensation. When a gray-and-white tabby wandered onto the Anfield pitch during an English Premier League match in February, it became an internet hit. The Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool match was brought to a standstill and the ""Anfield Cat"" quickly assumed its own Twitter account. ""Quite disappointed John Terry isn't able to take a penalty, this game has lacked comedy #meow,"" is one of the posts that has now attracted more than 75,000 followers. The brains behind the hugely popular cat are anonymous. But perhaps that's the perfect excuse to say things your human persona never could.","Racehorses increasingly taking to Twitter to reach out to fans .

"(CNN) -- A federal court on Monday sentenced a Somali man to 30 years in prison for acts related to high-seas piracy, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""Today marks the first sentencing in Norfolk for acts of piracy in more than 150 years,"" U.S. Attorney MacBride said in the statement. ""Piracy is a growing threat throughout the world, and today's sentence ... demonstrates that the United States will hold modern-day pirates accountable in U.S. courtrooms."" Jama Idle Ibrahim pleaded guilty in federal court in August, admitting he had intended to seize a U.S. merchant vessel on April 10 and hold it for ransom. Ibrahim and five other would-be pirates learned too late that they had instead pulled alongside a U.S. Naval vessel, the USS Ashland. They were captured after firing at those on board, according to the statement. The attack occurred in the Gulf of Aden between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Until this year, there had not been a piracy-related conviction in the United States since 1861, during the Civil War, officials said. In May, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, who was accused of leading the attack on the Maersk Alabama in April 2009, pleaded guilty to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage taking.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A police officer in Los Angeles who claimed he was shot while patrolling near a high school has now been arrested for making up the story, authorities said. Officer Jeff Stenroos of the Los Angeles Unified School District Police Department had said he was shot in the chest on January 19 in the west San Fernando Valley. He said the shooting happened when he got out of his squad car to check on a man peering into parked vehicles near the El Camino High School. The alleged shooting prompted an hours-long lockdown of several schools as police scoured the area looking for the shooter. In the following days, authorities released a sketch of the alleged gunman, and the reward for information grew to $100,000. But Thursday night, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Stenroos had been arrested on a felony count of filing a false police report. ""The current state of the investigation refutes Stenroos' initial account of the incident and we are now certain that there is no outstanding suspect in this shooting,"" he said in a statement. Beck said detectives followed up on more than 350 clues, carried out several neighborhood canvasses and distributed ""countless"" fliers seeking information. After the shooting, a Good Samaritan used Stenroos' radio to call for help and tended to him until medics arrived. The officer's protective vest had prevented the bullet from entering his body. Beck's statement Thursday night did not elaborate on how Stenroos may have acquired his wound. ""While I understand the media and the public's intense interest in this investigation, and the desire for answers to the many questions that will be asked with this new development of the officer's arrest, I cannot provide more detailed information at this time,"" he said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Georgia's Supreme Court halted Monday evening's scheduled execution of a convicted murderer on procedural grounds, but rejected a plea to spare him due to mental retardation. The unanimous ruling from the seven-member court gave a reprieve to 52-year-old Warren Lee Hill, who was condemned for bludgeoning a fellow inmate to death in 1990. He had been scheduled to die at 7 p.m. Monday. Justices said they would review whether prison officials needed public hearings before changing the drugs used in lethal injections from a mix of three to a single drug. Hill's lawyers also argue that the condemned convict should be spared because he has an IQ of 70. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 struck down the death penalty for convicts with mental retardation, but Georgia law says an inmate has to prove mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt, and a state court ruled earlier this month that Hill's lawyers had failed to do that. All justices except Robert Benham refused to review Hill's appeal of that case. ""I cannot join in any ruling by this court that would allow the execution of Warren Hill Jr., who has been found by a preponderance of the evidence to have a mental disability,"" Benham found. Hill was already serving a life term in the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend, Myra Sylvia Wright, when convicted of killing inmate Joseph Handspike. The state announced last week that it was replacing its use of a three-drug cocktail to put prisoners to death with a single drug, pentobarbital. Hill's lawyers argued the decision required public notice under the state's Administrative Procedure Act, a question the court halted proceedings to consider. CNN's Jamie Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Justices reject appeal of mental retardation claim .

"(CNN) -- Niger's constitution has been suspended, a Niger military official announced Thursday night on the nation's three television channels. The order, read by Col. Goukoye Abdul Karimou, was attributed to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy, which also suspended all institutions and called on the nation for calm and on the international community for support, said Ousman Tudou, a journalist for Radio Afini. Tudou said President Mamadou Tandja and his ministers were being held in a military camp. No curfew had been ordered and people were in the streets at 11 p.m., around the time of the announcement, he said. Dana Palade, a spokeswoman for the nongovernmental organization World Vision, told CNN from the capital city of Niamey that the official made the announcement on Doumial Tele Sahel and RTT. Palade said she heard gunfire in the streets. ""The sounds were quite frightening, but the streets are calm. The people are calm,"" she said, adding the atmosphere was ""not what you'd expect in a capital city where you have a coup d'état."" Earlier Thursday, the Niger Embassy in London, England, reported an ""ongoing attempted coup d'etat"" was taking place in Niger. ""Details remain sparse, but sporadic gunshots have continued to be heard in and around the presidential palace for some time,"" said a statement from the embassy. ""Reports reaching us suggest that both the president and the cabinet ministers who were with him at the time are safe and well."" Other media reports, however, said Tandja was missing. The French Embassy also reported hearing intermittent gunfire about 1 km (0.6 miles) from the palace. Resident and activist Laoual Sayabou told CNN the military surrounded the palace, where a ministerial meeting was taking place, about 1 p.m. The military entered the meeting and shots were fired, he said, citing sources in the presidential guard. ""Indications are, it could be an attempted coup,"" Assistant U.S. Secretary of State P.J. Crowley told reporters. ""There was evidently an attempt at assassination of President Tandja."" The U.S. Embassy was monitoring the situation, he said, and embassy staff were safe. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, is in Niger, he said, and was also safe at the embassy. Tensions have been rising in Niger recently. Tandja, who has been in office since December 1999, has recently been trying to force through a bid for a third term. ""This is a difficult situation,"" Crowley said. ""President Tandja has been trying to extend his mandate in office."" The United States has expressed concern about that, he said, and ""that may well have been ... an act on his behalf that precipitated the act today."" While the United States does not condone violence, ""clearly we think this underscores that Niger needs to move ahead with the elections and the formation of a new government."" Although Niger is one of the poorest countries in Africa, it has about 8 percent of the world's uranium, and has had some lucrative uranium contracts, particularly with China, CNN's Christian Purefoy said. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Speaking to nation via television, colonel announces suspension of all institutions .

"(CNN) -- Gaming in 2012 is going to be a very wild ride, with the introduction of two new consoles, a return to the ""Halo"" universe and the potential for even more entertainment choices. The PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Wii U are both expected to hit the shelves, with the Vita hitting North American and European shores in February after a Japanese launch in mid-December. The PS Vita is a handheld console and successor to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) that promises beefier graphics, interactive touchscreens on the front and back, and dual analog sticks much like the PlayStation 3 controllers. Sony is banking on familiar characters in games like ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" and ""Little Big Planet"" to help draw in customers, while also looking to create unique and immersive games to appeal to the hardcore gamer. More than 320,000 units have been sold in Japan since the Vita's December 16 release there, putting it on nearly even footing with early sales for Nintendo's 3-D handheld gaming device, the 3DS. But the Vita's numbers dropped dramatically in the second week to just over 70,000 and analysts are watching to see whether the device has staying power in the U.S. and Europe. The verdict on whether consumers want 3-D gaming still appears to be out. Nintendo announced Tuesday that its 3DS has sold 4 million units in the U.S. -- a solid but not spectacular number for a hugely hyped product. New consoles . Later in 2012, Nintendo will be releasing their next-generation console called Wii U. It is the first Nintendo console to feature souped-up 1080p high-definition graphics and will have a touchscreen embedded in the controller to allow for gaming when the TV is off or interaction between two screens. A prototype was shown last year during the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), and Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the final version will be revealed at E3 this June in Los Angeles. Critics are concerned about the potential cost, but Nintendo says it's confident the Wii U will open up a new style of gameplay for the home gamer in the same way that the Wii expanded the customer base for gaming consoles in general. There has also been speculation that a PlayStation 4 from Sony or new Xbox console from Microsoft could be released in 2012. In an interview with CNN Geek Out, Xplay host Morgan Webb said many developers are working on new franchises for a new generation of consoles. ""We're nearly at the end of a console cycle, so series that have begun at the beginning of the console cycle, they're starting to finish up the series,"" Webb said. ""People have made the investment in the franchise and they've got the art together and they don't want to create something completely new when new consoles are starting to be on the horizon."" Some developers have spoken openly about learning about technology for a new Sony console. And while there have been hints about a new Xbox console for a couple of years, Microsoft has been mum about any new hardware, focusing their efforts on the motion-based Kinect controller. Blockbuster games . Of course, all these new hardware devices won't mean a thing unless gamers have great games to play. There is a powerhouse line-up of major franchises and popular characters set to debut in 2012. ""Halo 4"" is sure to be the next blockbuster installment in an iconic franchise that has helped defined a generation of gaming.

Speaking of saving the universe, ""Mass Effect 3"" brings back Commander Shepard to resume his battles against the machine race of Reapers. The story is expected to flow directly from the ending of ""Mass Effect 2"" and will also offer a female version of Commander Shepard for the first time. Some old friends will be returning in ""Diablo III"" and ""Twisted Metal."" More than 10 years after ""Diablo II,"" players will get to battle the forces of evil with new destructible environments and classes to play. ""Twisted Metal"" returns from a 17-year hiatus for more combat on wheels action and over-the-top explosions.

Square Enix, developer of the game, is expecting a great launch for the rest of the world in 2012. Other titles, like ""Resident Evil Revelations,"" ""Max Payne 3,"" ""Borderlands 2"" and ""Grand Theft Auto V"" will also be must-play games in the upcoming year. Casual and mobile gaming . But as is becoming increasingly clear, gaming is not just for consoles, and consoles are not just for gaming. Smartphones and tablets are continuing their march into the gaming genre with more choices from Atari, Zynga, Electronic Arts and other well-known gaming developers on the way. As mobile devices become more powerful, social and casual gaming is expected to define a new and growing base of folks as ""gamers."" Some research shows that demographic is morphing into nearly an even split between males and females, as well as getting older and more affluent. Likewise, consoles are broadening their entertainment scope beyond just gaming, into live sporting events, movies and music. Hulu, Netflix and ESPN have already made inroads that other providers are sure to be exploring in the coming year. Look for that trend to continue as content producers look to capture audiences wherever they are. While 2011 was a big year in gaming, 2012 is projected to be even bigger. Communications market researcher TMNG expects the global gaming business to reach $40 billion in revenues by the end of 2012, with high growth in the mobile game sector. There are likely to be twists and unexpected developments along the way for the gaming industry in 2012. And, in the end, the gaming consumer will be the one who decides which technology or title goes on to glory and which goes in the discount bin.","Vita will hit North American, European shores in February after a Japanese launch .

"New York (CNN) -- Investigators and rescue teams will continue their search Friday for a missing 13-year-old Texas girl, focusing near a densely wooded area and along the Colorado River. Meanwhile, Hailey Dunn's mother, Billie Dunn, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she and her live-in boyfriend, Shawn Adkins, both failed polygraph exams. Adkins was the last person to see the eighth-grade cheerleader on December 27 at Dunn's home in Colorado City, according to local reports. Colorado City -- a rural central Texas town -- is about 70 miles west of Abilene. Hailey reportedly told Adkins she was going to visit her father and then a friend. Hailey's father, Clint Dunn, says she often came to his home but did not on that day. Dunn said she took the polygraph test after she was informed that Adkins had failed. Woodrow Tripp, a polygraph expert, told Nancy Grace that troubles him. ''That absolutely would cause major problems emotionally as she's administered one. You want to try to minimize that as much as possible,"" Tripp said. Dunn did not say who administered the exam, during which she says she was asked if she knew anything about or caused Hailey's disappearance and whether she feared any questions. The night Hailey vanished, Dunn says she thought her daughter was sleeping over at a friend's house. Asked why she did not confirm Hailey's location before going to bed that night, Dunn said, ''I just don't have an answer for that. I wish I would have called to tell her goodnight.'' Dunn says police questioned her for more than 10 hours on Wednesday. She met Adkins on the MySpace social networking site more than two years ago, and he moved in with her several months ago. Police initially considered Hailey a runaway, but the situation is now a missing person case. A Texas Amber Alert has not been issued, reportedly because no one saw Hailey being abducted. Hailey is 5-foot-2 and weighs 120 pounds. She has hazel eyes and brown hair with blond streaks. When she disappeared, she was wearing navy blue sweatpants, a light colored short sleeve T-shirt, and pink and white tennis shoes.","Hailey Dunn, a cheerleader, has been missing since December 27 .

"(CNN) -- Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who captured the drama of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with an ""SOS"" call to the nation, was indicted Friday on 21 federal corruption charges, including bribery, money laundering, fraud and filing false tax returns. Nagin allegedly defrauded the city through ""a bribery and kickback scheme"" in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city, the 25-page federal indictment says. As part of the alleged bribes, Nagin's family members received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City totaling $23,500; and cellular phone service, the indictment said. Nagin's family-owned granite-business Stone Age LLC allegedly benefited in the corruption, too, the indictment said. Nagin could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the indictment, the bribing businessmen allegedly received city contracts of $1 million for consulting, more than $3 million to build a project at Louis Armstrong International Airport, and $1 million for another airport project, the indictment said. Other contracts were for sidewalk repairs in the French Quarter and professional services, authorities allege. Among the conspiracy charges is an accusation that Nagin awarded ""no bid"" work to a city contractor who provided ""concealed and direct campaign monies"" to Nagin, the indictment says. Read the indictment . Nagin allegedly received bribes from city contractors in the amounts of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000 and $10,000, the indictment says. He also is accused of receiving a bribe in the form of granite inventory from a city construction contractor. Nagin faces nine counts of honest services wire fraud, alleging he received nine wire transfers amounting to $12,500 each that were bribes or kickback payoffs from the same city construction contractor in 2010 and 2011, the indictment says. Those bribed totaled $112,500. In his 2005 tax return -- the same year that Katrina hit the Gulf Coast -- Nagin allegedly filed a false tax return claiming his income was $156,278, the indictment says. He is also accused of filing false returns for 2006 listing his income at $170,364, for 2007 with an income of $31,163, and for 2008 with a $143,852 income, the indictment said. The indictment does not detail what the government claims the returns should state. In 2005, as Katrina became the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history, Nagin took center stage on behalf of victims when he excoriated the slow pace of federal and state relief efforts, even using profanities. Nagin, who is black, urged the reconstruction of a ""chocolate New Orleans,"" adding, ""You can't have New Orleans no other way."" He later apologized, saying everyone is welcome to the city. In issuing a national ""SOS"" during Katrina, Nagin expressed the desperation of a battered Gulf Coast: . ""I need reinforcements, I need troops, man. I need 500 buses, man. We ain't talking about -- you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here,"" he told radio station WWL-AM. ""I'm like, 'You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.' In 2010: Nagin -- One day New Orleanians will recognize my good work . ""That's -- they're thinking small, man. And this is a major, major, major deal. And I can't emphasize it enough, man. This is crazy,"" Nagin said then. The hurricane slammed the Gulf Coast in 2005 and killed 1,833 people, directly or indirectly, in five states. Damages totaled $108 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who won election in 2010 when term limits kept Nagin out of the race, said the charges mark ""a sad day for the city of New Orleans."" In the 2006 mayoral race, Nagin beat then Lt. Gov. Landrieu, scion of a prominent Louisiana political family. ""Today's indictment of former Mayor Ray Nagin alleges serious violations of the public's trust,"" Landrieu said in a prepared statement. ""Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated."" 2010: Nagin remarks on future public office -- 'I have given my pound of flesh' CNN's Zach Cumer and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Ray Nagin's family allegedly received Hawaii vacation, first-class Jamaica trip .

"Washington (CNN) -- Upcoming forced government spending cuts will heavily impact the Federal Aviation Administration, triggering flight delays nationwide and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Friday. ""Travelers should expect delays,"" LaHood told reporters in calling for fellow Republicans to work toward compromise to avert the worst impacts of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts set to take effect March 1. The full impact won't be felt until April as furloughs and other staffing reductions of air traffic controllers come into effect, said LaHood, who has announced his intention to step down from President Barack Obama's Cabinet. ""Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff,"" LaHood said. ""Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country."" In addition, control towers at smaller airports such as Boca Raton, Florida, and Joplin, Missouri, would be closed, he said. Asked why he was brought to the White House briefing room to address reporters, he said: ""I would describe my presence here with one word -- Republican."" ""They're hoping that maybe I can influence members of my own party"" to compromise with Obama and Democrats on an alternative to the mandatory spending cuts agreed to in a 2011 deal to increase the federal borrowing limit, LaHood said. LaHood is a former member of the House of Representatives from Illinois. In a letter to airline associations, the Defense Department and other ""aviation colleagues"" released on Friday, LaHood said plans under consideration to absorb the mandatory spending cuts included furloughs for most FAA workers, eliminating midnight shifts in 60 control towers and shutting down more than 100 towers at smaller airports. The FAA operates towers at more than 400 airports nationwide. The Homeland Security Department has separately warned of longer security lines at airports if budget cuts take effect, another potential headache for air travelers. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Most FAA workers will face furloughs, LaHood says .
