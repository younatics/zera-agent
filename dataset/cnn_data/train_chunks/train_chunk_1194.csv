"Brigitte Bardot yesterday threatened to follow actor Gerard Depardieu in taking Russian citizenship unless two elephants are reprieved from being put down. The Sixties sex symbol and animal rights campaigner is furious over plans to end the lives of Baby and Nepal, after both contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo. She said: ‘If the powers that be have the cowardice and the shamelessness to kill Baby and Nepal, I have decided to take Russian nationality and quit this country that is nothing more an animal cemetery.’ French sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, pictured left in her heyday in 1968, and right, in 2007, has threatened to leave the country and take Russia citizenship if two elephants, suffering from TB, are put down at Lyon Zoo . The 78-year-old star has also supported Depardieu, 64, in his row with the socialist French government over high taxes, saying he had been the ‘victim of extremely unfair persecution’. The Sixties’ sex symbol and veteran animal rights campaigner is furious over plans to end the lives of Baby and Nepal. Both contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo. He was this week granted Russian citizenship by leader Vladimir Putin who Bardot has previously dubbed 'my favourite prime minister'. The ex-KGB spy - now president and no longer premier - won Bardot’s admiration for his concern for animal welfare which critics say masks his contempt for human rights. City authorities said the elephants had to be put down after contracting tuberculosis . Bardot yesterday made clear she was . ready to follow Depardieu, 64, to Moscow due to her concern over the . fate of the elephants which are deemed a threat to the health of other . animals and visitors to the Tete d’Or zoo in Lyon. City . authorities ordered the elephants to be put down last month but a . petition organised by their original owner, circus master Gilbert . Edelstein, led to a temporary reprieve over Christmas. The star yesterday threatened to quit France unless the stay of execution is made permanent. Putin delighted her in 2011 by banning the import and export of harp seal skins. Last . month she said Depardieu - branded 'pathetic' by French Prime Minister . Jean-Marc Ayrault - had been the 'victim of extremely unfair . persecution'. He objects to French president Francois Hollande’s planned 75 per cent top rate of tax. Meanwhile Russians yesterday mocked Depardieu for claiming the country was a 'great democracy' under Putin, . who says he has a 'very friendly personal relationship' with the actor. One opposition leader challenged him to come to a protest rally where he could face arrest. But glamorous television host Tina Kandelaki was ready to help him when it comes to registering his address, a duty for all Russians. 'I’m ready to let him register as a resident in my apartment, he can stay as long as he likes,' she said.

"Just hours after Nokia said claims about its demise had been exaggerated, the firm has unveiled its N1 tablet. The device, which was teased on Twitter overnight, is a 7.9-inch Android tablet with 8MP rear-facing and 5MP front-facing cameras, 32GB storage and is set to cost $249 (£159) when it launches early next year. Earlier this week, the president of Nokia Technologies said it would start licencing its brand to other manufacturers as well as launch its own range of new devices - and the N1 shows its already true to its word. Scroll down for video . The Nokia N1 is a 7.9-inch Android tablet that is set to launch in February in China. It has 8MP rear-facing and 5MP front-facing cameras, is 6.9mm thick and comes with 32GB of storage. It is expected to cost $249 (£159) - although prices may vary based on region . The firm posted the teaser tweet last night, that simply said 'Guess what? We're up to something', accompanied by an image of a black box. Speculation ranged from a TV set top box to take on the Apple TV and Amazon Fire, to a small computer. Display: 7.9-inch . Cameras:  8MP rear-facing and 5MP front-facing . Storage: 32GB .

Colours: Natural Aluminium and Lava Grey . However, one thing it was never going to be was a mobile phone. As part of a recent deal with Microsoft, Nokia is not allowed to use its branding on phones until 2017 - but that means after this date, Nokia phones could also be resurrected. Inside the N1 is a 2.4GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 processor, with 2GB of RAM. It is made from aluminium - in either 'Natural' or Lava Grey' - and weighs 0.7lbs (318g). It is 0.2-inches (6.9mm) thick - thinner than Apple's 0.3-inches (7.5mm) iPad mini 3 - and will launch in time for the Chinese New Year in China next year. Nokia will then release the device in Russia - but release dates in other regions have not been announced. In terms of software, the N1 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop with Nokia's own  Z Launcher. The launcher monitors which apps users frequently open and 'adapts to them' by rearranging the app list accordingly. It isn't reserved to the N1 though, and can be downloaded to other Android devices.

Following Microsoft's plans to ditch the brand across its smartphone range earlier this year, the Finnish firm said it would start licencing its name, expertise and technologies to other companies, starting this quarter. Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for £4.5bn ($7.2 bn) in April and announced it was dropping both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in October, in favour of just using Lumia. But, the firm is continuing to trade as a separate company, focusing on mapping and network infrastructure. The firm posted the teaser tweet last night, that simply said 'Guess what?

As part of the deal, Nokia is not allowed to use its own branding on smartphones until 2016, and on feature phones until 2024. The recent licencing plans were announced at the Nokia Capital Markets Day by president of Nokia Technologies, Ramzi Haidamus. He said: 'It is our goal to start licensing our brand in areas other than these two restricted areas, starting this quarter actually, in the areas we can and the areas where the brand is relevant.' It was a strategy used by Polaroid to bolster its failing brand over the past decade. Polaroid licenses its polarising technology to flat-screen TVs, for example, and its camera technology to tablets. Nokia Networks recently made a significant breakthrough in boosting battery life on phones, by increasing capacity by up to 49 per cent. The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network. Nokia Networks has completed its first live testing of High Speed Cell FACH technology, with support from chip manufacturer Qualcomm. When using apps, phones send and receive small amounts of data, and Nokia's technology is designed to handle these so-called 'data packets' more efficiently. Nokia Networks recently made a significant breakthrough in boosting battery life on phones, by increasing capacity by up to 49 per cent. The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network . This increases browsing speeds, power savings and response times . When running applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as browsing the web, sending emails and using services such as FaceTime, phones often send and receive small amounts of data, known as packets, of just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes. High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software. This makes apps run faster, and also means they use less energy over the course of a day, for example. The technology additionally means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks. According to the recent Nokia tests, the 3G software boosts speeds and network response times by up to 65 per cent, and leads to up to 20 per cent faster browsing. Users also saw power savings of up to 49 per cent, which meant their battery life lasted almost twice as long - depending on which applications were being used. The lowest power saving was nine per cent. It also recently partnered with photography experts at C&A Marketing, which owns Ritz Camera stores and Calumet photography, to make Polaroid-branded cameras and accessories. After the restrictions on smartphone branding lifts, however, Nokia would be able to brand devices made by other manufacturers. These devices may also use technology being developed by Nokia's Network division.

'Some of today's press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs. 'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, ""reports of our death are an exaggeration."" 'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. 'We have one of the world's best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere. 'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves. 'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!' The recent name change by Microsoft brings an end to Nokia's brand being on mobile phones - a run that stretches back into the 1980s. It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft's own site. Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France. Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, though, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status. Nokia has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on, albeit no longer in the mobile phone business.

"When Helen Coughlan’s next door neighbour extended his home, good relations went out of the window. A furious Mrs Coughlan has been left with a view of a brick wall – and claims it has knocked £100,000 off the value of her four-bedroom home. A similar house sold recently for £475,000. Now the 52-year-old wants Tariq Ahmed to demolish his extension, which sits just 24 inches from her window. No world outside: Helen Coughlan fears she will never be able to sell her four-bed semi-detached house after her neighbour put up a brick wall just 24 inches away from her window . No light: The brick wall blocks out all natural light, plunging her newly designed kitchen and dining room into complete darkness . She said: ‘The extension wrecked not only the view, but damaged my walls and now they tell me my home has subsidence problems. ‘My house used to be lovely and light but now it’s dark and dingy. I have to have lights on in my kitchen all the time. ‘He . has not even finished the outside wall. He says he has not got the . money, but he doesn’t care because he doesn’t have to look at it. It’s . made our lives a living hell.’ Dispute: Mrs Coughlan, who lives at the property in Woodford Bridge, London with her husband Paul, her two sons and her mother, says the issue is a 'joke' and claims it hasn't just affected her view but also damaged her walls . Shadow: The extension on Tariq Ahmed's home (circled) was added in 2010, four years after Mrs Coughlan completed her loft conversion . The bottom pictures show the original designs that were submitted to Redbridge Council. The top highlights ow the roof of the extension was higher than first approved . A homeowner is required to get planning permission when they build something new, make a major change to their building or change the use of their building (by reverting it to a building premesis for example). A council can take action if a developer has planning permission but is not complying with the conditions that were approved. They may not be following the approved plans or could have failed to submit some formation before commencing development. Mr Ahmed submitted planning applications, which were subsequently approved, but the completed project was bigger than the original plans. Your right to light dates back to the Prescription Act 1832, and was updated in Rights of Light Act 1959 . Any development can potentially block the light coming into your home. The most common problem is where light is blocked to a side window by a high wall, that may have been built without the need for planning permission. However Redbridge Council, the local authority in control of the area, state on their website that they will not become involved in right to light disputes. Neighbours' rights to light apply irrespective of having obtained planning permission or building under the permitted development rules. The right is automatically acquired if the light has been enjoyed through defined apertures of a building - windows - uninterrupted for 20 years. It can also have been granted by deed. Action: The local council has ruled the extension was bigger than Tarid Ahmed applied for - but have not ordered him to tear it down because it only constitutes 'loss of light' Building problems: Mrs Coughlan claims her neighbour's extension has not only spoiled her view but has also caused subsidence issues . The . saga began after Mrs Coughlan – who moved into the semi-detached house . in Woodford Bridge, north-east London, with husband Paul, 48, and sons . Patrick, now 22, and Sean, 21, in 1999 – redesigned her home, adding a . loft and  roof conversion. But . a few years later, Mr Ahmed also added an upstairs room to his home – . and his relationship with Mrs Coughlan hit a brick wall. With . just two feet between his new room and her new window, all natural . light through her kitchen and dining room windows is blocked, leaving . her with no view apart from the brickwork. Redbridge . Council has ruled Mr Ahmed’s extension is bigger than it had been in . the planning application granted in 2010, but has not ordered him to . tear it down because it constitutes only ‘loss of light’. Mrs Coughlan, a . carer, said: ‘It is unacceptable that the council wants to wash its . hands of the situation. It has a responsibility to sort it out.’ In . 2012, she took Mr Ahmed to court in a civil case over the right to . light, and he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of £30,000. Neighbours on the other side of Mr Ahmed’s property, Veronica and Tony Martin, have also had problems with the building work. In April 2011 they found a huge crack down the length of their house. The work cost £13,000 to fix, which Mr Ahmed paid for. The . council said in a statement: ‘The council is satisfied it applied the . relevant planning policies and procedures correctly.  The “right to . light” is a private law right which is not, of itself, a qualifying . factor when determining planning applications. ‘It . is an applicant’s responsibility to consider the relevance of the . general law, including any possible right to light and party wall . issues.’ Mr Ahmed, 45, who . lives with wife Kay and their four children, said: ‘I refute all the . allegations, they are all false. There was a garage here before so she . [Mrs Coughlan] always had a reduced light. She’s accepted the . compensation and we’re now being victimised when we had permission to . build the extension.’ The row is due to be featured in an episode of Channel 5 series Neighbour Disputes next month. Close: Mr Ahmed strayed from the original plans and in December 2012 Helen took him to court in a civil case and he agreed to an out of court settlement of £30,000 . Workmanship: Picture shows parts of the extension crumbling away. Mrs Coughlan, who works as a carer for her mother says the building has caused 'subsidence issues' Rear view: The extension at the back of the house is close to Mrs Coughlan's roof conversion, which she put up before Mr Ahmed built the extension .","Helen Coughlan, 52, who lives with her husband, two children and her mother, fears she will never be able to sell .

"Donna Ricketts, who avoided jail despite admitting throwing a glass in the face of a model in a nightclub leaving her scarred . A mother-of-three who left a model scarred for life after throwing a glass in her face at a nightclub has been spared jail for the sake of her young children. Donna Ricketts flew into a rage at the Bijou nightclub in Salford, Manchester, attacking the 27-year-old victim, who narrowly escaped losing an eye. Ricketts, 31, pleaded guilty to wounding but escaped a prison sentence after Manchester Crown Court heard she was the single mother of three children, with the youngest being just 18-months-old. She was also spared paying out £1,800 in compensation to her scarred victim after claiming she could only repay £50 a month from her benefits. Instead, the victim will receive just £250 unless she pursues compensation in a civil action. Prosecutor Simone Flynn told the court that a dispute broke out in the club between the victim's group of friends and Ricketts' group of friends after the victim lost her handbag in the early hours of May 11. Ricketts lost her temper in the melee, first throwing her glass at the young woman, causing a deep, gaping wound below her left eye. The victim, a health worker, who worked as a part-time model before the incident, revealed how traumatised she has been left by the attack. In a victim impact statement read by Miss Flynn, she said: 'I have been told even if I have surgery I will be left with a scar on my face permanently. 'I had to take a month off work while I was recovering and I am regularly suffering from severe headaches and twitches in the left eye. 'I feel my clients may take an unfavourable view of me because I have a scar. 'It may be several months before I am able to do modelling work again. 'The incident has definitely knocked my confidence.' Anthony O’Donnell, defending, said Ricketts ‘retaliated’ after she was shoved from behind and a drink was thrown over her. The attack happened during a melee after the victim lost her handbag at the Bijou club in Salford, Manchester, pictured . He said the aspiring child psychologist had never intended the injury and was ‘shocked and dismayed’ at her actions. He also added that she was well thought of by those who knew her and would never appear before a court again, describing the offence as ‘without a shadow of a doubt a one-off’. Sentencing her to 18-months, suspended for two years, with supervision and 80 hours unpaid work, Mr Recorder Shaw said the injury was ‘horrific’ and ‘dreadful’. He added: 'I have no doubt at all that in front of pretty much any other judge you would go straight to jail. 'But you have three children and I have to ask myself, would it do any good?'","Donna Ricketts, 31, flew into a rage at the Bijou nightclub in Salford .

"Millions of pounds will never be recouped from a tax avoidance scheme used by celebrities after the taxman took so long to investigate it. HM Revenue and Customs was so ‘unacceptably’ slow that it missed the legal deadline beyond which it cannot re-examine people’s tax affairs, a Parliamentary report said. The Liberty scheme – used by stars including Take That’s Gary Barlow, singers George Michael and Katie Melua, actor Michael Caine, and the Arctic Monkeys – was closed in 2009 but was not taken to a tax tribunal until this year. The Liberty scheme used by stars including Take That’s Gary Barlow (left) and singer Katie Melua (right) was closed in 2009 but was not taken to a tax tribunal until this year - Barlow later apologised for using the scheme and said he would settle his tax affairs, while Melua repaid what she owed . A report has revealed that the taxman will never get back up to £10million owed by rich tax avoiders because it failed to act before the 12-month deadline passed. MPs accuse the HMRC of ‘putting tax revenues at risk’ and warned the slip-up ‘may just be the tip of the iceberg’. The report is published as the taxman is requesting greater powers to take money directly from people’s bank accounts when it believes tax is owed. MPs accuse the HMRC (headquarters pictured) of ‘putting tax revenues at risk’ and warned the slip-up ‘may just be the tip of the iceberg’ But critics said last night that ‘error-prone’ HMRC should not be given more powers until it has proved it can ‘keep its eye on the ball’. Actors, doctors and judges were among those who allegedly tried to shelter £1.2billion through Liberty, making it one of the biggest known tax-avoidance schemes. The Leeds firm was allegedly able to help clients avoid tax by offsetting their earnings against artificial losses it reportedly created offshore. The Commons Public Accounts Committee was scathing about HMRC’s failures and said it ‘must do more faster’. Its report into tax avoidance said: ‘Up to £10 million of the total £400 million tax at stake from the 2,000 users of this scheme may not be recoverable because in 30 cases HMRC failed to start inquiries into personal tax returns within the 12-month statutory deadline.’ Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: ‘HMRC are missing deadlines as a result of a lack of drive, a lack of staff and a lack of a sense of urgency. ‘They believe £10 million is peanuts in the grand scheme of things, but that attitude is irresponsible. It is also about justice, and they should not be allowed to get away with it. ‘The majority of the public pay their fair share so why should some people, just because they are wealthy, treat it as a voluntary activity?’ Liberty is one of many legal tax-avoidance loopholes to have been exposed in recent years, used by celebrities, doctors and judges. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The report is right to point the finger at HMRC but the real villains of the piece are the politicians who have created a tax code so complex that even the taxman can’t administer it. ‘Of course HMRC needs to up its game, but it’s hardly a surprise that mistakes creep in when you’re trying to enforce a tax system of almost comical complexity.’ The Commons Public Accounts Committee was scathing about HMRC’s failures and said it ‘must do more faster’ Every year about £3 billion is lost through legal avoidance schemes. Barlow, 43, later apologised for using an avoidance scheme and said he would settle his tax affairs, while Miss Melua, 30, repaid what she owed. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We have accelerated collection of tax from avoiders enormously. ‘The committee recognises we have addressed their key comments about tax avoidance. 'The way we now work makes it clear to promoters and users of schemes that we will robustly tackle tax avoidance, so increasingly taxpayers are contacting us to help disentangle them from schemes that simply don’t work.’","Millions will never be recouped from the Liberty tax avoidance scheme .

"Labour peer Lord Ahmed has been suspended by the party over reports that he blamed a Jewish conspiracy for his jail sentence . A Muslim peer has been suspended from the Labour Party for allegedly blaming his prison sentence for dangerous driving on a Jewish conspiracy. Lord Ahmed was sentenced to three months for sending text messages shortly before his car was in a motorway crash that killed a father of two. But, in an extraordinary rant on Pakistani television, Lord Ahmed is alleged to have blamed his imprisonment on pressure from Jews ‘who own newspapers and TV channels’. The peer, who became one of the first Muslim men in the House of Lords in 1998, is said to have claimed in Urdu that the conspiracy was a result of his support for Palestinians in Gaza. And he allegedly said the judge who jailed him was appointed to the High Court after helping a ‘Jewish colleague’ of Tony Blair during ‘an important case’. Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday suspended Lord Ahmed and ordered an investigation into the incident, which is believed to have taken place last April. Lord Ahmed’s alleged comments are so extreme they would have invited a prosecution for inciting racial hatred in Britain. Mark Gardner, of the Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors anti-semitism, said: ‘If accurate, these comments will be the most blatantly anti-semitic remarks by such a public figure for many years.’ Martyn Gombar, a 28-year-old Slovakian living in Leigh, Lancashire, was killed on Christmas Day 2007 when his stationary car was hit by Lord Ahmed’s Jaguar on the M1 near Sheffield. A police investigation found Lord Ahmed had sent and received five lengthy text messages while driving at speeds of up to 60mph. The last was sent minutes before the fatal crash. Lord Ahmed pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Sheffield magistrates court in December  2008 but the case was moved to a higher court. Labour party leader Ed Miliband, pictured in the Commons yesterday, has suspended Lord Ahmed . At Sheffield Crown Court, Mr Justice Wilkie accepted Lord Ahmed’s texting had not caused the accident but imposed a jail sentence for the ‘prolonged, deliberate and highly dangerous driving’. The Pakistan-born property developer was released after 16 days when the Court of Appeal suspended his sentence. In the Pakistani television broadcast it is alleged Lord Ahmed claimed he should have been sentenced by a magistrate. He said: ‘My case became more critical because I went to Gaza to support Palestinians. My Jewish friends who own newspapers and TV channels opposed this.’ Killed: Martyn Gombar was just 28 when he died . He claimed Mr Justice Wilkie was hand-picked and sent from London to carry out the sentence because no other judge was willing to handle his case. He was however the presiding judge on the north-eastern circuit, which includes Sheffield Crown Court. During his television interview Lord Ahmed allegedly claimed his conviction was overturned. In fact, the Court of Appeal refused to quash the conviction and said: ‘There should not be one law for the rich and powerful and one law for the rest.’ The peer told the Times newspaper, which uncovered the footage, he had ‘no recollection’ of giving the television interview. Labour is now coming under pressure to kick him out of the party. Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, blogged: ‘If one of Lord Ahmed’s respective party allies had said something similar about Muslims, you can bet your life that they would be drummed out of Westminster before you can say racist.’ In 2009 Lord Ahmed was jailed for 12 weeks . for dangerous driving after sending and receiving text messages minutes . before his car crashed into a stationary vehicle on the M1 near . Sheffield on Christmas Day 2007. He was freed by the Court of Appeal . after serving only 16 days of his prison sentence and later supported an . AA/Populus poll into mobile phone use among motorists, saying he had 'learnt the hard way' about the problem. He joined the Labour Party in his teens and was made a life peer in 1998. Lord Ahmed was suspended from the Labour Party for three months last year over reports that he offered a 10 million-dollar 'bounty' for the capture of US President Barack Obama and his White House predecessor, George Bush. The peer denied having made the comments, published in a Pakistani newspaper, and was reinstated after an investigation by Labour Lords Chief Whip Lord Bassam after it was found he had been misquoted.","Lord Ahmed was jailed in 2009 for dangerous driving after texting minutes before a fatal crash .

"When Paul and Wendy Collins were woken by the sound of workmen digging holes outside their home, it was little more than an everyday suburban irritation. This soon turned to alarm, however, when concrete posts were put into the holes and a six-foot timber fence erected across the front and side of the house they have lived in for 26 years. ‘It feels like we are behind some kind of Berlin Wall, like being a prisoner in our own home,’ said Mrs Collins. Wendy Collins, from Brownhills, West Midlands, has been left unable to use her garden gate after her neighbour built a fence across it . The move comes after a row with the property developer over the state of Mrs Collins's garden wall . Mrs Collins and her husband looked on in horror as builders erected the wooden fence around their Victorian four-bedroom property last week . The fence was the culmination of a dispute the family have been having with the property company that owns the apartments next door, which says they had encroached on its land. It means the Collinses can no longer use the front gate of their four-bedroom house, which can only be reached  from the rear, while the fence is all they can see out of their living-room window. Mrs Collins, 62, a retired teacher, said: ‘The first we knew that a fence was going up was when the builders arrived on Friday. They refused to stop, so I called the police and the council, who sent an enforcement officer. ‘But he said planning permission wasn’t needed and dismissed it as a neighbour dispute. Now we have been barricaded in.’ The couple's Fiat Stilo worth £2,000, has also been blocked in by the fence, which has been erected around their property . An aerial shot of Mrs Collins house, marked up to show exactly where the fence erected around the house has been built . Neighbouring property developer Michael Nicholls, left, who had the fence put up around the property by workmen, right . The fence has been built on land owned Sadlers Mill Ltd which own 12 apartments overlooking the Collins' home . The fence was put 8in from her front gate on the perimeter of a car park owned by Sadlers Mill, a property firm formed by the 12 owners of apartments in a converted flour mill adjacent to the Collinses’ home in Brownhills, West Midlands. Mr Collins, 60, an engineer, his wife and three children moved there in 1988, a few years after the conversion was completed. The property has a rear driveway, but the family began paying Sadlers Mill a nominal rent in 2012 to park two cars in its parking area in front of their home. Mrs Collins, pictured standing outside her home, said: 'This is a Victorian house, it was built in 1865, it's never going to be a show home' Mrs Collins said they can still get in and out via the back door but are unable to leave and enter their home through the front . The developer who owns flats next door to the property said the wall was devaluing the price of his properties . Mr Nicholls said he put up the fence to keep it out of sight from potential buyers . Mrs Collins said the two sides fell out after a car crashed through her garden’s brick wall, partially demolishing it. She used the access it created to park her Fiat Stilo on the front lawn, where it is now stuck. Sadlers Mill asked the family to tidy up the front of their home and even offered to pay for replacing the wall if the couple agreed to sign over ownership of it. Mrs Collins said the company warned it would build a new boundary fence if she did not rectify the damage, but heard no more about it until last Friday. Mrs Collins says she now has to use a ladder to exit her home on the side of the new fence . The move, which followed a row over their crumbling garden fence, means they can no longer walk out of the front gate or move their car off the drive . Michael Nicholls, 57, a Sadlers Mill resident and director of the property management company, claimed the couple demolished part of the wall themselves to create access to an extra parking space for a third car, and said the state of the Collinses’ garden was hitting the value of the apartments. He added: ‘It was unsightly and also trespassing on our land. ‘We have tried to be amicable and neighbourly, but Mr and Mrs Collins would accept no compromise. It’s a shame.’ Walsall council said: ‘The fence was erected under permitted development rights . . . The local planning authority cannot intervene.’ The developer insists he has been reasonable with the couple, who he says have 'accepted no compromise' Mrs Collins said: 'We're like prisoners in our own home, we've been barricaded in. It feels like we are behind some kind of Berlin Wall' The couple are also unable to receive their post due to their house being surrounded by the fence .","Couple had row with  neighbour after he claimed state of their old wall was reducing values of neighbouring homes .

"Mother Helen Turnbull, 35, kissed a 16-year-old pupil before telling him it was her 'guilty pleasure' and 'clearly teaching had its perks', a court heard . A teaching assistant who kissed a 16-year-old pupil told him it was her 'guilty pleasure' before exclaiming 'clearly teaching does have its perks', a court heard. Helen Turnbull, 35, denies having sex with the boy but has admitted kissing him during secret meetings in her Mini convertible and sending him flirtatious messages. The mother of two, from Haswell, County Durham, has admitted one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, relating to kissing, but denies three further counts relating to sex, a sex act and oral sex. In the witness box at Teesside Crown Court today, Turnbull denied being unfaithful to her ex-husband Ben and said that she never had sex with the boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Sarah Mallett, prosecuting, read out some of the messages the pair sent each other over the internet after they first kissed on an industrial estate. He wrote to her: 'You love kissing me' before she replied: 'It's a guilty pleasure.' She later added: 'Clearly teaching does have its perks.' When Miss Mallett asked if teaching had the 'advantage' of giving her contact with people to kiss, Turnbull replied: 'That was a stupid thing to say and I fully admit it. 'Earlier in the messages I say why am I even doing it. I was confused. 'Guilty pleasure - we did kiss and I did feel guilty about it.' Earlier, Miss Mallett read out a message Turnbull sent to the boy when they were discussing two men who may have seen them kissing. It said: 'They were thinking ""them two are well horny but she's out of his league"".' The court also heard how Turnbull allegedly asked the boy which knickers she should wear for a secret meeting with him – by texting him beforehand with the choice of 'pink or yellow'. When he replied 'pink', she wrote back: 'Haha, got them on.' On another occasion they discussed where they should have sex and he suggested her desk. Turnbull (pictured outside court) also sent a text message to the boy asking which colour knickers she should wear: 'pink or yellow', the court heard. She also said he would be a legend if they had sex on her desk . Turnbull admitted one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, relating to kissing, at Teesside Crown Court (above) but denies three other counts relating to sex, a sex act and oral sex . Miss Mallett said: 'You say he would be a legend. 'You say ""gutted if we get caught"" because you would get sacked.' They also discussed staying at a hotel and undressing, the court heard. The boy wrote to the literacy assistant: 'Your dress wouldn't be on for long, like' and she replied: 'To the floor in seconds.' Of the messages, Turnbull told the prosecution: 'It was just chat, all talk, it didn't happen.' Earlier in the trial, Turnbull admitted she enjoyed the attention she received from the pupil, who is now 18. She told the court: ‘There was no intention ever to act on the messages but it was what he wanted. ‘I wish now I had not sent them. It was just sexual chat, being able to flirt with somebody. I enjoyed getting the attention, especially when I was on my own. The children were in bed – it was the instancy of getting a message back and not feeling on my own. ‘The next day I would say it wasn’t right and try to end it.’ The court also previously heard how her marriage broke down when her affair with the teenager came to light. Her husband said he became suspicious after seeing a comment beside a Facebook picture of Turnball and the boy in which she asked him whether she should wear an ‘itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini’ on a school outing. Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing. The trial continues.

"Women said they needed 15 more days of sleep than what they get in a survey of 2,000 adults (file image) Britain's women need at least at 15 days more sleep each year than they get, says a new survey. They feel worse off than men – who reckon they are 10 days short of the ideal sleep ration. Overall, Britons say they need seven and a half hours a night, but they are getting fewer than six hours 40 minutes. Experts believe insufficient sleep has become a worldwide epidemic, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to medical problems such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and immune deficiency. Previous US research even found lack of sleep could double the signs of skin ageing, including fine lines. The latest survey of 2,000 UK adults showed men claim to get less sleep than women, but also need less time in bed. The survey showed men were getting 6 hours 3 mins sleep on average, compared with 6 hours 40 mins they believe they should have – a sleep deficit of 40 mins a night. Over a year, the shortfall would reach 10 days 3 hours. Women claim to get 6 hours 21 mins each night – but want 7hrs 23 mins. The sleep deficit of 1 hr 2mins a night adds up to a staggering 15 days 17 hours annually. The figures emerged in a survey of the nation’s sleeping habits for a new app, iCukoo, which allows users to donate to a charity of their choice every time they hit the snooze button on their phone alarm. Fewer than half of Britons actually wake up to an alarm clock or phone alarm. Almost a fifth of people wake naturally, and most of the remainder are awakened by partners, pets or children. Scroll down for video . More men than women are woken up by their partners – 11.5 per cent versus 9 per cent – and twice as many women are woken by children – 11 per cent versus 5.5 per cent. A quarter of those surveyed by OnePoll said they always got a good night’s sleep, but almost one in five were kept awake by work worries, and one in eight had their sleep affected by issues with family or friends. Snoring by a partner kept one in 10 awake while a further seven per cent suffered because of their own snoring, or conditions such as sleep apnoea. Inevitably, women suffer far more with snoring partners: 15.5 per cent said this kept them awake, compared with just 6 per cent of men. One in four people said needing the toilet was the thing guaranteed to get them up. Research suggests seven and a half hours of sleep a night is the optimum level for good health. More women complained about being kept awake by a snoring partner while men said they needed less time in bed (file image) Earlier this year scientists at Surrey University last month found just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress, immunity and inflammation. Other research shows women are more likely to seek help for sleeping problems – but they are twice as likely to become reliant on medication. Josh Hart of Chelsea Apps Factory, which created iCukoo, said the app would help good causes because every time a user hit the snooze button, a small sum of money was donated to their charity of choice. He said ‘With so many people struggling to get enough sleep, it’s no wonder so many of us feel the need to snooze every day. ‘Now, using an app, we can use that snooze time to help others and snooze guilt-free!’ Mark Bishop, Director of Fundraising at Prostate Cancer UK, one of the charities involved, said ‘Extreme snoozing is a brilliant way of fundraising if you don’t fancy climbing mountains and skydiving. ‘Prostate Cancer UK is conscious of the clock, with one man dying from the disease every hour in the UK. We cannot afford to hit the snooze button, but our supporters can.’ Paul Jackson-Clark, Director of Fundraising at Parkinson’s UK ‘We all struggle to get out of bed on cold and dark winter mornings, and anything that can make getting up more bearable can only be a good thing. ‘Waking up and snoozing with iCukoo is a fun and simple way to kick-start every day, whilst making a donation to Parkinson’s UK at the same time.’ Laura Lee, Chief Executive of Maggie’s, said: ‘Maggie’s is here for everyone and anyone affected by cancer as well as their family and friends and we are delighted to have been selected as one of iCukoo’s charity partners.’","Britons say they need seven and a half hours of sleep every night .

"A former Obama health policy adviser has insisted he wants to be dead by his 75th birthday as the elderly are 'feeble, ineffectual and pathetic' A former Obama health policy adviser has insisted he wants to be dead by his 75th birthday as the elderly are 'feeble, ineffectual and pathetic.' Physicist Ezekiel Emanuel, architect of Obamacare and brother of former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, claims that longevity often comes at the expense of quality of life and the desire to live longer is 'misguided.' Writing in the October issue of The Atlantic, he says: 'There is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. 'It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. 'It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. 'It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. 'We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic. The father-of-three acknowledges that his desire to die in his seventies does not sit well with his family, especially his daughters, but insists he will not change his mind as his years advance. He says that if parents live to their nineties, their children must give up their retirement time to look after them and the only time they are free is when their parents die - and they are then old themselves. The 57-year-old, a former Obama health policy adviser, says longevity often comes at the expense of quality of life . Emanuel insists in the essay that he is not arguing for euthanasia or assisted suicide at a certain age. He says that if he was diagnosed with cancer now he would probably have it treated, but when he turns 65 he will have his last colonoscopy and have no screening for prostate cancer at any age. Emanuel insists that once he turns 75 he will refuse all medical treatment and says he 'die when whatever comes first takes me.' In the essay,  which is published on the website with photos of his family, Emanuel says he will hold a memorial before his death to celebrate his life, but if his survivors want to have one when he has passed away it is not his 'business.' Emanuel writes: 'Americans seem to be obsessed with exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins and supplements, all in a valiant effort to cheat death and prolong life as long as possible' Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, does acknowledge that sometimes age is not a barrier to creativity. He cites the case of a prominent health economist who recently celebrated his 90th birthday and continues to be 'brilliant', but insists that the man is simply 'an outlier—a very rare individual.' Emanuel blasts the American obsession with 'exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins' and says he thinks the mindset is both 'misguided and potentially destructive.' Emanuel,  told ABC's Dr. Richard Besser on This Week: 'I look at the data on disability, I look at the data on Alzheimer's disease, I look at the data on loss of creativity. Emanuel's brothers are Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel (seen left with his wife) and Chicago Mayor Rahm (right) 'And 75 seems to be the right moment where the chance of disability, physical disability is low, you're still not in the high Alzheimer's risk of 30 percent or 50 percent and creativity has sort of come to an end. Emanuel, the director of the Clinical Bioethics Department at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and head of the Department of Medical Ethics & Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, helped develop President Obama's health care reform law. Emanuel's youngest brother is the president's first chief of staff, current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Their other brother is Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel whose clients have included Rhianna, Justin Timberlake, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. The three brothers were raised in Chicago by their father Israeli-born pediatrician Benjamin and mother Marsha, a nurse who was a descendant of Russian immigrants. They also have an adopted sister with cerebral palsy who shuns the limelight.","Physician Ezekiel Emanuel is a former Obama health policy adviser .

"A toddler suffered severe nerve damage to his face after being attacked by a dog off its leash while playing in a park with his mother this weekend. One-year-old Kaidyn Sutton was rushed to the hospital with large gashes to his eyes and cheek after the black dog approached him and his mother in a French Valley, California park. He underwent surgery Friday night, but doctors say it's likely he'll be left with long-term damage from the mauling. The dog was later found at a house on the outskirts of the park and officials will now decide whether to return the dog to its owners or put the animal down. Scroll down for video . 1-year-old Kaidyn Sutton was viciously mauled by a dog this weekend while playing in a park with his mother . The dog was identified the day after the attack, living at a house two doors down from the park. Kaidyn's mother says the dog did not have a collar or leash on at the time of the attack . Kaidyn's mother Michaela says her son, just one month shy of his second birthday, suffered lasting nerve damage . Michaela Sutton, her son and the boy's godmother were playing in Primrose Park Friday afternoon around 4pm when the black dog suddenly approached and  grabbed hold of the boy's face. 'He was running around in the grass playing when a dog...came out of nowhere and attacked him -- latched onto his face and just mauled him,' the boy's grandfather Glenn Garrett told NBC Los Angeles. Kaidyn pictured above recovering in the hospital after the attack . Kaidyn's godmother was able to wrench the ferocious dog off him,  but not before the animal ripped up the little boy's face. The boy, just one month shy of his second birthday, was rushed to Loma Linda Medical Center where doctors performed surgery overnight to fix the injuries to his forehead and cheek. 'He is out they said he did great, he looks great. There may be some nerve damage in his forehead and they fixed one tendon that works one eyebrow but couldn't exactly pinpoint the other but (because) he's so little they hope it will grow back,' Sutton said in a Facebook update. Doctors say the boy may need to undergo further surgeries before he is fully recovered.  He was expected to be released from the hospital on Sunday. On Saturday, the godmother identified the dog at a house just two doors down from the park. Residents expressed shock that the seemingly nice 6-year-old black lab named Dexter was responsible for the attack. The dog was removed from the home by Animal Services and a hearing will be scheduled to decide whether to put down the dog or return it to its owners. They say the dog was not involved in any prior incidents, and that it was vaccinated for rabies and microchipped.

"On trial: Bouchra Bagour, 35, leaves court (file photo) A French mother has appeared in court after sending her three-year-old son named Jihad to school in a T-shirt saying 'I am a bomb.' Bouchra Bagour, 35, insisted she  had put it on him 'without stopping to think about it' when he wore it to the nursery in Sorgues near Avignon on 24 September. Bagour is charged with 'glorifying crime.' Teachers and the headteacher were shocked by the clothing and alerted authorities. A few days later the town mayor, Thierry Lagneau of the conservative UMP party, asked prosecutors to investigate. I condemn the attitude of the parents who shamefully took advantage of the person and the age of this child to convey a political message,' Lagneau said at the time. At the start of her trial in Avignon, she denied defending terrorism through the T-shirt message. 'I thought it might make people laugh,' she said, according to Le Parisien. The expression plays on the popular French saying 'Je suis la bombe', which translates roughly as 'I am the best'. The back of the T-shirt read 'Born on 11 September,' but Bagour insisted it was only a reference to her son's date of birth. Ms Bagour's brother - who gave the . T-shirt to her three-year-old son is a co-defendant in the . case and also denies the charge. Zeyad Bagour said he he was not trying to promote a message by buying the T-shirt. 'It's the day his birth I wanted to highlight, not the year,' he told the court. In . an interview with the newspaper La Provence in November, Boucha Bagour . said that while she is Muslim, 'there is no message to be conveyed by . the T-shirt — no intent.' Claims: Bouchra Bagour, 35, insisted she had put it on him 'without stopping to think about it' when he wore it to school in Sorgues near Avignon on 24 September . Controversial: A T-shirt similar to the one worn by three-year-old Jihad . 'Bomb' is used in the sense of 'handsome,' nothing more,' she said. However, lawyer Claude Avril said: 'Idiocy is often the best alibi to hide the real intentions', reported Sky News. 'The most scandalous thing is that they've used and manipulated a three-year-old child to voluntarily convey the words of a terrorist.' The prosecutor in Avignon previously told the court the family must have known the reaction the boy’s clothing would provoke, reported The Local. 'At some point there must be limits. They are not stupid. They understand the significance of what they are doing,' he said. He called for a fine of 1,000 euros (£870; $1,300) against Ms Bagour and 3,000 euros for her brother. Josette Pessemesse, from the far-left . Front de Gauche party, wrote an open letter to the court defending the 'right to humour.' It was signed by around 50 people. 'This is the same as qualifying all Muslims as terrorists,' Pessemesse told France Info. The trial has been adjourned until next month.","Bouchra Bagour, 35, charged with 'glorifying crime'

"Gale force winds and driving rain might not sound like fun to most of us but for surfer Andrew Cotton, 34, stormy weather means the chance to pit his skills against towering 80ft waves. But the incredible photographs of Cotton tackling the surf created by the St. Jude's storm in Portugal yesterday didn't impress everyone. Critics condemned his feat as 'stupid' and 'idiotic' and called on him to show a more responsible attitude towards his family. Now his wife Katie, 37, has hit back at the critics, arguing that surfing is what her husband was born to do and revealing her pride in his achievement. Happy family: Surfer Andrew Cotton and his wife Katie with their two children, Honey, six, and Ace, one . Adorable: Katie says she hopes her one-year-old son Ace won't become a surfer like his father . 'I feel a mixture of things when I watch him doing something like that,' she said in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'I'm really pleased for him because he's doing what he loves, what he's been trained to do. At the same time, I'm terrified because to do that [surfing] would be my worst nightmare so I'm relieved he came through it OK.' Cotton, a professional surfer and part time lifeguard from Croyde in North Devon, successfully completed his attempt on the 80ft behemoth. But his colleague, fellow surfer, Maya Gabeira wasn't so lucky. The Brazilian was knocked unconscious by a wave and had to be pulled from the surf and given CPR. After being rushed to hospital, it was later revealed that she had suffered a broken leg in the incident. Katie, who knows the risks her husband takes when he goes into the water, says that she's always relieved when she hears the phone ring and his voice on the other end after one of his surfing exploits. 'As soon . as the phone rings and I know he's on dry land, I'm OK,' she explains. 'That's all I care about - for me, all . about getting the phone call.' Despite being left on the edge of her seat by his exploits, Katie says she can't imagine him doing anything else and is completely supportive of his choices. Family man: Andrew cuddles up to Ace and Honey (left) and with his children on the beach in Portugal (right) Proud: Katie says she is thrilled about her husband's incredible achievement and cannot wait to see him again . 'He's been surfing since before I met him,' she explains. 'I'm completely supportive because it's who he is - he's totally driven and he's following his heart. 'When not doing it, he's a little bit of a lost soul even if it does mean pushing boundaries, so as far as I'm concerned, good on him. 'It's terrifying for me but he's doing the right thing by himself.' Katie, who was at home bracing herself against St Jude's storm while her husband made his attempt, might be supportive of Andrew's efforts but admits she might not feel the same if one of her children, Honey, six, or Ace, one, decided to follow in their father's footsteps. 'I'd . just have to laugh,' she chuckles. 'Doing it myself is actually, literally my worst nightmare! Being a wife and having a husband doing it is tough but having child do it . would be even harder. '[Andrew's] mum is incredible.' In the meantime, music teacher Katie is looking forward to welcoming her adventurous husband home to Devon in a few days time. 'I really am looking forward to it,' she says. 'I want to say well done and give him a huge hug. He's done absolutely brilliantly and after working so hard and doing so much training. 'He's following . his dreams and I'm just so proud. We all are here.' Death-defying: Andrew tackles one of the 80ft waves blown up by the St Jude's storm on Monday . Incredible: Andrew was supported by two jetskis during his feat and trained for months before attempting it . 'Sometimes I think these daredevil people should die.

Keep the photos coming!! - Magnus Norton, London . '""TOTALY [sic] IRRESPONSIBLE"" especialy [sic] putting the lives of would be rescuers at RISK.' - Anthony Payne, Gloucestershire . 'Amazing photos! As for people criticising, yes, it may have been ""irresponsible"", but I'm pretty sure most people who take part in water sports/extreme sports are aware of the risks... It's their choice if they choose to take them doing something that they enjoy.' Anon_Girl, Southampton .

"Four men who threw a pig's head into the grounds of a mosque two days after the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby have been jailed. Thomas Ashton, 21, Andrew Warner, 31, Travis Crabtree, 25, and Steven White, 28, dumped a carrier bag containing the severed head in the car park of Blackpool Central Mosque as part of a prank. The crime was described as 'poisonous' by Judge Graham Knowles who jailed the four -  despite pleas by the imam of the Lancashire mosque to be lenient with them. Andrew Warner, 31, (left) and Travis Crabtree, 25 (right) have been jailed after they were part of a gang of four who threw a severed head into Blackpool Central Mosque just two days after the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby . Stephen White, 28, (left) and Thomas Ashton, 21, (right) have also been jailed for dumping the severed head . Judge Graham Knowles said: 'People are and must be free to worship as they please and without this kind of foul attack on them and that which they hold sacred. 'What you four did must be denounced.' The four men, all from Blackpool admitted a charge of religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress. After the incident the mosque's imam, Ashfaq Patel. asked for the defendants to be spared prison. He said: 'As long as they realise what they did was offensive and wrong, I dont think they should end up behind bars.'

During a hearing at Preston Crown Court, he told the four: 'Even now the imam asks for mercy for you and strives to understand you.' Fusilier Lee Rigby, 25, was murdered in Woolwich, south London, by Islamic extremists in May last year . The severed pig's head was dumped just days after Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered by Islamic extremists in Woolwich, south London, on May 22, 2013. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of the 25-year-old soldier, a father of one. He had been walking back to his barracks at the time of the attack. Clare Thomas, prosecuting, said a volunteer saw a carrier bag in the mosque car park on May 24 last year. Miss Thomas said 'Sticking out of the bag was a pig's ear and he realised it was attached to a pig's head. 'He described himself as being totally shocked. Thomas Ashton, 21, Andrew Warner, 31, Travis Crabtree, 25, and Steven White, 28, dumped a carrier bag containing the severed head in the car park of Blackpool Central Mosque (pictured) as part of a prank . 'It sent a shiver down his spine. Pigs are forbidden for Muslims to touch or have contact with. 'Its presence at a place of worship was highly insulting. Parents and children had started to arrive at the mosque. 'Some of them saw the head and felt offended and angry.' The severed head was removed by the police and after an investigation a Facebook message was traced to White. When White was arrested, his iPhone was seized and a video was found showing a car being driven by Warner. It recorded comments being made about Muslims, indicating the four knew of the significance of a pig's head, Miss Thomas told Preston Crown Court. The court heard Ashton and Crabtree had gone to buy the pigs head and Warner and White decided to join in after being told what would happen.","Men threw a pig's head into a mosque two days after murder of Lee Rigby .

"Victim: After a desperate 911 call, officers discovered Tevin A. Geike, pictured, a Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldier, in a parking lot in Lakewood, Washington suffering multiple stab wounds just after 2:30 a.m. A 20-year-old white soldier was stabbed to death on Saturday in what authorities believe could be a hate crime. After a desperate 911 call, officers discovered Tevin A. Geike, a Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldier, in a parking lot in Lakewood, Washington suffering multiple stab wounds just after 2:30 a.m. He died at the scene. The victim's two friends, also soldiers and also white, told police they were walking south on Pacific Highway when a vehicle approached them and someone inside called out a racial slur. One of the soldiers yelled back something about those in the car treating combat soldiers with disrespect, Lawler said. The car then turned around, stopped next to the soldiers and five black males piled out of the vehicle. A verbal confrontation started, Lawler said, but the driver called his friends off when he learned some of the soldiers were actually combat veterans. As the group returned to the car, one of the suspects appeared to bump into Geike, Lawler said. The two soldiers then saw their friend fall to the ground as the car sped away. That's when they discovered Geike had been stabbed and was bleeding profusely. 'At this point, it appears that it could have been a hate crime,' Lawler said, according to the News Tribune. 'We're certainly looking at it now as a potential hate crime. We're not going to say that it is, but according to two guys at the scene, it appears to be racially motivated.' Police are seeking a midnight blue sedan, perhaps a BMW or a Volkswagen Jetta, with four doors, tinted windows and stock rims with low-profile tires. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Geike's two friends saw him fall to the ground, bleeding profusely as the suspects' car sped away . The suspects were described as being in their mid-20s, Lawler said. The main suspect is about 6 feet 1, medium build and was wearing a blue zip-up sweater, while the driver was described as being 5 feet 7 with short cropped hair and wearing a blue-and-white horizontal-striped shirt. Another suspect is 5 feet 7 with short hair and was wearing a gray tank top, while another was described as 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 7, wearing camouflage pants. The fifth man is described as 5 feet 6. According to the Tribune, Lt. Col. Joe Sowers, of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, said Geike and his two companions were members of the 7th Infantry Division. Sowers said Geike had been in the Army 35 months and had no combat experience. He could not confirm Geike's rank. Geike graduated from high school in North Charleston, South Carolina, in 2010. Investigating officers have recovered some surveillance video, Lawler said, but have not yet found anything to identify the suspects.","Tevin A.

"Aid to help women in poor countries give birth safely is being cut – as money to fight global warming in the Third World is increased. Funds for doctors, nurses and midwives to help mothers and babies fell from £221million to £183million. But at the same time, cash for climate change adaptation, low carbon development and protecting forests rose from £281million to £321million. Funds for doctors, nurses and midwives to help mothers and babies fell from £221million to £183million in poor countries. Pictured, a nurse carries a two-month-old child to an Ebola centre in Liberia . Spending by the Department for International Development on anti-malaria bed nets, crucial for protecting people from the disease, also fell sharply to £20.3million last year from £25million the previous year. Critics questioned why money was being diverted from practical life-saving projects towards trendy schemes. The controversy comes as it emerged David Cameron is due to announce this week that Britain will pump even more – up to £600million – into tackling global warming in the Third World. Yesterday the Prime Minister insisted that helping people cope with climate change abroad can help reduce the pressure of immigration at home. Figures in the DfID’s annual report indicate that last year, funding from taxpayers helped four times as many people deal with global warming as it helped mothers give birth safely. David Cameron is due to announce this week that Britain will pump more into tackling global warming . Between 2012/13 and 2013/14, the number helped to ‘cope with the impacts of climate change’ soared from 200,000 to 2.9million. But the number of mothers helped to give birth safely fell from 1million to 700,000. The number of insecticide-treated bed nets given out, another traditional aid activity, dropped from 11.2million to 9.1million. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘People want their money to be used for practical things such as malaria and childbirth – not climate change.’ He added that Britain should not be ‘wasting money on climate change, which I believe is siphoned off for corrupt purposes’. The report showed that last year aid spending rose 30.5 per cent, higher than previously disclosed, to £11.4bilion. This equates to 0.72 per cent of the national budget. Spending soared after the Coalition pledged to spend 0.7 per cent on aid, despite cuts to frontline services in the UK. A section of the report on ‘impact indicators’ shows a rise in the number of those with access to financial services thanks to support from 19.6million to 26.7million. Britain also helped 60.6million people vote in elections, up from 26million. In the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron defended higher aid spending, saying: ‘Breaking our promise to the poorest people in the world would not be the right thing to do. ‘When I think about the problems we are facing, whether it’s the pressure of asylum-seekers or immigration, our aid budget is not the answer, it is part of the answer. ‘If you can solve some of the underlying problems in countries with instability, sometimes caused by climate change, then you are doing the right thing.’ Last night a spokesman for the DfID said Britain spent far more on health aid as a whole than on climate change: £1.3billion in 2013/14 compared to £321million. He added UK aid has saved the lives of 36,000 mothers and 64,000 newborns since 2010.","Money to fight global warming increased as aid for women is being cut .

"It is one of the biggest impact craters on Earth - and until now, scientists have been unsure how it got there. The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3  miles deep. Researchers have been unsure how it formed - but now say it was a giant comet, not a meteorite as previously thought. They say it was caused caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago. The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep. It was formed by a comet hitting Earth 1.8 billion years ago, researchers have found. Following the impact, the large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold, and other metals. As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world's major mining communities. Due to the high mineral content of its soil, the floor of the basin is among the best agricultural land in Northern Ontario. Collaborative research led by geologists at Trinity College Dublin has found strong evidence that one of the largest preserved impact structures on Earth was caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago. The findings of this ancient impact are particularly topical with the current mission to provide more information about comets successfully relaying images of Comet 67P to the European Space Agency. A critical aim of the mission was to test whether the terrestrial hydrosphere was delivered by comets to an originally dry Earth. In a recently published study in the international journal Terra Nova, the Trinity-led geologists explain the rationale behind their assertion that the Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, was caused by a comet - and not a meteorite. Comets are composed by dust and frozen gas and carry few heavy elements, whereas meteorites are solid rocks that delivered iron-loving elements, such as platinum, to a younger Earth. By conducting geochemical analyses of the siderophile (iron-loving) elements found in and around the crater fill – and by modelling the impact with computer software – the geologists showed that whatever crashed to Earth was almost completely vaporised on entry. The large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold, and other metals. The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep. The Vredefort crater, Free State Province, South Africa: 190 miles wide - created 2billion years ago . The Sudbury Basin, Ontario, Canada: 160 miles wide - created 1.8billion years ago . East Warburton Basin, South Australia: 120 miles wide - created 300million years ago . A meteorite of sufficient size to create a crater as large as the Sudbury Basin should only be partially vaporised on entry, which leaves a 'comet-as-culprit' scenario as by far the most likely. Professor of Geology and Mineralogy in the School of Natural Sciences at Trinity, Balz Kamber, said: 'Our findings provide further evidence that some very large terrestrial impact basins were created by comets, which is important and interesting in the context of the early bombardment of our inner Solar System – it might well be that comets were responsible for bringing volatile elements to the young Earth.' The large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold, and other metals. An Image of the basin taken from Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984/1985. It is the second-largest known impact crater or astrobleme on Earth, as well as one of the oldest. A shatter cone from the area, a rare geological feature that only forms in the bedrock beneath meteorite impact craters or underground nuclear explosions. The development of a mining settlement occurred in 1883 after blasting connected to the railway construction revealed a large concentration of nickel and copper ore at the Murray Mine site. As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world's major mining communities. The region is one of the world's largest suppliers of nickel and copper ores, all found on the outer rim of the basin.","Ontario crater is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide, and 9.3 miles deep .

"Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill was famous for his bulldog spirit but a letter has emerged showing he was a big softie when it came to his dogs. The Second World War leader wrote of his sad loss following the death of his beloved pet dog Rufus in 1947 and how he couldn't bear the prospect of losing another when the mutt's replacement fell ill. Rufus was a small poodle who died after being struck by a car. Within a few months Churchill had been given another French miniature poodle who he named Rufus II. But soon after Churchill received him, the dog became seriously ill. The great leader wrote a letter to Bella Lobban, who ran a London kennels that looked after Rufus II whenever Churchill was absent, in which he admits he is fearing the worst. Scroll down for video . Winston Churchill with his pet dog Rufus II in a photo taken in 1950. The wartime leader was an animal lover and kept a menagerie of pets at his estate in Kent . In his 1948 letter (pictured), Churchill admits if Rufus II dies he cannot bear the prospect of losing a third . He wrote: 'I am so sorry that Rufus has developed this distressing complaint, and I hope you will let me know at the end of the three weeks whether or not he has recovered. 'After the said loss of the first one, I feel that I would rather not have another dog just now. Please do not therefore look for another poodle for me. 'I am very grateful to you for the trouble you have taken in looking after Rufus during my absence abroad. Pray let me know what is owing in the way of veterinerary [sic] fees.' As it turned out, Rufus II made a full recovery and lived to the ripe old age of 15 before dying in his sleep in 1962. He was buried in the garden at Chartwell, Churchill's home in Kent. The letter is now coming up for sale along with six charming thank you notes Churchill wrote to Mrs Lobban for gifts she sent to Rufus II throughout the 1950s. Many of the personal notes are similar in content, with one dated 1958 stating typically: 'It was indeed kind of you to send Rufus a new collar and lead. It suits him well, and he is most proud of it.' Churchill, who outwardly presented himself as a very formal and stoic character, was a great animal lover and had a 'menagerie' of pets at Chartwell. He had a great love for cats, especially Jock, a marmalade-coloured moggy with white bib and socks, that comforted him in the latter years of his life. One of Churchill's last requests was that there always be a cat with four white paws and white bib residing at Chartwell. Two letters, dated around the time of Churchill's birthday in 1953 and 1957, show him thanking Miss Lobban for sending him gifts for Rufus II on his birthday . Two more letters reveal Miss Lobban sent a dog collar and coat for Churchill's pet dog Rufus II in 1958 and 1960 . Churchill leaves Buckingham Palace after a 1951 visit with Rufus II riding alongside him . A final letter shows Rufus II was given another collar and lead as a birthday present for Churchill in 1961. Rufus II died the following year and was buried in the garden at Chartwell, Churchill's home in Kent . Earlier this year the National Trust, which was left the property by Churchill's family in 1966, welcomed Jock VI after Jock V left when its owner, the former house and collections manager at the property, moved to Scotland. His affection for Rufus was said to have extended to letting him eat in the family dining room at meal times. He is also said to have covered the dog's eyes while watching a scene from Oliver Twist in which the character Bill Sykes drowned a dog. The letters are being sold by a private collector at Los Angeles auctioneers Nate D Sanders. A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Winston Churchill was devastated when Rufus was killed after being struck by a car while attending a political conference in 1947. Churchill pictured smoking a cigar with Rufus II on his lap at his estate in Kent in 1950 . 'Walter Graebner, who edited Churchill's war memoirs for a magazine format, gave him another dog, whom Churchill named 'Rufus II'. 'These letters to Miss Lobban show Churchill's love and dedication to his dog, while highlighting his appreciation for the Miss Lobban's dedicated care towards his canine companion.' Katherine Barnett, the house and collections manager at Chartwell, said: 'Churchill loved all animals enormously, they played a huge part in his personal life. 'He was devastated when Rufus was killed but it wasn't just dogs he had a passion for, he was also very close to his pet cats. 'When one cat ran away for a few days after he shouted at it, Churchill put up in a note in a window at Chartwell saying ""all is forgiven"".' The series of latter, that are being sold by a private collector, have a started bid of £7,500 and the online auction runs to Thursday.","Letters reveal leader couldn't bear prospect of losing second pet poodle .

"George Zimmerman's estranged wife has revealed that she now has doubts over her husband's innocence in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year. Shellie Zimmerman, who said she has lost 40lbs since appearing with her husband in court, spoke out on Thursday in her first interview since a domestic dispute between the couple this month. She told the Today show she was standing by her story that he had a gun during the altercation in Lake Mary, Florida two weeks ago because of how he touched his shirt - even though she never actually saw a firearm and police said they did not find one. She added that she no longer feels like she can trust her husband or his version of events in the Trayvon Martin shooting after how he has treated her. 'I'm conflicted,' she said. 'I believe the evidence but this revelation in my life has helped me take the blinders off. I think anyone would doubt that innocence because I don't know the person I've been married to.' Scroll down for video . Questions: Speaking on the Today show on Thursday, Shellie Zimmerman said she has doubts over her estranged husband's innocence in the killing of Trayvon Martin as she feels like she no longer knows him . Weight loss: Shellie told the Today show that she has lost 40lbs since her husband's murder trial earlier this year, left, and she looked undeniably more svelte as she appeared on the show . She added: 'I have doubts but I also believe the evidence. I respect the jury's decision.' Shellie, 26, spoke to Matt Lauer nearly three weeks after she frantically called 911 claiming her husband had his hand on a gun and was threatening to shoot her and her father in Lake Mary, Florida. She claimed that Zimmerman had punched her father and smashed her iPad. But Zimmerman disputed the claims, instead blaming Shellie for starting the argument and hitting him with the iPad. Police responded to the scene but neither side pressed charges. The dispute came days after she filed for divorce against her husband of more than six years, explaining that their marriage had been 'irretrievably broken'. Speaking on the Today show, Shellie Zimmerman said she maintains he had a gun outside the house, even though police officers said they did not find any firearms. In court: She stood by her husband throughout his murder trial, pictured, but said she is now moving on . 'I absolutely stand by my story,' she said. 'I did not see a gun but I know my husband. I saw him in a stance and a look in his eyes that I've never seen before. 'He was putting his hand in his shirt saying, ""Please step closer, please step closer"". Logically I assumed he had a gun on him.' She said she regrets not pressing charges . but said she remains on probation and officers 'made it clear' that she . would go to jail if charges were filed. Shellie Zimmerman was sentenced to one year probation and 100 hours of community service after she pleaded guilty to lying to the court about the couple's finances during his bail hearing. She added that despite this unwavering commitment to him, their relationship had changed throughout the murder trial because he treated her as if she was 'disposable'. 'I felt like I was living a life with . him and that we were going to rebuild after this, but he had other . plans,' she said on the show.

Doubts: She said she has doubts over her husband's innocence in the shooting of Trayvon Martin (pictured) in Florida last year because she no longer knows her husband. He was found not guilty . She said that she has so far been unable to serve him with the divorce papers as she does not know where he is.

"Actress checked into centre on Monday for 30-day programme . Treatment described as 'maintenance' for bipolar II disorder . Catherine spent five days in a treatment centre in Connecticut in 2011 . Catherine Zeta-Jones has checked in to a centre to get additional treatment  for her Bipolar II disorder. The 43-year-old Academy Award winner checked in to the treatment centre Monday and is expected to complete a 30-day programme. 'Catherine has proactively checked into a health care facility,' her spokesperson Cece Yorke confirmed to America's People magazine. 'Previously Catherine has said that she is committed to periodic care in order to manage her health in an optimum manner.' Happy and healthy: Catherine Zeta Jones was last seen at the 40th Chaplin Awards Gala Honoring Barbara Streisand in New York on April 22 with her husband Michael Douglas - she checked into a treatment centre for bipolar on Monday . A source tells the publication that . Zeta-Jones was planning to return to treatment as a way for doctors to . monitor her medication. 'There . was no big problem,' insisted the insider. 'This was just a good time . to do it. She is in between projects. This has always been part of the . plan. She would manage her health. She is vigilant about it.' Another source also told TMZ she has not had a relapse, adding: 'It's maintenance.' Jones first sought help in 2011, at . the time her spokesperson said that Catherine had 'made the decision to . check in to a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her . Bipolar II disorder.' Catherine looked fine on April 22nd . when she attended the 40th Anniversary Chaplin Award Gala at Lincoln . Center with her husband Michael Douglas, who attended the White House . Correspondents' Dinner in Washington without her - an unusual . occurrence. In 2011 she stayed for five days, . joining 10 to 15 others in the £770-a-day detox centre at the hospital . in New Canaan, Connecticut. Going strong: Catherine looked radiant at the premiere of her last film, Side Effects, in January . Her publicist confirmed that she had received mental health treatment to help her cope with her traumatic personal life. ‘After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the . decision to check into a mental health facility for a brief stay to . treat her bipolar  II disorder,’ she said. ‘She’s feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on two upcoming films.’ New York Mental Health Consultant Stefanie Weiss, who has not treated the actress, believes that the decision to return to a treatment centre would have been especially difficult, given her high-profile identity. 'Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that is not easy for anyone to live with, especially when the Hollywood spotlight is constantly on you,' she told MailOnline. 'Catherine Zeta Jones going back into treatment for a disorder that she struggles with is an extremely difficult and private decision. It is unfortunate that she needs the added stress of reporting to the media and her many fans that she needs to take this time to improve her mental health. 'Hopefully, her courageous decision to seek help will inspire more people to do the same.' Facility: The actress spent five days at the Silver Hill Hospital near New Canaan, Connecticut . Douglas, with whom she has two young children, battled stage four throat cancer in 2010, enduring both chemotherapy and . radiation. Catherine showed signs that she was struggling to cope with her emotions when she broke down in public that September at the Ryder Cup Welcome To Wales concert at Cardiff Millennium Stadium. Catherine had been booked months before her husband fell ill to speak at the event and had to go to the event solo as he was treated back in New York. A traumatic event can sometimes cause symptoms of the mood-altering illness. Experts . say patients experience both elevated moods - which may lead to bouts . of increased activity - as well as episodes of depression. Unlike bipolar I, the 'up' moods do not  reach full-on levels of mania. Rather . than descending into deep depressions, patients can be very outgoing, . functional and often more productive than normal, one reason why it . often goes undiagnosed. People . in a hypomanic state also often have a decreased need for sleep. They . are also said to be at a higher risk of committing suicide. Celebrities who have reportedly battled various forms of bipolar . disorder have included Britney Spears, Stephen Fry and Charlie Sheen. It is treatable with medication. Dr Michael Roizen, America’s first Chief Wellness Officer, claims genetics can also be a factor. ‘If one or more of your parents has the mood disorder, you are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. ‘Other . contributing factors include stress, illness, death, or a job loss. Also, researchers believe that bipolar disorder may be caused in part by . an imbalance in any or all of the brain chemicals norepinephrine, . serotonin, and dopamine.’ ‘Sometimes . a traumatic event that causes a lot of stress can cause bipolar II . disorder to develop. Other possible causes include an abnormal amount of . hormones and drug use,’ added a spokeswoman for the US Honour Society . of Nursing. But the strain was too much for her and she broke down when talking about him in her native Wales in front of the 13,000 strong audience. The 68-year-old . announced in January 2011 that doctors had declared him free of cancer . following six months of gruelling treatment. The actor accompanied his ‘emotionally distraught’ wife as she . checked into the hospital under the name Terrie Kirny, the National . Enquirer magazine claimed. A witness at the hospital told the magazine that the Welsh-born . actress, who was made a CBE in February, appeared ‘happy’ during her . stay. She apparently joined fellow guests for meals, jogs around the grounds and even poker sessions before bed. Miss Zeta-Jones often appeared to be on edge in public during Douglas’s treatment for throat cancer. She was close to tears at New York’s John F Kennedy airport after . she reportedly cut short a visit to the UK when her husband’s . conditioned worsened. In February, she flew into a rage at a photographer in London, . claiming he hit her as she and Douglas returned to their hotel after . dinner. The Enquirer also quoted an observer who said she had ‘really put the . red wine away’ during two recent visits with Douglas to a Manhattan . restaurant. Miss Zeta-Jones claimed in 2004 that a stalker’s threats against her . left her so shaken that she feared she would have a nervous breakdown. The Enquirer quotes a family source as saying: ‘It’s been the most . difficult year of her life. She’s been through hell! The pressure has . been almost unbearable.’ Claiming that the actress had suffered ‘more sleepless nights than . you could possibly know’ worrying about her husband, the source added: . ‘Catherine had a lot of trouble coping. She was chain-smoking and . drinking. ‘It was tearing Catherine apart to see such a vital man as Michael in such a weakened state. I think she was crumbling.’ Zeta-Jones said as much in an interview last September in which . she spoke of the pain of watching her husband dealing with cancer and . her ‘fury’ that doctors did not spot it earlier. The couple’s stress levels will not have been helped by moves this . week by Douglas’s first wife, Diandra, to revive her court battle for a . share of  his Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps earnings. Family time: Catherine and Michael with their children Dylan and Carys at Disneyland in November . Her camp pressed a judge to reconsider his view that the . case belongs in California. The couple divorced there in 2000 after 23 . years together. His lawyer said her client's ex 'should be ashamed of herself' for . seeking more when she had already received more than $51 million in . their divorce settlement. Douglas' adult son Cameron, from his marriage to Diandra, was sentenced to prison last year on drug charges. Zeta-Jones and Douglas are parents to son Dylan, 10, and daughter Carys, who turns eight on April 20.

"Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant complained that too few hotels had British staff . Labour was today accused of peddling 'xenophobic rhetoric' after a senior frontbencher complained about receptionists in hotels being foreign. In controversial remarks, Labour’s shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said it ‘would be nice’ to go into a hotel in this country which had a British receptionist. He said he was ‘angry’ at employers for failing to train and employ Brits, relying instead on people from Latvia and Estonia. But the Tories said the comments were proof that Ed Miliband's party was 'confused' on the issue of immigration and was 'cynically' trying to grab headlines. Mr Bryant, the MP for Rhondda in south Wales, said local businesses had been unable to fill jobs with local people. ‘I have very high levels of youth unemployment in my constituency; it has risen by some 200 per cent in the last year,’ he told BBC2’s Newsnight. ‘I do get quite angry with some British employers, who’ve decided not to bother train British youngsters to work in the hospitality industry or the construction industry. ‘It would be nice sometimes when you go into a British hotel if the receptionist was British. ‘We need to give our young people to have the skills and the opportunities to get those jobs. ‘There is a hotel in my constituency quite often it’s not been able to employ locally, it has ended up employing people from Estonia and Latvia, often people from Estonia and Latvia have so much get up and go they’ve got up and gone.’ He was speaking during a debate on the impact of immigration in the UK, ahead of limits being lifted next year on the number of people from Bulgaria and Romania who can settle elsewhere in the European Union. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said: 'Chris Bryant's choice of words are irresponsible and unwise. 'His comments demonstrate how confused Labour are over the issue of immigration. Labour have gone from an ""open door"" policy leaving the country to cope with 2 million migrants, to cynically  peddling xenophobic rhetoric.' Mr Bryant complained that he never met a British person on a hotel reception desk . Victor Ponta, the prime minister of Romania, admitted there is a problem with citizens of his country coming to Britain and committing crimes. He said Roma gypsies, in particular, posed a 'huge challenge' to law enforcement by begging and stealing mobile phones. Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta has admitted there is a problem with citizens of his country coming to Britain and committing crimes . And he backed Britain's moves to tighten up access to benefits for Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants. It came as surverys suggested 150,000 Romanians and 200,000 Bulgarians are planning to move to Britain. During the debate Mr Bryant apologised the immigration policy of the Labour government, in which he was a minister. He said:’ In all situations where you have one country where wages are much lower than in another country, then people will be prepared, despite having very advanced skills and knowledge and qualifications, to work at much lower level in another country. ‘One of the things we have to take into consideration – absolutely – well, yes – can I do the apology on behalf of the Labour party. ‘I mean look, there was a very serious mistake that was made in 2004, which is that, all the main political parties believed in enlargement of the European Union. ‘The point is that we went out – Britain went out on a limb – Britain decided that unlike France and Germany and Italy that we would allow people to come to the UK, immediately from day one.’","Chris Bryant says employers are forced to hire Estonians and Latvians .

"The family of a terminally ill South Carolina girl who is dying of a rare genetic disorder have voluntary put themselves in quarantine for the last six months as they fight to find a cure for their daughter's sickness. Glenn and Cara O'Neil have had little-to-no contact with the outside world since May in an effort to prolong the life of little Eliza, who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), a genetic and terminal disorder that means she lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function. The condition eventually causes a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Quarantine: Four-year-old Eliza O'Neill (pictured), who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), has not left her home in Colombia, South Carolina, since May after her family started a voluntary quarantine . Family: Eliza (pictured with her father, Glenn, mother, Cara, and brother Beckham) was born with the terminal disorder . Father and daughter: The youngster (pictured with her father) lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function, causing a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate -  which leads to leaning and behavioral problems . Quarantine: Cara O'Neil wipes down groceries before allowing them into the house . Protective: A team from Inside Edition don special suits before entering the O'Neil's house . Outdoors: The height of the family's outdoor fun is doing circles on their yard on bikes . Mrs O'Neill has quit her job as a pediatrician and homeschools Eliza's older brother, seven-year-old Beckham. Mr O'Neil also works from home. The family's food is ordered online and all of the groceries have to be wiped down with disinfectant wipes when they arrive at the house. Everything else they need is ordered on Amazon. 'It was something that we could do to protect Eliza,' Mrs O'Neil told Inside Edition. 'We've heard, ''You're being overly cautious'', but how can you be overcautious when you're talking about the chance of life for your child?' Mr O'Neil added. While they believe the quarantine will help her live longer, Eliza's family realize the only way to really save her is to find a cure. They launched a fundraising campaign for the disease nearly a year ago. They expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday, which was last weekend. Aalthough the she can still talk, Mr O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. 'It's the disease beginning to catch up with her,' he told ABC News. 'This disease just kind of taunts you. You don't know when things are coming but you see them happening.' To celebrate her birthday on Sunday, Eliza had a party with her father, mother Cara and brother in the family's backyard, where Mr O'Neill dressed up like a clown and juggle. As far as outdoor acitivites go, the family ride bikes in circles in their yard. At home and in hospital: When Eliza's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago, they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday . Homeschool: Cara O'Neil quit her job and teaches her two children from home . Sick: And although the five-year-old can still talk, her father, Glenn O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. Above, Eliza is seen in hospital with her mother . Campaign: To celebrate her fifth birthday on Sunday, Eliza had a party with her family. The family hoped to raise $600,000 on the day as part of their push to find a cure . But even the milestone celebrations will not distract  the O'Neill's from their fundraising efforts, with the family hoping to raise a staggering $600,000 on the day to help fulfill Eliza's wish to live. They have already gained more than $1.7 million on a GoFundMe page, and another $400 elsewhere, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza. Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births. Victims lack an enzyme that is essential for normal cellular function. The condition eventually causes a buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Sufferers typically die before they are out of their teens. There is no known cure. The funds - which have come from more than 26,000 donors from 70 different countries - means the family is close to their goal. Although there is no guarantee that the treatment will get approved or work - or that Eliza will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try. 'If we don't get the trial funded, and we don't get it up and running, the guarantee is that she has no chance,' he told the news station. He added that the family has remained at home for the past six months to prevent Eliza from catching any viruses. Her mother, a pediatrician, has left her job, while her brother is being homeschooled. 'We're trying to do everything we can to keep her as happy and as healthy and as sharp as she can be,' said Mr O'Neill, who describes the disease as 'a parent's worst nightmare'. 'For the next however many months it takes to get to the point where, hopefully, she can be treated.' Siblings: The O'Neill's have already gained over $1.3million on a GoFundMe page, and another $400 elsewhere, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza (seen with her brother) Loving family: The funds - which have come from more than 26,000 donors from 70 different countries - means the family is close to their goal. Above, the O'Neill's laugh together in a still from their video campaign . Kindhearted: Donors have so far raised a staggering $1.75 million on the GoFundMe page (right) for Eliza (left) Sanfilippo Syndrome, named after pediatrician Sylvester Sanfilipoo, affects around 1 in 70,000 live births, said Doug McCarty, a researcher at Nationwide Children's hospital in Columbus, Ohio. While there is currently no cure, the hospital  has found a potential gene therapy that, in a study, successfully rid mice of heparin sulfate buildup, according to Fox News. Researchers have proposed what they feel is a sufficient toxicology plan to move forward with the clinical trial. They aim to go ahead with the treatment in 2015. It is this therapy - a 'glimmer of hope' - that Eliza's family hope they will be able to fund. Trying his best: 'We're trying to do everything we can to keep Eliza as happy and as healthy and as sharp as she can be,' said Mr O'Neill (pictured), who describes Sanfilippo Syndrome as 'a parent's worst nightmare'","Eliza O'Neill, of South Carolina, suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A)

"A deputy care home manager 'waved her breasts in the face of an 88-year-old dementia sufferer' before hauling him out of his chair, biting him between the legs and calling him a 'dirty old man', a court heard. Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was 'taking revenge' on pensioner Ken Pinkney for breaking her mother Margaret's shoulder while agitated, it has been claimed. During her time at Roundstone Care Residential Home in Filey, North Yorkshire, Koralewski also allegedly forced another dementia sufferer, Elizabeth Hall, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea, Teesside Crown Court heard. Siobhan Koralewski (pictured) was a senior carer at Roundstone Care Residential Home in Filey, North Yorkshire, which her parents owned, when she allegedly 'waved her breasts' in the face of the resident . Deputy care home manager Koralewski, 30, (left) was allegedly 'taking revenge' on 88-year-old dementia sufferer Ken Pinkney after he broke her 67-year-old mother Margaret's (right) shoulder while agitated . When Ms Hall screamed she did not want to drink the concoction, Koralewski put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before pulling a 'wedgie' on her to force her to move, the jury was told today. Koralewski and her 67-year-old mother both deny four counts of ill-treating four residents at the now-closed care home between June and November 2012. Former care worker Jennifer Price took to the witness stand today to describe how she arrived in the care home's dining room at 9am on July 17, 2012, to witness the attack on Mr Pinkney. Ms Price told the court: 'When Siobhan was dancing around in front of him she took her top off. She had a vest top on underneath. 'She said ""Do you like that you dirty old man?"". She was waving her breasts around in his face. 'Siobhan pulled Mr Pinkney out of his chair by the legs. She sat on top of his stomach, holding his arms down, and started bouncing up and down on his tummy.' The court heard Mr Pinkney was screaming for his daughter and trying to get up and lash out while Margaret did nothing to stop what was going on. Ms Price said: 'Siobhan moved down a bit and bit him and he screamed. She bit him between the legs at the top. She got off him to answer the phone.' Koralewski and her 67-year-old mother Margaret (pictured to the front), are both accused of mistreating four dementia patients at the care home. They deny the charges and the trial at Teesside Crown Court continues . Former care worker Jennifer Price (pictured outside court with Siobhan Koralewski's brother Jeremy) took to the witness stand today to describe how she saw the attack on Mr Pinkney unfold at 9am on July 17, 2012 . She also saw Siobhan slap Mr Pinkney three or four times across the face, she told the court. 'It was loud enough to make a sound but not leave a mark,' she added. Siobhan then 'roughly' put Mr Pinkney in the passenger seat of her car and drove him to Cross Lane Psychiatric Hospital in Scarborough. 'When she got back she told me she had fastened his seatbelt really tight and had the window open all the way there so he got cold,' Ms Price said. Ms Price told the jury she would also see Siobhan preparing mixtures of leftover drinks for Ms Hall, 59, who suffered from Downs Syndrome, learning difficulties and dementia. She said: 'She was making a drink of all the drinks Liz had left - three or four drinks of tea she would not drink during the day. 'Liz was crying because she did not want to drink her drinks. Siobhan put her hand over her mouth and said ""shut up"". 'Siobhan then did what she often did to get Elizabeth to move - held onto the belt of her trousers and pulled them up. 'She was like ""wedgie-ing"" them so they had no option but to walk up the stairs. Elizabeth was screaming,' Ms Price added. Koralewski, 30, and her mother Margaret, 67, both deny four counts of ill-treating four residents at the now-closed care home between June and November 2012. The trial at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) continues . In another alleged incident, when dealing with stroke victim Harold Waller, 91, who was supposed to be guided patiently along on his zimmer frame, Siobhan walked with him 'with her knee driving him forward while she held him up,' Ms Price claimed. 'He used to be shaking and worried about falling,' she added. Earlier Siobhan's brother Jeremy, who is also Ms Price's partner, told the court his sister 'hated her job'. He added: 'She couldn't handle the stress. She shouted a lot at everybody. She had no managerial skills. She had no people skills. 'She is not stupid. She just hasn't got patience. 'Elizabeth Hall used to hide in her bedroom and ask 'Is Siobhan here today?' if she was, she would not come out.' The trial continues.

"Bed-blocking is bringing the NHS ‘to its knees’ with doctors unable to discharge more than 1,000 patients each day, a study reveals today. The crisis has deepened due to a lack of available council-provided care for the elderly. On one day this September, staff were unable to move 4,966 patients to another part of the NHS or into council care – the most since 2010. That month, a total 138,068 ‘days of care’ were lost due to these delayed transfers, analysis by Sky News found. With bed places costing £250 a day, this suggests that NHS hospitals are wasting £34million a month on patients that should not still be there. Backlog: A lack of social care is keeping the elderly in hospital and research suggests that NHS hospitals are wasting £34million every month on patients that should not still be there (file picture, posed by model) The number of ‘acute’ admissions unable to be transferred from beds that could have been used for accident and emergency wards was also found to have hit the highest level on record – meaning ambulances have nowhere to put incoming patients. More than a quarter of the delays were attributed to a lack of social care. Funding for this has dropped significantly since the Coalition came to power, as councils look to cut costs. The main reason cited for social care-related delays was ‘patients awaiting a care package in their own home’. NHS chief Sir Bruce Keogh told Sky News that bed-blocking is a ‘major issue’. He added: ‘I was concerned about it as a practising surgeon, I’m concerned about it as a medical director. 'If you can’t get patients out of hospital and back into their own homes – where they’re safe and want to be – then the whole system backs up, you can’t treat people effectively in A&E, ambulances start to form queues at the front door.’ A recent survey by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust found 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied by someone who could have been moved on. Worried: Sir Bruce Keogh described bed-blocking as a ‘major issue’ and said he was concerned . A&E consultant Dr Susan Robinson, from Addenbrooke’s Hospital, said: ‘If we’re crowded it’s because the hospital’s crowded, and the hospital’s crowded because they can’t get patients out. The crowded hospital is almost bringing us to our knees.’ Chris Hopson, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network which represents hospital bosses, said: ‘We are going back downhill to 15 years ago, when the NHS was an international joke because you had to wait most of the day in an A&E department. Nobody wants to go back to that but you get what you pay for.’ Social care is provided at home and in the community by local authorities but, under pressure from the Government to cut costs, they have slashed budgets by around a fifth, or almost £3.5billion in total. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is truly sad that record numbers of older people are trapped in hospital when they are well enough to be at home. Rather than rising to the challenge of the ageing society, we are going backwards and care is getting worse.’ A Department of Health spokesman said that even though the numbers of bed-blockers has gone up, the rate of delayed discharges as a proportion of hospital admissions has gone down. ‘The figures actually show that hospitals are discharging patients more quickly on average than at any time since the NHS started collecting this data,’ he said.","Medics unable to discharge more than 1,000 patients each day, study says .

The number of senior nurses in the NHS has fallen by almost 3,400 since the election. New figures show there are now only 63,458 – down from 66,832 in May 2010. The Royal College of Nursing said: ‘Cutting senior nursing posts means that the NHS has lost vital experience and knowledge, built up over many years, at a time when it needs it more than ever.’"
"A Catholic priest who announced his resignation last week after confessing he made a woman pregnant has now become the father of a baby boy. Father Daniel McFalls’ son was born on Saturday and given the name, Gabriel. ‘He’s a beautiful kid,’ said the 58-year-old McFalls after the birth. McFalls - known as Dean - from St. Mary's Catholic Church in Stockton, California, voluntarily quit his post on Tuesday after admitting he had got a woman pregnant. Scroll down for video... New father: Catholic priest, Dean McFalls is now the father of a baby boy, Gabriel, who was born on Saturday . Quit: McFalls voluntarily stepped down from his post on Tuesday after admitting he had got a woman pregnant . In a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation, McFalls said: 'A child will soon be born, and I am the baby’s father. I know this comes as a shock to you and, to many, a disappointment. 'I assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that I can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves. McFalls' was given an indefinite leave of absence by Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, head of the Diocese of Stockton, and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest. The identity of the mother has not yet been released, nor whether he intends to marry her. At the time of McFalls’ controversial confession, one of members of his congregations said they were glad he was gone, calling him ‘flirty’. 'Flirty': Some of the parishioners said he was flirty, while others said he was just plain friendly . Diana Garcia, who has attended the church for 15 years, said he has pursued other woman, including her daughters. 'He’s just lustful. He didn’t say he was in love or [will] marry the girl, no. 'It’s not about being a sinner, it’s about playing with God, he made a vow, this is a priest we’re talking about.' However, some long-time parishioners said his friendly disposition may be perceived by some as flirtatious. ‘He’s a very friendly man and everyone thinks that he’s their best friend. So, you can misconstrue that,’ Cathleen Cavanaugh told Fox 40. ‘He spreads himself to everybody. He loves the poor, the young, the sick.’ 'Loves everyone': Cathleen Cavanaugh, a long-time parishioner said McFalls would spread his love to everyone . McFalls said the accusations by some of the members were unfounded. ‘I was pretty hurt … My reputation was really damaged,’ he said. ‘I went out of my way to make a public confession and acknowledge my error and take responsibility.’ He spoke about one woman who asked him to do an exorcism. ‘When I said I wasn’t free to exorcise her at that time she said that she was going to take it farther …because she was possessed, and  I want to pray for her. I’ve known her for years.’ 'Pretty hurt': McFalls said his reputation was damaged after his confession and said he was hurt by some of the accusations from members of the parish . 'Wonderful': Terri Lomeli, another parishioner, said the priest was always there to help the people in his congregation . Another long-time parishioner, Terri Lomeli, said the accusations were not ‘accurate in any way’. ‘I’ve known him for quite some time, and I have never felt that that would be accurate in any way. He’s been nothing but wonderful,’ she said. ‘I’ve had a rough couple of years, and he has been over to my home many times just with a call to say prayers with my family and children at all different times of the day,’ said Lomeli.","Father Daniel 'Dean' McFalls’ son was born on Saturday and given the name, Gabriel .

"Women may claim they are attracted to a man for his personality, looks or even . his money, but the naked truth is far simpler and cruder that that: size matters. New research has shown that 21st century females are far more similar to their cavewomen ancestors than originally thought, because the size of a man's penis still plays a key role in deciding how attractive a woman rates him. The findings are based on 5,145 computer-generated images of men shown to over 100 . adult women of all ages and backgrounds, . Big is better: Women might not admit it but they prefer well-endowed men . Each image showed a representation of the male form, with varying combinations of height, shoulder-to-body . ratio and, of course, penis length. Flaccid penis sizes . of between two and five inches (five to 13cm) were used because this is the typical . size range found in Western men, according to the study carried out by researchers at the . University of Ottawa, Canada. Women were then asked to rate the attractiveness of each man, according to the research published in the journal . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The results showed that while women's opinions were influenced by . a variety of physical features - tall and broad-shouldered men tended to be . favoured over shorter men with bigger waistlines - the size of a man's penis reigned supreme in the attractiveness stakes. The findings contradict previous studies suggesting that the size of male genitalia was of no importance to . women. While researchers were unable to find the perfect penis size, proportion is crucial, they say. In what may come as a relief . to many men, manhood must not be so large that it appears out . of proportion to the rest of his body. The long and short of it: Women shown a variety of computer-generated men said penis size was the most important trait . They said: 'Our results directly contradict claims that penis size is unimportant to most females. They show that female mate choice could have played a role in the evolution of the relatively large human male penis.' 'Males with a larger penis were rated as . being relatively more attractive, but, the proportional increase [in size] begins . to decrease [in attractiveness] after a certain size,' said the report. The Canadian study comes after another investigation carried out by the . University of the West of Scotland found that a larger than average penis is more . likely to bring women to orgasm. In the Scottish study, an average . length penis was defined as being 5.8 inches (14.7 cm) long when erect - the same . length as a ten pound note.","Size of a man's penis still plays key role in deciding how attractive a woman finds him, say Canadian experts .

"The cheerleader who has proudly shared snaps of her posing with dead exotic animals in Africa has received death threats from Real Housewives of Miami star Joanna Krupa, her father has claimed. Kendall Jones, a 19-year-old cheerleader for Texas Tech, has received numerous threats by phone and email for her hunting hobby, including one from the model and animal rights activist, said TMZ. According to Jones' father Cody, Krupa wrote on Instagram: 'This b**** Kendall Jones killed this beautiful creature so she post a selfie! That lion is an endangered species... breaks my f***ing [heart] not to mention he had a family... I wish I can fly to Africa and shoot her ugly ass.' The message has since been removed and Krupa, 35, has not commented on the claims. Fight: Real Housewives of Miami star Joanna Krupa, pictured last week, has reportedly sent an angry Instragram message to a teenage hunter that the girl has interpreted as a death threat . Cody said his daughter believed the 'uneducated' message was a death threat but has not contacted authorities because: 'We're in Texas and we feel safe here.' Facebook has now deleted Jones' trophy photos showing the rhinos, elephants, lions and leopards that she has killed or tranquilized in Africa. On Thursday, Facebook removed some of the images that violated their standards. In a statement, it said it removes 'reported content that . promotes poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for . organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'. Removed: Facebook had taken down this photo of Kendall Jones, 19, with a lion that she hunted in Africa. The social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards . It came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles . proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from . extinction. 'For the sake of all animals,' the petition against Jones reads as it implores . animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' After starting the social media firestorm, the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife. In a typo-laden defense that invokes . the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, she claimed . killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them. 'This . is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become . extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook. Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse' '[Roosevelt] . was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now . chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, . how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from . the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never . understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless . Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't . always space for threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' 'This is a conservation effort!': The Texas Tech cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them . Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed. One . particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely . endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the . Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The . vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, . treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to . be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino . population through conservation,' she wrote. However, . Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, . elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a . white rhino, which number around 20,000. Because . of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her . dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be . banned from hunting in Africa completely. Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Cruelty': Critics say she is not . a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures . Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall . Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has . been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads . the petition. It . continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television . hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as . a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.' But she also has her supporters. A Facebook account, Support Kendall Jones, has also started. 'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page. Jon .","Kendall Jones, 19, has drawn the ire of thousands with her Facebook photos showing her smiling alongside rare African beasts .
On Friday, her father claimed that one of the threatening message she had received came from model and rights activist Joanna Krupa .
But they had not reported the message - in which Krupa said she wanted to 'shoot her ugly ass' - to cops because they feel safe in Texas .

"Thieves left a gaping hole in the side of a convenience store after using a digger to steal a cash machine. The suspects used the machine to smash through the brick wall of Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, before fleeing from the scene with the ATM. Police found a stolen Caterpillar telescopic loader, which had been used in the raid, doused in petrol and set on fire. Scroll down for video . Thieves used a digger to smash a huge hole in a convenience store wall so they could steal a cash machine . The Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, was attacked just before 2am yesterday . Police found a yellow Caterpillar telescopic loader on fire outside the shop which was used in the theft . The theft, which took place at 2am yesterday, comes weeks after another cash machine theft in Malvern and another attempted ATM theft in Sapcote, Leicestershire. During the incident in Malvern, the cash machine was ripped from the the wall of a Marks and Spencer store in the town's retail park, leaving a 10ft hole. The digger used in that raid was also left at the scene. Police are now investigating whether or not the offences are linked. After the incident, Jerry Tweney, store manager of Budgens, said: 'We got alerted about it around 1.50am, and there was a huge JCB on fire. 'We think it has been used to ram into the wall just over the cash machine and used to pull the machine out. 'We don't know what they loaded the machine onto. It all happened really quickly, all within four to five minutes. The digger and shop was cordoned off (pictured) after it was doused in petrol and set on fire by the suspects . Thieves fled from the scene with the cash machine, but left the stolen digger outside the shop (pictured) 'CCTV managed to pick up the lights from the JCB. They set fire to it. 'It looks like they poured petrol over it and then set it on fire. It also looks like they might have hot wired it.' The shop continued to trade as the damage only destroyed part of the customer toilets and staff canteen. Mr Tweney said: 'We've never had this happen to us before. Everyone is a little shocked.' It is not the first time this has happened in Moreton. In August 2011, thieves used farming machines to smash into the Tesco store, also on the High Street, in the early hours of the morning. In that instance, a Redrock handler vehicle was used, and it was believed no cash was taken. Ram raiders also smashed into an antiques centre in the town in 2009. The theft comes weeks after another cash machine theft in Malvern (pictured) in which a digger left a 10ft hole in the side of a Marks & Spencer store . Steve Farnsworth, who owns Grimes House Gallery, near Budgens, who shops was previously targeted by thieves, said: 'Events of this nature seem to be happening again. 'I know there have been a few incidents in the Cotswolds, and a few here as well. It's something I'm very sad to see have happened again, and I hope the police will catch the people responsible. 'The police need to stamp their authority on this, and find the people as soon as possible. I'm very sad for the staff at the store and it's something no one wants to see.' Detective Constable Jon Newton said: 'We are investigating all lines of enquiry at this time in order to keep an open mind on this offence. 'However we are not ruling out that it may be related to other similar offences that have taken place recently within the region. 'We do appeal for anyone who was in the area and may have seen something to contact the police.' Anyone with information should call the police at 101, quoting incident 29 of November 17.","Incident took place at Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucs .

During tests, an 11-stone (70kg) volunteer crawled up a 12ft (3.6 metre) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet.

During tests, an 11-stone (70kg) volunteer crawled up a 12ft (3.6 metre) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet (pictured) But, unlike the sucker-gloves employed by Mr Cruise, or the science fiction of Marvel comic books, the latest gecko devices are real and technologically sophisticated. They employ the same natural molecular forces that allow gecko lizards to scurry around on ceilings. Geckos climb on a wide variety of surfaces, including smooth surfaces such as glass. They have adhesive pressures of 15 to 30 pounds (6.8kg to 13.6kg) per square inch for each limb, meaning a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe. A gecko's toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure of stalk-like setae - 100 microns in length, 2 microns in radius. From individual setae, a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae - approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest - branch out and contact the climbing surface. These hairs create an electrostatic force known as Van der Waals. It causes neighbouring molecules to be attracted to each other. Although very weak, the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko's toes, allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces.

'We tested hundreds of individual steps on glass with the 70kg (11 stone) climber and 140 square centimetres of adhesive without failure. 'The synthetic adhesion system creates a nearly uniform load distribution across the whole adhesive area, improving upon the adhesive-bearing structures of a gecko's toe and enabling a human to climb vertical glass using an area of adhesive no larger than the area of a human hand.'

"The Catholic priest who quit after getting a woman pregnant has revealed that the mother of his child was a member of his congregation and he now thinks that the Church should allow priests to marry. Father Daniel McFalls left his post at St Mary's in Stockton, California after making the shocking announcement to his parish that he was going to be a first-time father. The baby- a boy, named Daniel Gabriel- has since been born and the former priest is speaking out about how he feels the Church needs to change with the times. New kind of Father: Daniel 'Dean' McFalls announced that he was stepping down as a Catholic priest because he got one of his parishioners pregnant and will be helping raise the baby boy . 'It's sad I had to choose between caring for this child and all the people I care for at our church. It's sad I was put in that position,' he told The New York Daily News. 'I know I'm not worthy to be speaking publicly about this because I'm a sinner, but I hope this might help the Catholic Church to look more deeply at the possibility of finding some way to open the door to a married priesthood.' One of those parishioners who was particularly close to his heart was the mother of his newborn child. He has not revealed her name, but said that she is a 'discreet' member of his church. 'When that little baby was born at 5.22am, it was the happiest moment of my life, along with my ordination,' he told the news site. 'Nothing on earth equals the joy I feel when I see his little face. When you hold a baby, you know that child contains the whole universe. You see the eyes of God looking back at you saying, ""Where do you stand?""' Pushing for change: Though he knows he will be viewed as a sinner, he feels that the Church laws should change so that priests could be fathers and in the clergy . St. Mary of The Assumption Parish will have to find a new priest after the sudden resignation . The news about the impending childbirth came from a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation. McFalls said: 'A child will soon be born, and I am the baby’s father. I know this comes as a shock to you, and to many a disappointment. 'I assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that I can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves. 'As St. Paul told the “Romans: ‘God makes all things work together for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his decree,’ and though the Lord never decreed that I sin, he does command that all life be respected and nurtured.' McFalls' was given an indefinite leave of absence by Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, head of the Diocese of Stockton, and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest. One member of his congregations has said she is glad he is gone, calling him 'flirty.' Diana Garcia, who has attended the church for 15 years, told Fox News: 'He’s gone after girls before and he’s gone after my daughters.' 'He’s just lustful, he didn’t say he was in love or marry the girl, no. 'It’s not about being a sinner, it’s about playing with God, he made a vow, this is a priest we’re talking about.'","Father Daniel McFalls made the announcement in a letter .

"Tony Abbott, Vladimir Putin and a bikini model. Normally, they would have very, very little in common. But as world leaders sweltered in their suits during the G20, a beautiful blonde in a bikini turned up the heat, made international headlines for working as a news reporter in her bikini. It’s been revealed that this young reporter was Susanne Ward, a Gold Coast model and a reporter for radical online news channel ‘Aussie Beach TV’ - an online news site whose female reporters always conduct interviews partially undressed. Aussie Beach TV hires attractive women to report in their bikinis, in the hope that their stunning appearance will make ‘everyday Australians’ pay attention to the issues that matter. ‘Aussie Beach TV is based on getting the girls in bikinis to do interviews with people because it will actually get people interested and watching,’ Ms Ward told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Susanne Ward, also known as Janaya, interviewed people at the G20 while she wore a bikini for Aussie Beach TV.  Here she is pictured with another character from Aussie Beach TV, bogan 'Jack Russel' Ms Ward was a model (left) when she was approached to report for Aussie Beach TV during the G20 . Ms Ward, 27, says she had absolutely no qualms about flaunting her body to bring attention to politics. ‘I’m a bikini model so I didn’t feel uncomfortable about doing the interview in my bikini. ‘Anyway, I’m happy with what I’ve got going on,’ she says with a laugh. ‘With the forty degree heat, being in a bikini was the best way to do it!’ But Ms Ward, who goes by the stage name Janaya, is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues. ‘A lot of people have a lot to say but none of the normal people get heard,’ she said. ‘But they should be heard because the world is our world.’ Aussie Beach TV spoke to people on the streets in the hope they could give everyday Australians a platform so their opinions would be heard . Ms Ward's unique reporting style on the streets of Brisbane during the G20 made international headlines . During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana . During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana. However she insists her preparation for the weekened only involved ‘buying another bikini’. She says she learnt so much from interviewing everyday people in the street. ‘I never knew about things like how the government is only saying what they want us to know,’ Ms Ward told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Everyone was really smart, people blew me out of the water. The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’. The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’ During the G20, the Aussie Beach TV news crew encountered an irate woman who was offended by Ms Ward’s lack of clothing. ‘One person didn’t like what we were doing, she yelled and swore at the camera,’ said Mr Forest. ‘She asking why we were exploiting a beautiful and intelligent young woman by getting her to degrade herself.’ Mr Forest says that the angered woman's passion is exactly what the news site is all about. ‘We stick up for her right to say that; her free speech and freedom of expression,' he said. ‘So we’re going to put her fight to air because it’s a ripper!’ Janaya learnt a lot from interviewing the protesters at the G20, explaining ‘I never knew about things like how the government is only saying what they want us to know' Janaya is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues . He started the website in late 2011 and they have already made 120 videos. The website also includes ‘bikini entertainment’ including bikini sports, fashion and pool parties. Mr Forest also plays a character in the series named ‘Jack Russel’, an eccentric bogan with a fake mullet and an ocker accent. Mr Forest hopes that his unique approach will appeal to ‘the average Aussie’. He believes his bikini reporters will captivate the audience in a unique way, so everyday Australians will learn about alternative views that do not normally receive media coverage. ‘We want to show all the news that you should have noticed but you were probably distracted, or the stories or opinions that you don’t hear on the news.’ ‘We want to make it fun and more popular to talk about the important stuff.’ ‘Big TV news crews came up to us and said “you have the best job”’ Ms Ward was relieved she was in a bikini because it was the only way to survive the heat. Mr Forest, who was in character as Jack Ruseel, was also affected by the 40 degree temperatures and stripped down to his speedos .","A woman made headlines worldwide for reporting in her bikini at the G20 .

"A seven-year-old girl has uncovered the 100 million year old bones of an extinct  dolphin-like marine reptile that once swam through Australia's ancient inland sea. Amber Wilson was on a family holiday with her parents Tony and Lisa and brother Darcy in outback Queensland when she came across the fossilised bones of an ichthyosaur - a seven-metre animal that was around in the dinosaur age. The Wilsons  had stopped at a known fossil site near the Kronosaurus Korner museum in Richmond, 500km west of Townsville, at the end of their family holiday in July when they made the discovery. Scroll down for video . A seven-year-old girl has uncovered the 100 million year old bones of an extinct dolphin-like marine reptile in outback Queensland . Amber uncovered a large hockey puck-shaped vertebra hidden amongst a pile of rocks, before her family helped discover part of the 1.5m long skull with six centimetre long teeth shortly afterwards. 'Money couldn't buy the incredible experience our family got from finding this fossil,' Mr Wilson said. The family from Wiseleigh in eastern Victoria quickly called for help from the staff at the museum to unearth the huge fossil. 'I was completely stunned. A professional palaeontologist might search their entire career to find a fossil of this quality. It only took the Wilson family a few hours,' Dr Timothy Holland, Kronosaurus Korner's  Curator, said. Amber Wilson visited the Kronosaurus Korner fossil museum with parents Tony and Lisa and brother Darcy in July when she uncovered part of the 1.5m long skull . Nine people were required to lift the estimated 400kg weight of the specimen after it was covered in a protective coating of plaster, newspaper and hessian . 'I have never seen tourists uncover such a beautifully preserved fossil before. It is easily the most complete ichthyosaur skull in our collection and one of the best from Australia. 'We normally run tours out to the free fossil site to show people how to look and dig for fossils. But we didn't need to for the Wilson family, they went out and found it all on their own.' A protective coating of plaster, newspaper and hessian was applied to the bones before the fossil, now nicknamed 'Wilson', was hoisted out of the ground. Nine people were required to lift the estimated 400kg weight of the specimen. Additional rock was removed from the bones using dentist tools and toothbrushes over the following four months. Additional rock was removed from the bones found under piles of rock using dentist tools and toothbrushes over the following four months .

"Christmas trees are already on sale despite there being almost 40 days until the big day (file picture) There are almost 40 days still to go, but major retail chains have started selling real Christmas trees. The move goes against the advice of experts who recommend waiting until at least the first week of December to buy a real tree, and then keeping it away from radiators to ensure it hasn’t faded to a twig by Christmas Day. The usual peak for sales is seven to 10 days before Christmas. Retailers are always keen to bring forward the festive trading period in any way they can. However, 10 Tesco and 35 Dobbies Garden Centre stores have been selling pot grown trees for the past two weeks and began selling cut trees yesterday. Trees grown in a pot from seedling stage last longer as they have a fully formed root system. Some Asda and B&Q stores started selling real trees at the weekend. Shoppers have a choice of the traditional Norway Spruce, which is renowned for quickly drying out and dropping its needles, together with the more expensive Nordmann Fir and the luxuriant Fraser Fir, which will last longer. The official advice on the website of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association reads: ‘It is suggested that trees should not be purchased earlier than December 1.’ Shopper Sarah Taylor, who noticed Asda selling trees at a store in Clapham, said: ‘If you put a Christmas trees up now in a house with central heating it will be dead in a few weeks. By Christmas it will look like a stick. ‘All the needles will drop or the branches will droop in a few weeks and we have about five and a half weeks to go before Christmas Day. How are you supposed to defy nature? A tree will be dead by Christmas. ‘We haven’t even got to the first Sunday in Advent. Why are people buying them now? It’s miles too early, you’ll have to buy another one in a few weeks to make sure it looks good for Christmas.’ She added: ’It’s all rubbish and one-upmanship. It’s nothing to do with Christmas if you have the tree now. Why is it getting earlier and earlier?’ Harry Brightwell, of the BCTGA, said the useful life of a cut tree depends on the variety and how it is cared for. Buying Christmas trees this early could leave them 'looking like a stick' by the time the big day arrives (file picture) ‘The Nordmann Fir tends to last longer than the Norway Spruce,’ he said. ‘It is a bit like buying a bunch of daffodils. Most people can tell the difference between a nice fresh bunch and some that have been sitting around for a while. It is the same with a tree. ‘To prolong the life, it is a good idea to cut half an inch off the bottom and leave it outside to stand in a bucket of water for while so it can drink in the water. You then need to put it into a stand where you can top it up with water every day. ‘You wouldn’t put a bunch of flowers next to a radiator and you should adopt the same policy with a Christmas tree, otherwise it will dry out.’ He added: ‘The earlier you buy a tree the more difficult it is. After all, it is a cut plant. Our advice would be to wait to get a Christmas tree until the first week in December and try and make sure it is freshly cut. Try keeping it topped up with water and cool.’ Many families have switched to artificial trees in recent years on the basis these can be re-used. At the same time they are cheaper than spending anything from £20 to £50 on a real tree. The Carbon Trust says a real tree can be ‘greener’ than an artificial one. It estimates that a two metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg of carbon dioxide, in terms of the energy involved in manufacture and transport, which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill, and more than ten times that of real trees that are burnt. Mr Brightwell said around six million real trees are sold in the UK every year and this figure appears to be holding up. ‘For many families the tradition of going out to buy the Christmas tree creates memories that last a lifetime. Very few people reminisce about getting the artificial tree out of the loft,’ he said.","Christmas trees are on sale almost 40 days before December 25 .

"Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will point out it has not been helpful for 'liberal commentators' to say concern about immigration is 'irrational' Labour will today attack 'liberal commentators' who are too quick to dismiss the public's 'genuine' concerns about mass immigration. Ed Miliband's party has repeatedly come under fire for trying to close down debate about immigration by labelling its opponents 'bigots'. But in a speech today, the Shadow Home Secretary will say there is a need for a frank and honest discussion. In particular, Yvette Cooper will point out that it has not been helpful for 'liberal commentators and business advocates' to say concern about immigration is 'irrational'. She will go on to say: 'Too often the debate about immigration becomes polarised and unhealthy. On the one hand we now have an arms race of rhetoric involving the Tories and Ukip over immigration. Ukip are exploiting people's fears, fuelling anxiety and division, and David Cameron is racing to catch up. 'On the other hand some people seem to think talking about immigration at all is a problem and they dismiss people's genuine concerns.' Mrs Cooper will also promise that, under a Labour government, 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect Britain's porous borders. Controversially, they would be paid for by imposing a £10 visa waiver charge on visitors from overseas. Labour said the charge would apply to people coming from countries such as the 'US, Oman and the United Arab Emirates' who are trusted to return home at the end of a holiday or a short business trip. Last night Labour insisted the policy could work, pointing out that America imposes a $14 charge on visitors to America, including Britons. It costs the US around $4 to process each application and the additional $10 is used to fund government programmes. A Labour spokesman said: 'This reform was not beyond the wit of the American civil service, so the Tories really need to examine their basic competence and ambitions for reform.' However Tory officials claimed the scheme would cost 'more to operate than it would recover in fees' – and said the charge would pay for only 59 extra staff. Scroll down for video . They also accused Labour of sitting on secret plans to slash the Home Office budget if they come to power. Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'Labour would take Britain backwards and risk a surge in both legal and illegal immigration. This disastrous policy launch shows Labour aren't remotely ready for the responsibility of government.' Mrs Cooper's speech is likely to be seen as an attempt by Labour to regain some credibility on immigration amid alarm at the way Ukip is eating into its core vote. Following Ukip coming within 617 votes of taking Heywood and Middleton from Labour, senior politicians have been speaking more openly about mass immigration. Last week Ed Miliband declared: 'It isn't prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration.'

When they weren't attacking shoelaces, or reliving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights. Ms Davidson visited pet owners and rescue shelters to find her furry subjects and in the process even took one in. Saul, an eight-year-old schnauzer, needed a new home when his previous owner developed dementia and Ms Davidson was happy to take him in: 'He's a puppy to me, I've only had him for a few months.' The wet puppy project was hardly work at all for Ms Davidson: 'I was drawn to the idea of surrounding myself with puppies. It was almost medicinal-spending the day overdosing on cuteness.' Puppies galore: Ms Davidson said the hardest things about the project was resisting the temptation to adopt all the puppies from pet shelters . Do you mind? A puppy looks bemused by the photo shoot and appears to be asking for some privacy while it dries off . Naughty: Ms Davidson said when the puppies weren't attacking shoelaces, or relieving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights; nevertheless, she said they were easier to photograph than adult dogs . Drip dry: A schnauzer tips its head to the side as water drips from its floppy ears on to the ground; 100 dogs took part in the photo shoot . Get my best side: Ms Davidson visited pet owners and rescue shelters to find her furry subjects and in the process even took one in . Baby baths: The puppies involved in the project were aged from just four weeks to a year-old, so couldn't be cuter . Despite the occasional bout of naughtiness, Ms Davidson said the puppies were 'easier' to photograph than adult dogs, saying: 'I think they were just more sensitive to moisture and being tussled.' The main challenge, Ms Davidson explained, was resisting adopting all the puppies she came across when recruiting dogs at pet shelters. She said: 'I had to resist becoming a puppy hoarder myself, and it was difficult to watch owners struggle with their new puppies behaviors. Watching two species struggle to communicate with each other is hard, and when one of them is a baby it is even harder.'

"Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, Leonardo’s Last Supper... now we have Joanna Jamieson’s Buckfast Abbey mural. The 79-year-old nun has followed in the footsteps of the masters by completing a stunning 26ft by 18ft art work depicting monks rebuilding the abbey in Devon. Over three years, and in between bouts of hip surgery, Mother Joanna worked tirelessly, painting for six hours a day, every day – apart from Sundays, of course. Mother Joanna's beautiful mural at the Buckfast Abbey in Devon - which she worked on six days a week . The artwork, commissioned for the building's Millennium, depicts monks working to rebuild the Abbey . Another scene in Mother Joanna's mural - showing monks loading blocks onto a horse-drawn cart . The result is a spectacular arch-shaped mural made up of 20 wooden panels. Mother Joanna, who trained as a mural painter at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s before becoming a nun, was commissioned to create the piece as part of the celebrations for the abbey’s millennium in 2018. Although she is based at Stanbrook Abbey in Wass, North Yorkshire, the monks at Buckfast found out about her talents through the Benedictine order which encompasses both communities. Mother Joanna, 79, trained at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s in mural painting . An outside view of the Buckfast Abbey in Devon - which will celebrate its Millennium in 2018 . This is a stupendous work: Accomplished, confident, beautifully planned and executed. It fits with distinction into the great tradition of mural painting that has been a feature of British art over the last 100 years in the hands of Stanley Spencer and Charles Mahoney. There are great precedents, such as Fra Angelico, the Renaissance master who painted devotional images on the walls of the cells of fellow monks. Working within a great tradition, the artist cleverly adopts from the modern movement just what she required. And so this remarkable mural is just what such a work ought to be: Truly timeless. By Robin Simon, editor of the British Art Journal . In 2011 she took possession of the . panels, which she laid out on the floor of the village hall in Wass – . the only space available for a project so ambitious. Mother Joanna painted the work in acrylic, often using a palette knife instead of a brush. As she progressed, she was forced to pause for three operations and turned to friend Sister Mary Stephen, 83, herself an artist and a former art teacher, for help with practical tasks, such as mixing paint. Together they made the deadline at the end of last year. Yesterday Mother Joanna said: ‘It has pushed me to the limit both physically and mentally but there has been a lot of enjoyment in it as well. It really has got to be the project of my life.’ The mural, in Buckfast’s 360-seat Grange restaurant, is due to be unveiled next month. Abbot David Charlesworth, who commissioned the work, said: ‘It is a monumental effort.’ The mural, located in the Abbey's restaurant, is due to be unveiled next month .","Mother Joanna, 79, completed stunning artwork in Buckfast Abbey, Devon .

"A bereaved mother has been awarded about $638,000 after she sued a man for having an alleged sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her severally handicapped adult daughter. Mary Kortner, of Greenwich, filed a civil sexual battery and assault lawsuit in 2006 against Craig Martise, a married father-of-four from the same town, saying her daughter wasn't able to consent to an abusive sexual relationship with him in 2003 because of her mental condition. She first found out about the affair when she noticed red marks and welts on her daughter's neck. Drawnout case: A jury has awarded about $638,000 to a woman who sued a man for allegedly having a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her handicapped adult daughter . According to court documents, the relationship included Martise dragging Kortner by a leash and dog collar, slapping her with his hand and a belt, pinching and twisting body parts, tying and gagging her and dripping burning hot wax on her. Martise said Caroline Kendall Kortner, whom he met online, was able to consent. Prosecutors refused to charge him, but Mary Kortner sued in 2006. She claimed that a court had ruled Kendall Kortner incapable of making decisions for herself and that she could not consent to any sex - much less the kind of relationship she had with Martise. A jury found in his favor in 2009, but the state Supreme Court overturned the verdict this June. The latest trial resulted in a new Stamford Superior Court jury finding in favor of Mary Kortner on Thursday. Kortner's daughter, known as Kendall, died in 2010 at age 39 from an undisclosed illness. She was diagnosed with clinical depression, borderline personality disorder, bulimia and anorexia, and she twice tried to commit suicide, according to court documents. She also in 2001 had a stroke that left her partially paralyzed from the waist down. Commenting on Thursday's outcome, Kortner's lawyer, Christopher Burdett, said: 'We finally got justice for Kendall and obviously for her mother. 'This case is important because it sends a message ... to men who prey on women. 'People who do the kinds of things Martise did have to be made to answer to it, and the community needs to express outrage.' Martise didn't return a phone message Tuesday. His lawyer, Philip Russell, said he plans to ask the trial judge to overturn the verdict or lower the award and then, based on the judge's rulings, consider appealing the verdict to a higher state court. 'We were somewhat puzzled and disappointed by the outcome,' Russell said. 'Craig's a great guy. Unfortunately, like many things that become media sensations, he'll be pilloried before his side gets told.' A probate court ruled in 1994 that Kendall Kortner couldn't manage her own affairs and appointed her mother as her conservator. In Mary Kortner's appeal of the first jury verdict, the state Supreme Court ruled that people don't necessarily give up their ability to consent to sex, including sadomasochistic encounters, when they are placed under the legal conservatorship of others. Appeal: Kendall Karson's mother Mary brought the case to the Supreme Court after a jury found that the sex was consensual . The court also said it is up to juries to decide if people are able to consent to sex. While sadomasochism was glamorized in the popular book trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, the practice has long been on questionable legal ground. Some lawyers believe people can't consent to being assaulted or abused under common law, while others say established legal principles provide sexual rights to most people, including the elderly in nursing homes and the mentally ill. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial because a letter Kendall Kortner purportedly wrote in 2003 about unwanted sexual advances by another man was mistakenly given to the jury for deliberations despite not having been properly admitted into evidence. Lawyers in the case had said they couldn't recall any legal precedents in the country on whether mentally ill people can consent to sex or sadomasochism.","Mary Kortner, of Greenwich, filed a civil sexual battery and assault lawsuit in 2006 against Craig Martise .

"Warning: Pope Benedict XVI today warned that the Human Rights Act is being abused by selfish individuals to serve their own ends . The Pope has warned that human rights have become a vehicle for individuals to pursue selfish demands. His attack was combined with a fresh appeal for tolerance of Christianity and of Christians who object to equality laws. In a speech in the Vatican to foreign ambassadors, Pope Benedict XVI suggested human rights laws can lead to ‘intolerance or even violence towards individuals, symbols of religious identity and religious institutions’. The Pope’s intervention comes at a time of deepening concern over the misuse of human rights laws  in Britain, and as the European Court of Human Rights comes close to verdicts on four British test cases on Christian rights. The cases include Nadia Eweida, a British Airways check-in clerk who was refused the right to wear a cross with her uniform, and Lillian Ladele, who was sacked as a registrar because she declined to conduct civil partnership ceremonies. The Pope has been heavily critical of gay rights in Britain and denounced David Cameron’s plans for gay marriage in his New Year message. In his latest speech, the Pope said he was concerned that human rights laws were being used by selfish individuals to trample on those with opposing views. He said: ‘Sadly, especially in the West, one frequently encounters ambiguities about the meaning of human rights and their corresponding duties. ‘Rights are often confused with exaggerated manifestations of the autonomy of the individual, who becomes self-referential and absorbed only in seeking to satisfy his or her own needs. ‘To be authentic, the defence of rights . must instead consider human beings integrally, in their personal and . communitarian dimensions.’ In an apparent reference to the British Catholic adoption agencies that closed rather than follow equality laws that meant placing children with same-sex couples, the Pope added: ‘Believers, and Christians in particular, are prevented from contributing to the common good. The Pope, pictured attending an audience with the foreign ambassadors to the Holy See at the Vatican today, argued that the freedom of conscience and religion is being eroded by the Human Rights Act . Controversy: The popes words come just a week after it emerged that nearly 4,000 foreign criminals are using the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, to avoid deportation from the UK . ‘Outlawing individual and institutional . conscientious objection in the name of liberty and pluralism opens the . door to intolerance and forced uniformity.’ The Pope’s remarks will inevitably be seen as another attack on the emergence of so-called ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ – including gay rights – at a time when some countries, including Britain, are seeking to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples. The Pope said Christians are being prevented from contributing to the 'common good' because of human rights legislation . But they will please critics of the way the Human Rights Act is being implemented following revelations last week that nearly 4,000 foreign criminals, including rapists and murderers, are using its provisions to avoid deportation. Such abuses have added to the pressure on David Cameron to withdraw from the European Convention of Human Rights, enshrined into British law by the Human Rights Act, but the Prime Minister’s Liberal Democrat partners are keen supporters of the Act. In his address, the Pope observed that such major existing, recognised rights as the right to life and the right to freedom of conscience and religion were being eroded as human rights were being redefined. He criticised the use of the false concept of human rights to ‘expand legislation which decriminalises abortion’ and to marginalise religion in social life, sometimes resulting in ‘intolerance or even of violence towards individuals, symbols of religious identity and religious institutions’. He said: ‘In order effectively to safeguard the exercise of religious liberty it is essential to respect the right of conscientious objection. ‘This “frontier” of liberty touches upon principles of great importance of an ethical and religious character, rooted in the very dignity of the human person. ‘They are, as it were, the “bearing walls” of any society that wishes to be truly free and democratic. Benedict XVI used his address to also call for a halt to the ‘endless slaughter’ and ‘dreadful suffering’ in Syria, warning governments that without a ceasefire in the civil war the country would soon be reduced to ‘nothing but a field of ruins’. The Pope’s remarks came in his annual address to foreign ambassadors to the Holy See – including Nigel Baker, the British Ambassador.

"Reynolds American is launching a cigarette that heats tobacco rather than burning it and is hoping to capitalize on the growing appetite for alternatives to traditional smokes. The nation's second-biggest tobacco company said Monday that it will begin selling Revo - a cigarette that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit — in Wisconsin in February 2015. Reynolds said the cigarette is a 'repositioning' of its Eclipse product first launched in the mid-1990s with minimal success. Puff: The nation's second-biggest tobacco company said it will begin selling Revo, a cigarette that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit . The surging e-cigarette or vapor industry has reinvigorated the interest for cigarette alternatives, including products like Revo and its predecessor Eclipse that smokers once considered foreign. Even though the products left no lingering odor and didn't produce ashes, they tasted different than cigarettes and were more difficult to use. Eclipse had remained in limited distribution and is one of the top-selling brands in the cafeteria at Reynolds' headquarters. 'Heat-not-burn technology was 20 years ahead of when consumers were ready for it. It needed the mass presence of vapor products to open up an experience-base that smokers understood,' said J. Brice O'Brien, head of consumer marketing for the maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes. 'The smoker could only compare heat-not-burn to a combustible and it lost every time. That's no longer the case.' Revo is a 'modern take on the classic cigarette' that — unlike popular e-cigarettes that use liquid nicotine — contains real tobacco, which could make them more attractive to cigarette smokers, O'Brien said. The brand is being launched with a marketing campaign that lets smokers know that it's different and harder to use than traditional cigarettes but to 'stick with it, because it's totally worth it,' O'Brien said. Revo will cost about the same as a premium pack of regular cigarettes, which varies across the country but averages close to $6. Smoke signals: Revo will cost about the same as a premium pack of regular cigarettes, which varies across the country but averages close to $6 . With the health risks associated with traditional cigarettes and changes in societal expectations, it's no wonder many of the world's 1 billion smokers want to quit or try other tobacco alternatives. In the U.S., nearly half of the nation's 42 million adult smokers try to quit each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In more recent years, much of the attention to quitting has steered away from nicotine gum and patches to electronic cigarettes, which many smokers credit with helping them kick the habit. The company's move follows that of overseas Marlboro maker Philip Morris International Inc., which launched Marlboro HeatStick and an accompanying device called iQOS  in a test market in Nagoya, Japan, earlier this month. The short, cigarette-like sticks are heated to maximum of 660 degrees Fahrenheit (about 350 degrees Celsius) in the hollow pen-like device to create a tobacco-flavored nicotine vapor. Reynolds American Inc., based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has plans for another test market in Italy, with further expansion plans in 2015. It's one of several so-called 'reduced-risk' products Philip Morris International plans to test as the industry diversifies beyond traditional cigarettes amid declining demand. Philip Morris International and former parent company Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc. have agreed to share their technology for electronic cigarettes and other new alternatives to traditional cigarettes, so HeatSticks could potentially be marketed in the U.S. eventually.","The new cigarette, which will be called Revo, is a rebranded version of a former Reynolds’ product .
That product flopped, but it believes Revo will appeal to smokers who don’t like e-cigarettes but would like an alternative to traditional smoking .
The cigarette comes with a carbon tip that, when lighted, heats the tobacco rather than burning it, so that the cigarette releases a tobacco-flavored vapor and not traditional cigarette smoke ."
"Swedish archeologists have uncovered the remains of a brutal fifth century massacre at a remote island fort, described as being 'frozen in time' like the ruins of the Roman city of Pompeii. Bodies of victims slaughtered in the violence on the island of Öland, just off the Swedish coast, have remained untouched for centuries, and were found to resemble a modern day crime scene. Before they attack, the fort appears to have been a peaceful and prosperous place, where people lived comfortably in small huts and reared livestock for meat. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Swedish archaeologists have unearthed a brutal 5th century massacre at an island fort . But their peace was shattered when a group of unknown men burst in one night, butchering the residents in a vicious and unexplained attack. Helene Wilhelmson, a researcher who specializes in the study of bones at Sweden's Lund University, said: 'It's more of a frozen moment than you normally see in archaeology. 'It's like Pompeii: Something terrible happened, and everything just stopped.' Murdered: An archaeologist examines the body of one of the victims found lying flat on its face inside the fort . Preserved: The site on the island of Öland, just off the Swedish coast, has remained untouched for centuries, and resembled a modern day crime scene . So far five bodies have been unearthed amid the ruins of one of the huts. Two were found lying next to the door as if they had been slaughtered as they tried desperately to escape. Why the fort has been left untouched for . 1,500 years remains a mystery. One theory is that the location became . taboo after the massacre, with people simply too terrified to set foot there. Archaeologist Helene Wilhelmson said the site was like a moment 'frozen in time' During the Migration Period in Scandinavia it was customary to burn the dead, and very few uncremated remains have previously been recovered. At an earlier excavation in 2010 the team discovered gilded brooches, raising questions as to why they were not plundered in the wake of the massacre. Ms Wilhelmson added: 'I think they . were surprised and there were so many bodies and two of them are lying . by the door as if they were running for the door and people were coming . in. 'So I think they were . ambushed in some way and people were running into the house trying to . kill them and they didn't have a chance.' The . team are now creating computerised 3-D models of the fort to . reconstruct the crime scene — in the hope of solving the mystery. They . have gone over the site collecting all precious metals to avoid modern . plundering. Lund University . archaeologist Nicoló Dell’Unto explains: 'Using 3D-modeling gives us the . unprecedented opportunity to see all the bodies simultaneously, even . though the skeletons were removed one by one'. A reconstruction of the fort on the island gives some idea what life was like was for the residents . At an earlier excavation in 2010 the team discovered gilded brooches, raising questions as to why they were not plundered in the wake of the massacre . Human bones have been found in other parts of the fort, making it highly likely that many more bodies are yet to be dug out. The Roman city of Pompeii was destroyed when the volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79 showering in 20ft (6m) of superheated ash. The ash effectively preserved the city and enabled archaeologists to create plaster casts of many of the victims, captured in their death throes.

"High school students have paid tribute to a mother-of-three who was allegedly killed by her husband in the front yard of their south-west Sydney home. Zoran Crnobrnja, 51, is accused of murdering his 49-year-old wife, Vesna, at their Casula home reportedly with a gardening tool on Monday.

It's estimated around 50 students from a nearby high school marched down Flame Street in tribute . Vesna Crnobrnja's husband Zoran has been charged with murder after she was found outside the couple's south-west Sydney home . The students were classmates of the Crnobrnja's 17-year-old son, according to Seven News. One student led a touching prayer as others bowed their heads, asking God to 'guide [the couple's children] through this tough time'. The day after the horrific incident the couple's well-manicured lawn looked eerily untouched and deserted, with a rolled-up newspaper lying on the driveway as the family car sat parked in front of a basketball hoop. Earlier on Tuesday, Crnobrnja appeared in Liverpool Court where he did not apply for bail and will next appear in Campbelltown Court on December 3. Remnants of police tape and a plastic bag left by forensics were strewn near the fence after officers were called to the home about 2.20pm on Monday after reports of a disturbance to find a woman's body in the front yard. Students paused to pay their respects outside the couple's home, where 49-year-old Vesna was killed . Some students lay flowers while others said a quiet prayer for the mother-of-three .

"Gary Dawn, who is also known as Pogo the Clown, who is accused of viciously attacking a police officer with a bottle of vodka . A professional clown who was accused of viciously attacking a police officer with a bottle of vodka has walked free from court after being found not guilty. Gary Dawn, who is also known as Pogo the Clown, was accused of maliciously wounding PC Mark Szeremetta leaving him hospitalised with a gaping wound to his skull. But today a jury at Nottingham Crown Court found the 54-year-old not guilty of the offence. The court had heard how the 54-year-old had been drinking on February 12 after the break-up of his long term relationship, which had left him feeling depressed. But when a friend called police over concerns for his welfare, Dawn lashed out when the officer arrived at the scene in Stoke Bardolph near Gedling in Nottinghamshire. The court heard how PC Szeremetta approached the accused before he launched the bottle of vodka he was drinking in the officer's face. The officer was then taken to hospital with a head injury and needing the wound glued, jurors were told. Prosecutor Mark Knowles told the court Dawn's actions were 'reckless' and that he intended to do harm. He said: 'It's a straight forward issue. He pushed the officer away and the Crown will say that's indicative of the defendant's mood. 'He had no regard for others.' Giving evidence, PC Szeremetta, who was first on the scene on Stoke Lane said: 'I got out of the police vehicle and went to approach the male. 'He had his back to me at that stage.' PC Szeremetta said after shouting after Dawn he then approached the defendant when he was struck by the bottle. He added: 'I was very shocked, I was blinded, I could not really see at the time what I had been struck with. Dawn denied the charge at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured, and the trial continues . 'My priority was the preservation of the male.' Jurors were told the police officer caught up with Dawn - who has previously made attempts at taking his own life - and sat on him until other officers arrived. Dawn, who has been a professional clown for 20 years and done charity work with When You Wish Upon A Star, told the court: 'I was not thinking of the consequences. 'I was just down, looking down. 'There was someone behind me and I got frightened and scared.' Dawn denied the charge claiming it wasn’t intentional and he was just trying to push the officer away without realising the bottle was in his hand. He added he only realised the hand he struck the officer with had a bottle in it was when his 'hand felt lighter'.","Gary Dawn, also known as Pogo the Clown, accused of attacking PC .

"An American scholar claims to have made a controversial discovery that proves the entire story of Jesus was made up by Roman aristocrats. Joseph Atwill asserts that Christianity did not start as a religion, but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the Roman Empire. He says he noticed a pattern forming when he was studying the only surviving account of first-century Judea, which he claims contains dozens of parallels between the life of a Roman emperor and that of Jesus in the New Testament. Is Jesus really a myth? A Bible scholar claims he has uncovered new evidence that proves the Romans invented the entire life story of Christ . Eureka moment: Joseph Atwill, above left, says he made his discovery . while studying War Of The Jews by Josephus, which he says . contains dozens of parallels between Jesus and Roman Emperor Titus Flavius . Mr Atwill argues that these ancient . 'confessions' provide 'clear evidence' that the biography of Jesus is . 'actually constructed, tip to stern, on prior stories, but especially on . the biography of a Roman Caesar'. Mr Atwill accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time. But bible academic Professor James Crossley, from the University of Sheffield, compared Mr . Atwill's theory to a Dan Brown fiction book. He told Mail Online: 'These types of theories are very . common outside the academic world and are usually reserved for sensationalist . literature. 'They are virtually non-existent in the academic world.' He also suggested the theories are not taken seriously by experts. Mr Crossley said: 'People do debate about how much we can . know about Jesus, but the idea that Romans invented stories about Jesus is . outside of the academic world.' He added that this sort of theory can be 'irritating' to . religion academics. On his theory, Mr Atwill said: 'I present my work with some ambivalence as I do not want to . directly cause Christians any harm, but this is important for our . culture. 'Alert citizens . need to know the truth about our past so we can understand how and why . governments create false histories and false gods.

He . said: 'Jewish sects in Palestine at the time, who were waiting for a . prophesied warrior Messiah, were a constant source of violent . insurrection during the first century. 'When the Romans had exhausted conventional means of quashing rebellion, they switched to psychological warfare. 'They surmised that the way to stop the spread of zealous Jewish missionary activity was to create a competing belief system. 'That's when the ""peaceful"" Messiah story was invented. 'Instead . of inspiring warfare, this Messiah urged turn-the-other-cheek pacifism . and encouraged Jews to ""give onto Caesar"" and pay their taxes to Rome.' Law and order: Scholar Joseph Atwill asserts that Christianity did not start as a religion, but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the Roman Empire . 'Once those sources are all laid bare, there's simply nothing left,' he added. He . says he stumbled upon his discovery while studying War of the Jews by .

'Although . it's been recognised by Christian scholars for centuries that the . prophesies of Jesus appear to be fulfilled by what Josephus wrote about . in the First Jewish-Roman war, I was seeing dozens more. 'What . seems to have eluded many scholars is that the sequence of events and . locations of Jesus ministry are more or less the same as the sequence of . events and locations of the military campaign of [Emperor] Titus .

Estimates suggest Jesus died before 39 AD – 30 AD according to the encyclopaedia. This was a number of years prior to Titus Flavius’s military campaign. Mr Atwill continued: 'This is clear evidence of a deliberately constructed pattern. 'The biography of Jesus is . actually constructed, tip to stern, on prior stories, but especially on . the biography of a Roman Caesar.' Atwill said the clues had gone unnoticed all this time because they are coneptual or poetic. This, he says, was designed to prevent the average believer from becoming aware of what was happening. They did, however, want the alert reader to cotton on. Christ Appearing to Mary Magdalene by Titian: Mr Atwill accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time . He adds: 'An educated Roman in the ruling class would probably have recognised the literary game being played.' Atwill maintains he can demonstrate that 'the Roman Caesars left us a kind of puzzle literature that was meant to be solved by future generations, and that the solution to that puzzle is ""We invented Jesus Christ and we're proud of it"".' Atwill does not believe that this is the end of Christianity, but hopes his work will give half-believers a reason to 'make a clean break'. 'We've got the evidence now to show exactly where the story of Jesus came from,' he says. Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem in 63 BC. Estimates suggest Jesus was born between 6-4 BC, and died around 30 AD. Roman emperor Titus Flavius was born in 39 AD and died in 81 AD. The first Jewish revolt occurred between 66-70 AD, the first in a long series of clashes up until 135 AD. 'Although Christianity can be a comfort to some, it can also be very damaging and repressive, an insidious form of mind control that has led to blind acceptance of serfdom, poverty, and war throughout history. 'To this day, especially in the United States, it is used to create support for war in the Middle East.' Atwill will be giving a presentation on his findings entitled Covert Messiah at Conway Hall in Holborn, London, on October 19, where he is encouraging sceptics to challenge his theory, according to a release published on PRWeb.","Joseph Atwill says Romans 'used Christ as propaganda to pacify subjects'

"Daisy Coleman became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14, then tormented by cyber bullies, her mother says . A mother says she was driven from a rural Missouri town and her home mysteriously burned down after her 14-year-old daughter accused a popular football player of rape. High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant cyber-bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported in January 2012 that she had been raped. She told police the 17-year-old boy invited her to a party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had sex with her while a friend filmed the incident on an iPhone. She told CNN's 'Erin Burnett OutFront' that she and her friend had been drinking and went to his house, where they 'snuck in through his basement window. 'He gave me a big glass of a clear liquid. And that's all I remember,' the teenager said yesterday on CNN. The athlete and his friends then allegedly dumped Daisy on her front porch, where she passed out - with no shoes or socks and no coat - in 22-degree weather. When her mother found her several hours later, Daisy's hair was frozen and she had frostbite on her hands and feet. 'There was frost on the ground,' Daisy's mother Melinda Coleman told CNN. 'It wasn't until I undressed her to put her in a warm tub that I realised that maybe she had been sexually assaulted. So I asked her if she was hurting, and she said yes, and started to cry,' she said. The Kansas City Star reports . that Mrs Coleman, a veterinarian, lost her job as a . result of the police report her daughter filed. Mrs Coleman says her . three sons - Daisy's brothers - were threatened at school and booed on . the field - often by boys they had counted as their friends just weeks . earlier. The charred remains of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children in October. The cause of the fire could not be determined . Accusations: Daisy, pictured left with her brother, told police that she became so drunk she couldn't remember anything at a party thrown by several older high school boys . She said she had no . choice but leave. Town officials and many residents had made it clear . that she was no longer welcome in the town of 12,000, she said. 'Basically . I was terrified, I wanted to protect my children, I wanted to get them . out of there,' she told MailOnline, agreeing that her family's names and photographs be used to highlight their case. In April, eight months after she left town, Mrs Coleman's house in Maryville - which she was trying to sell - burned down. Fire investigators have ruled the cause 'undetermined,' but Mrs Coleman told MailOnline that she suspects the blaze could be arson - connected with town residents who were furious over her daughter's rape allegations. 'On one hand, it would almost be a comfort to think it was an electrical problem that caused the fire, but on the other other hand, there’s a part of me that really thinks that the fire could be part of all this,' Mrs Coleman said. 'They threatened me. I’d been threatened and my daughter had been threatened and I lost my job because of threats.' Daisy, seen here with her three brothers, was threatened by residents of Maryville after the charges against a popular football player went public. Her brothers were threatened and harassed, as well . Melinda Coleman, Daisy's mother, said she feared for her family's safety after she and her children received threats . Mrs Coleman says she moved her family to . Maryville after her husband, a doctor, died in a car crash in 2006. She . was hoping for a fresh start for herself and for her children. Sheriff's deputies arrested two teens within hours and charged them with felonies. A few weeks later, the prosecutor, Robert Rice, dropped the rape charges - citing insufficient evidence. Mrs Coleman told MailOnline the torrents of hatred came only days after the case went public. The backlash on social media was . vitriolic. Classmates said the Daisy had been 'asking for it' at the party. A girl showed . up to one of the teen girl's dance recitals with a shirt alluding to . the alleged rape. When the charges against her alleged rapist were dismissed, one local . student wrote to the teen on Twitter, saying, 'F*** yea. That’s what you . get for bein a skank : )'. One of Daisy's brothers was booed at his final wrestling match of the . year. Mrs Coleman says a friend warned her that students were planning . to beat up her sons in the parking lot of the high school over the . incident. Mrs . Coleman lost her job at the local veterinary clinic. She . says her boss admitted that she was fired because the case had become . too contentious. Veterinarian . Sally Hayse told the Star: 'This is a small community, and it . definitely was stressful for us here, without a doubt. The entrance of Maryville High School - High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported she had been raped in January 2012 . Life at Maryville High School became difficult for the four Coleman children after numerous former friends lashed out over the sex assault report . Maryville is a tight-knit town of 12,000 in rural northern Missouri . But, she said, 'If you were to ask me point-blank (why Mrs Coleman was fired), I would say it’s because our style of medicine didn’t jive.' Mrs Coleman said her daughter suffered heavily - both from the alleged assault and from the online abuse. She tried to kill herself twice, including once when her brother found her in the bathroom and took her to the hospital. 'She had a really hard time. She went through a period, a really dark time. She did the self-mutilation and the anger,' Mrs Coleman told MailOnline. 'So much of being told it was her fault ... it really does seem like it’s your fault when people keep saying it over and over again.' But, Daisy, now 16, is recovering, her mother says. After intensive therapy, she is beginning to move past the trauma of the alleged attack.","Melinda Coleman says she and her family had to leave Maryville, Missouri, after intense backlash when her daughter said she was raped at a party .

"Florida prosecutors offered Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, a third plea deal Wednesday after she'd refusing or losing the previous ones in her ongoing legal saga over her sexual relationship with a 14-year-old female classmate. The Sebastian Beach teen's felony troubles began when she was arrested in February and got worst when she lost a plea deal in August after prosecutors alleged she'd continued the sexual relationship and communicated with the girl via 20,000 texts. Hunt has been in jail ever since and is expected to accept this newest offer, which requires her to remain in jail until December 20 and serve two years house arrest. Scroll down for video . Third chance: Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, has been offered a third plea deal in her ongoing saga over a lesbian relationship with a 14-year-old high school classmate . Deal: Under the new deal, which Hunt's layers helped cut, two counts of she'll plead no contest to five charges including two felony counts of  interference with child custody . The deal would see Hunt remain in jail until December 20. She would then begin two years of electronically monitored house arrest. Nine months of probation would follow. According to CNN, ff she has no violations, she will not be a convicted felon per Florida law. She would then have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years. 'I believe this is a fair and . balanced offer that protects the victim while giving Ms. Hunt the . ability to avoid the most severe consequences of her crimes by . demonstrating that no further punishment is necessary,' Workman said. Under the deal, Hunt must plead no contest to five charges including two felony charges of interference with child custody. Arrest: Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, who 'had sex with her underage girlfriend', lost one plea deal and rejected another but is expected to take the third one offered by Florida prosecutors . Better times: Hunt, who met the underage girl as they attended the same high school, faced up to 15 yuars in jail and having to register as a sex offender. The new deal helps her avoid both, but does include jail time and two years of house arrest . The . teenager was booked into the Indian River County Jail on August 19 and has been in jail since. A . judge decided to keep Hunt behind bars for violating the terms of her . pre-trial release after it emerged that she had remained in touch with . the girl by allegedly slipping her an iPod and exchanging more than . 20,000 text messages following her arrest in February. After the new details emerged, . prosecutors withdrew a plea deal that would have seen Hunt avoid prison . time but register as a sex offender. Now she faces the possibility of . having to do both. The case . has garnered national attention as the teenager's supporters have . claimed that the younger girl's parents only contacted police about the . relationship because Hunt is gay. She was charged with two counts of . lewd and lascivious battery in February and jailed before posting . $5,000. She was banned from contacting the younger girl, whom she had . met at high school. Under . Florida law, even if the relationship was consensual, it is illegal for . anyone over the age of 18 to have sexual relations with anyone under . that age. At the time of their relationship, Hunt was 18. Court documents accuse Hunt of 'covertly . contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to . the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it. Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the plea deal when renewed accusations broke. Revoked: Hunt, pictured in court earlier this month, had a plea deal on the . table until investigators accused her of violating her bond terms with . continued contact with her 14-year-old lover. Most notably, she was accused of exchanging 20,000 text messages with the girl . Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt . The new evidence indicated Hunt and the . girl, until July, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day . at Sebastian River High School in March. Court . documents claim that the teens exchanged thousands of texts since . March. Hunt also allegedly sent more than 25 lewd photos of herself . which show her nude or 'masturbating while moaning'. They . also allege that Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith, may have helped her . daughter cover her tracks by messaging the girl, urging her to delete . all trace of their contact. According . to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend told detectives about the continued . illicit contact and how Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location . where they would have intimate physical contact.' New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . Massive push: A 'Free Kate' Facebook page has generated more than 35,000 followers so far, and an online petition urging that the charges be dropped already has nearly 120,000 signatures . 'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told . the girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in . communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.' 'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.' On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship. 'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you . snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.' The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.' The . defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court . documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith . tried to help her daughter cover her tracks. Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July . Defending his daughter: Steven Hunt (right) insists that his 19-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn (left), is being targeted . by prosecutors for dating a 14-year-old classmate because she is . lesbian . 'Delete . EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete . everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing. 'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.' To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.' Ms. Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents . make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest . revelations. 'It is . apparent that the conduct of both the defendant and Kelley Hunt Smith is . severely threatening the integrity of the judicial process,' read the . documents. The younger girl's parents have remained adamant that Hunt should be prosecuted as a sex offender. The . glut of publicity included interviews in where her parents claimed . their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 . people had signed an online petition to have the charges against the . teenager dropped. If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the two original charges of lewd or lascivious battery alone. She is now likely to face additional charges for breaking the terms of her bond. Thousands have signed petitions in . support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged . with lascivious battery of a minor. But while she and her parents gave . national interviews maintaining her consensual relationship was . innocent, Hunt was breaking court orders that she stay away from her . 14-year-old girlfriend and could now lose a plea deal offer and face . additional felony charges.

"Founder: Dr Philip Nitschke believes it is a 'fundamental right' for anyone to take their own life .

Exit International, which campaigns to legalise euthanasia, has opened a London office to ‘cope with demand’ after its UK membership hit 1,000. The group, which charges members a fee to access online information and attend workshops to discuss ‘peaceful’ methods of suicide, has attracted fierce criticism in Australia, where it was originally set up.

"Back in jail: Six months after Missouri judge freed Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson from jail, where he landed after avoiding prison time for 13 years due to a clerical error, the 37-year-old man was charged with second-degree robbery . Six months after a Missouri judge freed Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson from jail proclaiming him 'a changed man,' the married father of four landed behind bars once again, this time on a robbery charge. Anderson has made national headlines earlier this year when the St Louis resident was sent to jail after having avoided incarceration for 13 years because of a clerical error. The 37-year-old husband and father was set free in May of this year, but at around 1am Sunday he was arrested and charged with second-degree robbery for allegedly grabbing a woman's purse from her shoulder and briefly dragging her in St. Louis. Prosecutors say Anderson matched a description from the victim and a witness, but his attorney says police made a big mistake. Anderson has since been released on $10,000 bond. ‘There was a report of a man who completely and totally did not match my client's description as the alleged purse snatcher,’ his attorney, Patrick Megaro, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ‘It makes me wonder what is going on out there in St. Louis.’ Anderson was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Burger King worker in St. Charles County, just north of St. Louis, in 2000. Scroll down for videos . A free man: A judge ordered Cornealious Anderson (left) out of jail in May. He was arrested last year when it was discovered he was never sent to prison for a robbery conviction in a clerical mistake. Pictured above with wife LaQonna and daughter Nevaeh, 3, after his release . Emotional reunion: Anderson embraces his grandmother Mary Porter after being released from custody May 5 . More legal trouble: Anderson, pictured walking out of the courtroom with his family in May, is accused of snatching a woman's purse in St Louis Sunday . He waited for information on when and where to report to prison, but the order never came. Anderson later started his own carpentry business, married, had children, coached youth football and volunteered at his church in Webster Groves, a suburb of St. Louis. When prison officials found the clerical error in July 2013, as Anderson's prison term was set to end, eight US marshals were sent to his home and took him to prison. He remained in jail until May. ‘You've been a good father,’ Judge Terry Lynn Brown said during a hearing May 5, when he set Anderson free. ‘You've been a good husband. You've been a good taxpaying citizen of the state of Missouri. ‘That leads me to believe that you are a good man and a changed man.’ Speaking to Daily Riverfront Times Monday, Anderson's father, Michael Anderson, said that his son was taken into custody upon leaving his employer’s birthday party. Past sins: Anderson was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the armed robbery of a Burger King worker in St. Charles County in 2000 . 'He didn't do it,' said Mr Anderson. 'He was with 40 other people the entire evening.' Mike Anderson's lawyer reiterated that his client has a solid alibi, given that he had been at the party the entire night and left to go home with his wife only at around 1am. Attorney Patrick Megaro also took issue with the purse snatcher's description, saying that according to police, the suspect was a black male dressed in a hoodie and Nike sneakers, while Mike Anderson was wearing a leather jacket, slacks and light brown boots that night. The lawyer noted that his client did not have the victim's purse or any of her other personal effects in his possession at the time of his arrest. Mr Megaro and Anderson's family have suggested that his checkered past and the notoriety surrounding his release have swayed the responding police officer to take the 37-year-old man into custody. ‘The past is never the past, and the reality is, when they run his name and they see this in his record, he'll never get the benefit of the doubt,’ said the lawyer. On Monday evening, Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce released a statement saying that the victim of the Sunday night mugging identified Mike Anderson as her assailant on two separate occasions: the first time just steps away from the crime scene on South Broadway, and the second time during a formal police line-up. Alibi: Anderson's family and his attorney say that the 37-year-old man could not have committed the robbery because he had spent the whole night at a birthday party, surrounded by as many as 40 people . Everything to lose: Anderson's attorney said his client would not have jeopardized his life and family for a purse . Also, Joyce asserted that the victim never described the purse-snatcher as sporting a pair of Nikes and a hoodie, but rather a leather jacket and boots similar to the ones worn by Anderson that night. Patrick Megaro insisted that his client was '100 per cent innocent' and questioned why the married father of four, who only recently has started putting his life back together, would jeopardize everything for a purse. ‘He’s been working, spending time with the family, going to church,’ he said. ‘He’s been doing very well financially, as a matter of fact. A purse snatching involving this individual is completely implausible.’ During an appearance on the Today Show in May, a beaming Mike Anderson described his reunion with his family as a dream come true. 'It's still a dream. It hasn't really sunk in yet,’ he said, holding the hand of his wife, LaQonna. 'They got the wrong guy': Anderson's supporters insist that the 37-year-old man is 100 per cent innocent . Identified: The victim named Anderson, seen here with his family, as her assailant just minutes after the robbery, and later picked him out from a police line-up . Mississippi County Associate Circuit Judge Terry Lynn Brown needed just a 10-minute hearing in May before ruling that he was giving Anderson credit for time served for all 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year. ‘Very happy,’ Anderson said as he climbed into an SUV for the ride home to suburban St. Louis and a planned family celebration. ‘My faith has always been in God. I'm just so thankful. That God for everybody.’ Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement at the time: ‘From the outset, I have proposed a solution that balances the seriousness of Mr. Anderson's crime with the mistake made by the criminal justice system and Mr. Anderson's lack of a criminal record over the past 13 years. Today's outcome appears to appropriately balance the facts as we understand them.’ The judge said that rather than grant parole, Anderson would get credit for the entirety of the time he should have been in prison. The distinction is important because it means Anderson doesn't have to report to a parole agent. Anderson had never been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the holdup, then told to wait for orders that would specify when and where he was to report to prison. But the orders never came. Anderson suspected that his case had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do. ‘Day by day, month by month, year by year, time passed, and they never picked me up,’ he said in an interview in April with the Associated Press. A court filing by the attorney general's office said the mistake happened when a trial court clerk failed to inform the Missouri Supreme Court that Anderson was free on bond after his initial conviction.","Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson, 37, charged with second-degree robbery in connection to purse-snatching in St Louis .

"For seven years, the Department of Defense has faked repatriations where military personnel carry honored dead soldiers off of planes as part of their ceremonial return to the U.S. While the Pentagon insists the coffins indeed contain the remains of MIA soldiers returned to America from foreign wars, it now admits that the Hawaii arrival ceremonies often attended by a tearful audience aren’t actually arrivals at all. In fact, the coffins are toted out of planes that can no longer even fly, but must be towed onto the runway for the phony ceremonies and the remains have sometimes been back in the country for months. Scroll down for video... Revealed: Repatriation ceremonies at a Hawaii base have been faked for seven years. The Pentagon admits that most remains in the 'arrival ceremonies' had been back in the U.S. for a long time . The ceremonies are handled by the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, an agency charged with recovering some 83,000 missing service men and women from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Until now, agency has allowed the public to believe that flag-draped boxes pulled from C-17 military planes contained the rediscovered dead from those countries. But the Pentagon acknowledged to NBC News Wednesday that, in fact, the remains had only just been removed from a lab at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu. Now, the events will be known as ‘honor ceremonies.’ ‘The name changed because they've already arrived, technically,’ Army Staff Sergeant Andrew Smith told NBC. Sham: Ceremonies like the one pictured ahve been revealed as having taken place as long as months after remains were recovered from Korea, Vietnam, and World War II battlefields . JPAC identifies around 80 soldiers per year. After their ceremonies — during which buglers play Taps and audience members sing the Star Spangled Banner following a chaplain’s prayer — the remains are returned to the lab. A military official thanks attendees for ‘welcoming them home’ before they ‘begin the identification process.’ On average, it takes about 11 years and a $1million to identify each of them. Helping further dupe attendees is the use of an airplane that many believed had actually just flown the remains home. A plane is towed to where the ceremony will take place prior to doors opening to the public. It is often a plane that can no longer even fly. Duped? While attendees watched believing the remains had just arrived, they were carted off planes that don't even fly and back to the same labs they were carted out of prior to the ceremony . ‘Many times, static aircraft are used for the ceremonies, as operational requirements dictate flight schedules and aircraft availability,’ Department of Defense spokesperson, Navy Commander Amy Derrick-Frost told NBC. Though they defended the practice, military officials took the blame for any misconceptions that have come of the so-called arrival ceremonies. ‘Based on how media announcements and ceremony remarks are currently written, it is understandable how these “arrival” ceremonies might be misinterpreted, leading one to believe the ceremonies are “dignified transfer ceremonies,” which they are not,’ Derrick-Frost. One ceremony bagpiper told NBC that even he believed the remains were just delivered from abroad. Weeping attendees would sing and buglers would sound Taps, followed by a chaplain's prayer. Group's were thanked for helping to welcome the men home . ‘It was a very humbling experience . for me,’ said bagpiper Alan Miyamura. ‘The thing that I remember most . vividly is the silence. ... It meant respect and a feeling that these . soldiers are welcomed home.’ Rick Stone who once worked for JPAC said the agency has always known of their deceit. ‘It's . an open fraud inside JPAC,’ he said of the bogged down agency. ‘But . it's more than just the arrival ceremony. The fraud is really their . inability to bring closure to more families.

"A private Native American school in South Dakota has been exposed fabricating 'sob stories' of disadvantaged and displaced children in order to appeal for charity donations and handouts - and collecting millions of dollars while doing so. St. Joseph's Indian School - a 200-person boarding school in Chamberlain - collected over $50 million in fundraising last year using a national marketing campaign that involves mailing 'help packets' all over the country. The packets feature children apparently in need, such as one little boy, Josh Little Bear, who says his father gets drunk and beats him and 'mom chose drugs over me'. However the children are not real, a CNN investigation has discovered. Scroll down for video . Marketing campaign exposed: St Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota, sends out 30 million mailing packets each year appealing for donations . Mail packet: The packages contain notebooks, stickers and even a Dreamcatcher and ask for donations . Fabricated: The school has admitted the personalized notes in each packet, such as this one from 'Josh Little Bear' are made up . Fake: The children that appear in the campaign do not go the school, a CNN investigation has shown . With 30 million charity packets sent out last year, the approach has been attacked as 'poverty porn'. 'They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills,' Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute, told CNN. Leonard Pease, vice chairman of the nearby Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, said the mail packets are a scam the school has been using for years. 'That's how they get their money,' he told CNN. 'To me, they make the Indians look bad.' Kory Christianson, the director of development at St. Josephs, admitted the school's marketing campaign 'pushed the edge'. 'The name 'Josh Little Bear' is fictitious, but unfortunately, his story is not,' Christianson said. '(The letter) is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society.' 'Poverty porn': Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute, said the school is operating a scam . Offended: Leonard Pease, vice chairman of the nearby Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, said the school is giving Indians a bad name . Good services: The school is said to be putting the donated money to good use . Students: The boarding school in South Dakota is home to 200 students . He said it wasn't the 'intention to disparage in any way the Native American community'. A Christmas appeal was sent around in November. Inside were a calendar, notepads, stickers and a Dreamcatcher. There was a letter from a girl, Emily High Elk, who apparently arrived at St. Joseph's one year ago. 'You could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes,' the letter said. '(Now) her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed.' Financial records show St. Joseph's collected $51 million in donations last year. The school's 2013 finanical statement listed its cash on hand at $122 million. That is an increase of $18.5 million on the previous year. However CNN noted that it appeared the school was putting the donations to good use, with decent facilities and happy students.","St. Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota, is a private boarding school with 200 students .

"It is one of Apple's most anticipated products - and the firm's watch edged closer today as developers were let loose on the software needed to build apps for it. Announced earlier this year, the Watch it set to go on sale in spring 2015, with the cheapest model costing $295, and more expensive luxury versions expected to cost thousands more. Today the firm revealed that developers have already started building apps for the Watch, with a special app store set to launch alongside the Watch. Scroll down for video . The new kit allows developers to start building apps for the Apple Watch, which is expected to go on sale in Spring, with prices starting at $295. The Apple watch will use three types of app. Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Full apps can use a developer's own interface. 'Apple Watch is our most personal device ever, and WatchKit provides the incredible iOS developer community with the tools they need to create exciting new experiences right on your wrist,' said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. 'With the iOS 8.2 beta SDK, developers can now start using WatchKit to create breakthrough new apps, Glances and actionable notifications designed for the innovative Apple Watch interface and work with new technologies such as Force Touch, Digital Crown and Taptic Engine.' Instagram is one of the first to create an app for the Apple Watch. 'Apple Watch allows us to make the Instagram experience even more intimate and in the moment,' says Kevin Systrom, co-founder and CEO of Instagram. 'With actionable notifications you can see and instantly like a photo or react with an emoji. The Instagram news and watch list allows you to see your friends' latest photos, follow new accounts and get a real-time view of your likes and comments.' The watch will use three types of app. Developers can create notifications that allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. They can also incorporate Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Finally, they can build full apps that use their own interface. The Apple watch will use three types of app. WatchKit apps have two parts: A WatchKit extension that runs on iPhone and a set of user interface resources that are installed on Apple Watch. When your app is launched on Apple Watch, the WatchKit extension on iPhone runs in the background to update the user interface and respond to user interactions. American Airlines has already created an app . Others who were given early access include American Airlines. and ESPN. 'Fans crave real-time and personal information, and the ESPN app for Apple Watch gives us the ability to deliver live scores and information for their favorite teams,' said John Kosner, executive vice president of Digital and Print Media, ESPN. 'Glances provide fans with a snapshot of live games, and if there is no game taking place, they'll get valuable game-time information or the final box score. 'With actionable notifications, the experience becomes even more personal, as fans receive alerts on score changes, news and more.' 'The American Airlines app on Apple Watch reminds you when it's time to head to the airport via pre-trip notifications, and provides updates for gate changes, connecting gate info upon arrival, and will notify you when boarding begins if you're not at the gate yet,' said John Gustafson, American Airlines vice president of Digital. 'Travelers can also ask 'Where am I?' in-flight and get real-time location information at 30,000 ft.' The WatchKit site includes programming guides, human interface guidelines, templates and more. Starting later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for Apple Watch.","Instagram, American Airlines and ESPN already working on apps .

"Two officials at San Jose State University officials have been forced to resign after a storm over alleged derogatory comments made about Latino women during a meeting of university employees earlier this year. Wanda Ginner, a donor and board member of the university's philanthropic Tower Foundation since 2007, resigned on Friday over the long-running incident. Ginner is alleged to have said that Latina students ‘do not have the DNA to be successful’ during a February meeting. She has denied the allegation. Student protests: Two officials at San Jose State University have been forced to resign after a storm over alleged derogatory comments made about Latino women during a meeting in February . Within hours of Ginner’s stepping down, Vice President for University Advancement Rebecca Dukes also resigned. She had been criticized for failing to challenge the remarks during the original meeting. An informal complaint had been made by a Latina administrator present at the meeting. She then filed a formal complaint in August after she wasn't informed of any resolution. Students have staged protests to voice disapproval with the way the school has handled the accusations. The group Students for Racial Equality publicized one of Ginner's purported quotes in a news release: 'I contribute to this university because these little Latinas do not have the DNA to be successful.' Stepped down: San Jose State University donor Wanda Ginner, right, and Vice President for University Advancement Rebecca Dukes, left, have both been forced to step down over the incident . Ginner denies having ever made the statements and says she is dedicated to supporting organizations that help Latinas, the San Jose Mercury News reported. ‘Although many efforts are already underway, a great deal of work lies ahead as we seek to be the welcoming, inclusive community all Spartans aspire to,’ said University President Mo Qayoumi following the resignations. Students are now demanding that he issue an apology letter to the original complainant and implement mandatory anti-racism trainings. Tower Foundation board chair Amir Mashkoori said Ginner's resigned to stop diverting attention from the university. ‘The fact that Wanda agreed to step down reflects genuine concern for the university and her desire to avoid being a distraction,’ Mashkoori said. The resignations come a year after four San Jose State University students were charged with misdemeanor hate crimes for abusing a black roommate. A report on that incident found the university was slow to respond to the students' cruel taunts and abuse, which included writing racial slurs on a whiteboard, hanging a Confederate flag in their suite, and barricading him in his room.

"Energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs, making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal. A damning investigation by consumer champions at Which? found customer service staff were failing to give families clear tariff information a staggering 95 per cent of the time. Historically, bills have been so complicated that it has been impossible for customers to understand how much gas and electricity they are using and the price per unit. A damning investigation by consumer champions at Which? found customer service staff were failing to give families clear tariff information a staggering 95 per cent of the time . The industry regulator Ofgem responded in March by introducing a new system requiring energy companies to give a Tariff Comparison Rate (TCR) for each energy type. The TCR is similar to an APR for credit cards and tells householders how much a tariff costs per kilowatt hour (kWh) based on medium usage for both gas and electricity. The idea is that householders should be able to ask companies for their TCR in order to get some idea as to which offers the lowest bills. Which? called 13 energy companies six times each – making a total of 78 – asking them to explain the TCR and how it works, however they only managed to provide the correct information on four occasions. The consumer group said the calculation to work out the TCR is so complicated that it is little better than the old system. It involves multiplying the energy unit price by Ofgem’s average consumption figures – 3,200 kWh for electricity and 13,500 kWh for gas. You then add a year’ s standing charge and subtract any discounts, before adding VAT at 20per cent. You then divide the figure by 3,200 for electric or 13,500 for gas to give a TCR for each energy type in pence per kWh. Energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs, making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal. Previous Which? research makes clear the TCR system is of little help to customers and it wants Ofgem to require suppliers to adopt a much simpler petrol pump style system for tariffs. An earlier study found that just three in ten consumers - 28 per cent - got the right answer when asked to identify the cheapest deal from a range of tariffs using the TCR. This shot up to 84 per cent when people used the simple petrol pump style tariff favoured by Which? The group’s executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘If the energy companies can’t even explain how to accurately compare tariffs then their customers stand no chance. ‘It is clear suppliers need to up their game and ensure they can provide consumers with a clear and accurate explanation to help them find the best deal. ‘Energy pricing is still far too complicated, which is why we want the government to introduce simpler pricing, similar to petrol pump displays, so people can spot the cheapest deal at a glance.’ Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and said an increasing number are shopping around . Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and an increasing number are shopping around. ‘Hundreds of thousands of customers are changing electricity supplier every month and new research from Ipsos MORI has shown that 74 per cent of recent switchers found it easy to change supplier,’ it said. ‘The new Tariff Comparison Rate gives customers an indication of whether they are on the best deal but it is not the only way to compare tariffs. 'All consumer bills now tell you how much you can save by changing to a different deal with the same supplier. 'Not only that, switching sites offer customers the chance to compare deals from across the market at the click of a button.’ It added: ‘Energy deals cannot be compared in the same way as petrol pump prices as there are number of additional factors influencing the amount a customer pays. 'These include the customer’s location and government legislation which applies to some companies and not others. However, this does not mean it is hard to find a good deal. ‘Energy UK supports transparency and simplicity. 'Hundreds of thousands of people are switching every month. There are plenty of deals out there so customers should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier to see if they can save money by switching.' Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. Don't forget, prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.

"A nursing student dubbed 'the world's sexiest criminal' has apologized for her crime spree after agreeing to plead guilty to a string of charges that could see her locked away for years. Stéphanie Beaudoin, 21, appeared in court today in Victoriaville, Quebec, to face accusations of 114 separate crimes, including theft and illegally possessing a stash of nine guns. But the striking defendant - who became a viral sensation when pictures emerged after she was first accused - now says she's seen the error of her ways, and is prepared for her punishment. Smouldering before court: Stéphanie Beaudoin, 21, agreed to plead guilty to around 30 counts of theft and firearms possession at a courthouse today in Victoriaville, Quebec . Sensation: Beaudoin became a viral sensation after her social media pictures convinced internet users to dub her the 'world's sexiest criminal' Her lawyers today said she is prepared to enter guilty pleas to around 30 of the accusations in a plea deal which will see Canadian prosecutors drop the rest of the charges. In front of news crews at the courthouse today, French-speaking Beaudoin said: 'Yes, I regret my actions. She told La Nouvelle Union: 'I acted on a whim, and at a bad time. I'm suffering the consequences now, which is the right thing, too.' Although the act charges she will eventually face is unclear, prosecution lawyers have said time behind bars is likely when she next comes to court, on December 9. Prison? Beaudoin, left with a friend, could be imprisoned following her guilty plea - with the most extreme sentence being life behind bars . Apology: Beaudoin said that she is sorry for her crimes, and is prepared for whatever punishment she gets . Legal issues: Beaudoin, pictured above with her lawyer Denis Lavigne, is due back in court next month . The maximum possible sentence is life in prison. Canadian authorities believe Beaudoin worked with three underage accomplices - ages 13, 15 and 17 - to burgle residence in the Athabaska and Maple areas. The young accomplices are being processed by Canadian youth courts. The nursing student and her cohorts allegedly broke into the homes using the back door or basement windows. Viral sensation: Beaudoin, pictured left in a bikini and right with a gun, gained a significant fanbase after the accusation against her - and her pictures - came to light . History of depression: Beaudoin's lawyer said she was going through a difficult time when she committed her crimes . She faces charges of breaking and entering, receiving stolen property, as well as illegally owning and storing a cache of nine firearms. Police found the guns in the back of Beaudoin's white Mitsubishi Lancer. Her lawyer, Denis Lavigne, said: 'I think, with the available information, that she did what she did after a period of depression, which made itself felt.' A pre-sentencing report has been ordered which will give more insight into her state of mind during the crimes. Beaudoin is just the latest in a series of extremely attractive convicts to captivate the internet. First there was Meagan McCullough, a Florida mother who was arrested in July 2010 after a DUI. Her resulting tearful mugshot in an orange jumpsuit spurned several memes including one thatsaid 'I guess it's true...looks do kill'.

"A two-year-old Syrian boy has been reunited with his family in Cyprus after they accidentally left him behind as they fled shelling in Damascus in the summer. Bushr Al Tawashi's parents thought their son had died when their house was bombed, but he was found in the rubble of his family home by rebel fighters. The toddler was taken care of by family friends and after a long legal process his father was able to reunite with his son in Lebanon and take him to Cyprus. Reunited: Bushr Al Tawashi is finally back in his mother's arms after they were separated during heavy shelling in Damascus in the summer . ‘You can imagine how they felt when they were told their son was alive after bearing all this guilt thinking that he was dead,’ the family’s lawyer Stella Constantinou said. In their chaotic haste to escape fighting between government troops and Syrian rebels, Bushr's father Machhour Al Tawashi and his mother Arin Al Dakkar had assumed the boy was picked up by other members of their extended family who had been staying with them. Heavy fighting prevented the parents from going back to search for Bushr once they found temporary shelter at a refugee camp and realised that he was missing. Believing he did not survive the shelling, his parents and their other two sons, aged 4 and 6, arrived in Cyprus in August last year, in search of asylum, two weeks later. Fortunately, word that their boy was safe eventually reached the parents, who now live in the coastal town of Limassol. Luck: Bushr's parents believed he was dead when they arrived at a refugee camps and discovered that the boy was missing . Back together: The toddler pulls a face at the cameras outside a TV station, in Nicosia, Cyprus, the day after he was reunited with his mother and siblings on the island . Mr Al Tawashi’s sister, who had joined the family in Cyprus, volunteered to return to Damascus to take care of Bushr until arrangements for his return could be made, Ms Constantinou said. When Bushr's parents provided proof that he was their child to the Cypriot Foreign Ministry expedited the process. Bushr's father then travelled to the Lebanese capital of Beirut where he was reunited with the boy at the Cypriot Embassy and brought Bushr back to the island on Thursday. ‘I can't describe how I felt when I saw him, just overjoyed at seeing him again,’ Macchour said. ‘At first he didn't recognize me, but then they embraced and he started calling out “Father, Father”'. Mr Al Tawashi said although he still has relatives in Syria there's no way he'll ever go back. Ongoing fight: At least five people were killed and 32 wounded in a car bomb attack in southern Damascus earlier today . Destroyed: Local people in the Daf El Shok area in southern Damascus look at the damage to their neighbourhood from today's car bomb . Ms Constantinou said the toddler was just happy to be in his mother's arms again and calling out to his older brothers. She said what drove her to make sure that the family was reunited was that she became emotionally involved. ‘As a grandmother of a 2-year-old myself, there's nothing I wouldn't do to get that boy back to his parents,’ she said.

"In the age of the internet hoax, viral video can be as slippery as an eel.

Using special effects they learned from working in cinematography, the 20-second clips have duped hundreds of thousands of viewers, garnered them an offer from their local council and even led to a proposal from an American television show. The first od the two popular 20-second-clips, 'Monster Eel yells at pizza bread in Manawatu River'. The videoshave garnered hundreds of thousands of views as well as an offer from an American television show . (L) The second clip, Human sized eel in the Manawatu River. Tim Hamilton says viewers have contacted them saying they too have spotted the monster eels . ‘A viral video show called Right This Minute told us they wanted to use the video,’ said Tim Hamilton. ‘We said ""sure, be our guests"". We never pretended it was real, we just went along with it! I’m not sure if it’s actually going on the show now, but we never lied about the nature of the clip.’ Eventually, the brothers let the cat out of the bag. ‘It started to become a moralistic issue,’ said Tim Hamilton. ‘The river we filmed in is very polluted. We were being approached by activists, as well as Palmerston North City Council, who were excited to start pouring money into the issue. We decided we had to throw in the towel.’ ‘Pahiatua, where we filmed the video, is kind of a medieval town. We realised that if we kept this up, we would probably be burned at the stake.’ The brothers own a special effects company called The Shizz, where they are commissioned to make promotional videos. It was here they learned the expertise to make the video convincing. The brothers eventually decided to expose the videos when they were contacted by their local council, who thought they represented an environmental concern . Ray (left) and Tim Hamilton own a cinematography company which gave them the expertise to create the videos. Tim  (right) says this was their first independent project . ‘It was a pretty simple process. We caught some eels from the river, took them into a bathtub and filmed them over a red screen. We fed them luncheon meat, they blew the scale of the images up so it looks like pizza bread. Then we imposed it over some footage of Manuhatu river.’ Mr Hamilton recalls the best reactions to the videos. ‘There were plenty of people who were saying, ""We’ve seen these before also"". It was really funny. I think the quality of a YouTube video is not necessarily the number of views it gets, but the quality of the dialogue it creates.’ But he says he is unsure if there's a magic ingredient for a viral video. ‘I don’t know you can manufacture a big hit on the internet. Ultimately I think you just need to release lots of quality videos and hope for the best.

"The appearance of two rare sea serpents washing ashore beaches on the Southern California coast in the past week has prompted fears it could be a sign that a natural catastrophe is coming. The giant oarfish were dead when they washed up on land, and some scientists believe they come ashore to die because they are ‘in distress’. The first sea monster, measuring 18 feet, was discovered by a woman snorkelling off the coast of Catalina Island on October 13. It took 16 people to drag it up onto the beach. The second silvery creature, measuring almost 14 feet, came just a few days later on October 18 in Oceanside, California. Scroll down for video... Rare: This snakelike oarfish measuring nearly 14 feet long was found on a beach in Southern California on October 18. Speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake . Close-up: The head of the 18-foot-long oarfish that was found in the waters of Toyon Bay on Santa Catalina Island, California on October 13 . Giant: Oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet in length, are considered the longest bony fish in the world. Pictured is the 18-foot one that washed up on Catalina Island October 13 . Oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet in length, are considered the longest bony fish in the world. They . typically dive more than 3,000 feet deep, which makes sightings rare . and has fueled various serpent legends throughout history. According . to traditional Japanese folklore, oarfish rise to the water’s surface . before an impending earthquake. Scientists speculate it is because the . bottom-dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts. In . 2011, just a few months before a magnitude 8.9 earthquake hit northeast . Japan, over a dozen oarfish, known as ‘ryugu no tsukai’ in Japanese, . either washed ashore or were caught in fishing nets in the Ishikawa, . Toyama, Kyoto, Shimane and Nagasaki prefectures near the quake’s . epicentre. Scientists, however, say there is no data to support an actual link between the two phenomena. Rick . Feeney, who has been studying fish for almost 35 years for the Natural . History Museum of Los Angeles County, told CBS Los Angeles that the two . sightings this week in California were ‘probably just a coincidence’. ‘We . think that they come inshore to die actually because they’re in . distress for some reason, but we don’t know what the reason is,’ said . Feeney, adding that the fish could have been starving or disoriented. The . obscure fish that were found last week apparently died of natural causes and tissue samples and . video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the University of . California, Santa Barbara. According . to Feeney, four sightings have been reported since 2010 from the . Central Coast southward, including in Malibu in 2010 and Lompoc in 2011. In . March 2012, fishermen in Japan reported a sharp increase in oarfish . sightings following the massive magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile that . same month, which marked almost exactly one year before the country was . devastated by its own magnitude-8.9 quake in northeast Japan. The . belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters . – and even the weather - has been around for centuries. Anticipate disaster? A sharp increase in oarfish sightings came just months before a magnitude-8.9 quake devastated northeast Japan in 2011 . Incredible: An 18-foot-long oarfish found dead in the water off Catalina Island near Los Angeles, California . Issues in the deep: Scientist Rick Feeney says they believe the oarfish come up to the water's surface to die 'because they're in distress' A mystery: Oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied . In 373 . B.C., historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes and . weasels, deserted the Greek city of Helice in droves just days before a . quake devastated the place.

"Two mothers’ text message argument over a schoolbus fight between their daughters escalated into a Wild West-style duel and only one woman walked away alive. Deadly duel: Judith Kowaleski is charged with murdering Elizabeth Slagle in a deadly duel that stemmed from a school bus argument between the women's daughters . Judith Kowaleski, 42, told police a fight began between herself and Elizabeth Slagle on Thursday evening. Kowaleski said it stemmed from an earlier argument that occurred between the two women’s daughters as they rode the bus home from school. WVVA reports that text messages and phone calls between Kowaleski, Slagle, and Kowaleski’s aunt identified as Barbra Harrington. At one point, according to the police report, Kowaleski gave the phone to Harrington, who continued the exchange with Slagle. Though . police are still awaiting a warrant in order to read the messages, something was said that took the argument to a far more dangerous . level. Harrington suddenly told Kowaleski she was to meet Slagle at a designated point somewhere between their Bluefield, West Virginia homes. She also told Kowaleski to arm herself. She did as she was told and grabbed a handgun. Too far: Elizabeth Slagle exchanged text messages prior to meeting Kowaleski for the duel that ended her life . The two women walked to the end of their road, where they met Slagle. More arguing about the children ensued and at one point, the report alleges, Slagle claimed she had a gun and would shoot Kowaleski. A witness at the scene, identified in reports as Kowaleski's boyfriend George Slagle, claimed Elizabeth Slagle used Taser on Kowaleski and Harrington. George Slagle also told officials that his girlfriend fired the shot that eventually killed Slagle, though the relationship between the two Slagle remains unknown. Big trouble: Kowaleski (pictured at her arraignment) faces a first degree murder charge for the shooting and killing of Elizabeth Slagle . Defense? Police are shown at the scene of Slagle's deadly shooting, which Kowaleski claims occurred when the victim lunged at her with a Taser . It was while being Tasered, Kowaleski told officials, when she ‘just tried to get [Slagle] off, and the gun went off.’ It is unclear if that shot wounded Slagle or if there was a second shot that struck the 42-year-old because Kowaleski’s account also claims she tried to walk away and Slagle lunged at her and it was at that point that Kowaleski shot Slagle. According to the report, the shooting occurred sometime prior to 10pm on March 28. The report states that a witness arrived at the scene to find Kowaleski and Harrington administering CPR to Slagle in a roadway. Slagle was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. Investigators would subsequently find the alleged murder weapon in Kowaleski’s home. Kowaleski is being held on a first degree murder charge with no bail set.","Judith Kowaleski took a handgun to a mutually planned confrontation that ended with fellow mother Elizabeth Slagle dead and Kowaleski placed in custody .

"Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson (above) will be made to wear an electronic tag as a condition of his early release from prison on Friday . Disgraced ex-Tory communications chief Andy Coulson will be freed from prison on Friday – after serving less than five months of an 18-month sentence for hacking. The ex-News of the World editor will be made to wear an electronic tag as a condition of his early release, which is around 130 days before his jail term reaches even the halfway stage. Coulson was jailed on July 4 after he was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones. A senior judge at the Old Bailey said that he had to take a ‘major share of the blame’ for the phone hacking at the now defunct tabloid newspaper, in which the voicemails of thousands of victims were unlawfully accessed. The victims included celebrities, politicians, the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and members of the royal family, . Coulson, 46, initially spent two months in Category A Belmarsh prison, in south London, alongside terrorists and other dangerous inmates – longer than is usual for a crime such as hacking. He was then moved to Hollesley Bay, a minimum security jail in Suffolk. When the shamed Tory MP Jeffrey Archer was imprisoned there for perverting the course of justice, the NOTW called it a ‘holiday camp’. His sentence has been calculated under a complicated set of rules known as the Home Detention Curfew Scheme. This allows non-violent inmates sentenced to 18 months or more to spend the last 135 days or less at home, wearing a tag. In Coulson’s case, his 18-month sentence was halved – as happens in all bar the most serious cases - then had the further reduction made under HDC rules. However, his ordeal will not be at an end when he leaves open prison. In August, prosecutors in Scotland announced he faces a series of perjury charges over the Tommy Sheridan trial. Coulson, who was jailed on July 4 after he was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones at the now defunct tabloid newspaper, is currently being held at Hollesley Bay, a minimum security jail in Suffolk (pictured) Coulson is alleged to have lied while giving evidence at the trial in December 2010. He is accused of knowing there was a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World while he was editor but denying it while on oath. Following his conviction in July, the Prime Minister apologised for hiring Coulson as a Tory spin doctor and, later, the communications chief at Number Ten. David Cameron said it was “the wrong decision”.","Andy Coulson jailed in July after conviction of conspiracy to hack phones .

"Plan: Ahmed Raofi, 29, became enraged when lover Irene Santos refused to terminate their unborn child . An Afghani minicab driver who tied his pregnant mistress up then forced poisonous pills into her womb in order to abort his unwanted child has been jailed for six years. Ahmed Raofi, 29, became enraged when lover Irene Santos refused to terminate their unborn child, so he hatched a plan to kill the foetus without her consent. After hours of internet research, . Raofi bought packets Misoprostol online and invited Ms Santos to his . flat  in Edgware, northwest London, on April 9, with the promise of sex, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. He then pounced when Ms Santos was on the bed, taping her hands, feet, and mouth when she began to scream out for help. Within a few hours, Ms Santon - a Filipino national working in Britain -  began . getting crippling cramps. She miscarried the 19-week-old foetus, . which was still breathing and showed signs of life, paramedics told the court. The baby survived for ten minutes outside the womb. Judge Aidan Marron said Raofi had . ‘surreptitiously’ had sex with Ms Santos so that she was naked and that . he could detain her and force the abortion. ‘Overtures to Ms Santos to terminate . the baby were to no avail and yet apparently she continued throughout to . love you dearly,’ Judge Marron said. ‘You obtained drugs to facilitate a . miscarriage and then surreptitiously engaged in sexual intercourse with . Ms Santos so when she was naked you could cause the abortion. 'You denied a woman of a much wanted child and the damage to that woman is manifestly profound' Judge Aidan Marron . ‘You denied a woman of a much wanted child and the damage to that woman is manifestly profound.’ Raofi, of Edgware, northwest London, admitted to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage. Prosecutor David Markham told the court: ‘Irene . Santos was the lover of the defendant. The defendant was married to another woman’. ‘The . defendant had met Ms Santos in late 2011 and they became lovers - she . knew he was married and that he was not seeking a serious relationship. Harrowing: Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, heard how Ahmed Raofi tied his pregnant mistress down and forced poisonous pill into her womb as she screamed out for help . ‘The . defendant travelled to Afghanistan in January this year to be with his . wife and it was then that Ms Santos told him over Skype that she was . pregnant. ‘He had previously . made it clear to Ms Santos that the prospect of having a child in these . circumstances was something he did not want. ‘When . she became pregnant he wanted her to have an abortion and when she . refused to do that he took matters into his own had to end the pregnancy . against her wishes. ‘In . February he had tried to take Ms Santos to an abortion clinic and booked . an appointment for her but she refused to go through with it. ‘He told her that he would wait until she was seven months pregnant then, in his words, “punch it out of her”.' After receiving news of his lover's pregnancy, Raofi returned from Afghanistan to attack Ms Santos, telling her he would ‘punch it out of her,’ Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Mr Markham said: ‘They had made love . on the night of April 9 and after that the defendant produced some . gaffer tape and asked if she wanted a “Chinese massage”. ‘Ms Santos lied naked on her back and . could feel plastic against her legs - the defendant then pulled her legs . apart and she then felt at least four tablets go inside her. ‘When she screamed he put the gaffer tape over her mouth. ‘In the early hours of April 10 Ms Santos suffered abdominal cramping and bleeding and called 999. ‘The foetus, which was 19 weeks old, came out her before the ambulance arrived. ‘There were signs of life and a . paramedic described that he could see the baby breathing and moving for . at least ten minutes before it died. ‘Ms Santos told a midwife at hospital . what had happened to her and that is when the police were called and the . defendant was arrested.’","Ahmed Raofi, 29, of Edgware, London, was jailed for six years .

"A scandal-hit hospital where all but the most seriously ill patients have been barred from accident and emergency is being investigated for fiddling waiting time figures. Colchester General Hospital is only handling urgent cases after a surprise inspection found staff swamped by ‘unprecedented demand’. And watchdogs were shocked to see a dead body being wheeled through casualty during the inspection. The Care Quality Commission confirmed it will investigate allegations staff at Colchester General Hospital in Essex fiddled waiting time figures to meet four-hour target . In the past three days, 29 non-emergency operations have been cancelled – around ten times as many as normal. The ongoing ‘major incident’ is likely to last more than a week. A Department of Health source said the trust has suffered from long-term problems, stemming largely from weak management. A review in 2010 also found that in four of the five previous years, Colchester Hospital reported higher than expected death rates. Now health watchdog the Care Quality Commission has confirmed that during an inspection its team was confronted with claims A&E staff were faking records to meet the four-hour waiting time target. ‘A can of worms has been opened at Colchester Hospital and there is a lot more waiting to come out,’ a source told the Mail. In the past three days, 29 non-emergency operations have been cancelled – ten times as many as normal . The culture of highly paid interim managers at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust has also been criticised. Former temporary chief executive Kim Hodgson was paid up to £95,000 for just ten weeks’ work – equivalent to £450,000 a year. The CQC has confirmed it is investigating the alleged falsification of records. The revelation suggests statistics which show one in nine patients wait more than four hours to be seen in casualty could be wildly inaccurate. Some 77,757 patients were treated there in 2013-2014, up from 76,338 the previous year. It also raises the possibility of a culture of massaging figures after similar practices were uncovered in cancer care. The hospital was put into special measures last November after a CQC report found the records of 22 cancer patients out of a sample of 61 had been altered to disguise ‘extensive delays for treatment’. Gary Brigden (right) accused the hospital of robbing him of the chance to grow old with his wife Lisa (left, with her grandaughter Lilie Mae) after a catalogue of delays in her cancer treatment and a misdiagnosis . Police were asked to probe claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter waiting times. The CQC carried out an inspection last Wednesday after receiving ‘information of concern’. This led to the trust announcing a ‘major incident’. Only those with problems such as broken bones, heavy blood loss, chest pain and overdoses will be seen in A&E. The inspection also raised concerns about the treatment of elderly and dementia patients, after reports of ‘inappropriate restraint, sedation and resuscitation’. Roger Goss, from pressure group Patient Concern, said the allegations were ‘shocking’. A trust spokesman said: ‘We are not providing a running commentary on the CQC inspection.’","Care Quality Commission confirmed it's investigating falsification claims .

"Conservationists have launched an online petition to save a 45-year-old dolphin which they claim is being overworked and unfairly forced to kiss visitors to a marine park. Bucky is one of six dolphins which live at Dolphin Marine Magic park in Coffs Harbour, NSW, north of Sydney. Only he and one other dolphin were rescued, the other four were born in captivity. Conservation group Australia For Dolphins (AFD) has gathered 11,200 signatures for its petition which aims to get the Department of Primary Industries to look into the conditions of the park - as well as the 'cruel' treatment the animals are forced to 'endure'. Bucky was rescued at just a year old and has been living at a marine park in Coffs Harbour, NSW, ever since . AFD claims Dolphin Marine Magic doesn't have adequate facilities and has 'strong evidence' that the centre is not complying with its exhibit licence. The park denies the claims. Dolphin Marine Magic, which was opened in 1970, has been in conflict with original owner Hec Goodall since 2004 when he was 'pushed out' of the management side of the business - but the dispute took a new twist with the launch of the petition. Critics claim the park's focus has shifted from rescue and rehabilitation to a 'money making enterprise', and say the pools are no longer big enough to house all the marine animals. Hec Goodall, who founded Porpoise Pool in 1970 opened the park as a rescue and rehabilitation centre for marine animals . The petition - which has over 11,200 signatures - says: 'At Dolphin Marine Magic dolphins are forced to perform in demeaning shows, swim with and kiss strangers, and even give members of the public 'rides' on a daily basis. '... Not only that, but the size of the dolphin pool falls well short of legal specifications.' Advocacy director of AFD Jordan Sosnowski told Daily Mail Australia they hope this will push the marine park to realign their focus on caring for unwell animals rather than breeding them in captivity for shows. 'We were so happy with the public support we got, its calling on the Department of Primary Industries to undertake an investigation into Dolphin Marine Magic.' Australia For Dolphins have launched a petition against the park - now called Dolphin Marine Magic - claiming the animals are mistreated . 'The facilities are not only too small but we have strong evidence to suggest they're illegal,' said Ms Sosnowski. Other concerns include the number of shows that dolphins at the park perform, and the level of interaction they are now required to have with visitors each day. 'I think is fairly controversial, and this occurs on a daily basis despite the legal standards stating only minimal handling is allowed,' Ms Sosnowski said. Troy Saville, who managed the facility for ten years when it was still the Porpoise Pool, also voiced his concerns about the treatment of the animals. Mr Goodall has been battling to regain control of the marine centre and has plans to turn it into a hospital and rescue operation once again . 'I don’t think that the animals have the same freedom as they did when we were there,' Mr Saville said, speaking of the period he ran the park alongside Mr Goodall. 'The interaction that they're doing is to my mind is probably too much.' Mr Goodall held the same view, and while he wasn't quite as critical as Mr Saville, said despite the fact that dolphins have a 'natural affinity to become friends with humans' he believed they were 'overworked'. 'I don't agree that three shows a day is necessary, it's only necessary to make money,' Mr Goodall told Daily Mail Australia. '(And) there's a heck of a lot more interaction than we had.' Critics have said Bucky (right) and fellow dolphins are forced to perform three times a day to meet demand . However the current CEO of Dolphin Marine Magic Paige Sinclair disputes these claims, saying the dolphins actually spend less time performing now than they used to. Ms Sinclair said previous performances called 'Sea Circus Shows' run when Mr Goodall was in charge lasted for over an hour, and 'now they're only 25 minutes'. She denied claims that dolphins were forced to give visitors 'rides' and said while more people are swimming with the dolphins there are more animals at the park than there used to be. However CEO of Dolphin Marine Magic said the animals perform less than they used to and denied anyone rides the dolphins . The chief executive also told Daily Mail Australia that her park had already been working with the Department of Primary Industries to evaluate the measurements of the pools at the facility, as she believes she was misinformed about the size of them when she gained control. 'To blatantly lie to people ... and get 11,000 signatures on a petition is just a waste of time for everybody involved,' Ms Sinclair said. She also revealed that she had been 'fighting this battle' since she took the reins in 2004, and while she had no bad words to say about Mr Goodall said she was 'baffled' by the fact that one of major shareholders is fighting her over the park he founded. 'I don't understand why our major shareholder is trying to cause problems, it just baffles me,' Ms Sinclair said. There are also  concerns about the high level on interaction visitors have with the dolphins . Despite this Mr Goodall and his team are aiming to take control of the park once again and have big plans to turn the facility into a research centre and hospital for the marine life. 'We felt that the park had the ultimate potential to be a world leader in teaching people about marine animals, in rescue and rehab,' Mr Saville said, before adding he still has such aspirations if he was to regain control of the facility. '(Right now) the park doesn't realise its potenial, it has got this very commercial ambition.'","Bucky the bottlenose dolphin was rescued by Hec Goodall in 1970 .

"As Angel Quiles smiles down at his tiny daughter feeding on her bottle, it is nothing short of a miracle that he is holding the healthy baby girl in his arms. The proud father had his world turned upside down on October 15 when he received a call from a hospital in St Petersburg, Florida to say that his pregnant wife, Jenny, had been in a car accident. At first he thought she had been driving her car so he was stunned to learn that she had been on a crosswalk on her way to a doctor's appointment when she was hit by a tow truck. While his unborn baby daughter was not injured in the crash, doctors needed to put his wife, who was seven months pregnant, in a coma to help with her traumatic brain injury. Proud dad: Angel Quiles is pictured feeding his newborn daughter, Angel Noemi, at his parents home in Tarpon Springs, Florida. The little girl was born two weeks after her mother was hit by a truck and put in a coma . Two weeks later, she started having contractions and doctors delivered baby Angel Noemi by C-section. She weighed a tiny 6lbs at birth but was otherwise healthy. A week later, on November 7, she returned home - without her mother. Jenny Quiles, 36, has now woken up and remains in a rehabilitation center with serious brain injuries. But her husband, 35, told the St Petersburg Tribune that he does not think she recognizes her daughter, whom she has met and kissed. 'I don't think she recognizes the baby as to be her baby,' he said. 'I think she has an idea. We just don't know if she really knows.' Jenny appears to respond to conversation and can say some words and answer basic questions, but she will have to relearn how to speak and try to recover her memory, the Tribune reported. Meeting: Jenny Quiles kisses her baby daughter in hospital but Angel is not sure if his wife, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash a month ago, understands that the little girl is hers . 'She's like a three-year-old,' her husband said. 'She's learning how to say her ABC's again.' It is a battle he could never have anticipated. 'It's a lot of stress,' he said. 'I'm just going day by day and trying to do what I can on a daily basis. I'm exhausted, mentally drained... Now that the baby is home I can concentrate a little bit more on Jenny.' He is hoping she'll be able to come home by the end of the year but doctors said it's more likely she'll return in February or March, he said. Angel has taken time off his jobs as a medical assistant at assisted living facilities and a manager for an irrigation department under the Family and Medical Leave Act. He is trying to raise funds for his wife's care and has set up a gofundme page. Together: Jenny, who was 33 weeks pregnant when she was hit, and Angel Quiles married last year . Tragic: Jenny, left and right in hospital, is still battling a traumatic brain injury and struggling to talk . Police said that Mrs Quiles was crossing the road on the yellow light when the truck driver, Shaun Downing, hit her. Downing has been charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian. In a bizarre twist, the accident unfolded just weeks before Angel Quiles witnessed another crash in which a 21-year-old woman was fatally hit by a car as she rode her scooter. Susie Stone was thrown into a ditch in Dunedin and Quiles ran to her and prayed with her before she passed away. 'All she said after I prayed with her was, 'Tell my mom I'm going to be OK, and give her a hug for me',' Quiles, 35, told WPTV. 'I just began to cry when I saw her take her last breath.' On Friday, he met with Stone's heartbroken parents to comfort them and pass on her dying wish. Loss: Last week, Quiles was there when 21-year-old Susie Stone, pictured, was knocked off her scooter by a car. He ran to her side and held her as she passed away on the side of the road . Heartbreaking: Quiles met Susie's parents last week to pass on her final message to them . 'I told her, 'Sorry, I wish I could have done more',' said Quiles. 'She said that Susie's a beautiful girl who loved life.' Stone's mother said that she was glad her daughter had an angel by her side. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged. The Quiles family has set up a gofundme page to raise funds for Jenny's medical care.

"Topshop has asked the Court of Appeal to intervene after a row over the T-shirt (pictured) with  Rihanna led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores . High Street chain Topshop has launched an appeal case in a bid to overturn a ruling which stopped it from selling T-shirts with a picture of pop star Rihanna on the front. Topshop, which is owned by Sir Philip Green, has asked the Court of Appeal to intervene after a row over the T-shirt with the 26-year-old singer led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores. Last year, a High Court judge concluded that Rihanna's fans might be deceived into thinking she had endorsed the 'tank' sleeveless T-shirt sold by Topshop and ruled it must be pulled from shelves. However, Topshop – which is owned by the Arcadia Group – has now asked the appeal judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in London to review the case after believing the previous judge had erred in his approach to the law on celebrity merchandising. During the case last year, Rihanna's lawyers said the image used on the T-shirt was from an unauthorised photograph taken while she was filming a video in Northern Ireland for one of her singles in 2011. At the time, Mr Justice Birss ruled that Topshop's sale of the top without her approval was, in the circumstances, 'passing off'. Today, Topshop lawyers presented the appeal judges - Lord Justice Richards, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Underhill – with a rack of the T-shirts as the two-day case got underway. Geoffrey Hobbs QC, appearing for Topshop, said the starting point in the appeal case was that the court was dealing with a 'decorated T-shirt' in a tradition of the merchandising of star images over the decades, including those of Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and Prince. Mr Hobbs argued that Rihanna was in reality wrongly using the law on passing off to claim that 'only a celebrity may ever market his or her own character'. Rihanna has various lucrative endorsement deals with retailers including Topshop's high-street rival River Island. Mr Hobbs contended that the public had no expectation that clothes bearing an image were authorised by people shown in that image. Topshop, which is owned by Sir Philip Green (right), has asked the Court of Appeal to intervene after a judge ruled last year that the high street fashion chain could not sell its T-shirt with Rihanna's (left) face on the front . He challenged Mr Justice Birss's ruling that, although celebrities had no general right to control the reproduction of their image, Topshop's use of Rihanna's image did amount to passing off. The judge had observed it was damaging to the star's 'goodwill' and ultimately represented a loss of control over her reputation in the 'fashion sphere'. Mike Gardner, a partner and head of intellectual property and commercial at Wedlake Bell LLP, commented on the case: 'Unlike in some other countries, in the UK celebrities have no legal right, as such, to control the use that is made of their image. 'But if a product is marketed in such a way as to suggest, incorrectly, that they have endorsed or approved it, then this can amount to illegal passing off. Topshop has now asked the appeal judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured) to review the case after believing the previous judge had erred in his approach to the law on celebrity merchandising . 'Although each case is different, if Topshop fails to overturn the ruling, this may discourage other retailers from selling similar items in the future and may lead other celebrities to take a tougher line in policing their rights. 'But if Topshop is successful, celebrities and their management teams may have to think more about how they can best protect their branding in countries like the UK which do not recognise image rights.' The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Topshop ordered last year to stop selling T-shirts with Rihanna on the front .

"Lives are being put at risk because traffic authorities fail to show discretion towards drivers who try to ‘do the right thing’ by clearing a path for ‘999’ emergency vehicles, according to the AA. Hard-line automated camera enforcement means that law-abiding drivers ‘with a conscience’ who instinctively divert into a bus-lane, move into a yellow box, or nudge forward through a red light to let an ambulance or fire-engine pass, are rewarded with a hefty fine through the letterbox. ‘Motorists who act like saints are being treated like sinners’, said the AA. ‘The bottom-line is that local authorities and firms operating bus lane cameras have been making such a killing with fines that many drivers don’t now trust enforcers to show discretion. And with good reason.’ Scroll down for video . Many motorists who fear automatic fines from camera policing won't pull over on the road to let a fire engine, police or an ambulance pass, an AA survey shows - which is threatening emergency services' response times . The AA says 'local authorities and firms operating bus lane cameras have been making a killing with fines' As a result, the threat of automatic fines now means that one in 10 drivers would no longer divert into a bus lane to let through an ambulance, fire engine, or police car through – even if the sirens were wailing and the beacons flashing. That rises to one in six (17per cent) in London, a new AA /Populus poll reveals. Such reluctance to move threatens emergency services response times, says the AA. But it also exposes the extent to which automated traffic enforcement cameras have removed ‘common sense and discretion’ from the rules of the road. For the strict letter of the law is clear - no matter how much it pricks their conscience, drivers should only move into a bus lane, a yellow box junction or through a red light when specifically ‘directed to do so by a police officer in uniform.’ Otherwise they should harden their hearts, sit tight and let the emergency vehicles find their own way around them. The boom in cameras policing bus lanes and yellow boxes means that if they obey their conscience they will be hit with a hefty automatic penalty-charge dropping through their letter box, says the AA. The letter of the law says motorists should only pull over if directed to do so by a police officer in uniform . A fear of fines means that one in six (13per cent) of the 18,026 AA members surveyed would not stop in a yellow box junction to allow emergency vehicles to pass, rising to nearly one in five (19per cent) in London. The capital is the only part of the UK where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras though this is expected to move more widely across the country. Many UK cities fine drivers £60, reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days, for entering a bus lane. In London, the penalty charge is £130, halved to £65 for early payment. Drivers in London face the same if they stop in a yellow-box junction. Drivers do appear more prepared to carry out riskier manoeuvres to help emergency vehicles on their way, with nearly half (48per cent) prepared to go through red lights and nearly a third (31per) prepared cent to exceed the speed limit to give them clearance, even though they lay themselves open to prosecution by the police and points on their licence, as well as a fine. Failure to stop at a red traffic light can result in a £100 fixed penalty plus three points, the same as for speeding. Overall, four out of ten (39per cent) say they wouldn’t worry about bus lanes, red lights, box junctions, speed limits, or pulling up on to the pavement if an emergency vehicle needed to get past. AA president Edmund King said: ‘When it comes to emergency vehicles stuck in heavy traffic, most drivers think: ‘There but for the grace of God go we – because, the next time, that emergency vehicle could be for us’. And that is why most AA members and other drivers will risk the chance of a penalty charge to save a life.’ London is the only part of the UK where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras, though this is expected to move widely across the country. Traffic enforcers will 'seize on the chance to impose fines' ‘But in return too many bus lane, yellow box junction and moving traffic offence enforcers will seize the opportunity to dish out a penalty charge. Inevitably, some drivers won’t take the risk and it only takes one to block and hold up an ambulance or fire engine.’ Mr King noted: ‘The firms and councils operating enforcement cameras say that they take into account the presence of an on-call emergency vehicle before issuing a penalty notice. But in reality that is too often not the case.’ Sussex police advises on its website that motorists should ‘stay alert to approaching emergency vehicles’. It says: ‘When you hear the sirens or see flashing lights, try to locate the vehicle and consider the route that it may take. Take any appropriate action to let it pass, but be careful not to contravene any traffic signs or rules of the road.‘ . It adds: ‘Remember: Emergency vehicle drivers are specially trained and have exemptions to the law that you don’t have, so you must not go through red lights or speed to allow them to pass.' Motorists should not ‘panic or brake suddenly’, mount the kerb, or pull-over on or near to a hill, bend or narrow section of the road. Nottingham City Council has sought to clarify their enforcement of bus lanes. It notes there are ‘a small number of reasons when it is OK to enter a bus lane. 'Principally this is ‘when directed to do so by a police officer in uniform’. Other reasons it cites include: to avoid a collision or debris in the road; to drop off or pick up a passenger; circumstances outside the control of the driver; or to enter or exit a driveway to a roadside property. It adds: ‘In all cases it is expected that the stay in the bus lane is as brief as possible.’ Nottingham insists that if a driver is spotted using a bus lane to ‘undertake a vehicle which turning right into a side road, then the council will ‘treat each case on its merits and try to adopt a common sense approach.’ Drivers will have 20 metres’ ‘discretionary’ driving in the lane, it said: ‘The driver of such a manoeuvre should ensure that the route back out of the bus lane is clear before undertaking. 'In most cases the discretionary 20 metres distance will not be exceeded.’","Drivers who pull over for an ambulance or fire-engine hit with hefty fines .

"Britain faces another 10 years of austerity as the government struggles to repair the country’s battered finances, a hard-hitting report warns today. The vast deficit racked up by Labour will not be eliminated until after 2020 and possibly not until 2023, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The report also warns that Britain will be stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating as the national debt spirals further out of control. Britain should brace: A hard-hitting report warned today that Britain should prepare for ten more years of austerity as the Government struggles to bring spending under control . But it adds that the UK will avoid a triple-dip recession this year - but only just. The think tank expects a 0.5 per cent slump in output in the final quarter of 2012 followed by growth of just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. The forecasts will make grim reading for David Cameron and George Osborne and raise the prospect of the next two general elections, in 2015 and 2020, being fought against a backdrop of austerity. The Chancellor has staked his political and economic credibility on clearing up the mess left by Labour and safe-guarding the country’s gold-plated credit score. But Scott Corfe, senior economist at the CEBR, said: ‘Weak economic growth will hold back the deficit reduction programme over the coming years. ‘The deficit reduction programme will stretch into not just the next Parliament but into the one after that. It could take another 10 years from now.’ Douglas McWilliams, CEBR chief executive, said: ‘It will be almost impossible for the UK to maintain its AAA rating in the light of this forecast.’ The last Labour government borrowed a record £159 billion in 2009-10 as the financial crisis struck and the economic boom gave way to the biggest bust in living memory. Grim reading: Chancellor George Osborne (left) has staked his political and economic credibility on clearing up the mess left by Labour but the forecasts are grim for him and David Cameron (right) and raise the prospect of the next two general elections being fought against a backdrop of austerity . After coming to power in May 2010, Mr Osborne pledged to eradicate the budget deficit within five years - far faster than planned by Labour. Borrowing fell to £142 billion in the Coalition’s first year in power and again to £121 billion last year but the decline has not been as fast as the Chancellor predicted. He has now extended austerity to 2018 as he struggles to balance the books - but the CEBR report warns that this is still too optimistic. It forecasts borrowing of £68 billion in 2017-18 - more than double the £31 billion expected by the Treasury - making deficit reduction ‘a three Parliament problem’. Mission impossible: CEBR chief executive Douglas McWilliams said it will be 'almost impossible for the UK to maintain its AAA rating' The report blames weak growth and the government’s failure to cut spending, which looks set to have risen by 2.8 per cent in 2012, the fastest pace of growth since 2004. ‘There seems to have been a setback in reducing public spending despite alleged austerity,’ said Mr Corfe. The failure to reduce borrowing more quickly means the national debt will hit almost 85 per cent of national income in the next five years and will not start falling until 2018-19, according to the report. Mr Osborne initially planned for the national debt to peak at 70.3 per cent of national income in 2013-14 but now hopes it will not rise any higher than 79.9 per cent in 2015-16. The national debt was just £200 billion 20 years ago and around £300 billion 10 years ago. But it spiralled to £800 billion under Labour and is set to hit more than £1.5 trillion in the next five years - or £60,000 per household in Britain. Ruth Lea, economic advisor to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, said: ‘The public finances are truly dire. Public sector net debt is continuing to increase at an alarming rate. Britain’s AAA rating must be regarded as vulnerable.’ Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch - the world’s three biggest agencies - have all put the AAA rating on ‘negative outlook’ with a downgrade widely expected this year. Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: ‘I would be surprised if all three of the main ratings agencies had the UK as AAA by this time next year.’","Report by Centre for Economics and Business Research says Britain faces another 10 years of austerity .

"Former AFL player Stephen Milne has received a hefty fine but avoided a conviction for indecently assaulting a woman 10 years ago. The former St Kilda star, who was supported by wife Melissa, his father and brother, was fined $15,000 in Victorian Country Court on Tuesday after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting a 19 year old woman at a teammate's house after a drunken night out in 2004. The result in the long standing case comes after three rape charges against the former AFL footballer were dropped earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Former St Kilda AFL player Stephen Milne (centre) arrives at the Victorian County Court in Melbourne where he was fined $15,000 but escaped conviction for allegedly indecently assaulting a woman in 2004 . Former St Kilda AFL player Stephen Milne (pictured) and his wife Melissa (pictured) leave the Victorian County Court in Melbourne after he was fined $15,000 with no conviction to indecent assault . Victorian County Court Judge Michael Bourke described the incident as a non-violent but physical sexual act. He said both the victim and Milne had suffered due to the decade-long delay in bringing the matter to court, and described Milne as a different and far more mature man than at the time of his crime. 'The evidence is highly persuasive that this offending was out of character,' Judge Bourke said on Tuesday. He accepted Milne was a man of good character who had suffered from the publicity of the high profile incident. 'You have been the subject of public scrutiny and public abuse,' Judge Bourke said. 'Your family has witnessed and been distressed by this.' Milne, 34, had been due to face trial charged with three counts of rape later this month. Former AFL player Stephen Milne outside court on Tuesday, has been fined but avoided a conviction for indecently assaulting a woman 10 years ago . In Victorian County Court on Tuesday Stephen Milne (pictured) was flanked by supporters including wife Melissa (pictured) The resolution to the long standing case comes after three rape charges against the former AFL footballer were dropped earlier this month . But he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault on November 6 after the Office of Public Prosecutions withdrew the rape allegations. Milne, admitted to indecently assaulting the woman in a darkened room, with former teammate Leigh Montagna and another woman nearby. Judge Bourke said the victim had believed Milne was Montagna. Milne met his victim and her female friend at the St Kilda Football Club family day in March 2004, the day after the club won the pre-season premiership. Milne, Montagna and the two women met later that night at Montagna's house and the offending occurred while all four were together in a dark room. Judge Bourke described Milne's crime as unplanned and somewhat spontaneous but said he offended after the victim had been clear in saying no. Former AFL player Stephen Milne (pictured) with wife Melissa (pictured) has received a hefty fine but avoided a conviction for indecently assaulting a woman 10 years ago . Stephen Milne (pictured at an earlier court appearance) had three rape charges dropped . If Milne was convicted, the maximum penalty for indecent assault was 10 years' jail. He has six months to pay the fine. Earlier in November when the rape charges were dropped, Milne went to court supported by wife Melissa, St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt and recently retired Saints midfielder Lenny Hayes. At an earlier court appearance, Milne's barrister Philip Dunn QC asked Judge Michael Bourke to hand Milne a fine without conviction in relation to his indecent assault charge. Mr Dunn said the offence was more than 10 years old and Milne had not offended since. He described the offending as 'unplanned, spontaneous and momentary'. But Mr Dunn acknowledged Milne had offended after the victim had been clear in saying 'no'. Milne (pictured in an earlier court appearance) was supported by former Saints teammates Nick Riewoldt and Lenny Hayes . Milne retired last year after playing more than 250 game for St Kilda . 'His recklessness was a misread of the situation,' said Mr Dunn in court early November. He also said Milne and his family had suffered a decade of abuse, in which crowds chanted 'rapist' at St Kilda's AFL games. Mr Dunn described one incident in which Milne's partner took photos of his 250th AFL game and was insulted by a K-Mart employee when she went to have them printed. 'What do you want a photo of a rapist for?' she was asked.

The popular award-winning show stars Taylor Schilling (right) and Laura Prepon (left) One of the world's leading Internet movie and TV subscription service is set to launch in Australia and New Zealand in March 2015 . The announcement of the launch ends months of speculation about the local plans for the company. The online service, which first launched in 2007, boasts some 53 million subscribers in dozens of countries . The platform will be available on smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, set-top boxes and consoles, with high-definition and 4K available. A Netflix spokesman told Daily Mail Australia it has been unconfirmed whether shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black will be available as they are still in 'internal discussions'. Pricing has not been disclosed but the Daily Telegraph reports it is expected to cost about $10 to $15 a month. Tens of thousands of Australians are reportedly already accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network technology, which alters their IP address. DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien will be available to Australian and New Zealand viewers . Other launch titles include upcoming US television series Marvel's Daredevil . Marco Polo is also one of Neflix's original series, which is set to be available in Australia and New Zealand . The announcement comes months after Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax Media revealed they will be launching a new Australian subscription service next year. StreamCo is expected to launch during the 2015 financial year. The Netflix launch is expected to ramp up the pressure on pay-TV services such as Foxtel, which recently slashed prices in anticipation. Yet the antipodean version is likely to lag the US version given Foxtel owns exclusive local rights to shows such as Game of Thrones. Launch titles will include original series such as Marco Polo, BoJack Horseman and All Hail King Julien, with others such as Bloodline and Marvel's Daredevil to come later in the year. The US-based company has also gained Australian subscription video on-demand rights to superhero television series Gotham, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. However Nine Entertainment currently holds the broadcast, first-run, and in-season catch up rights to the Batman prequel. As a result, Netflix will not be able to air the new show until 12 months after it has premiered on Nine.","Netflix will be available to Australian and New Zealand viewers next year .

"Students the world over have always fought with each other, but when the dust-ups appear on social media it just makes for bad PR for the school involved. This is why Kinross College in Perth is trying to shut down a Facebook page created by their students dedicated to showing fights at their school. However, Facebook has shown they’re also up for a scrap and have refused to bow to pressure from the college to shut down the page. 9News reported that the principal and parents at the Perth high school have demanded that the Facebook posting showing the playground brawls be taken down. Scroll down for video . Two Kinross College year nine students square up in the fight posted on Facebook . It's the second clip of students fighting from Kinross College and the fourth from a Northern Suburbs school to be shared in the past week. A concerned parent contacted Facebook asking for the page to be removed because of its brutal content but they were adamant that the page did not breach its standards. In one video on the Perth Fights page on Tuesday, two year nine students from Kincross College are shown punching and kicking each other. They're being cheered on by other students who can be heard in the background encouraging the fighters on by shouting: “Go…fight, fight, fight”. Both students in the latest video were suspended. One student gets knocked back by a punch during the brawl at the Perth high school . In an interview with the Today Show, Kincross College Principal Lloyd Page condemned the school-yard attack and requested Facebook take it down. 'We've consulted with our parents and our parents are happy with the sanctions we've put in with our students,' he said. 'From our point of view the issue’s been dealt with appropriately.' Facebook maintained that the Perth Fights page was 'within the guidelines of their operating system' However, Mr Page is hopeful that Facebook will accept that the footage is in bad taste and that they'll shut down the offending page. 'We have approached Facebook and we initially received a negative response from Facebook saying what's on the page was within the guidelines of their operating system,' he explained. Parents of students were furious that the fights could be viewed on facebook . 'However early this morning I have received information the Facebook page is still up, but the information has been taken down.' Despite this though, a replacement 'fight' page has already been put up by students. All of which calls into question exactly how much parents know about what their children are uploading onto the likes of Facebook, and whether it is appropriate. School authorities have asked that the Facebook page be shut down due to its violent content . 'Parents have a huge responsibility and a huge role to play in all aspects of social media. They need to keep abreast of what's happening with social media. Our students are clearly more advanced... with this sort of technology,' Mr Page told the Today Show. The stunned student tries to get to his feet after coming off second best in the fight at Kinross College . 'Part of it is monitoring... and sitting and talking with students about the types of things going on social media. 'Once you're up on the social media page, that stays with you for the rest of your life.'","Pupils at Kinross College have created their own Perth Fights page .

"Health visitors are to be given guidance on how to recognise the signs of relationships in trouble and offer support to help families stay together. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith believes couples may be reluctant to seek support but are more likely to respond to professionals they already know. The proposal emerged as Mr Duncan Smith claimed Britain’s broken society is slowly on the mend, with a quarter of a million more children living with both parents than when the Government came to power. Health visitors are to be given guidance on how to recognise the signs of relationships in trouble and offer support to help families stay together (file picture) The minister, who oversees all Government policy on social justice, said there were other ‘signs of hope’, including 160,000 people having taken up an offer of support to keep troubled families together. Of the proposal to encourage health visitors to intervene if they encounter couples whose relationships are in trouble, a Government source added: ‘Health visitors often have to deal with relationship issues in their regular contact with families, and as such, are well placed to identify signs of relationship distress and signpost to appropriate support. ‘We will therefore develop national guidance for health visitors on how to recognise the signs of relationship difficulties, how to respond and review the need for further support.’ The Department of Health has already offered training to health visitors on specific issues such as mothers’ mental health around the time of birth and domestic violence. ‘A similar approach will be adopted for wider relationship distress,’ the source added. In a major speech in London, Mr Duncan Smith yesterday said he believed a social ‘revolution is underway’ in some of Britain’s ‘poorest neighbourhoods’. There are record numbers of people in work, up two million since 2010, 33,000 pupils on free school meals are now getting good grades in English and Maths GCSE and members of 53,000 troubled families are back to school or into work, he said. Official figures also suggest 2,100 former gang members are ‘back on the straight and narrow’. The latest figures show economic inactivity is at a historic low, and more than 800,000 fewer people are on the main out-of-work benefits. There has also been the largest ever annual fall both in youth unemployment and workless households. ‘Each and every one of these statistics is a rise in hope. Each and every one, a life transformed,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (pictured) believes couples are more likely to respond to professionals they already know . He claimed that the Government had been ‘unwavering in its commitment to social reform’, saying changes to welfare, education, justice and health were all designed ‘so that they no longer trap people, but set them on a path from dependency to independence’. ‘Social justice is about offering meaningful routes out of disadvantage, and dispelling the appalling idea that it is easier to manage the problem than to help transform people’s lives. ‘For you don’t solve addiction by parking people on methadone. You don’t stop problem debt by abandoning people to payday lenders. ‘You don’t rehabilitate offenders by simply locking them away, and you don't cure welfare dependency by parking people on benefits.’ Previous governments had thrown ‘more and more taxpayers’ money on ineffective remedial policies, in the hope of doing something’ about the country’s social ills, he said. The coalition had pioneered a new approached, investing in programmes based on results and which involved ‘intervening early’ and . ‘offering second chances out where lives do go off track’. ‘It has not been easy, for cultural change is never quick. Yet I believe we are now seeing real progress,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘It starts with prevention: getting to the source of social problems early, rather than waiting to pick up the pieces.’ He pointed to schemes in health, where new family nurse partnerships are now helping vulnerable mothers in over 100 councils, and the record number of parents – more than a million – now using children’s centres. Some 260,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds are now benefitting from free early education, he added. Despite the progress, he warned that the ‘disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been’. ‘We have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom. ‘Yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life. ‘I believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well.’ Mr Duncan Smith urged the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘social enterprises’ in deprived neighbourhoods. ‘Because they are risking their money – money that could otherwise be reaping a return elsewhere – those investors will want to see that social programme succeed, bringing a whole new rigour to how it is delivered,’ he said. ‘But what’s more, the same investors will want to take an interest in that community where they would otherwise be totally detached… brought back into contact with our most disadvantaged individuals and families, for mutual benefit. ‘In doing so, these wealth creators could have a powerful influence on the communities themselves, a human interface between two polarised worlds bringing success to the doorstep of failure – the city and the inner city closer together.’","Couples are more likely to seek support from professionals they know .

"Vile: George-Josef Blaj broke into a young woman's house before beating and raping her . A convicted Romanian rapist brutally attacked a young woman in her own home within weeks of  arriving in Britain. George-Josif . Blaj, 20, fled to the UK after judges released him three years into a . prison sentence for a horrific rape and three robberies in his home . country. Less than three . months after arriving in Britain, he broke into the woman’s home in the . early hours and throttled her until she was unconscious. When . she awoke, she begged him to take her money but he refused, flashing a . knife at her, battering her with a spade and subjecting her to a violent . rape. Jailing him for 15 years yesterday, a judge branded Blaj a rapist ‘of the most extreme nature’. The . girl’s friends, meanwhile, said she stopped feeling safe in the UK and . had emigrated for fear of further attacks. And MPs demanded to know why a . criminal with such an ‘appalling’ history of violence was ever allowed . into the country. Blaj, a . drink and drug abuser, was jailed as a minor in Romania in 2009 after he . raped a woman in his home town Zarnesti, 125 miles north of Bucharest, . when he was 16. Because he . was so young, he was sentenced to serve just four-and-a-half years for . the sexual assault and three robberies and was granted a conditional . release after serving two thirds of his sentence. Border controls have effectively been eroded by free movement directives issued by Brussels, which mean Britain must open its doors to people from other EU countries, even convicted criminals. Anyone coming to the UK from outside the EU faces stringent tests and must apply for a visa, giving details of their criminal history. When it comes to most of those arriving from inside the EU, however, the Border Agency has no way of knowing their criminal record. They are checked against a range of watch-lists – which include suspected terrorists, those wanted by police, certain sex offenders, and people excluded from the UK. But British police rely on other countries to provide them with the details. The system breaks down when the offender’s home country does not come forward with this information. Cynically, foreign countries within the EU may even withhold information because they would rather their murderers were in the UK than at home. If they are not informed, British police have no way of checking a foreigner’s criminal convictions. But . none of the conditions barred Blaj from travelling abroad and within . weeks he moved to Britain, where his conviction was not flagged up. Less . than three months later, on February 1 this year, he broke into a house . in Northampton by climbing through a bathroom window. The . victim, 24, awoke at around 7am to find him standing over her bed . clutching a shovel. She saw a knife by the bed before he reached down . and throttled her. She lost . consciousness and he waited for her to come back around, when she begged . him to take her money and her laptop and leave. Instead, he raped her and when she tried to scream, he attacked her with the spade, leaving her face and hair soaked in blood. He . was eventually caught after the girl’s best friend and housemate heard a . commotion and walked in to see Blaj holding the spade. ‘I . thought [my friend] was out for the night. I opened the door and saw . the guy. Everything was in a big mess and he was holding a shovel,’ she . said. ‘I couldn’t see [my friend] so I thought he was robbing the house. ‘I . ran back to my room and locked it and he started banging on the door to . make me afraid. I called the police and thought he would leave but he . went back to [my friend’s] room.’ Blaj fled after officers arrived but was found nearby. Jailed: Blaj was sentenced to 15 years in prison at Northampton Crown Court and will be deported afterwards . The Latvian victim’s friend only realised she had been attacked when she suddenly emerged from her room dazed and bloodied. She was naked but had covered herself with a bed sheet. The . friend said: ‘After she came home from the police and the hospital, she . packed her things. Within a fortnight she left for Canada. She was so . scared … Everywhere that she turned there were reminders of what had . happened.’ Criticism: MP Michael Ellis hit out at Romanian authorities claiming they did not inform the UK that Blaj had a serious conviction . Blaj was . arrested and pleaded guilty to assault, burglary and rape despite . claiming to have no memory of the attack, saying he had taken drugs and . alcohol beforehand. He also admitted burgling a mosque in Northampton. On . August 22 at Northampton Crown Court, he was given a sentence of 15 . years , with 11 years to be served in custody and four years on licence. He will be deported after . he serves his sentence. Judge Rupert Mayo said Blaj was a rapist ‘of the . most extreme nature’. ‘This has left the victim with permanent . psychological scarring,’ he said. Addressing . Blaj, he added: ‘What makes this case more disturbing is your young age . and your previous convictions for rape and burglary in Romania.’ Michael . Ellis, MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is another appalling . example of a person who has been permitted to enter the UK despite the . fact that his presence was against the public’s interest. ‘The . question needs to be asked why the Romanian authorities did not inform . the UK that this person should not be permitted entry.’ The . Home Office said people travelling to the UK were checked against a . range of watch-lists but the onus for flagging someone’s criminal . history is with the authorities in their home country. ‘Where . we receive information that foreign nationals present a genuine threat . to society, we are able to take action to prevent their entry to the . UK,’ a spokesman added.","George-Josif Blaj, 20, convicted of sex attack on woman in Northampton .

"Women can officially become  bishops in the Church of England following a historic vote today. The Anglican General Synod overwhelmingly backed a change in church law with a simple show of hands at a meeting in London today. It comes 20 years after the first women were ordained as Church of England priests. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the church was starting ‘a completely new phase of our existence’ and predicted half of bishops could be women within 15 years. Female clergy were emotional after the General Synod voted in favour of women bishops at Church House in London today . The General Synod overwhelmingly adopted legislation which means the first female bishops could be ordained in 2015 . After the vote, the Archbishop welcomed the historic vote. He said: ‘It has taken a very, very long time and the way is now open to select people for the episcopacy, to nominate them on the basis simply of our sense that they are called by God to be in that position without qualification as to their gender.’ It is anticipated that the first female bishop could take her seat next year. The change sees the simple addition of a sentence to Canon 33, which reads: 'A man or a woman may be consecrated to the office of bishop.' The Very Rev Dr Jane Hedges, 58, dean of Norwich, is the bookies' favourite to become the first woman bishop. Ladbrokes has offered odds of just 3/1 that the former canon steward of Westminster Abbey and archdeacon of Westminster will become a bishop.

The plan to allow them to stand as bishops was derailed by just six votes cast by lay members in November 2012, causing shock and bitter recriminations within the Church of England and prompting threats of an intervention by Parliament.

"These breathtaking pictures show how millions of pilgrims are arriving in Mecca for Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which starts tomorrow, as Saudi authorities warned they will stop any disruptive protests over the conflict in Syria. The Grand Mosque, the focal point of the Islamic faith, was already teeming with joyful pilgrims at dawn yesterday, wearing the simple white folds of cloth prescribed for haj, many of them having slept on the white marble paving outside. ‘I feel proud to be here because it's a visual message that Muslims are united. People speaking in all kind of languages pray to the one God,’ said Fahmi Mohammed al-Nemr, 52, from Egypt. Big event: Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as they pray inside and outside the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The annual pilgrimage draws three million visitors each year .

Prince Ahmed said on Saturday after attending a Mecca march-past where . troops paraded water cannon, teargas launchers and even truck-mounted . machine guns. Authorities . are keenly aware of past episodes of violence at haj, such as in 1979, . when attackers seized the Grand Mosque, beginning a two-week siege that . left hundreds dead. Despite . Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, locking horns with regional rival .

All ages: Muslim pilgrims attend to perform their evening prayers in the Grand Mosque in the holy city of Mecca on Monday . ‘I don't think there will be any . repercussion on the security of the pilgrimage as a result of what is . unfortunately happening in Syria and elsewhere,’ Prince Ahmed said. Saudi . Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has backed rebels fighting Syrian . President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, at a time of already tense . relations between Riyadh and Tehran. Assad . and Iranian leaders have both accused Turkey and Gulf Arab countries of . arming the rebels, while Riyadh has accused Tehran of stirring unrest . in Bahrain and instigating protests among Shi'ite Muslims in Saudi . Arabia. Iran has denied . those charges and both sides have said they are keen to avoid trouble . during haj, mindful of 1987 clashes between Iranian pilgrims and Saudi . security forces that led to hundreds of deaths. In . the years since, Saudi authorities have tolerated small protests by . Iranians in their part of the massive camp where most pilgrims stay. Prince Ahmed said Tehran had assured Riyadh that Iranian pilgrims would . cause no disruption this year.

Maintaining safety: Saudi leaders have emphasised it is a strictly religious occasion and they are prepared to deal with any troublemaking . Beginning: Wednesday is the first official day of the pilgrimage, with Muslims following a set form of rites laid out by the Prophet, and it culminates on Friday . However, Egyptian cleric Yusuf . al-Qaradawi last week called on Muslims to ostracise Iran and Russia . during haj over their backing of Assad, stoking an already tense . atmosphere. In his Friday . sermon the imam of Mecca's Grand Mosque, Saleh bin Abdullah Hamid, also . railed against the violence in Syria, calling on God to ‘be against the . forces of oppressors’ there. Pilgrims said they were praying for an end to the fighting. ‘I . pray for the Syrian Muslims to be saved from the oppression they are . being subjected to,’ said Abdullah Abdulrahman Mohammed, 69, from Iraqi . Kurdistan, a father of 12 who had just performed Friday prayers. Last . year nearly 3million pilgrims performed the haj, with roughly a third . from inside the conservative kingdom.

Avoidance of trouble: Authorities are keenly aware of past episodes of violence at haj, such as in 1979, when attackers seized the Grand Mosque . Together as one: The extraordinary gathering was said by some of the faith to be a visual message that Muslims are united . ‘The first time I saw the Kaaba I cried with joy. I prayed for myself and all Muslims,’ said Nafisa Rangrez, 36, from Gujarat in India, who had waited five years for a haj visa. All Muslims must face towards the Kaaba, the huge black cube at the centre of the Grand Mosque, five times a day for prayer, making a visit to the sanctuary a powerful experience. Pilgrims must circle it seven times when they arrive in Mecca. Tomorrow is the first official day of the pilgrimage, with Muslims following a set form of rites laid out by the Prophet and culminating on Friday with the Feast of the Sacrifice, Eid al-Adha, a holiday across the Islamic world. ‘I would love to live here for the rest of my life. There's no such place in the entire world. This is a blessed country,’ said Ziad Adam, 23, a theology student from Kenya. Saudi Arabia's king is formally titled Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the ruling family has long based its claims to reign on its guardianship of Islam's birthplace. Over the past decade it has spent billions of dollars expanding the Grand Mosque and building new infrastructure to avert the stampedes and tent fires that marred past pilgrimages with hundreds of deaths. The last deadly stampede was in 2006, when 360 people were crushed to death.","Saudi authorities warn they will stop any disruptive protests at annual pilgrimage in Mecca over the conflict in Syria .

"The head of Ofsted yesterday called for children to be streamed at the age of 14 as part of a radical overhaul of the school system. Sir Michael Wilshaw said pupils should be directed towards either an academic or vocational school halfway through secondary education. His blueprint – outlined in a speech to business leaders – will be seen as tacit backing for a revival of academic selection. Sir Michael Wilshaw said that pupils should be directed towards either academic or vocational training midway through their secondary education in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry . It follows the revelation that two new grammar schools are being planned in Berkshire and Kent, in what would represent the first major extension of selection by ability for 50 years. Home Secretary Theresa May is backing plans for a ‘satellite’ grammar in her Maidenhead constituency while Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is supporting a similar scheme in Sevenoaks. Sir Michael has previously spoken of his opposition to traditional grammar schools, claiming they fail to improve social mobility because they are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’. But in a keynote speech to the Confederation of British Industry, he backed a degree of academic selection later in a child’s school career, at age 14 before they start their GCSE courses. A ‘fundamental shift’ in school structures was needed, he said. Under his proposals, schools would form local ‘clusters’ with each developing different specialisms such as highly academic education – similar to a grammar – and vocational qualifications. Vocational options might include the existing University Technical Colleges (UTCs), which already take pupils from 14 and teach them skills needed for a trade or industry. ‘Wouldn’t it be good if at least one of the schools in the cluster had particularly strong vocational provision from 14, perhaps in a UTC or a specialist college?’ he said. ‘Young people could then transfer across institutions in the cluster to provide a route to high-level academic or vocational study. Students on either path would be free to access the specialist teaching available in the other and would not be stuck in one route.’ Sir Michael insisted he was not advocating ‘selection at 14’ but ‘maximum opportunity at 14’. In a newspaper interview foreshadowing the speech, he suggested that children would be assessed ‘in consultation with parents, teachers and employers’ and directed towards a school that best matched their aptitudes at 14 or 16. ‘I am absolutely sure it is going to happen,’ he said. In his speech, he said the shake-up was needed to ensure all talents were catered for and tackle Britain’s ‘lamentable’ record on providing vocational education. Home Secretary Theresa May is backing the creation of a satellite grammar school in her own constituency . Sir Michael said that figures showed 146,000 jobs are unfilled because companies cannot find staff with the skills they need. He said vocational education must no longer be seen as a ‘consolation prize’. Apprenticeships should be held in the same regard as A-levels and ‘sold aggressively’ to young people, he added. Sir Michael’s plans were immediately welcomed by Lord Baker, the former Tory Education Secretary. He said the speech was ‘most important’ and backed the proposal for clusters of schools with ‘at least one of the schools in the cluster having particularly strong vocational provision from 14 – for instance a UTC’. Labour passed laws in 1998 banning the opening of any more grammar schools but the Coalition made it easier for the remaining 163 state grammars to open ‘satellites’.","Sir Michael Wilshaw was addressing the Confederation of British Industry .

"The former leader of a popular Christian ministry – who resigned last year after confessing to an ‘inappropriate’ relationship – is now the subject of a lawsuit by a woman who claims that he ‘groomed’ her to be his ‘personal sex slave’. Doug Phillips, a married father of eight, is a senior figure in the controversial Quiverfull movement, which preaches that women should keep giving birth until they can't anymore and that both wives and daughters must live in submission at home. The movement is followed by Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, they've attributed their 19 children to a Quiverfull belief that God is in control of the womb. Michelle Duggar received a Mother Of The Year award in 2010 from Vision Forum, Phillip's ministry. Doug Phillips, a senior figure in the controversial Quiverfull movement, is the subject of a lawsuit by a woman who claims that he 'groomed' her to be his 'personal sex slave' Lourdes Torres-Manteufel, now 29, is suing for more than $1 million in damages over what she alleges was an abusive and manipulative relationship that caused her serious mental harm and distress . Women within the Quiverfull movement are generally expected not to work outside their home or go to college, and are taught to abide by strict gender roles in which men have authority over women. Phillips - a close friend of the Duggars and actor Kirk Cameron - resigned last October from Vision Forum Ministries and Boerne Christian Assembly, a Baptist church outside San Antonio, Texas, after admitting to ‘a lengthy, inappropriate relationship with a woman.’ In a civil lawsuit filed against Phillips and Vision Forum on Tuesday, Lourdes Torres-Manteufel, now 29, claims that she is the woman that Phillips had previously confessed about. She is suing for more than $1 million in damages over what she alleges was an abusive and manipulative relationship that caused her serious mental harm and distress, reports TLC. Actor Kirk Cameron and reality stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar of TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting are friends of disgraced Quiverfull leader Doug Phillips . According to her complaint, Torres-Manteufel was just 15 years old when she first met Phillips and his wife, Beall, at a homeschooling conference in November 1999. Her lawsuit states: Among her disturbing accusations: ‘Douglas Phillips repeatedly groped, rubbed, and touched Ms. Torres’ crotch, breasts, and other areas of her body; rubbed his penis on her; masturbated on her; forced her to watch him masturbate on her; and ejaculated upon her. 'This perverse and offensive conduct repeatedly took place over the course of several years.’ The 30-page complaint includes specific incidents with dates in which Torres claims Phillips assaulted her. ‘In July 2007 Douglas Phillips invited Ms. Torres to ‘help’ him on one of his events. That night when standing next to Ms. Torres, Douglas Phillips put his hand under her hair around the back of her neck and massaged her neck,' the document states. According to her complaint, Torres-Manteufel was just 15 years old when she first met Phillips at a homeschooling conference in November 1999 . 'Another time Douglas Phillips sat next to her while she watched a movie with his children. While watching the movie, Phillips reached out and massaged her leg.' Torres-Manteufel eventually moved into the Phillips’ home in 2007, acting as a nanny - but she claims it wasn’t long before he began to enter her bedroom without her permission to touch 'her breasts, stomach, back, neck, and waist.' 'As a result of the manipulation of this movement, Ms. Torres’s thinking was altered. 'As described herein, Douglas Phillips - standing in a position of influence and prominence within patriarchy - methodically groomed Ms. Torres so that she would eventually participate in illicit sexual rendezvous with him promising that she could one day marry him.' By the end of 2012, Torres stopped working with Phillips and attending his church. She told her parents and a friend about the relationship. Smile . for the cameras! The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on . TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of . Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17  - now 19 - children . Though Phillips resigned from his position as an elder of Boerne Christian Assembly in January 2013, claiming he wished to devote more time to his family, it would be nearly nine months before he resign from Vision Forum Ministries. Torres also named Vision Forum for negligent supervision and retention, claiming they were aware of the alleged abuse and turned a blind eye for their leader. Attorney Jason Jakob, who is representing Phillips and Vision Forum, told WND that the allegations are 'false, defamatory and made with malicious intent to destroy Doug Phillips, his family and his ministry.' 'While it may be true that Mr. Phillips had an intermittent relationship with Mrs. Lourdes Torres-Manteufel, they never had the physical intimacy of touching and/or the exposure of genitalia, nor did the intermittent relationship escalate to sexual intercourse,' he said.","Doug Phillips resigned from Vision Forum Ministries last year after admitting an affair .

"Nearly half a million immigrants have been given taxpayer-funded homes over the past decade. The revelation comes as the number of families on the waiting list for social housing hits a record 1.8million. Most are British born. Of the four million migrants who arrived between 2001 and 2011, 469,843 were allocated council or housing association properties. New figures reveal 469,843 of the 4million migrants who arrived in the UK between 2001 and 2011 were given council homes . Around 1.2million foreigners now live in social housing – one in eight of the total. In London the figure is thought to be as high as one in five. The national census statistics, which were released yesterday, highlight fears about increased pressure on public services when Romanians and Bulgarians win free access to jobs in this country in January. The figures also show the effects of the large-scale immigration encouraged by the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments. According to the census, 105,506 of the immigrants who found social housing after 2001 were from Eastern European states that joined the EU in 2004, most of them Poles. In the mid-2000s, Whitehall officials estimated that the cost to taxpayers of maintaining a single social housing unit was £620 a year. Assuming each unit is occupied by four people, that would put the housing costs of post-2001 migrants at between £5billion and £8billion. Sir Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The figures serve to underline the huge costs of mass immigration – costs often ignored by the immigration lobby.’ In 2009, a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission claimed there was ‘no evidence to support the perception that new migrants are getting priority over UK-born residents’. National census statistics chart the rise in Eastern European immigrants given social housing after 2001. More than 100,000 were from states that joined the EU in 2004, mostly Poles . Census figures from the last decade reveal the effects of the large-scale immigration encouraged by Tony Blair (left). In March, David Cameron (right) launched plans to prioritise local people on social housing waiting lists . The research found no evidence of abuse of the system such as queue jumping or providing false information. But in March David Cameron announced a clampdown, including plans for a local residence test. Local people will be given priority on waiting lists for social housing and migrants will become eligible only after two years. Councils say the fundamental flaw in the plan is they will still be obliged to help any EU migrants who present themselves as homeless. Mike Jones, of the Local Government Association, says: ‘If we don’t house them that means we are going to have to deal with them under the homeless laws which cost us a great deal more.’ While most migrants would expect a modest home, some councils have spent huge amounts of public money on housing families who arrive on their doorstep. Somali asylum seeker Saeed Khaliif was given a £2million home in one of the country’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in 2011. The 49-year-old was granted housing benefits of almost £8,000 a month to live in the six-bedroom property with his wife Sayida and their children. Exclusive living: Saeed Khalif (left) and the Hampstead home (right) he and his family were given in 2011 . The couple demanded to be moved to West Hampstead, North-West London, after deciding their home in the Midlands was inadequate. Their new house boasted a 90ft garden and was refurbished before their arrival. It is understood Mr Khaliif has up to eight children and lives on benefits. He has not worked since arriving here three years ago. Although housing benefit has been capped at £400 a week, the Khaliifs were able to claim more because they moved before the change came into force. According to sources, the house was being advertised to rent at £7,800 per month.","1.8million families are now on the waiting list on social housing .

"Accused: Marcos Ortega, 33, allegedly smashed into Moeller while he was walking on the side of the road . A man who was allegedly hit by a drunk driver and dragged for a mile and a half down the road stuck in his windshield has died. Kenneth Moeller, 61, was hit in Ocean Township, New Jersey, last week and sustained such horrific injuries that he had to have a leg amputated in hospital. Police say Marcos Ortega, 33, was behind the wheel - and kept on driving with Moeller lodged in his battered windshield until officers pulled him over. Ortega was first charged with driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury, but is likely to face more serious accusations now that Moeller has died, NJ.com reported. According to invesigators, Moeller, from Lanoka Harbor, was walking on the shoulder of the highway when Ortega veered into him. Ortega remained jailed Tuesday on $150,000 cash bail. It's not known whether he has retained an attorney. The accident occurred November 10 on Route 9 in Ocean Township. Prosecutors said a township police officer responding to reports of an erratic driver saw what appeared to be a person lying on the hood of a vehicle. The officer stopped the vehicle and, as he approached it, saw the victim lodged halfway through the windshield. Samples of Ortega's blood were collected for analysis, but the tests have not been completed.

"The most senior EU official could be declared unfit for his post next week by European MPs over his alleged role in tax avoidance. Jean-Claude Juncker, the arch-federalist president of the European Commission, faces a censure motion because of his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into Europe’s biggest tax haven when he was Prime Minister of the country. Far-right and anti-EU MEPs have managed to collect enough support for a motion of censure, which must be debated and voted on, possibly as soon as next week. Scroll down for video . Italian comedian-turned politician Beppe Grillo, right, is behind the attempt to censure Jean-Claude Junker over his alleged role in turning Luxembourg into one of Europe's biggest tax havens . The Five Star movement of Italian former stand-up comedian Beppe Grillo is behind the attempt to declare Juncker ‘intolerable’, claiming he has lost his credibility as president of the European Commission. The plan also has the support of Nigel Farage’s Ukip. But a lack of support for the censure motion from other parties, less than a month after the European Parliament endorsed the appointment of Juncker’s 28-strong executive team, makes it highly improbable that his critics will win the two-thirds majority required to force the Commission from office. The European Parliament has no power to sanction individual members of the executive. An alliance of Eurosceptics, including Ukip and the French National Front gathered 76 signatures to meet the threshold of 10 percent of the 751-seat chamber to put the motion on the agenda. It stated that Mr Juncker, who was Luxembourg’s Prime Minister for two decades until a year ago, was directly responsible for tax policies which are now under investigation by the Commission for unfairly attracting multinational businesses. Eurozone countries have had to slash spending and hike taxes to counter government debt crises in the past few years, heightening public resentment of schemes that help wealthy individuals and companies to pay less tax. Jean-Claude Junker, left, was Luxembourg's prime minister for two decades and was responsible for the country's controversial tax policies which are currently under investigation by the European Commission . ‘It is intolerable that a person who has been responsible for aggressive tax avoidance policies serves as president of the European Commission,’ the motion read. Mr Juncker has said he wants a level playing field in corporate taxation. The censure motion, brought by parties that oppose EU oversight over states, said ‘tax sovereignty’ was vital for competition but Luxembourg’s policies were not fair competition. Eurosceptics won a bigger voice in parliament at elections in May amid growing disillusionment with economic austerity and perceived failures of European Union administration. They have complained of a ‘grand coalition’ of mainstream parties backing Mr Juncker and trying to suppress minority views in parliament.

"A family who moved home so they could send their son to a primary school found they were still outside the catchment area - and now face 12 bus journeys a day to take him elsewhere. Parents Kelly, 26, and David Taylor, 33, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, uprooted so five-year-old Aiden could go to the same school where he attended nursery. But the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area - by just a dozen houses - and were refused a place after a council allocated them a school further away. Bus stop: Kelly Taylor, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, is pictured with her five-year-old son Aiden. The boy's father faces 12 bus journeys to take Aiden and his brother Justin to school . Because of the decision, Mr Taylor will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day - two buses in each direction, six times - to get both Aiden and his younger brother to the correct school and back. The family moved in May last year to ensure that Aiden was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to St Thomas Church of England Primary School in the Bradley area of the town. But Aiden has been home-schooled since September while his parents battle to get him into the school where he went to nursery. His brother Justin, three, currently attends the nursery where his mother and her siblings also went to school. But the couple have lost an appeal for Aiden to attend - as the school is said to be full. However, the family home is about half a mile from St Thomas - while Rawthorpe St James Church of England School, which has been offered by Kirklees Council, is around 1.5 miles away. And if Aiden ends up having to attend Rawthorpe St James, the family will also move Justin there, resulting in the 12 bus journeys for Mr Taylor each day. 'He's bored': Aiden's parents moved house so he could go to the same school where he attended nursery - but the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area . Map: As a consequence of the council's decision, Mr Taylor will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day across Huddersfield in order to get both Aiden and his younger brother to the correct school and back . Justin, three, currently attends nursery at St Thomas Church of England Primary School, which is half a mile from the family home. Aiden, five, is currently home-schooled. If Aiden ends up going Rawthorpe St James Church of England School, which has been offered by Kirklees Council, the family will also move Justin to the nursery there. Two buses are required to make it from the family home to Rawthorpe St James. And because Justin will take part in half-day nursery, the father would have to take him into school separately to Aiden. This would therefore result in: . Aiden was first on the list for a place at St Thomas but the family have heard that another child has moved into the catchment area and leapfrogged them despite living further away from the school. Mother-of-two Mrs Taylor, a senior healthcare support worker, said: ‘If Aiden got in then there would be more chance that Justin would get in because he would have a sibling there. ‘We've all got links to the school and we still think it is a really good school. I would say it is a slim to none chance that he will get in now that he has dropped down to second place on the list. ‘Another child has moved in to the catchment area but they are further away from the school than us. The road opposite us are in the catchment area and if we had moved into the end of our road we would have been fine. ‘The council allocated him Rawthorpe but it is much further from us then St Thomas is. When we moved we just assumed it was ok because it is so close to the school. ‘It's hard to get hold of a map of the catchment areas and the first time we saw one was when I registered him for the reception. He was already in the nursery and we just assumed he would move up. ‘The woman at the school showed me a map and I thought it won't make much difference but we got a letter through from the council saying he had been allocated Rawthorpe. Mummy: Mrs Taylor said the family are 'devastated' at not being able to get Aiden into their preferred school . Where Aiden's parents want him to go: The family moved to ensure Aiden was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to St Thomas Church of England Primary School (pictured) in Bradley, Huddersfield . ‘The school said “oo you're just outside” and I never thought it wouldn't make a difference. If you look at the map it's such a small difference you might not even see it. The line on the map just skips our house.’ 'Devastated': Mrs Taylor, pictured with Aiden, said the family spent £1,000 to move closer to the school . The family spent £1,000 to move closer to the school and are not planning to move again as they do not believe it will guarantee their children a place. Mrs Taylor said: 'We are devastated. We have considered moving again to be inside the catchment area but we have worked out it would cost us £1,380 and that would only move him up to first, not guarantee a place.’ If the family accepted the council's offer, they would also put Justin in the Rawthorpe Nursery, which would involve a total of 12 buses a day for the boys' self-employed car valeter father, Mr Taylor. There is a school bus but Aiden is said to be afraid to travel alone. Mrs Taylor said: ‘I can't drop Aiden off at school due to my working hours and his father doesn't drive, so it would mean 12 buses a day for David including half-day nursery for Justin. ‘Aiden has a phobia, he won't go alone on the school bus, and he doesn't adjust very well to change. I explained all this at the appeal but they didn't seem interested. ‘He's getting bored of being home schooled and he just wants to see his friends. I'm trying to keep him interested and keep him in a routine but it would be better if he was in a school. ‘It did start off very well but now we are very concerned as Aiden seems bored, and his behaviour has drastically deteriorated. We are constantly trying to keep him cheerful, but it is stressful.’ The appeal officers also suggested Aiden could attend Christ Church Academy in the Deighton area of Huddersfield, despite being told it was full by the Kirklees officer present. Further distance: The family home is about half a mile from St Thomas School - and Rawthorpe St James Church of England School (pictured), which has been offered by Kirklees Council, is around 1.5 miles away . Gill Ellis, the council's assistant director for Learning and Skills, said: ‘Children are more likely to be allocated to a particular school if they live within the catchment area. ‘All reception places at St Thomas were already full. Places were allocated based on the school's oversubscription criteria and we were unable to allocate any more - an independent appeals panel has supported that decision. ‘Our advice to parents is always to state more than one preference when applying for a school place. When an application only names one preferred school, and when that school is full, parents can only be offered a place at the nearest available school. ‘If a family also name a school that is within their catchment area, this can help in securing a place nearer to home. Whilst we sympathise with any family in this situation, it does highlight the important of naming more than one school preference.’","Parents moved house so Aiden could go to same school as nursery .

"On their way? new arrivals in the French port of Calais . The UK has abandoned identity checks on illegal immigrants trying to sneak into the country from Calais. In a huge security downgrade,  Border Force officials no longer  photograph or fingerprint immigrants found stowing away in lorries at the Channel ferry port. Instead, they are handed to French police, who free them, enabling them to try again and again until they succeed. The scrapping of fingerprinting means that if the migrants reach Britain and apply for asylum under a false identity, claiming to be refugees, immigration officers have no way of identifying them as having previously tried to enter Britain illegally. As a result, they cannot expose their new identity as fake. Economic migrants, criminals and terrorists can now slip much more easily through the net. This contrasts with the increasingly strict checks on holiday-makers, who have to hand over their passport which contains biometric information to confirm their identities. Tory MP Peter Bone last night called for the ‘extraordinary’ and ‘disturbing’ loophole to be closed. The scandal, which makes a mockery of Government promises of tougher immigration controls, has been going on for more than three years. It came to light during an official inspection, which published its report two weeks ago. The security gap also means migrants’ details cannot be checked against prints and photos taken in the EU country where they first enter Europe – often Italy, Greece or Malta. Under the rules, migrants are meant to live in the EU country where they arrived while their asylum claim is processed there. But many immediately head straight for Britain because the benefits system is more generous. Once in the UK, they can avoid being sent back to the original country of entry by lying about their identity. Terrorists and foreign criminals can create horror stories about their past lives and pretend to be refugees. Economic migrants seeking a ‘better life’ are also able to fabricate tales of needing urgent asylum, claiming they come from war-torn countries. This creates havoc in the UK’s overburdened asylum system as officials try to sort out who is a genuine refugee. The Border Force claims it catches 8,000 would-be illegal migrants in lorries in northern France each year. But this official tally is now in doubt because a migrant whose identity goes unchecked in Calais can make multiple attempts as a stowaway to get to Britain while being counted again and again as a new ‘catch’. John Vine, independent chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, who wrote the report, said: ‘It seems odd that ordinary travellers are subject to 100 per cent checks when those travelling illegally are not subject to this regime. People attempting to enter the UK concealed in freight vehicles, who are discovered by Border Force, are no longer fingerprinted at Calais.’ Loophole: The change in policy was revealed in a highly-critical, independent review of Britain's border controls . British border officials stopped processing ‘clandestines discovered in freight vehicles’ at the port in January 2010. They blamed the lack of available ‘detention’ facilities. However, the chief inspector has called for the Home Office to ‘reconsider’ identity checks to protect UK borders. Mr Bone said last night: ‘It is very disturbing that the Border Agency is not doing the basics when it catches illegal immigrants. By definition illegal immigration is a crime and it is very hard to see why it should be treated any differently from any other crime. ‘If we stopped fingerprinting burglars because we lacked detention facilities there would be uproar. Ministers will now have to explain why this offence should be treated differently. The Government needs to take urgent action to correct this extraordinary situation.’ Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said he had been assured that the Home Office would review the situation. He added: ‘It is clearly important that we have the tightest possible border security. The report is clear these people should be fingerprinted and it is right that the Home Office is going to review it.’ Last night the Home Office said scrapping checks freed up the Border Force to concentrate on searching vehicles for stowaways and was decided by the last Labour government. A spokesman added: ‘Would-be illegal immigrants found by Border Force in freight vehicles are handed to the French authorities for processing, including fingerprinting where appropriate.’ However, during a Daily Mail investigation, migrants caught on the lorries said they had not been fingerprinted or photographed by either the British or French authorities. Syrian Rami Kazaz, 35, told the Mail: ‘The British officials hand us over to the French police who let us go. ‘I don’t know of anyone found on a lorry who has had their fingerprints checked. This encourages us to try again.’ Fawzi Aloui, a 29-year-old Tunisian, said he was fingerprinted and photographed in Lampedusa, Italy, after fleeing there by boat from the North African coast three years ago. ‘They checked my identity thoroughly. I have tried to get through to Britain on a lorry every night for three months in Calais. Each time I am caught, the British take no details of who I am or ask which country I came from. I have not been fingerprinted by the French either.’ People-trafficking gangs smuggle at least 30 migrants every day to this country from Calais.","Huge security downgrade gives illegal immigrants endless chances .

"Apple has sent out invites for a launch event on September 9th where it is expected to unveil its wearable health monitoring gadget alongside two new larger iPhones. The cryptic invite gives no details, and simply says 'wish we could say more'. Apple is expected to reveal a 4.7inch and 5.5inch iPhone 6 alongside the much anticipated 'iWatch'. Scroll down for video . Apple's cryptic invite for it's September 9th event, which is expected to see the iPhone 6 and iWatch unveiled. The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. The event will be held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino, the same location where Steve Jobs introduced the original Mac 30 years ago. Tech blog Re/Code said yesterday the firm is preparing to reveal the gadget, which is believed will be called iTime, alongside larger 4.7inch and 5.5inch handsets. The wearable device will be able to monitor it's wearer's health, as well and show them alerts from their phone. It could also act a remote for 'smart' home gadgets. 'Apple plans to unveil a new wearable alongside the two next-generation iPhones we told you the company will debut on September 9,' Re/Code said. Apple has already built a mysterious large structure at the site of the unveiling - believed to be where the press will get their first chance to try the firm's new iPhone and iWatch . Apple has already hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its iOS software, which includes health tracking capabilities. 'The new device will, predictably, make good use of Apple’s HealthKit health and fitness platform,' Re.Code says. 'It will also — predictably — make good use of HomeKit, the company’s new framework for controlling connected devices — though it’s not clear how broadly or in what way.' Earlier this month one analyst claimed Apple's iWatch had been delayed and will not go on sale until 2015. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says difficulties with manufacturing the new device will likely be the cause of the delay, according to 9to5mac. Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate. It could launch at an event in October, alongside Apple's next iPad range . 'We reiterate our view that iWatch, as compared to existing products, and as Apple’s (US) first attempt at a wearable device, represents a much higher level of difficulty for the company as regards component and system design, manufacturing and integration between hardware and software, he said. 'While we are positive on iWatch and believe that the advantages of the design and business model behind it are difficult to copy, we think, given the aforementioned challenges, that the launch could be postponed to 2015.' A leading French blog says the iPhone 6 will be announced on Tues 9 Sept. The information comes from supposedly leaked box art of the device (left). On the right is the box art previously leaked by Steve Hemmerstoffer of nowhereelse.fr, which confirmed details on the iPhone 5S hours before it was announced . Apple recently  poached a senior executive from Swiss luxury watch brand Tag Heuer, which could be to help it with the launch of its iWatch expected this autumn. Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple. It did not say what his new job would be, and Apple declined to comment. The iWatch will be the closest the U.S. company has come to selling a fashion accessory and marks its first foray into the personal luxury goods market.It is in a race against Samsung Electronics and Google to turn computers into wearable fashion and must-have items as smartphones, increasingly becoming commoditized items, start losing their appeal. Apple has plucked several executives from the luxury sector in recent months. Burberry ex-Chief Executive Angela Ahrendts started as its new head of retail and online sales in May, and former head of French fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent Paul Deneve was hired last year to work on special projects. With the iPhone 6 launch two weeks away,  new images of leaked parts have been revealed on a near daily basis. Multiple images of both the front panel and the rear shell of the 4.7-inch device have surfaced, while this image seemingly shows the design of the entire device . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. 'I think he was probably head-hunted,' a Tag Heuer spokeswoman said of Pruniaux, adding a replacement had already been found. Analysts and industry executives say the jury is still out on whether smart watches will disrupt the luxury Swiss watch industry. 'I don’t believe that an iWatch will be a threat to luxury Swiss watches,' said Jon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. 'But where I do see some potential impact is at lower, for example below $1,000, price points where there could be a temporary dislocation if there is super high demand for iWatches.' Jean-Claude Biver, head of watch brands at LVMH and chairman of watch brand Hublot, said he believed the threat of smart watches had to be taken seriously by the Swiss watch industry. 'The iWatch will have the same status symbol power as many other Apple products, especially at the beginning,' he said. 'I personally believe it has the potential to be a threat for the industry, and it should not stay with its arms crossed.' Apple applied for a trademark for the ""iWatch"" in Japan, a patent official said earlier this week, signaling the iPhone maker could be moving ahead with plans to launch a watch-like device soon. Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like . Speculation has been mounting that Apple was preparing to launch an iWatch which would include multiple health and fitness sensors and access to features such as messages and notifications through integration with the iPhone and iPad. A sweat sensor is believed to one of at least 10 sensors on the watch. It has also been revealed Apple has signed up a host of sports star to try the wearable - including basketball star Kobe Brant, who was recently spotted at Apple's Cupertino campus. According to laoyaoba.com, the sweat sensor has been developed in house by Apple. Although the watch is shrouded in secrecy, players from the MLB, NHL and NBA have believed to have been approached about the fitness aspects of the watch. One of these athletes is reportedly Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant, who was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month. According to 9to5Mac's source, Bryant met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team, to discuss upcoming products. Apple is also believed to be working with Los Angeles Kings' Dustin Brown and an unnamed player from the Boston Red Sox, according to 9to5Mac. However,  laoyaoba.com also claims the watch may be delayed as it must be certified as a medical device with the Food and Drug Administration. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband . Apple has already revealed it is working with Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and the National Institutes of Health on its HealthKit app, which is believed to work in tandem with the iWatch. Earlier reports say the watch will includes more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. It is also set to come in multiple sizes - and is expected to go on sale in October. The much rumoured watch is believed to be about to begin mass production in Taiwan. The Wall Street Journal also said that Apple is planning multiple screen sizes for the device, and previous rumour have claimed a male and female version will be released. Rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular. Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant (pictured) was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month, and is believed to have met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team to discuss upcoming products - including the iWatch. Samsung, Sony, Qualcomm and others have already released smartwatches, but the gadgets have mostly functioned as companions to smartphones, offering email notifications, clock functions and the like. Samsung's Gear 2 line, released this year, added fitness-related apps and has a heart rate sensor. But the market is growing fast, with data firm IDC saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices - a category that includes smartwatches - will triple in size this year over 2013. Apple has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena, hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA, and proclaiming that it will introduce 'new product categories""' this year.","Wearable gadget will monitor wearer's health .

"ARE you about to turn 29, 39, 49 or 59? Then you could be on the cusp of making big decisions, a study has found, with people more likely to make changes when they approach a milestone birthday. Researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults from more than 100 countries who completed a survey about their values between 2010 and 2014. They found that people with an age ending in nine were more likely to make changes ‘that suggest a search for meaning’ such as taking up marathon running or joining an extramarital dating site. Lead author Adam Alter, from New York University, said: ‘People audit the meaningfulness of their lives as they approach a new decade. People tend to either conclude happily that their lives are meaningful or they decide their lives lack meaning.’ The team discovered that some people will engage in ‘productive behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport. But Professor Alter added: ‘In contrast to this adaptive behaviour, some people might struggle to come to terms with the conclusion that their lives lack meaning. They might seek a socially damaging extramarital affair.' Researchers found that men who have an age ending in nine - 29, 39, 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages. Over a series of studies, the experts found that these so-called ‘9-enders’ were particularly prone to behaviour ‘that suggests a search for, or crisis in meaning’ A poll of 2,000 women found those who cheat are often following in their own mother's footsteps. According to the research by Illicit Encounters site, seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too. Many women feel their mother's infidelity gives them 'permission' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously. Men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women. For the first part of their study, the researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults who completed the World Values Survey - a large-scale questionnaire completed by people from more than 100 countries between 2010 and 2014. They found that 9-enders reported thinking and questioning the meaning of life more than other respondents. Subsequently, the researchers obtained data from an online dating site that targets people who are already in a relationship and found that there were far more 9-ender men - 18 per cent more - than would be expected by chance. Further analysis found a similar, though less-pronounced, pattern of results for women. Using government data, the researchers then examined the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals aged between 25 and 64 across the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. The researchers also found that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘productive meaning-seeking behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport. They randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons (stock image). Of that sample, 74 were 9-enders – ‘an overrepresentation of 48 per cent’ They found a small, but statistically significant, increase in the number of 9-enders committing suicide compared to other ages. The researchers also found, however, that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ‘productive meaning-seeking behaviours’, such as taking up a new sport. They randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons in the US. Of that sample, 74 were 9-enders – ‘an overrepresentation of 48 per cent’. They also analysed another set of marathon runners’ race times and found that people ran an average 2.3 per cent faster in their 9-end year than the two years before or after. This suggested that they were more motivated and trained harder as they approached their milestone birthday, the researchers said. The research paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Researchers studied answers of 42,000 adults from World Values Survey .

"Old laptops, televisions and fridge freezers will be able to be exchanged for cash and money off vouchers under a new recycling initiative. Sainsbury's, Argos and Samsung are among some of the retailers that have already signed up to the scheme that will see shoppers be able to trade in laptops for £100 or old fridge freezers for £70 off the newest models. It is estimated that old electrical items worth around £1bn are sitting unused in British homes and the scheme aims to recycle these goods while also saving shoppers money on new products. Scroll down for video . Washing machines and hoovers will be able to be traded in for discounts and money off vouchers under a new scheme to recycle electricals and make the industry sustainable and the newest models affordable . The initiative has been launched by Wrap, a sustainability campaign group, which aims to change the way the electricals industry works and make it more environmentally friendly. Liz Goodwin, chief executive of Wrap, said: 'This has the potential to revolutionise how we design, manufacture, sell, repair, re-use, and recycle electrical and electronic products. 'By making better use of resources, businesses can better safeguard their future through creating new opportunities for economic and environmental benefits, whilst saving consumers money.' It will mean people will be able to afford some of the latest models while unused laptops and hoovers that may have spent months sitting in lofts and corners of rooms can be recycled. This will reduce the impact on the environment of constantly developing new technology. Shoppers will be able to exchange their old iPads for discounts on newer versions under the scheme . Experts believe encouraging the trade-in of televisions alone could boost the UK economy by £750m per year by 2020. Some stores have already started offering customers discounts for exchanging their old items. For example Dell offers people up to £100 off the newest version of their tablets if the trade in an old model, while Currys is giving customers discounts of around £50 to £70 off new fridge freezers if they bring their old electricals into the store. Some items are also estimated to attract even bigger discounts when the scheme is implemented. Dell offers a trade in service for laptops, phones and tablets. Fridges can be traded in for newer models . Customers can trade their old Venue 11 Pro tablet for £110 off the newest version, costing £339 for the most basic version . At Curry's shoppers can trade in any old fridge freezer for money off new models, including £50 off a Neff intergrated fridge freezer (right) which costs £689 . It is also possible to swap old washing machines for money off new models, such as £70 off a Sandstrom machine which costs £349.99 . For example mid-range laptops that are two years old or newer are still worth £240 while a digital SLR camera that was bought about two years ago is valued at £105. A four-year-old LCD television with a 22 inch screen attracts a value of £40, while a three-year-old model with a 55 inch screen could be worth £475. Wrap said electricals will have a shelf life for exchange - for example laptops are no longer viewed as a good trade economically after seven years, while tablets lose their value after four years. B&Q, Sky and Homebase are among the 50 companies that have signed up to the scheme so far. All companies have between three and five years to implement it. Some  will offer to pick up old televisions and fridge freezers while others will offer customers discounts or money off vouchers if they bring their discarded hoovers and washing machines into the store. The scheme builds on discounts and cash back deals already offered on the internet, where people can recycle iPad 3 models for around £110 and Samsung S3 smartphones for about £70 if they are in good working order.","Shoppers will be able to trade in laptops and televisions for latest models .

"Religious grounds: Asia Lemmon, whose legal name appears on her driver's license as Jessica Steinhauser, said the strainer represents her beliefs . A retired adult film star in heavily-Mormon Utah has become the fourth person in the United States to be granted permission to have her driver's license photo taken while wearing a colander on her head as a religious statement. Asia Lemmon, whose legal name appears on her driver's license as Jessica Steinhauser, said the pasta strainer represents her beliefs in the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, also known as 'Pastafarianism,' started in 2005 as a protest against teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in Kansas schools. When she had the photo taken in September, Miss Lemmon said she was not sure if officials at the Division of Motor Vehicles office in Hurricane would allow her to wear the headgear, but 'it was surprisingly really, really easy.' Nannette Rolfe, the director of Utah's Driver License Division, said about a dozen Pastafarians have had their state driver's license photos taken with a similar colander or pasta strainer on their heads in recent years. 'As long as we can get a visual of the face, we're fine if they choose to wear the headgear,' she said. Hats and headgear are not allowed for driver's license photos unless they're religious garments, Rolfe said. After the first few Pastafarians came in about two years ago, state officials determined the church is a recognized religion and its members don't require any special paperwork, she said. Miss Lemmon, a St. George resident, is a retired adult film star who performed under the name Asia Carrera, according to The Spectrum of St George. She said she wanted to make a statement with the photo. 'I'm a really proud, outspoken atheist,' she said. 'I am proud of Utah for allowing freedom of all religions in what is considered by many to be a one-religion state.' About two-thirds of the state's residents are Mormons, and Utah is home to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Lemmon said even though Utah is a conservative state, everyone has been respectful of her religious views. Earlier this year, Shawna Hammond, from Oklahoma, was allowed to pose for her license wearing the spaghetti strainer. Ms Hammond, an atheist, explained that she was allowed to take the photo because she obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. Shawna Hammond, a female driver in Oklahoma, was allowed to pose for her driver's license earlier this year wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head . In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'.","Asia Lemmon becomes fourth person to be granted permission .

"Men and women enjoy sex just as much with condoms as they do without, according to a study. Researchers reviewing an online questionnaire of the sex habits of men and women from 18-59, found participants consistently rated safe sex as 'highly arousing and pleasurable' - the same score as unprotected sex. Dr Debby Herbenick, from the School . of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, who led the study . said: 'This may be because men are more likely than women to purchase . condoms and to apply condoms. 'However, . it’s important for more women to become familiar with the condoms they . use with their partner so that they can make choices that enhance the . safety and pleasure of their sexual experiences.' Men don't find it difficult to maintain an erection while putting a condom on, a survey found . The nationwide American study found that men did not find it difficult to maintain erections when putting on condoms. The research also found that many women could not tell if the condom was lubricated or not. Dr Herbenick said the study will help target health messages in the fight against sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unintended pregnancies. He said: 'The U.S. continues to grapple with high rates of sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unintended pregnancies. 'We need to understand how people make choices about the products they use and how these products contribute to the safety and pleasurable aspects of their sexual experiences. 'This is particularly important as the products themselves evolve and become more mainstream in American society.' Scientists urged women to become more aware of the contraceptions on the market . Sexually transmitted infections are passed on during sex without a condom. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 19 million new infections in the U.S every year. Chlamydia is one of the most common types, with 1.3m cases reported in the U.S, and 152,828 new cases reported among 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK in 2010. Sufferers can remain symptom free but if left untreated can lead to serious long-term health problems. Other infections include HIV, genital warts, syphilis, gonorrhoea and pubic lice. Irwin Goldstein, editor of The Journal of Sexual Medicine, said the study continued the work of pioneering sexologist Alfred Kinsey, who founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University in 1947. He said: 'Gathering sexual data regarding condom use is highly relevant. 'Understanding current condom use offers health care providers an opportunity to educate those people uncomfortable with condoms but for whom lack of use may lead to significant sexually transmitted infection health risk.'","Men did not find it difficult to maintain erections when putting on condoms, according to a U.S study .

"Esa’s Rosetta mission is currently making its way towards a comet in the solar system. And, in a series of stunning new images, it reveals how comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has begun to develop into an exciting ball of dust and gas. Over a period of six weeks the comet has begun to extend its dusty veil known as a ‘coma’ into space. This sequence of images was taken between 27 March and 4 May, as the gap between spacecraft and comet closed from around 3.1 million miles (five million kilometres) to 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) The Rosetta spacecraft is set to rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August and becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. Rosetta, . named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient . Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. The . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its . final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For . the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation. Later . this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting . with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s . surface in November. Once there it will follow the comet on its journey around the sun, performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface. And in November it will perform another first when it releases the Philae lander, which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a comet. By the end of the sequence of images of the comet the coma extends about 800 miles (1,300 kilometres). But the core of the comet, known as the nucleus, is itself just 2.5 miles (four kilometres) across and cannot yet be seen. The coma has developed as a result of the comet moving progressively closer to the sun along its 6.5 year orbit. Even though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus. As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma. The warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail. Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet . In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings . The onset of activity now offers scientists the opportunity to study dust production and structures within the coma before getting much closer. 'It’s beginning to look like a real comet,' says Holger Sierks, principal investigator for OSIRIS, the Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany. 'It’s hard to believe that only a few months from now, Rosetta will be deep inside this cloud of dust and en route to the origin of the comet’s activity.' In addition, tracking the periodic changes in brightness reveals the nucleus is rotating every 12.4 hours ' about 20 minutes shorter than previously thought. 'These early observations are helping us to develop models of the comet that will be essential to help us navigate around it once we get closer,' says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk . OSIRIS and the spacecraft’s dedicated navigation cameras have been regularly acquiring images to help determine Rosetta’s exact trajectory relative to the comet. Using this information, the spacecraft has already started a series of manoeuvres that will slowly bring it in line with the comet before making it enters orbit in the first week of August. Detailed scientific observations will then help to find the best location on the comet for the Philae lander’s descent to the surface in November. The images shown here were taken during a six-week period that saw the orbiter’s 11 science experiments and the lander and its 10 instruments switched back on and checked out after more than 2.5 years of hibernation. Earlier this week, a formal review brought these commissioning activities to a close, giving the official ‘go’ for routine science operations. 'We have a challenging three months ahead of us as we navigate closer to the comet, but after a 10'year journey it’s great to be able to say that our spacecraft is ready to conduct unique science at comet 67P/C-G,' says Fred Jansen, ESA’s Rosetta mission manager.","Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is getting ready to rendezvous with a comet .

"An Ohio mother-of-two is suing an abortion clinic after it failed to terminate her pregnancy. Ariel Knights, 22, and her fiance adore their 'miracle baby' daughter who was born in September. But doctors had originally warned the couple that a medical condition Knights suffers meant her life was at serious risk if they went ahead with the pregnancy. She agonized over the decision, but, with a preschool-aged son and a fiance to think of, she called Akron Women's Medical Group and booked in the March 2012 abortion. Miracle baby: Ariel Knights, pictured left with her fiance, he son and the 'miracle baby' girl she delivered in September . 'It was a decision I made because my life was in danger,' she said. 'I was put in jeopardy.' On the morning of her appointment, in March 2012, Knights said women were being herded into the clinic's waiting room like cattle. 'Every seat was full. People were standing,' Knights told the Beacon Journal. 'It was pretty much like a slaughterhouse; it was like OK, next, next.' She described how, when her name was called, she walked into a cramped room, hopped onto a table and, as instructed, positioned her lower body over a trash bag. When the doctor was finished, and she was still woozy from the sedation, Knights was handed her belongings and shown the door. '(The doctor) said, ""All right, everything's good and clear, everything went well,""' she recalled, thinking that was it. But days later, she said she became . severely ill and in pain. She visited her family doctor then she went to . ER where an obstetrician gave her an internal ultrasound. 'The . look on (the doctor's) face when he found out, he was like, ""Oh my . goodness, honey, you're still pregnant,""' she told the Journal. 'My . fiance and I, we both were kind of in shock.' Cutie: Knights and her fiance are thrilled to have their healthy baby girl, pictured . Lawsuit: The 22-year-old woman, pictured right before the delivery, filed the malpractice lawsuit last month alleging negligence on behalf of the clinic and two doctors . She called the Akron abortion clinic, who are denying the allegations against them, and she said she was told she could visit their Cleveland-area office but declined. Knights then contacted another clinic, which, according to the lawsuit, told her it would not treat her for 'somebody else's mistake.' At that point, Knights and her fiance decided to go ahead with the pregnancy. But because she suffered uterine didelphys, which results in a double uterus with individual cervices, it was dangerous and extremely stressful, she said. She first learned she had the genetic condition while carrying her son. He, however, was carried in the left uterus which was healthy enough to hold a baby to near full-term but doctors said in a February 2012 exam that this fetus was located in the weaker right uterus. The fear that the weakened uterus would fail never left her during her pregnancy, she told the Journal. 'I can't explain how I felt. It was . just a sense of being overwhelmed, wondering what happened to the baby, . wondering what's happening to me and what did (the clinic) think they . did,' she said. 'It was just constant stress.' Medical: Doctors told Knights, pictured left, to abort because the fetus was growing in her right uterus which was extremely weak . Denial: Akron Women's Medical Group, pictured, is denying the allegations . Knights visited the ER multiple times during the pregnancy, was admitted to the hospital four times, with each visit lasting around five days, and had bi-weekly ultrasounds at a doctor specializing in high-risk pregnancies. In September, she delivered her daughter who they call the 'miracle baby' and thankfully both mother and daughter were healthy. Knights said she still doesn't know why the abortion clinic doctor believed the procedure was complete and what, if anything, was removed from her body. She said she had two ultrasounds before the procedure but wasn't sure if one was done afterward. Knights said she's hoping the to get some answers as her malpractice lawsuit against the clinic, and two doctors, makes its way through Summit County Common Pleas Court. In a court filing, the clinic and doctors deny any negligence and challenge the lawsuit for various reasons, including that they say at least some of the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. They want the case dismissed. knights is seeking unspecified damages of at least $25,000 for the pain, suffering and emotional distress she says the failed pregnancy has caused her. But neither Knights or her fiance regret having their beautiful little girl in their arms. 'That's a sore subject to think about,' she told the Journal. 'I mean, it's just hard, thinking she's here and thinking, if they would have done their job... It's just something I don't like to think about.'","Doctors told Ariel Knights that going ahead with her pregnancy was dangerous because a genetic condition meant the baby was growing in a weak uterus .

"Scientists have been forced to invent monitoring technology to protect dolphins from being killed while swimming through military training waters, it was revealed today. Conservationists feared the bottlenose dolphins were at risk from laser-guided missiles when their family pods swim into Ministry of Defence explosive trials at Aberporth in Cardigan Bay, Wales. But a team of experts at defence firm QinetiQ created a special listening system to find the dolphins - and can now hear their distinctive clicking sounds from more than 20 miles away. Worries: Conservationists feared the bottlenose dolphins were at risk from laser guided missiles when their family pods swim into Ministry of Defence explosive trials at Aberporth in Cardigan Bay, Wales . And thanks to the company’s Passive Acoustic Monitoring (Pam) system, when a pod of dolphins is heard entering a missile testing area, all firing is stopped to let them pass through safely. The detection of marine life in the area had previously relied on remote camera systems and visual observations by aircrew, because nobody else can enter the area during a missile trial. But Pam uses an underwater microphone known as a hydrophone and processing equipment to identify the sounds made by marine mammals, which QinetiQ says is robust and cost-effective. The system has been in use for two years at the MoD testing zone, which is a conservation area and has the largest population of protected bottlenose dolphins in Europe. They are also one of only two significant . populations in Britain. It is an offence under existing law to . deliberately kill, injure or disturb European marine protected species. A People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman told MailOnline: 'Animals do not wage war, so why should they suffer because humans do? System: Pam uses an underwater microphone known as a hydrophone and processing equipment to identify the sounds made by marine mammals, which QinetiQ says is robust and cost-effective . 'Wars are human endeavours, but just . like civilians, animals can easily become victims. For animals, there . are no Geneva Conventions and no peace treaties - just our mercy. 'Our troops deserve the best protection, and animals deserve to be left out of human conflict.' QinetiQ, which manages the range under a . long-term partnering agreement, won the top environmental prize at the . MoD’s annual Sanctuary Awards for its dolphin detection technology. Competition . judge Jane Hallett said: ‘This project demonstrated an innovative . approach to an emerging issue within marine conservation. ‘It shows how defence requirements can be successfully integrated with environmental responsibility.’ The . award citation said: 'This is an excellent example of how the proactive . management of noise can enable the MoD to continue its business and . conduct live explosive trials.' Aerial view: The MOD Aberporth range covers 2,500 sq miles of Cardigan Bay, home to hundreds of bottlenose dolphins. Other marine mammals in the area include porpoises and grey seals . A QinetiQ spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The MOD Aberporth range has a rich and diverse history of innovation and problem solving. 'Animals do not wage war, so why should they suffer because humans do?' People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman . ‘The . development of the PAM system is an excellent example of this . creativity and technical expertise being used to protect the natural . resources in and around Cardigan Bay.’ The MOD Aberporth range covers 2,500 . sq miles of Cardigan Bay, home to hundreds of bottlenose dolphins. Other . marine mammals in the area include porpoises and grey seals. Separately, . in May, the Royal Navy was blamed for driving dozens of dolphins to an . agonising death during anti-submarine war games. A four-year investigation by scientists . ruled out every other cause for the UK’s largest stranding of common . dolphins in shallows off the coast of Cornwall in 2008. Marine conservation: The system has been in use for two years at the MoD testing area, which is a conservation area and has the largest population of protected bottlenose dolphins in Europe . The area was hosting a week of ‘live fire’ war games involving 20 Royal Navy ships, helicopters and submarines - including the nuclear-powered sub HMS Torbay - as well as 11 foreign vessels. And scientists believed trials of anti-submarine warfare techniques, using a range of mid-frequency sonar devices in the water to detect hidden vessels, were the most likely cause of the deaths. But the Navy rejected the investigation’s findings. In August, two studies were released in America suggesting US Navy training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years. Most of the deaths would come from explosives, though some might come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships. According to the reports, computer models show it may kill 186 whales and dolphins off the East Coast and 155 off Hawaii and Southern California.","Conservationists feared bottlenose dolphins were at risk from missiles .

"Under fire: Jamie Oliver has faced stinging criticism since he suggested British workers are lazier than Europeans . Jamie Oliver has received a barrage of criticism after his attack on young British workers branding them lazy compared with his 'tougher' immigrant staff. The 38-year-old celebrity chef sparked outrage yesterday after he claimed that his restaurant empire would be forced to close if he had to rely only on Britons. Chefs, political groups and the general public lined up to defend British workers saying they are hard-working and reliable. Migration Watch vice-chairman Alp . Mehmet said it was unfair to compare immigrants desperate for a job with . young Britons trying to establish a career. 'Jamie Oliver is simply wrong,' he told MailOnline. 'It wasn't that long ago that he was a young British worker. 'This . generalisation is wrong and it's damaging. 'Hundreds of thousands of . young British people are very hard-working and bright and desperate for a . job.'

He says European immigrants are 'tougher, much stronger' Backlash: A Twitter user makes her feelings about Jamie's comments known . Criticism: Another Twitter user vents frustration at Jamie's remarks . Criticism: Alp Mehmet, from MigrationWatch, said Jamie Oliver is 'simply wrong' about British workers . He told the Mirror: 'A lot of European staff are good workers, but they don't have that passion for food. 'When . I find a young Brit I find them incredibly creative and enthusiastic. The country needs young people to train as there aren't enough young . British chefs. We need to encourage them, rather than knock them.' Essex-born Oliver, . who worked his way up from the kitchen in his father’s Essex pub, said . working an 80 to 100-hour week was 'really normal' when he started his . career. But he said young British workers nowadays don't have the same work ethic. 'The EU . regulation now is 48 hours, which is half a week’s work for me. And they . still whinge about it!' he said. ‘British . kids particularly, I have never seen anything so wet behind the ears. I . have mummies phoning up for 23-year-olds saying to me, “My son is too . tired.” On a 48-hour-week! Are you having a laugh? ‘I . think our European immigrant friends are much stronger, much tougher. If we didn’t have any, all of my restaurants would close tomorrow. There . wouldn’t be any Brits to replace them.’ Jamie Oliver’s food range products cost up to seven times more than supermarket own-brand equivalents - while he lectures the poor about eating healthily and cheaply. The celebrity chef's new television show and accompanying cookery book sees him steering families away from spending money on expensive ready meals and convenience foods. But the 38-year-old has put his name to ready-to-eat dishes that are much pricier than supermarkets' own brands. A foodbank charity has now questioned why people would pay more for products just because it had a celebrity's picture on the packet. But several British chefs voiced their disagreement. Chef Sam Carlton, who works at a brasserie in Halifax, wrote on Twitter: 'I'm a British female chef who works over 48hrs and doesn't whinge. Don't tarnish us all.' Chef Mike Counsel said: 'So Jamie Oliver employs immigrants . because British workers are soft? Is he for . real? ‏The guy has forgotten his roots and should be ashamed' Many took to Twitter to pour scorn on Oliver, arguing that he should have more faith in the country's youth. One wrote: 'Jamie no points for loyalty; will remember when next dining out.' Another said: 'I won't be wasting my . cash in his restaurants' 'What Jamie Oliver said about young British workers is disgusting,' wrote one. 'Hard-working': Sam Carlton, 25, said British chefs work long hours and don't complain . Sam Carlton, 25, said she felt 'insulted' by Jamie's attack on young British chefs. The female sous chef has been working in kitchens since she left school at the age of 16 and says she has had to graft tirelessly to make her way in the industry. After stints in hotels, restaurants and even a period of working in the U.S with the Marriott Hotel chain, she gained the experience which helped her gain her current job at gastro-pub the Brasserie At The Bull in Halifax. 'Everywhere I've worked, I've always worked long hours - it just comes as standard,' she told MailOnline. 'All the other chefs I've worked with have been the same. We don't complain - it's just what the job entails. 'I've had to sacrifice to be a chef. I can't remember the last time I had a weekend off and I've had one Christmas at home in the past nine years. We slog our guts off but Jamie's comments have tarnished us all. 'These celebrity chefs are missing the point.' In fact, Sam said in some cases it was European, rather than British, staff who had found the long hours of the catering industry a problem. 'In my experience, it's been . foreign workers who have complained about the working hours,' she said. 'They . weren't used to it compared to their country. 'When I worked in America the hours we're actually shorter because that's just how it is over there. 'And when I worked in North Yorkshire we had some Spanish waiting staff and they were shocked at how many hours we work. 'Chefs in this country know what the job entails and just get on with it because it's not about that - it's about the passion.'","Chefs, political groups and public lined up to defend British workers .

"Lloyds Bank was accused of betraying small firms last night after sacking hundreds of business advisers – and leaving employers to get lending advice by phone. The taxpayer-backed bank will axe half of its travelling small business relationship managers, hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country. From May, minnow companies and start-up firms will be left relying on phone banking or the internet to get in touch with the lender. Betrayal: Taxpayer-backed Lloyds bank, heavily bailed out by government after the credit crunch, will axe half of its small business relationship managers, hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country . Lloyds is already one of the worst culprits for choking off lending to small firms, despite taking part in a Government scheme designed to boost loans. Since June 2012 its cumulative net lending – the difference between the total amount of money handed out minus the total amount paid back by its customers – is minus £2.2billion, according to the Bank of England. Critics said the latest move was further evidence that the lender had turned its back on the country’s smallest enterprises. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Small firms have lost trust in their bank and much more needs to be done to repair the damage. ‘Thirty per cent of our members keep in touch with their bank through face-to-face meetings. ‘It is difficult to understand why Lloyds will only offer their smallest business customers help and advice by phone if their goal is to rebuilding trust and re-establish personal relations with those firms.’ Lord Oakeshott, former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: ‘That’s a giant step in the wrong direction by Lloyds. The smallest businesses need local bankers, not box-tickers, to understand their needs. The more of a bank we taxpayers own, the less they lend.’ Centralised: From May, minnow companies and start-up firms will be left relying on phone banking with call centre operatives like these or the internet to get in touch with the lender. (Stock image) The bank employs more than 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprise relationship managers. But 560 of these will lose their jobs amid another round of redundancies costing 1,080 staff at the group, which is in the process of shedding 15,000 staff over several years. Another 300 staff will see their roles outsourced. Of the 250,000 small and mid-sized firms on its books, the smallest 120,000 will no longer be able to get meetings with travelling relationship managers. They will still have access to branch staff ‘when they start up’, although the bank said its ‘specialist business managers’ will be based in a central office. Lloyds defended the move, saying that smaller companies had ‘less complex needs’ than larger firms. A spokesman said ‘This will help us cater more effectively for the needs of our clients – including many smaller firms that want to make more use of the telephone and internet to manage their day-to-day banking and the increasing number of start-ups we are helping to support.’ He added: ‘All of our clients will continue to have the support of specialist business managers and for our smallest clients, in addition to branch staff, managers based in our central teams. To underpin this reorganisation, we are investing in improved technology and services. ‘We want to ensure all our clients get the right level of support, whatever their size, sector, or location – and how ever they bank with us.’","Critics accuse taxpayer-backed bank of turning its back on small businesses .

Melbourne, was fined $3,000 and has now apologised for the incident on the annual . celebratory night, which has become synonymous with giving the sport a . bad name. The AFL has tried to improve the image of . the sport after repeated drunken incidents, but the initial reaction of . the Aussie rules football chief executive did the sport no favours. Regret: Aussi Rules Footballer Clinton Jones, of St Kilda Saints, has apologised and been fined $3,000 for setting alight to a dwarf entertainer during a drunken 'Mad Monday' party . Andrew Demetriou began laughing uncontrollably when confronted with the news of the fire-lighting incident on a talk show. Once he regained his composure, he said he was laughing because he thought it was a joke. In interview with local news service ACA9, Mr Johnston said he was 'really upset' when he saw Mr Demetriou's reaction because . he is the head of the AFL, it was a serious matter and he was laughing . at it. Police were investigating the shocking pub incident, which took place in the Bell's Hotel, in South Melbourne, which left Mr Johnston 'very shaken' according to his work partner and friend, Arthur Serevetas. They had been employed to wear silly . outfits and meet and greet guests at the hotel as entertainment at the . party, each paid $250 for the service. Players wore fancy dress costumes: some were dressed as priests, a school girl and a zombie, Mr Johnston told ACA9. Mr Serevetas, who saw the incident happen, said he was shocked to see his performing partner being set on fire. 'Blake . was speaking to a player when another player went behind my friend, got . one of these gas lighters that would light up a stove and basically lit . him up. 'His shirt and . pants got on fire and after that, somebody put it out and he just got . ticked off and we basically left. That was the end of our gig.' He said Johnston, a father, scrambled . to extinguish the flames, then left: 'Physically Blake is OK, but he has . been absolutely humiliated. We just quit the gig immediately,' added Mr . Serevetas. 'He is very, very shaken.' Mr Johnston had intended to sue the St Kilda club - whose most famous supporter is Shane Warne. He . was even more alarmed when he asked in an email if his clothes could be . replaced, and got a rude reply from another player, Leigh Montagna, . saying 'no', because he felt he didn't do his job properly. The incident took place at the Bell's Hotel bar, Melbourne (pictured), on Monday night when players were celebrating Mad Monday . Damage: The flames burnt the entertainer's clothes and caused minor burns . According to ABC News, Mr Johnston has now accepted an apology from the player involved and received replacement clothes. He has donated the compensation money to charity, according to ACA9. AFL boss Mr Demetriou admitted . yesterday it was no laughing matter and slammed the actions of St . Kilda's players and said the tradition of Mad Monday in a sport . suffering from a poor public image from players' bad behaviour, was 'a . thing of a bygone era'. The . sport has spent the past year under a cloud of drug-taking and . investigations into players allegedly taking banned supplements. The . investigation by the sports anti-doping body, ASADA is continuing. Three years ago, player Sam Gilbert . was claimed to be the father of a baby born of a local school girl. These allegations were later disproved, said ACA9. Then . naked photos of Capt Nick Riewoldt and Nick Del Santo surfaced. They . claimed a St Kilda school girl stole them from another player's . computer. Now Stephen Milne is facing rape charges. The player denies the allegations. 'It’s . just reprehensible. I was flabbergasted – in the scheme of all the . things we’ve been through, that would have been one thing I could never . have predicted that we would deal with,' Demetriou said on radio. Appropriate response? AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou started laughing uncontrollably when confronted on a talk show with details of the incident . The AFL boss later said he was laughing because he thought it was a joke and described the act as 'reprehensible' 'My . giggling wasn’t about the situation, it was more about this is just . another thing that’s happened which I couldn’t have predicted. 'It wasn’t meant to be offensive and I apologise to anyone who is offended. I wasn’t directing my laughter at him.' He said the AFL would work with the club to investigate what happened. The St Kilda club is also investigating the incident. Earlier Josh Damman, another co-entertainer with Johnston, demanded an apology from Demetriou. 'Had it been a female entertainer that was set on fire, would he be laughing?' he said on his Facebook page today. Surely there would be an outrage made about it.' Victoria Police spokeswoman Creina O’Grady said police were looking into the allegation that the entertainer's clothes were set on fire with a cigarette lighter. Player Leigh Montagna got in touch with an booking firm to organise entertainment for the Mad Monday celebrations. he wrote: 'We . are looking for two midgets that can entertain our guests on arrival. Maybe scare/shock them, banter with them etc as guests arrive? 'Dressed up in something that can scare/shock the guests.' After the night, Mr Johnston sent an email to Montagna politely asking for his burnt clothes to be replaced. Montagna's response, sent on Tuesday: . 'If . you actually followed your job description and said you would entertain . us I would be happy to, but to sit on a seat and drink water for two . hours and still want your money does not constitute work in my book. 'I . am so sorry if you felt your clothes were affected but I also feel . ripped off that I paid you money to entertain and you did not make any . effort to try and entertain. 'If you felt we were disrespectful you should have tole me when I asked but you said everything was OK so I believed you.' His employers, Dwarf My Party and Professional Championship Wrestling, are demanding answers from the club. PCW wrote on its Facebook page: 'Could you please comment on why our on-screen president, known to spectators as Mr Big, was set on fire during your Mad Monday celebrations?' A spokesman for PCW said: 'We are utterly disgusted by the situation.' The friend said Johnston was slightly hurt in the incident, but was too embarrassed to see a doctor. 'He is very upset. You don't know what this does to someone's self-esteem."" He said PCW was forced to ask for answers on social media after the club involved did not respond to their phone calls earlier today. 'We rang them. We got nothing,' he said. 'We messaged them. Nothing. We got impatient, so we went to Facebook. 'Come on, this is not OK. We want answers. Now!' The sick joke resonated with another attack on a dwarf in the UK earlier this year, resulting in the victim dying. Lee Webster tipped a lethal 27 mirtazapine sleeping tablets into his dwarf friend Jason Wood’s beer can when he left it to go to the toilet, in a pub in Ramsgate, Kent. Mr Wood died three hours later. Mr Webster, who said he did it as a joke, was convicted of manslaughter in June and jailed for five years.","Midfielder Clinton Jones fined $3,000, apologised for setting fire to a dwarf .

"Hayley was 'too young' for bowel cancer to be considered . Hayley . Hovey was 23 weeks' pregnant with her first baby when she suddenly woke . in the middle of the night with a sharp, shooting pain in her side. She . visited her GP's out-of-hours service but was reassured to hear her . baby's heartbeat and be told all was well. The pain was probably . 'ligament strain' caused by the weight of the growing baby. 'I was . ecstatic to be having a baby - I've always wanted to be a mum,' says . Hayley, 34. 'All my scans showed my baby was healthy, so I didn't think . anything more about that pain.' She now knows it was the first sign . there was a grave threat to her baby's life, and her own. Four weeks . later her daughter, Autumn, was born prematurely and later died. Then . Hayley was found to have bowel cancer. Doctors now think Autumn's . death was linked to her mother's cancer, with a blood clot breaking away . from the tumour, damaging Hayley's placenta and cutting off the food . supply to her unborn baby. However, it took four months after . Autumn's death for Hayley to be diagnosed. The problem was her age - she . was 'too young' for bowel cancer to be considered. Hayley, who lives . in Fareham, Hants, with her husband Paul, a 35-year-old IT consultant, . says: 'Looking back, I had textbook symptoms - exhaustion, intermittent . stomach pains, increasingly bad diarrhoea, blood in my stools and . bleeding. The disease is Britain's second-biggest cancer killer, . claiming 16,000 lives a year. The number of under-50s diagnosed has been . gradually rising - to around 2,100 a year. But a recent survey by . the charity Bowel Cancer UK of patients under 50 found that 42 per cent . of the women had visited their GP at least five times before being . referred for tests. Indeed, Hayley, a supply planner for an IT firm, . was examined five times by different doctors and midwives, who all . missed her symptoms, despite a golf ball-sized lump appearing on her . stomach after her pregnancy. By the time she was diagnosed, Hayley had . stage three to four cancer, meaning the tumour had broken through her . bowel wall. She had to undergo a seven-hour operation to remove the 6cm growth, followed by six months of chemo and radiotherapy. But . her experience is not uncommon, says Deborah Alsina, chief executive of . Bowel Cancer UK: 'We hear from many younger people who express . frustration at not getting a diagnosis and support.' ‘Bowel cancer is often associated with older patients over 50 - but younger people can, and do, regularly get it, as the tragic story of Stephen Sutton recently highlighted,' adds Kevin Monahan,  consultant gastroenterologist at West Middlesex University Hospital, London. Stephen Sutton, 19, raised more than £3million during his three-year battle against multiple tumours . Stephen Sutton, . the 19-year-old fundraiser who died last week from the disease, told the . Mail earlier this month of his anger that he was not diagnosed for six . months after his symptoms started. This was despite his family history . of Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that raises the risk of bowel . cancer. 'If it had been caught earlier, it could have led to a . better prognosis,' he said. Hayley, too, eventually discovered she had . Lynch syndrome. Bowel cancer is very treatable if detected early - 93 . per cent of patients who are found to have a small tumour on the bowel . wall  live for five years or more. Yet only 9 per cent of cases are . diagnosed at this stage - most are diagnosed at stage three. So, the . overall five-year survival rate for bowel-cancer patients is just 54 per . cent. Because patients and many doctors assume that young people . won't get bowel cancer, they are particularly likely to have . advanced-stage tumours at the time of diagnosis. Bleeding or blood in faeces . A change in bowel habits lasting more than three weeks . Exhaustion . Unexplained weight loss . Abdominal pain . See bowelcanceruk.org.uk; beatingbowelcancer.org (phone 08450 719 301); and familyhistory bowelcancer.wordpress.com/ . Cancer charities are . campaigning to improve diagnosis for all ages - they want new . diagnostic guidelines for GPs and earlier screening procedures. Sean . Duffy, NHS England's national clinical director for cancer, says: 'The . UK lags behind much of Europe in terms of survival from bowel cancer. We . need to change this, and this includes identifying it better in . patients under 50.' National GP guidelines state only patients aged . 60 and over should be automatically referred to hospital for tests if . they have one symptom. Patients aged 40 to 60 must exhibit two or more . symptoms. For under 40s, there is often an assumption the symptoms . must be something else, says Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the . charity Beating Bowel Cancer. 'We've had patients with red-flag symptoms . - such as blood in their stools - being told ""you've got IBS"" or . ""you're too young to have cancer"" by their GPs.' Four weeks after . Hayley's initial scare, she was unable to feel her baby moving. Tests . revealed Autumn had stopped growing, and she had to be delivered by . emergency caesarean. After her birth, in July 2011, she was taken to a . specialist neo-natal unit at Southampton General Hospital but died in . hospital a few weeks later. Two weeks afterwards, Hayley experienced . more shooting pains. With her pregnancy bump gone, there was also a . noticeable lump on the side of her waist. Her midwife said it was . probably an infection, and Hayley was given antibiotics. But her . health deteriorated rapidly and she had to take six weeks off work with . exhaustion, which her GP put down to depression. Within three months . of Autumn's death, Hayley was suffering from nausea and abdominal pain. Unable to get a GP's appointment, she went to A&E but was told the . lump was possibly an infection related to her caesarean. Doctors . performed a cervical smear test (which was subsequently lost) and sent . her home with paracetamol. Stephen Sutton with his mother Jane whilst Prime Minister David Cameron visited him . 'I got the impression they didn't take me very seriously,' she recalls. Soon . after, she was vomiting up to ten times a day, feeling dizzy and weak, . passing blood and experiencing chronic diarrhoea. At an emergency GP . appointment, she was examined by a different doctor who immediately . referred her to hospital; after several days of tests, she was diagnosed . with cancer. Four days before Christmas, Hayley underwent surgery. 'We thought we'd be enjoying our first Christmas as a family, but . instead I was in hospital, grieving for the loss of our little girl and . terrified about the future,' she recalls. 'My treatment might have been . less of an ordeal if my cancer had been picked up sooner. It makes me . quite angry to think if I'd been 60, it would have been picked up more . quickly.' But even obvious symptoms are often missed by doctors, . says Mr Flannagan. 'I am not blaming GPs, but we need to not be shy of . pointing out where things are going wrong. The default position should . be for a GP to rule out cancer, just to be safe.' 'It can also be problematic if patients don’t have obvious symptoms such as bleeding', says Dr Monahan. ‘They may instead have vaguer symptoms such as tiredness, unexplained weight loss or abdominal pain, which could be attributed to being symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease.' Public awareness . is also an issue. A survey in March by health insurer AXA PPP found . nearly half of men couldn't name one symptom of bowel cancer. Indeed, . Martin Vickers, 49, had never heard of it before his diagnosis in 2008. 'I was totally shocked,' says the father of four, who lives in . Burton-on-Trent with wife Andrea, 48. 'I didn't know bowel cancer . existed. It was hugely traumatic.' Martin visited his GP five times . in nine months with extreme tiredness and loose stools. His symptoms . were attributed to stress - his mother had recently died and he has a . high-pressure job as head of capital investment for Cambridge and South . Staffordshire Water - and then IBS. Joining friends and family to complete a Guinness Book of Records challenge creating hearts with hands . 'But I knew something wasn't . right,' says Martin. 'It was instinctive.' He was finally diagnosed with . stage three bowel cancer in November 2008, after his GP did an internal . examination and felt a lump. Martin underwent three months of . chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by surgery, another six months . of chemotherapy and a second operation. He now has to use a colostomy . bag but has been in remission for five years. Currently, screening is . only available to people aged 60-plus. They are sent home tests, which . involve sending a stool sample to a lab. But the Department of Health is . now looking at a new procedure, bowel scope screening, which involves a . partial colonoscopy -examining only the lower bowel. A major UK . trial of 55 to 64 year olds showed that people screened this way were 43 . per cent less likely to die from bowel cancer, and 33 per cent less . likely to develop it. This is because the procedure is usually successful at detecting small growths known as polyps, which can become cancerous. The . screening - which would be offered to everyone aged 55 and over - is . now being piloted. Campaigners hope it will be made available nationally . by 2016. ‘This is a really important development and should make a big difference to bowel cancer outcomes,’ says Dr Monahan, who runs the Family History of Bowel Cancer clinic at West Middlesex University Hospital, specialising in hereditary components of the disease. It won't, however, help younger patients such as Hayley. Before her chemotherapy, she and Paul had nine embryos frozen via IVF. However she is worried she may pass on Lynch syndrome, so the couple are . considering what to do. But she says: 'I am still here, I have a life ahead of me - and I hope my story will help others to be diagnosed in time.'","Stephen Sutton died after a four-year battle with bowel cancer .

"Two huge radio telescopes have given scientists a rare look beneath the surface of the moon. Radar signals beamed from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico — the world's largest radio dish, with a diameter of 1,000 feet — penetrated deep into the moon. They then bounced back and were detected by the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the planet's biggest, fully steerable radio telescope at 330 feet wide. A lunar impact crater known as Aristillus. The dark ¿halo¿ surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged, radar-bright rim deposits. The crater is approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) in diameter and 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) deep. To make these images, radar signals beamed from Arecibo's powerful transmitter penetrated far below the Moon’s dusty surface. The signals then rebounded back and were picked up by the sensitive receivers on the GBT. This observing technique, known as bistatic radar, has been used to study many objects in our Solar System, including asteroids and other planets. Researchers use this technique, called bistatic radar, to study many solar system objects, from asteroids to other planets. In this case, it revealed subsurface details in two lunar locales, the Sea of Serenity and a crater called Aristillus. Scientists were able to peer 33 to 50 feet beneath the Sea of Serenity, which is near the site where NASA's final manned lunar effort, the Apollo 17 mission, touched down in December 1972. Light and dark areas visible in the images reveal details of rock and dust composition, researchers said. The radar images also provide a new perspective on Aristillus crater, which is about 34 miles wide and 2.2 miles deep. 'The dark 'halo' surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged, radar-bright rim deposits,"" representatives of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the Green Bank Telescope and a number of other instruments, said in a statement. The image reveals previously hidden features around an area known as Mare Serenitatis, or the Sea of Serenity, which is near the Apollo 17 landing site. The radar observations were able to ¿see¿ approximately 10-15 meters (33-50 feet) below the lunar surface. The light and dark features are the result of compositional changes in the lunar dust and differences in the abundance of rocks buried within the soil. 'The image also shows traces of lava-like features produced when lunar rock melted from the heat of the impact, . 'These images help planetary scientists interpret the complex history of the Moon, which is often obscured by dust layers built up over billions of years, better understand the geology of earlier landing sites, and plan for future lunar exploration.'

"Ancient humans rampantly indulged in interspecies sex in a Lord Of The Rings-type world of different  human groups, new DNA analysis has revealed. And our ancient bedfellows appear to have included a 'mystery human ancestor', which has not yet been identified. Genome analysis from a Neanderthal and another group of ancient humans, the Denisovans, was presented to a meeting of the Royal Society in London, and it included 'snippets' of  the mystery DNA  - neither human nor Neanderthal. It suggests that interbreeding was rampant and more widespread between the human-like groups living in Europe and Asia more than 30,000 years ago than previously thought, scientists say. Neanderthal groups (skull, pictured) are believed to have been small and relatively isolated, which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships . The . findings come from fresh analysis of DNA from a Denisovan, a hominin . discovered after the finding of bone and teeth remains in a Siberian . cave, and published in Nature. The new study of the genomes was carried out by David Reich of Harvard Medical School. He said: 'Denisovans appear more distinct from modern humans than Neanderthals. He added: 'Denisovans harbour ancestry from an unknown archaic population, unrelated to Neanderthals', New Scientist reports. Mark Thomas, an evolutionary geneticist at University College London who was present at the  presentation, said: 'What it begins to suggest is that we're looking at a Lord Of The Rings-type world - that there were many hominid populations.' It comes after ancient viruses inherited from Neanderthals were found in modern human DNA. Scientists . are investigating possible links between the 'endogenous retroviruses', . which are hardwired into DNA, and modern diseases such as AIDs and . cancer. Researchers compared DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans with that obtained from cancer patients. They found evidence of Neanderthal and Denisovan viruses in the modern DNA, suggesting that they originated in a common ancestor more than half a million years ago. Neanderthals co-existed with our ancestors in Europe for thousands of years, but belonged to a different human sub-species. They eventually became extinct around 30,000 years ago. Around 8% of human DNA is made up of endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, which are DNA sequences left by viruses which pass from generation to generation. They form part of the 90 per cent of the genome, sometimes called 'junk' DNA, that contains no instruction codes for making proteins. The analysis included 'snippets' of  the mystery DNA  - neither human nor Neanderthal . Dr Gkikas Magiorkinis, from Oxford University’s Department of Zoology, who co-led the research, said: 'I wouldn’t write it off as ‘junk’ just because we don’t know what it does yet. 'Under certain circumstances, two ‘junk’ viruses can combine to cause disease. We’ve seen this many times in animals already. ERVs have been shown to cause cancer when activated by bacteria in mice with weakened immune systems.' The Oxford team now plans to look for possible links between these ancient viruses, belonging to the HML2 virus family, and cancer and HIV/Aids. 'How HIV patients respond to HML2 is related to how fast a patient will progress to Aids, so there is clearly a connection there,' said Dr Magiorkinis. 'HIV patients are also at much higher risk of developing cancer, for reasons that are poorly understood. It is possible that some of the risk factors are genetic, and may be shared with HML2. 'They also become reactivated in cancer and HIV infection, so might prove useful as a therapy target in the future.' Co-author Dr Robert Belshaw, from the University of Plymouth, said: 'Using modern DNA sequencing of 300 patients, we should be able to see how widespread these viruses are in the modern population. 'We would expect viruses with no negative effects to have spread throughout most of the modern population, as there would be no evolutionary pressure against it. 'If we find that these viruses are less common than expected, this may indicate that the viruses have been inactivated by chance or that they increase mortality, for example through increased cancer risk.' The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council. Our modern language can be traced back to Neanderthals living half a million years ago, scientists have claimed. Research increasingly seems to indicate that our close cousins, the Neanderthals, were much more similar to us than imagined. Dutch researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals around half a million years ago, shared speech and language with modern humans. They believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought. The scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the Netherlands are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity. Popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts, but Neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western Eurasia for several hundreds of thousands of years, during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods. Psycholinguistics researchers Dan Dediuand Stephen Levinson, said that far from being slow brutes, their cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours. The duo, who have looked at past findings in detail, argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans (another form of humanity known mostly from their genome). Their interpretation of scarce evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists, who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language.","Genome analysis of Neanderthal and human-like group called Denisovans .

While five staff members live in the dorm, university officials says they don't check up on the residents often. Scroll down for video . Died alone: Third-year University of Chicago student Nicholas Barnes, 20, was discovered dead in his single dorm room Saturday and police say he had been decomposing for at least 72 hours . Mystery: Police said they do not suspect foul-play in the case, and will have to wait a month for toxicology reports to determine the cause of Barnes' untimely death . Record: The last time Barnes used his keycard to swipe into his dorm was February 7, more than a week before he was discovered dead . Resident Jordan Ginsburg doesn't understand how his fellow dorm mate's death could have gone unnoticed for so long. 'I don't understand how the people that . live next door, and the people who were responsible for his wellbeing . could have not seen that he has been gone for a week,' resident Jordan . Ginsburg told ABC7. Police spokesman Mike Sullivan says Nicholas Brastins Barnes, 20, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania had been dead for some time. Monitors: Five staff members live in Booth Hall where Barnes was discovered dead, but university officials say staff don't often check in on the students . Chicago . police found the body Saturday around 4:15pm 'in a decomposed state' after other students complained about a foul odor in Booth Hall where he . lived. He was found dead in the form room where he lived alone and pronounced dead at 4:50pm. Barnes was majoring in Germanic studies and had last used his keycard to enter his dorm on February 7. University officials said students don't always need to use their key cards when entering or exiting the building, depending on the time, so Barnes may have entered the building some time after that date. Authorities believe Barnes had been dead for at least 72 hours. Student residence: The huge International House houses hundreds of students and takes up an entire city block . Traumatic: Students held a minute of silence for Nicholas Barnes after police discovered his body face-down in his dorm room on Saturday . Many students are disturbed by the fact that no one had raised the alarm about Barnes' absence from class. 'I think that if I didn't speak to any of my friends for a week they would start to notice. And the classes are small here too, so you'd think that someone in your class would notice,' one student told ABC7. Booth Hall houses 253 students, including international students, all in single rooms. The cause of death is under investigation. Karen Warren Coleman, vice president for campus life and student services sought to reassure students living at International House, saying in an email that there was no evidence of foul play in the death of Barnes. Officials say staff members are 'making every effort' to understand the circumstances around the death. An autopsy performed on Sunday was inconclusive pending further toxicology testing. University officials say Barnes’ family is planning a funeral in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Friendly: While it's strange his death went unnoticed for so long, pictures posted on Facebook prove he wasn't friendless . 'Nick will be painfully missed. He was an excellent student, admired by faculty and peers alike,' said Susan Art, the dean of students. Barnes had studied abroad in the school's Vienna program in the fall quarter of 2012. He was also involved with the school's literary publication Sliced Bread. The university has made counselors available to students and a memorial will be held for Barnes tonight in the Ida Noyes library at 8pm.

"A University of New Hampshire shot put star is being hailed a hero after he quit his final athletics season so he can donate bone marrow to a stranger suffering leukemia. Like the rest of his track and field team, Cameron Lyle, 21, of Plaistow, joined the bone marrow registry in his sophomore year and a few weeks ago, he learned he was a 100 per cent match for a 28-year-old man who has just been given six months to live. But donating his bone marrow to the anonymous recipient means he'll have to miss the final two meets of his career, including the America East Championships. Sacrifice: Mr Lyle, pictured, is being hailed a hero after he quit his final season so he can donate bone marrow to a stranger suffering from leukemia . The decision, however, was a no-brainer, he said. 'I knew right away I was definitely going to donate,' Lyle told the Eagle Tribune. 'I was pretty terrified at first, but it is starting to settle in. 'They told me it was a one in five million chance of me being a match for a non-family member. They gave me the timeline and everything's been moving quickly after that.' The recipient, who is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Lyle are required by law to remain anonymous to each other for one year. 'He has six months to live and I have the possibility to buy him a couple more years,' Lyle told the newspaper. Easy decision: The decision to try save the 28-year-old man's life was a no-brainer, Lyle, pictured, said . But that responsibility means he'll be unable to lift more than 20 pounds over his head for a few weeks, ruling out throwing the discus, hammer and shot put in the championships. The athlete's mother and team coach were both extremely supportive of his decision. 'He's my hero,' his mom Christine Sciacca said. 'I couldn't be more proud of him and how he's been so humble about it.' But Lyle said he felt like he had been called into the principal's office when he went to tell his coach, Jim Boulanger, the news. But he needn't have worried. 'I told him, ""you either do 12 throws at the conference championships, or you give another man a few more years,""' Boulanger told the Eagle Tribune. 'It was easy for me.' Lyle is undergoing the surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston later this month. After a year, Lyle and the recipient will both have the choice to sign consent forms to reveal their identities. 'I'd love to meet him some day,' Lyle said. 'He's not that much older than myself. I just can't imagine what he's going through.'","University of New Hampshire athlete Cameron Lyle is donating bone marrow to a stranger suffering leukemia later this week .

"Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has said Julian Assange can stay at the London embassy indefinitely . Assange can remain  hidden in London ‘indefinitely’, Ecuador’s president said yesterday – leaving British taxpayers to foot the policing bill. Police have watched the Ecuadorian embassy round-the-clock since the WikiLeaks founder was granted asylum last week, at a cost of up to £50,000 a day. Assange, 41, has been living in the embassy in Knightsbridge, West London, for more than two months since he walked in and asked for  asylum in June, and Ecuador’s president Rafael Correa said he was welcome to stay indefinitely. His comments leave British taxpayers facing an open-ended bill for policing the embassy as it would be hugely embarrassing for the Government if Assange slipped out undetected. The former computer hacker is wanted in Sweden to answer rape and sexual assault accusations and Britain has vowed that he will be arrested and extradited if he steps foot outside the embassy. Mr Correa said Assange should be allowed to leave and fly to Ecuador. Assange denies the sex accusations but claims he cannot defend himself in Sweden because of fears he will be extradited from Scandinavia to the US over WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of secret diplomatic cables in 2010. Mr Correa said: ‘Since Mr Assange has received asylum from the Ecuadorian state, he can stay in the embassy indefinitely.’  Ecuador was ready to negotiate if Britain withdrew its ‘threat’ against his country’s London outpost, he added. Ecuador reacted with fury after the Foreign Office said the embassy’s diplomatic status could be rescinded, potentially allowing police to storm the building. Mr Correa said: ‘Despite that rude, impertinent and unacceptable remark, we’re still open to dialogue. 'We don't expect an apology, but of . course we expect Britain to retract the extremely serious mistake they . made when they issued the threat that they could violate our diplomatic . mission to arrest Mr. Julian Assange.' Ecuador has said it might take the dispute over Assange to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It was also reported that the previous ‘barren’ conditions of Julian Assange’s room has been updated with a treadmill, a microwave and a shower. Correa's government says there have been no talks with Britain or Sweden since August 15. The WikiLeaks founder is wanted in Sweden to face rape and sexual assault charges, and Britain’s Supreme Court has ruled he should be extradited. But the 41-year-old Australian broke . his bail conditions to claim asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in . June and has remained inside the mansion block for more than two months. Britain has vowed to arrest him if he . steps outside but cannot send police into the embassy under the terms . of the Vienna Convention. Julian Assange held a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy on Sunday where he called on U.S. President Barack Obama to end what he called a witch-hunt against WikiLeaks . Dozens of British police officers have surrounded the building for days to ensure he is not smuggled out and Foreign Secretary William Hague has made it clear he will not be allowed safe passage out of the country leaving  Britain in a diplomatic stand-off with Ecuador. Foreign ministers from across Latin America broadly backed Quito's position as the government rallied regional support at a series of high-level meetings in Ecuador over the weekend. Correa says he shared Assange's fears that from Sweden he could be further extradited to the United States and used his speech yesterday to portray the dispute as a David and Goliath-esque battle between a small country and ‘imperialist powers' of the United States and Britain. Local analysts in Ecuador say that . playing up the ‘colonial’ angle helps burnish Correa's anti-U.S. credentials and could lift his ratings. It also plays well with his ally . Venezuela's socialist President Hugo Chavez, the biggest critic of . Washington in the region. Correa, . a 49-year-old economist, has become popular with many Ecuadoreans by . building hospitals and schools, and for programs of cash handouts for . the poor. He is well placed to win re-election next year if - as widely . expected - he runs. The daily cost for the round-the-clock police guard of the embassy is £50,000 charged to the UK taxpayer each day Mr Assange remains in the Ecuadorian Embassy . Protestors and Assange supporters stood outside the embassy before Julian Assange addressed the media on Sunday . Correa said Ecuador never intended to stop Assange from facing justice in Sweden. ‘What we've asked for is guarantees that he won't be extradited to a third country,"" he said. The Ecuadorean leader also said his nation had to improvise to provide Assange with as many home comforts as possible at the diplomatic mission in London's affluent Knightsbridge area, including a bed, microwave, shower and treadmill for jogging. ‘Since Mr. Assange has received asylum from the Ecuadorean state, he can stay in the embassy indefinitely,’ Correa said. Since taking office in 2007, Correa . has often sparred with journalists whom he accuses of trying to . undermine his rule. Critics in the media accuse him of muzzling them and . behaving like an autocrat. Earlier . this year he won a libel case against three newspaper publishers and a . columnist for an article that called him a dictator and alleged he had . ordered troops to fire on civilians during a protest. He later pardoned . them. President Correa has asked Britain and Sweden for guarantees that Julian Assange will not be extradited to the U.S. following questioning over the rape allegations in Sweden . ‘I wonder what would England do if a journalist, with the permission and complicity of a newspaper, accused the Queen of a genocide?,’ Correa said when asked about accusations that he has used the courts to silence media critics. He added that in his domestic disputes with journalists he had only ever been standing up to unscrupulous media bosses. ‘We face up to (the likes of) Murdoch in the United Kingdom, who thought that they were above the law until a government came along to implement the law for all,’ Correa said, referring to the Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch's British newspaper arm is under investigation for illegally tapping the voice mails of celebrities, sports stars and politicians. There have been more than 60 arrests, including dozens of current and former journalist. Meanwhile, Respect MP George Galloway . has been sacked as a magazine columnist for saying the rape accusation . against Assange amounted to no more than bad ‘sexual etiquette’. Mandy Rhodes, editor of Holyrood, said: ‘His recent outpourings about definitions of rape have left me gobsmacked.’","President Correa said in speech the Julian Assange can stay at the Ecuadorian embassy indefinitely .

"Cambridge scientists say that taking as little as 20 minutes of exercise three times a week may be enough to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's . Taking 20 minutes of exercise three times a week could drastically reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s, research shows. Cambridge scientists say that even getting off the bus one stop early and walking the rest of the way could help prevent the devastating illness. They have found that a third of all cases are due to lifestyle reasons including inactivity, obesity, smoking, high blood pressure and having a poor education. But of these, a lack of exercise was found to be the single most important cause. Researchers believe regular physical activity ensures there is a steady flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain. This is thought to prevent the build-up of plaques – deposits of protein in the brain which cause Alzheimer’s. A total of 850,000 Britons have been diagnosed with dementia – including Alzheimer’s – although this will more than double by 2050 as the population ages. There are no effective treatments and the illness is having a devastating effect on families and placing an increasing burden on the NHS. But the researchers say adults can drastically lower their risk even by just walking to work. Professor Carol Brayne, from Cambridge University’s Institute of Public Health, said: ‘The important message is that there are aspects of healthy life which reduce risk. ‘This doesn’t say we can prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s altogether. But there is a proportion which is preventable. Even just having a vigorous walk a few times a week, and ideally make it social event. 'It’s really difficult for many people to take exercise. If nothing else is possible, even a walk will help. That’s what evidence suggests. ‘So 20 minutes to half an hour, three times a week. I would say to just fit something into life in the best possible way. This might be getting off the bus stop the next stop up, and walk the last bit.’ NHS guidelines say adults should do at least two-and-a-half hours of exercise a week, including gardening or housework. But more than a third don’t manage this, including a fifth who are classed as ‘inactive’, doing less than 30 minutes a week. Professor Brayne said that if someone started exercising they would be more inclined to eat healthily and give up smoking, further reducing their risk of dementia. The research, published in the journal Lancet Neurology, looked at almost 30 studies linking dementia to various lifestyle causes. A lack of exercise contributed to 22 per cent of cases, twice as many as any other cause. A third of all cases of Alzheimer's are due to lifestyle factors such as obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, and poor education - but of these a lack of physical activity was found to be most significant . Other researchers are trying to establish exactly how physical activity prevents dementia and if any particular type is more effective. They suspect that it keeps the heart and blood vessels strong, which maintains a steady flow of blood to the brain. This may prevent the build-up of plaques, protein deposits in the brain which are thought to trigger Alzheimer’s . But Professor Brayne said that in the meantime, adults should try to fit exercise into their lives. He said: ‘Simply tackling physical inactivity, for example, will reduce levels of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, and prevent some people from developing dementia, as well as lead to a healthier old age in general – it’s a win-win situation.’ Dr Doug Brown, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘This valuable study adds to a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting that simple lifestyle changes can help lower our risk of developing dementia. 'Regular exercise is a good place to start, as well as avoiding smoking and eating a Mediterranean diet.’ Statistically, one in three adults over 65 will develop dementia. Alzheimer’s is the most common form. More than a third of people don't manage to get the recommended two and a half hours of exercise per week, with a fifth classed as 'inactive', getting less than 30 minutes .","Scientists say inactivity is most important lifestyle factor for Alzheimer's .

"The secret wife of a Roman Catholic priest made it clear she is standing by him yesterday as he was jailed for sexually assaulting a teenage girl parishioner. William Finnegan, 60, and 48-year-old Beverley Dawson held hands and kissed outside court as he arrived for sentence. And the divorced mother of two sobbed as her husband was given six months. Jailed: William Finnegan appeared distraught outside Bradford Crown Court, where he wassentenced to six months in prison . During his trial at Bradford Crown . Court, Finnegan revealed he had duped his parishioners and the church . authorities by marrying Mrs Dawson abroad, and secretly living with her . for part of the week. The revelation of his broken vows was . made as part of his defence – arguing he enjoyed an ‘active sex life’ with his wife rather than being a sexually frustrated celibate priest . who would assault a girl. Despite Finnegan’s conviction last . month, many of his parishioners have continued to support him and turned . against his 17-year-old victim. Passing sentence, Judge Roger Thomas, . QC, showed his displeasure at the congregation’s blind faith in him and . his lack of remorse. He said: ‘It seems to me he can’t face . up to what he has done. It may be he cannot lose face amidst so much . shame for those who still respect him. ‘Many of his supporters might believe that the sun would rise in the west tomorrow if he said it would.’ Couple: The former Catholic priest with Beverly Dawson, whom he secretly married . ‘Father Bill’ was the parish priest at . St Clare’s Roman Catholic Church in Fagley, Bradford, when he pounced . on his blonde victim on Easter Sunday last year. He touched her bottom and passionately kissed her. Two days later he visited her home to tell her he had sexual feelings towards her. Finnegan claimed she instigated the kiss. Yesterday the judge told him he had . undoubtedly given ‘real and beneficial religious and pastoral support’ to many during his 30 years as a parish priest, even though he was in . breach of his vow of celibacy for more than a decade. Embrace: The couple kissed in front of photographers as they arrived at Bradford Crown Court . But he told Finnegan he ‘took the chance to act out your sexual desires’ on the teenage worshipper. The judge said his victim had been affected physically and spiritually by the priest’s lies. She was left feeling ‘nauseated’ and . ‘scared’ after the sex assault. ‘You’ve also caused real damage to the . wider church community, particularly the Catholic Church, and at a time . when such churches can ill afford such damage.’ As well as serving his . jail term, Finnegan must also sign the sex offender register. Referring to a victim impact statement . written by the girl, prosecutor Heather Weir said she felt ‘abandoned . and alone and bereft’. Assault: St Clare's church in Bradford, where Finnegan attacked a 17-year-old female parishioner . The statement read: ‘Father Bill was . my priest, who I trusted and someone who was supposed to guide me . through my faith, and this has all been taken from me. I’ve not felt . able to go to my family church because I can’t cope with the animosity.’ Finnegan voluntarily stopped working as a priest after being charged and the Catholic Church says his career is over. Jeremy Hill-Baker, defending, said he . had written a suicide note and overdosed on a cocktail of liquid . morphine and whisky in September last year. ‘He’d stopped breathing and . only because his wife knew CPR did she manage to revive him,’ said Mr . Hill-Baker. ‘It was an attempt to take his own life – this was not what is sometimes called a cry for help.’ Mr Hill-Baker said the former priest’s . life lies in tatters following the conviction. ‘He has no income, he . had no pension. His ministry is lost, as is his reputation, which is in . ruins.’","William Finnegan argued he had 'active sex life' and would not assault a girl .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered that a ban be placed on foreign adoptions to same-sex couples. His decision follows the commissioning of a report into so called 'psychological damage' suffered by a boy was who was adopted by two gay women in the US. A move by France to legalise gay marriage and allow same sex couples to adopt has also led to new laws being drawn so that only traditional couples can adopt from Russian orphanages. Vladimir Putin will ban foreign same-sex couples from adopting Russian children . Opposition on same sex couples adopting came to light with the conclusion of a custody battle waged between two American women over their 10 year old adopted son. Russian authorities accused Marcia Ann Brandt of deliberately deceiving them when she adopted Yegor Shabatalov from an orphanage in Siberia in 2007 when he was five years old. At the time Brandt was in a relationship with another woman, but did not tell the adoption agency handling her case. Her same-sex union only came to light when Brandt and her partner Beth Chapman split up in 2009 and waged a custody battle over the boy who they re-named Ian. 'Unacceptable conditions': Russia's Foreign Ministry said the adopted boy faced conditions 'harmful to his mental health' A court ruled that the boy should stay with Chapman at her home in San Francisco. Russian officials said they were victims of an 'immoral trick' claiming Brandt had concealed the fact that she was in a same sex union when she began the adoption process. Gay and lesbian marriages are not recognised in Russia. Russian Foreign Ministry officials ordered a report into the so called 'psychological damage' suffered by the boy who was adopted in 2007. Diplomats were refused permission to have access to the child. Last month the Russian Foreign Ministry Envoy on human rights Konstantin Dolgov spoke of his concern for the well-being of the child. 'We are seriously concerned with the situation of Russian child Yegor Shatabalov, adopted by the US citizen Marcia Anne Brandt in 2007 under a ruling issued by the Kemerovo regional court,' he said. Dolgov said the custody battle could have harmed the child and said he should be brought up in a 'normal' household of a man and a woman. ‘Mrs Brandt deliberately hid the fact of her family status from the a Russian court because it goes against the Family Code of the Russian Federation, which clearly states that the family is a union between a man and a woman,’ he said. Chapman and Brandt had been together since 2002 but split two years after the adoption. Brandt continued to work while Chapman stayed at home to raise their child. In 2011 Brandt took her son for the weekend and refused to return him sparking the custody battle. 'Dubious morality': The Russian Embassy in Washington (pictured) said it had emerged that Ms Brandt was in a relationship with another woman when she adopted the Siberian boy in 2007 . A family court ruled in favour of Chapman with the decision upheld by the Court of Appeal in January. Russian officials attempted to gain access to the boy, but were refused. Relations between the two countries on adoptions has broken down following a ban imposed on US couples adopting from Russian orphanages. The Russian government in December banned all American adoptions of Russian children in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human-rights violators. About 60,000 children have been adopted by Americans in the past two decades, and many Russians disagree with the ban, seeing it as a politically driven move depriving children of a chance to have a family. Tearful: mother Yulia Kuzmina has appealed to President Putin to restore her . parental rights following the death of one of her sons in the U.S.  Russian authorities claim the death was a result of 'inhuman treatment'' Adopted: Russian authorities claim Maxim was being abused by his adoptive parents in Texas. They allege that Russian children are being mistreated by their adoptive parents in foreign countries . A number of high profile cases with alleged mistreatment of Russian children by their adoptive parents has further harmed relations. Earlier this month Yulia Kuzmina, the Russian birth mother of two boys adopted by a couple in Texas, appealed to President Putin for her younger son to be returned to her after his brother died. Max Shatto, three, was found unresponsive outside his home in Gardendale, Texas. Russian officials claimed the boy was the victim of 'inhuman treatment' even though a prosecutor said his injuries were accidental. Last month a teenager adopted by an American couple returned home claiming he had been forced to live on the streets. Alexander Abnosov,18, returned to live with his grandmother after claiming he wasn’t wanted by his adoptive parents in Philadelphia.","Russia is to ban foreign nationals in same-sex relationships from adopting .

"Students at a top university burst out laughing in the middle of an exam when they realised the answers were stapled to their test papers. The first year exam turned into a shambles after a printing error resulted in the paper’s mark scheme being attached to the back of the questions booklet. It gave first year students the answers to the complicated test for 40 Electrical and Information Engineering students at Imperial College, London. Blundergraduates: Students at Imperial College London were accidentally given the answers to an exam - they were stapled to the questions sheet . Undergraduates say many 'began laughing' during the exam when they realised they had all the answers. Upon being made aware of a situation, the convenor ran down from his office and, after discovering what had happened, reportedly couldn't help but join in with the laughter. The convenor decided to remove the mark schemes from the test and give it back to students, hoping that they would not be able to remember most of the answers. One of the students, speaking to newspaper The Tab, said: 'I raised my hand briefly, hoping to inform the invigilators of the error, but quickly retracted it after realising I might be the only one with the mark scheme. 'On looking around, I heard one of my peers sniggering at the front of the exam hall, and then seconds later the whole hall was in stitches as our examiners looked on blankly. 'Surely the best start to any of my exams.' Giggles: Undergraduates say many 'began laughing' when they realised they had the answers . An Imperial College spokesperson said: 'During an examination being taken by 30 first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering students, the first page of the answer scheme was included alongside the question paper due to a printing error.'The Department became aware of the situation within five minutes of the exam beginning. The exam was halted and the papers were removed from the students. 'The Department reviewed the situation carefully and concluded that students would not have been able to use the information to any advantage during the short time they had access to part of the answer scheme. 'The exam questions required students to demonstrate the application of an algorithm to a given data set setting out detailed reasoning in their solutions.

"Dapper in a black button down coat and bowler hat, the Duke of Edinburgh today paid tribute to some of Britain's brave Afghanistan veterans. Prince Philip flew to Germany to meet the tank regiment of the Queen's Royal Hussars and present them with their service medals. During the event, which took place at Athlone Barracks in Sennelager, the royal inspected the ranks, pinning on medals as he went. The Duke visited the tank regiment of the Queen's Royal Hussars at the Athlone Barracks in Sennelager . First deployed in 2011, the regiment worked closely with the Afghan police before handing them control of checkpoints. The regiment returned to the country in 2013, fighting insurgents from their base at Camp Bastion, and  were among the last troops to leave the country. The Duke, who is the colonel in chief, addressed more than 300 members of the regiment who took part in a parade, watched by their families, amid chilly conditions at the barracks. Philip told the troops: 'It’s a great pleasure for me to be here again to present these campaign medals and also to welcome you all back again. 'I am quite sure your family and friends are delighted to see you and I hope you all had a good leave and are now back raring to go.' Prince Philip himself served in the Royal Navy, fighting for Britain during the Second World War . Prince Philip walked lines of soldiers in a rather dapper bowler hat, pinning medals onto their uniforms . C Squadron deployed to Afghanistan in June as the Warthog Group - one of the last British combat sub-units in Helmand Province. The Warthog Group was made up of crews from the Queen’s Royal Hussars and dismounted infantry and was responsible for disrupting insurgent activity and for providing security in the province, alongside Afghan security forces, during the drawdown from Camp Bastion. Based in Germany, the Queen’s Royal Hussars (The Queen’s Own and Royal Irish) is the senior Light Cavalry Regiment of the British Army. Soldiers taking part in the parade and receiving their medals spoke of their pride at being among the last combat troops in Afghanistan. Trooper Luke Edwardson, 24, from Newton Aycliffe in County Durham, said of his experiences in Helmand: 'It will never leave me and it was a big part of my life. The Duke seemed in excellent spirits, taking his time to talk to each solider as he decorated them . Prince Philip kept warm during the outdoor service in a black button down coat over his suit . The 92-year-old seems to have been in robust health recently after several bouts of illness . 'It was the last tour so I feel proud to be part of it. There’s not going to be any more combat troops there. 'On the plane and having a quick look behind and thinking no-one’s coming back, I was really proud.' Trooper Edwardson worked as part of a Barma team, carrying out the perilous task of clearing paths and searching for improvised explosive devices (IEDs) with hand held detectors ahead of armoured vehicles. 'It’s really hard,' he said. 'You’ve got to be really switched on. You’ve got the lives of other people in your hands. We had one IED blast but luckily no-one was hurt.' He described today’s medal ceremony as 'one of the best days and proudest days of my life', adding: 'We’re one of the last squadrons to get operational medals from Afghanistan'. Lance Corporal Sami Quinton, 21, from Devizes, Wiltshire, said of her first tour to Afghanistan: 'I’m definitely incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved.' The Duke of Edinburgh is the colonel-in-chief of the regiment and a regular visitor to the German barracks . Philip was on jovial form as he was introduced to the families of troops living at the barracks . He looked thrilled to meet families - and they looked equally pleased to see him . The medic was the only servicewoman to be deployed in the regiment’s Warthog group, echoing the recent BBC1 drama Our Girl which follows a female medic serving in Afghanistan in an all-male team. L/Cpl Quinton said of the television show: 'I’m glad they did it because at least people can see how the job is. 'When you’re in the vehicle, it’s incredibly hot, but when I’m treating people and looking after the lads - I treated a few of the locals as well - it makes me proud that I’m there to look after them.' The soldier, who turned 21 while out in Afghanistan, said of being the only servicewoman in the group: 'It was hard to get used to but because of all the training we do, you do get a good bond with the lads.' Trooper Neil Featherstone, 23, from Westbury on Trym, Bristol, who spent three months in Afghanistan on what was his first tour, said: 'Being the last combat troops - I was definitely proud to be part of it but it’s good to be home.'

"Around 90 new pieces of gold and silver have been unearthed in the field where the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon treasure was found three years ago. The fresh discoveries, made in recent weeks at Hammerwich, near Lichfield, include what is thought to be a part of a helmet and an eagle-shaped object, Staffordshire County Council said. Speaking at a press conference in Stoke-on-Trent, council leader Philip Atkins confirmed that many of pieces weighed less than a gram. Newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure is unveiled at a press conference at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire today . Eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove. They include part of a helmet, an eagle and a cross. The new items were found in the same . field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy . objects were found in 2009. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Archaeologists discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and . silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Mr Atkins said: 'The ploughing of the same field has unearthed a small number of other gold and silver finds. 'While it is far too early to say exactly what they are, or how old they are, they are certainly interesting finds.' South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh is expected to rule whether the haul of 90 items should be declared treasure at an inquest on January 4. The five hectare field was examined by a team of archaeologists - who have previously worked on battlesites at Bosworth and Hastings - once it had been ploughed at the end of November. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest planned for January 4 if the metalwork pieces are part of the Anglo Saxon collection and should be declared treasure. Staffordshire County Council Leader Philip Atkins, said: 'The Staffordshire Hoard was an amazing discovery, and we have been immensely proud to play our part in helping to discover and tell the story of a collection of such international importance. 'We will now have to wait for the inquest, to discover if the objects are a significant part of our national history.' The new items were found in the same field where over 3,900 pieces of gold, silver and some copper alloy objects were found in 2009. The new artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia . The latest find includes parts of a helmet. The team has been using x-ray images to piece together objects they find. The first discovery was made by a metal detectorist, who had permission to scan the land. Following the discovery three years ago, English Heritage immediately recognised the exceptional significance of the finds and provided emergency funding at the start of the dig together with continued expert advice, support and funding for the research and preservation of the Staffordshire Hoard. Archaeologists working with Staffordshire County Council later carried out the excavation of the field and discovered the largest ever find of Anglo Saxon gold and silver metal work from this country. In total the hoard included over 5kg of gold, 1.5kg of silver and thousands of small garnets. Treasure is defined by the law as any gold or silver objects, or coins, more than 300 years old which were deliberately hidden. Under the 1996 Treasure Act, any treasure found in England and Wales belongs to the Crown. Anyone who finds what they suspect may be treasure must report it to the local coroner within 14 days of discovery. If they don't, they risk a three-month jail sentence or a £5,000 fine. If an inquest declares that a find is treasure, it is offered to the British Museum or a local museum who has it officially valued by an independent board of antiquities experts. If they want the find, they must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and/or landowner. If they don't, the finder can keep it. Normally, any treasure belongs to the landowner. However, a landowner can agree to split the reward with a metal detector enthusiast. They include a bishop’s pectoral cross, a large folded cross, a helmet cheek piece, a filigree seahorse and numerous sword fittings including hilt plates and pommel caps. The pieces appear to date from the seventh century, although there is some debate among experts as to when the hoard first entered the ground. The dig was closed when archaeologists were confident they had retrieved everything that was recoverable at the time. Last month, a team of archaeologists and experienced metal detectorists from Archaeology Warwickshire returned to the field when it was ploughed and recovered further material. These are currently being examined and x-rayed at a specialist archives laboratory. After the Staffordshire Hoard was declared treasure a huge fundraising campaign was launched to bring the treasure back to the West Midlands. The discovery, circled in red, was made in the same field where the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo Saxon treasure was recovered in 2009 . Staffordshire County Archaeologist Stephen Dean addresses a press conference about newly discovered Anglo Saxon treasure  at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire . The Hoard was valued at £3.3m by independent experts at the British Museum - the most valuable treasure discovery ever made. The fundraising campaign was led by The Art Fund, and featured a major donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found, anywhere in the world. The two men who fell out over £3.3million after finding Saxon treasure . could scoop another fortune - after more artefacts were found in the . same field. Terry Herbert, 57, discovered the ancient gold and silver haul on 68-year-old farmer Fred Johnson's land three years ago. Their find, dubbed the Staffordshire Hoard, was sold to museums after . becoming an international sensation after the discovery on July 5, 2009 . - leaving the men rich. But the duo fell out over the cash, with Terry claiming Fred wanted it all for himself. He even said his find of 3,900 artefacts - Britain's largest ever . haul of Anglo-Saxon treasure - was a curse and blamed it on ruining his . friendship with Fred. But yesterday it emerged the pair, who have not spoken since their . rift, are set to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds more after 90 . gold and silver items were unearthed close to the original find. Experts are currently examining the finds and South Staffordshire . Coroner Andrew Haigh will rule at an inquest on January 4 if the pieces . are part of the Anglo-Saxon collection. If they are ruled to be from the same collection they will be officially declared treasure before being valued. The proceeds from the sale of the treasure will then be split between Terry and Fred. Discovered in a field near the village of Hammerwich, on 5 July 2009, it consists of more than 3,900 items. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Kingdom of Mercia.

"A senior GP is under investigation for telling gay junior doctors to avoid acting effeminately around patients. Dr Una Coales said if they deepened their voices and changed the way they walked they would stand a better chance of impressing their examiners. In a guidebook written for medics sitting clinical skills tests, she advised doctors from Africa and Asia to try speaking in ‘lyrical’ Scottish or Welsh accents if they wanted jobs in those countries. Dr Una Coales is under investigation after advising medical students to alter their behaviour to 'neutralise bias' from examiners . And she told women doctors not to wear . overly-feminine, flowery dresses – in case patients mistake them for . nurses. Bizarrely, she even advised overweight medical students to . project an ‘image of Santa Claus’ by interlocking their fingers over . their bellies. Dr Coales is a senior member of the . Royal College of General Practitioners’ Council and earlier this year . narrowly missed out on being elected its president. She made her comments in a guidebook . for junior doctors sitting their ‘Clinical Skills Assessments’, which . are exams taken in their final year. In one passage, she wrote: ‘One . candidate was facing a third sitting and yet no one had told him that . his mannerisms, gait and speech were too overtly gay. ‘So I advised him to lower and deepen his high-pitched voice and neutralise his body movements. ‘He went back to his surgery, . practised his speech until his voice went hoarse and modified his body . language. Not only did he pass his exam, but he informed me he noticed a . huge difference in the way patients interacted with him.’ She also told women not to wear . flowery dresses because ‘if you dress like a nurse they [patients] have . difficulty believing they are seeing “the doctor”.’ Kenneth Williams in Carry on Doctor: Dr Coales advised one medical student not to appear 'camp' and to walk like a 'straight man' The Royal College of GPs has now . launched an inquiry into her comments, which have provoked outrage on . the social networking site Twitter. Dr Coales, who trained in America . before becoming a GP in South London, could now be ordered to leave the . College.

Clare Gerada, the Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, makes her opposition to Dr Coales' comments clear . ‘The RCGP should be seriously . concerned if those assumptions really are present during medical . students’ instructions and exams.’ Neil Hunt, chief executive of the . College said: ‘The RCGP does not endorse the book, the author did not . write it in her capacity as a member of the RCGP Council, and we reject . the advice given. ‘I have referred the matter to the senior officer team of the College.’ On her website, Dr Coales claims she ‘understands all views because she has lived them’.

"Furious M&S customers threatened to boycott the store last night for allowing Muslim checkout staff to refuse to serve customers who want to pay for alcohol or pork.

"The way that Benedict Cumberbatch – one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors – announced his engagement to Sophie Hunter in The Times newspaper has loudly applauded by a public sick of celebrity over-sharing. The style is typical of the Sherlock Holmes star – unassuming and modest in comparison to his showbiz status, as was his response a question from a reporter about how he felt about breaking thousands of women’s hearts – that he had made the most important heart happier. His charismatic personality is as much of a lure for his legions of followers as his acting prowess – an old school gentleman in a sea of brash modern males. Scroll down for video . Benedict's mother Wanda (left) has been a huge influence in both the star's personal and professional life. The actress had been desperate until recently for her son to settle down and have grandchildren, so was delighted to hear that he had proposed to girlfriend Sophie Hunter (right). Wanda is an extremely talented actress who tarred in UFO, Carry On films and Only Fools And Horses . He is the result of a comfortable upbringing in a loving family, where his parents are as much in love today as they were 42 years ago, but also as the son of a successful actress who was a household name in the 1970s. So who is this woman who inspired both Benedict’s career and love life? His mother Wanda Ventham, 79, is an extremely talented actress in her own right, with a long list of TV shows and films credits to her name. While she was a familiar face on television throughout the 70s and 80s, Wanda is best for her role as Colonel Virginia Lake in the 1970’s sci-fi programme UFO. One reviewer said of her performance in the show: ‘Colonel Lake is effortlessly played by the Hammer horror beauty Wanda Ventham. ‘Tall, slim and incredibly attractive, she portrayed a cool executive without losing her femininity.’ Ed Bishop and Wanda Ventham in the television series UFO in 1973 . UFO wasn’t the only big name show that she featured in, from 1989 to 1992 she had a recurring role in Only Fools And Horses as Cassandra’s mother, in Heartbeat as Fiona Weston and in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates as Margaret Balshaw, to name just a few. She also appeared in two of the Carry On films - Carry On Cleo in 1964 and Carry On Up the Khyber 1968. Benedict has previously spoken of his embarrassment at some of his mother more raunchy roles, including a theatre part that involved her helping a cheating man to get dressed before his girlfriend returned. He told The Sunday Times in 2010: ‘I had to say to her, sorry, Mum, I just can't bear to see that gag one more time. ‘I was so sensitive to it, she must have wondered if I was gay."" But despite cringing at some of her roles, it was Wanda and his actor father Timothy’s successful careers that convinced him to try for a career in performance art himself. Actress Wanda Ventham seen at her Kensington flat in the late 1970s . He told The Times Magazine last year: ‘What kid wouldn’t? Have you ever been backstage? ‘All the sets, with the name of the production on the back, with weights on the bottom of them, to hold them steady. ‘And in the wings, you see all that. But then you walk on stage – and you walk into a real world, for the people who are watching it. It’s amazing.’ Wanda was an extremely talented actress, with many expecting Brighton-born woman to become one of Britain’s exports to Hollywood. But from very early on, her love of a family life battled side-by-side with her desire to perform. Even in her earliest days of acting she always put her children first – she had to turn down an invitation to join the Royal Shakespeare Company because she was pregnant with her daughter – Benedict’s older half-sister. Benedict has since spoken of his regret that Wanda may have missed some golden opportunities through putting the needs of others above her own. He said: ‘I'd love her to have a 'Cranford moment', but for that you have to have a huge backlog of classical roles."" (L-R) Tom Pelphrey, Wanda Ventham, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tracie Bennett and Timothy Carlton pose backstage at the hit play ""End of The Rainbow"" on Broadway at The Belasco Theatre in New York on May 1, 2012 . This maternal instinct overriding ambition carried on throughout Benedict’s childhood – he has spoken previously of her decision to choose commercial television over the RSC in order to provide the fees needed for his preparatory school in East Grinstead and later his scholarship place at Harrow. A scholarship place among Britain’s super-rich has caused many in the public school system to crack, but it was Wanda and Timothy’s complete confidence in their middle-class son also helped him hold his own among the elite at the prestigious boarding school. He told The Times that he was never bullied there because: ‘My parents loved the f*****g life out of me, so I felt confident about the world. ‘Not… entitled. Just like… I could step into the world. Investigate it.’ One area that they influenced Benedict against their better judgement though, was in his career choice. Fully aware of the financial difficulties that came from a life in the arts, his mother tried hard to convince him that he would be more suited to a serious job. Wanda Ventham pictured in a scene from the programme The Gold Robbers in 1969 . Benedict had played along and looked into a career in law while studying at Harrow, before eventually deciding on a degree in Drama at Manchester University. He told The Times: ‘They just saw the pitfalls of it every day. You don’t know where your next job is coming from, and it’s unstable, and you want stability for your children.’ And fortunately for the thousands of Cumberbitches out there, Benedict continued to go against his mother’s advice and forged a glittering career in film, television and theatre. But her anti-showbiz stance has stayed with him throughout his ascent to stardom – it is one of the key reasons that he constantly shies away from the limelight and is rarely seen at a celebrity party. Wanda’s biggest influence on her son though has got to be the example of romance that she and his father Timothy have set throughout their 38-year marriage. The couple met while in 1972 while filming the TV drama Family At War together. Wanda was still married to her first husband, the businessman James Tabernacle, at the time, but the union had been on the rocks for a long time and was all but finished. Timothy and Wanda had instant chemistry on the television set and have barely been apart since – finally marrying in 1976. Benedict's parents Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham in London in the early 1980s . The pair are hopeless romantics and for the first seven years that they were together, Timothy sent her a single rose every morning. She told an interviewer in the late 1970s: ‘Tim is a great romantic, which is really why—in the end—I decided I would remarry.’ She got hitched in a pair of jeans held up by braces – much to the embarrassment of her daughter Tracy, who was by then a teenager. Her fashion choices have definitely rubbed off on Benedict though – he has made it very clear before that he has little interest in high-maintenance ladies. He told an interviewer back in 2011: ‘A woman who knows that she doesn't have to get all decked out to look good is sexy. Wanda and Timothy lived for more than a decade in a three-bedroom flat in Kensington – until Benedict was 12 years old. Wanda Ventham in Midsomer Murders in 2005 . Without a garden of their own, Wanda took him regularly to Kensington Gardens, where he found a love for London parks – an interest that influenced the positioning of his current home next to Hampstead Heath. As Benedict headed into his teens and enrolled at Harrow, his parents sold up and moved to a three-bedroom cottage in Gloucestershire that neighbours Kate Moss’s mansion. While the couple also own a holiday home in Greece, Wanda mainly spends her time at the Cotswolds property, where she tends to the garden and indulges in her hobby of collecting barn owl memorabilia. Although she claims to be retired, the actress has recently been dipping her toe back in television – most recently with a cameo on Holby City earlier this year. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter attend the Men's Final of Roland Garros French Tennis Open 2014 . She also starred in an episode of Sherlock where she and her husband played the onscreen parents of Benedict’s detective character. But her keen interest in her son’s career has been matched in recent years by her desire for him to settle down and have children. So, she would have been delighted to have been informed that her son had asked his girlfriend Sophie to marry him last month. He admitted last week that grandchildren were next on her wish list for her son, saying: ‘My mother is also waiting for Cumberbabies.'","His mother Wanda Ventham, 79, is an extremely talented actress .

Prince Albert has two children from previous relationships - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, and son Alexandre Coste, 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne. The princess recently spoke of her elation at the idea of becoming a mother. describing the experience as 'magical'. She told French publication Paris Match, 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful. We are full of love, gratitude, as well as a great sense of responsibility. 'I am particularly grateful for the spontaneous love bestowed on me in these special moments. The show of affection for my family, of the totality of the Monegasque people and all our friends.' Expecting: The pregnant princess (pictured in September, left, and during a trip to America last month, right) has said: 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful' Happy day: The princess with father, Mike Wittstock, on her wedding day. The proud father has moved to Monaco to be closer to his daughter as she prepares to become a mother for the first (and second) time next month . The royal couple announced they were expecting in May but the news that the former Olympic swimmer had twins on the way was unofficially broken on Twitter a week later by a friend of the princess's father. South African TV presenter Derek Watts, a friend of Mike Wittstock, tweeted: 'My old Bulawayo schoolmate Mike Wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats Princess Charlene and Albert!' The official announcement of the twins was only made last month, with the Palace releasing a statement that read: . 'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.' With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual. Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013. Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010. But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years. Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents. Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II. During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies. Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another double birth - for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - taking place. While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed. In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role. As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate. ‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins. ‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins. ‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’","Princess Charlene and Prince Albert appeared on the balcony .

"A dinner lady has been sacked for accidentally serving non-halal meat to Muslim students at a multi-faith school. The incident outraged parents at the 'halal-only' Moseley School in Birmingham, and they have forced the headmaster to apologise for 'insulting' their faith. The member of staff has been dismissed after the 'unintentional error' on December 12 last year recently came to light. Dinner dismissal: A dinner lady has been sacked from multi-faith Moseley School in Birmingham, for unintentionally serving non-halal meat . All 1,400 students at Moseley school are served halal meat, regardless of their religion. It has not been specified what type of meat was served, but the person responsible for serving the food was dismissed following a disciplinary hearing last Monday. Parents were informed of the mistake this month, and reacted with outrage, forcing headteacher Carl Jansen to apologise for the ‘unintentional error'. However, Muslim parents are demanding others be held accountable for the mistake, which they say call 'an insult to our faith’. ‘The school have failed the children,' one parent said yesterday. ‘How did this meal get into the school . system to be fed to the children? ‘It's just shocking that dietary requirements haven't been met.' ‘It is a disgrace that this could be allowed to happen and we demand more action is take,' a father of a sixth form student said yesterday. ‘It could not just be the error or one lady, there must be people at the top responsible too who also need to be sacked. It is an insult to our faith.’ You've been served: The dinner lady was sacked last Monday following a disciplinary hearing, after it came to light that non-halal meat had been served at the multi-faith school . Not all parents have taken the news with the same shock, saying the dinner lady should not have been sacked over a mistake. ‘It's a little bit harsh to sack somebody because of one little mistake,' father-of-three Barry Jackman said. ‘Yes, we have to respect religions and standards which are expected - but it was a one-off and surely the lady doesn't deserve to lose her job.’ The details of the non-halal school dinner only came to light last month, when provider Birmingham council department Direct Services confirmed the mistake. Sheila Walker, head of Direct Services, said: ‘This was found to be due to an error and was unintentional, nevertheless, we have failed to ensure the integrity of Halal only food at Moseley School.’ A Birmingham City Council spokesperson added: ‘We of course apologise for any concerns this has caused.'","Parents forced headmaster to apologise for 'insulting' their faith .

"High-flying tax lawter Cynthia Gibson Beerbower, 65, was found by her housekeeper at her apartment in Fulham, west London, in July this year . A high-flying tax lawyer who worked in the White House was found dead in the bath of her London home after taking an overdose while going through a 'painful' divorce. American-born Cynthia Gibson Beerbower, 65, was found by her housekeeper at her multi-million-pound apartment in Fulham, west London, on July 26 this year. The 'highly intelligent' former Wall Street lawyer had left three notes in her spare bedroom alongside a piece of card which read 'I can't do this anymore', an inquest has heard. The hearing was also told how the note included a request for Mrs Beerbower be buried in Cambridge, where she attended university. Mrs Beerbower had apparently been offered several ambassadorial roles by President Barack Obama in the weeks before her death and was planning a future with her new fiancé. But the hearing at Westminster Coroner's Court heard that Mrs Beerbower was struggling to cope with an ongoing divorce battle and feared her family 'wished her dead'. Her estranged husband also described how Mrs Beerbower had a history of mental illness and had threatened suicide several times. During the hearing, Coroner Fiona Wilcox told the court that a note left by the lawyer said: 'I can't do this any more, I hate you, I am sick'. The court also heard evidence from medical professionals who said Mrs Beerbower had started taking medication that she had not been prescribed. During the hearing, Dr Marios Pierides, a psychiatrist at the Nightingale Hospital in Marylebone, said Mrs Beerbower had visited him before her death. He described how she felt 'lonely' and 'isolated' while going through the process of divorcing her husband John Beerbower. He told the court: 'Cynthia was on various drugs at different time. 'When she came to me she was being treated with various medication, she was on anti-depressants and sleeping pills. 'She explained to me she was going through a very painful period of divorce. Also she was feeling quite lonely and isolated in her residence in Fulham. Dr Pierides added: 'She would say the family wished her dead. But she was, from my point of view, a life affirming person who enjoyed things until the awful circumstances around the divorce happened.' He continued: 'At the same time she was angry and lonely at her circumstances.' The court heard Mrs Beerbower had started taking Phentermine, an appetite suppressor, as well as Diazepam. Neither had been prescribed by the psychiatrist. Dr Pierides told the hearing that the drugs have the capability to 'alter' a person's mental state, adding: 'It could promote psychosis or mood swings. 'It can alter your mental state and you might not know what you're doing.' The American-born Cambridge graduate (left) had been offered several US ambassadorial roles by Barack Obama in the weeks before her death and was planning a future with her new partner, David Shaw (right) Mrs Beerbower's estranged husband, whom she married in 1971, told the court that Mrs Beerbower had threatened suicide in the past. He also said she had previously 'over-medicated' and had mental health problems dating back to the 1970s. Mr Beebower told the inquest: 'I think there were some issues that go all the way back to the middle of the 70s. It was between two and three decades that she had been seeing people. ' He said that she became suicidal on occasions, adding: 'She would become very upset or angry and would make these kinds of statements and, for example, lock herself in the bathroom. 'As far as I'm aware she never undertook any action on any of these threats.' The inquest heard Mrs Beerbower was struggling to cope with her divorce from husband John and feared her family 'wished her dead'. Pictured: Mr Beerbower and the couple's daughter Sarah outside Westminster Coroner's Court . Despite her divorce not being finalised, Mrs Beerbower become engaged to David Shaw in May this year, the inquest heard. Mr Shaw described her as a 'highly intelligent women' and said they had started to make plans for the future. He said: 'We were planning for the next 20 years. We were planning about what countries we wanted to go, because she was being offered ambassadorial roles by President Obama.' Mrs Beerbower - one of the few female partners in a Wall Street law firm - had joined the first Clinton administration in 1993. She served as International Tax Counsel under Secretary Lloyd Bentsen before becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy under Secretary Robert Rubin. She left US Government service in late 1996. Mrs Beerbower retired from the financial business in 2005 and moved to France with her daughter Sarah. Mrs Beerbower was found dead by her housekeeper at her apartment in Fulham, west London (pictured) She and her husband acquired an olive farm in Chateauneuf de Grasse, in the south of France in 2006. From 2012 onward, Cynthia divided her time between homes in Toronto, New York City, the South of France and London, the inquest heard. Home Office pathologist Dr Jon Van Der Walt gave the cause of death as Oxidon, Phetermine and paracetemol toxicity. He said the drugs could have been enough to create a loss of consciousness, or fatal arrhythmia. The coroner said she could not give a verdict of suicide because the drugs Mrs Beerbower was taking could have affected her decision-making. Dr Wilcox said: 'At the time of death she was under the influence of Phentermine - it may well have affected her ability to have clear intentions, or even think clearly in any sensible way.' She instead recorded a narrative verdict, adding: 'She died as a result of poly-drug overdose while under the influence of Phentermine.'

"Britain is attempting to opt out of a European initiative allowing people to easily remove their details from online service providers such as Facebook. The controversial move has caused uproar among privacy campaigners, who today accused the government of blocking an 'essential move' The rule, known as the 'right to be forgotten'  has been developed by the EU justice commissioners in the face of growing complaints about the way Facebook and other social media giants retain information. The British government is locked in a battle with Viviane Reding, European Information Society and Media Commissioner, over the rules governing how social networks delete data . Introducing the plans, Viviane Reding, the EU justice commissioner, said they are: 'A comprehensive set of existing and new rules to better cope with privacy risks online. 'When modernising the legislation, I want to explicitly clarify that people shall have the right – and not only the 'possibility' – to withdraw their consent to data processing. 'The burden of proof should be on data controllers – those who process your personal data. 'They must prove that they need to keep the data rather than individuals having to prove that collecting their data is not necessary.' In its . current form, which is not finalised, article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation provides for punitive fines – up to 2% of global turnover – . for companies that refuse to comply with requests to erase customers' personal details. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The right to be forgotten is a political sound bite that got out of control, but the idea behind it is an essential move. 'It’s absolutely right that for companies who do not legally need to keep data, if you leave a service you should be able to delete your data wherever it appears across that service. 'This change gives citizens that right.' Britain's objection to the EU move is that unrealistic expectations . will be created by the right's expansive title because the controls . proposed will be relatively modest in their impact on the way data . spreads, or is traded, across websites. Mr Pickles agreed with these concerns, but called for the bill to be saved. 'There are fair concerns about who is responsible for tracking down and deleting information if it has appeared on other services, but that is no reason to junk the whole proposal. 'Equally, it is critical that British citizens do not have weaker rights than people in other countries when we are dealing with international services. 'That creates needless complexity for individuals and businesses so I hope the detail can be worked out to ensure proper protections that are feasible and will not cripple small businesses.” Viviane Reding, the EU justice commissioner, said: 'At present a citizen . can request deletion only if data is incomplete or incorrect. The rules were proposed following a slew of complaints against sites such as Mark Zuckerberg's (pictured) Facebook . 'We want . to extend this right to make it stronger in this internet world. The . burden of proof shall be on the companies, they will have to show that . data is needed.' She described the legislation as 'One of the biggest market-openers of the . last few years.' The Ministry of Justice said: 'The UK does not support the right to be forgotten as . proposed by the European commission. The title raises unrealistic and . unfair expectations of the proposals. 'We are also concerned about potentially impossible requirements for . data controllers to manage third-party erasure; the ""reasonable steps"" required by the draft regulation would promise much, but deliver . little.'","'Right to be forgotten' regulations .

"A Delaware restaurant has come under fire after photographs of bad tippers and their receipts were uploaded to its social networking sites alongside offensive and racist messages. The Padi Restaurant in Hockessin has apologized after images appeared on its manager's Instagram account and the eatery's Facebook page calling people names such as 'cheap' and 'hillbilly'. But the manager, Aaron Kwan, has denied he took the images or wrote the messages - and has instead blamed other employees for accessing his online profiles when he was not looking. After the Wilmington News Journal reported about the messages, the Instagram and Facebook accounts were promptly removed. The News Journal shared several of the offensive messages. In trouble: Offensive and racist messages have appeared on the Instagram account of restaurant manager Aaron Kwan - but he denies that he was the one who posted them . Among them, there was a photo of a bill for $53.80 for a customer with an Indian surname, who had tipped $5.20 - less than 10 per cent. The photo appeared on the Instagram account, fumanchu85, alongside the message: 'What do you expect from a last name like that? #cheap #jew' In a similar message, where a diner with a $45.90 bill paid a $6.10 tip, the person wrote: 'With a last name like that, I don’t think you will ever expect a GOOD tip. #cheap #jerk #indian.' And another image shows a customer paying his bill with the message: '#deuchbag alert. ... hate him and his family. No respect for anyone ever' - before using a derogatory term for the man's wife. Offensive: In one message, a worker posted a picture of a receipt which showed a customer with an Indian surname had left a small tip (top), and then they added an angry message (bottom) He also refered to customers as '#cheapass' and '#hillbillies' in the messages. The News Journal also reported that negative comments were shared on the restaurant's Facebook page, which has now also been removed. 'People need . to take their meds before leaving the comfort of their home,' an October post reads. 'Why would . you come to an Asian restaurant when you don’t feel like having Asian . food.' Kwan, who reportedly would regularly upload pictures of himself to the Instagram account, said he barely used the application and should have checked it more to see if anyone else had access. He added that the messages probably came from other staff members. Rude: Other messages attack diners on the restaurant's public Facebook group for eating takeout there . Site: Many of the messages were posted to the manager's Instagram, pictured, but he says it was hacked . 'It may be hacked because I left my iPad and stuff all around,' he told Delaware Online. 'Probably some other water or waitress got really mad.' Edward B. Rosenthal, an attorney representing the restaurant's owner and Kwan's aunt, Eve Teoh, said the business is working hard to restore its image after the messages emerged two weeks ago. Teoh has written an open letter to customers that hangs beside the counter, apologizing for 'unacceptable and insulting behavior'. 'We . sincerely apologize for those actions, and want the community to know . that those actions and opinions are not consistent with our beliefs and . values, nor are they welcome at our restaurant. Scene: The owner of Padi Restaurant - Kwan's aunt - said they will investigate who is responsible . Inside: Kwan said he thinks other workers accessed his personal profiles when he left his phone out . Damage control: Chef Patrick Wong and owner Eve Teoh have apologized for the offensive messages . 'We want to . assure all of our customers, and members of the community, that those . responsible for insulting our customers and members of the community . will be held accountable, and that we are taking steps to insure that . this type of behavior never happens again,' the letter reads. Rosenthal added that Kwan was on indefinite unpaid leave. 'We're holding him responsible,' he said. 'But we feel there may have been other people [involved].' He added that there will be meetings with staff members to discuss about how they are expected to represent the message of the restaurant on all fronts.","Offensive messages found on Instagram profile belonging to the manager of Padi Restaurant in Hockessin, Delaware .

"Sir Stirling Moss has infuriated women drivers by claiming they are not mentally tough enough to  compete in Formula One. He accepts they can cope with the physical demands of handling a  Formula One car, but believes the stress of a high-speed race is too much for them. Sir Stirling, 83, who won 16 grand prix in the Fifties and Sixties, said: ‘I think they have the strength, but I don’t know if they’ve got the  mental aptitude to race hard, wheel to wheel. ‘The trouble is, when you’re racing, it’s pretty tiring. Racing legend: Sir Stirling Moss with Lewis Hamilton, taking a break in 1960 (below) and in 1955 (bottom) He added: ‘We had three-hour races in those days. You needed tremendous concentration. Now races are only one hour and ten minutes. ‘We’ve got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you’re trying to win. ‘The mental stress, I think, would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don’t think they have the aptitude to win a Formula One race.’ Only five female drivers have raced in a grand prix, the last in 1992. But Sir Stirling’s comments were attacked by Formula One test driver Susie Wolff, 30, who said: ‘I completely disagree with him. It makes me cringe hearing that. ‘I’ve got a lot of respect for Sir  Stirling and what he achieved, but  I think we’re in a different generation. 'He's from a different generation': Driver Susie Wolff says Sir Stirling's comments made her 'cringe' Sir Stirling Moss, pictured here in 1960, has long been an outspoken character in the world of motor racing . ‘For Sir Stirling, it’s unbelievable that a female would drive a  Formula One car, which is  fair enough. ‘In the days they were racing, every time they stepped into a car, they were putting their life on the line. But F1 is much more technologically advanced – it’s much safer than it was.’ The Scottish racing driver added: ‘When Sir Stirling was asked about me he said, “She’s going to have a really tough time ahead of her”. ‘He’s allowed to have his opinions, but I disagree with him. ‘That perception, that stereotype, is there and it maybe always will be there. It’s not up to me alone to change it.’ The most successful female Formula One driver was Italian Lella Lombardi, who competed in 12 races in the 1970s and became the only woman to finish on the championship scoreboard when she earned half a point by coming sixth at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix.

"Actress Linda Bellingham has won damages and an apology from a businessman who wrongly accused her and her husband of being involved in property fraud. Darren Richards created anonymous blogs that defamed Miss Bellingham and her property business, Virtual Property World, which she owns with her husband Michael Pattemore. The 64-year-old actress, who starred as the mother in the Oxo television adverts, won a six-figure settlement from Richards who has also apologised. Linda Bellingham and her husband Michael Pattemore (left) and entrepreneur Darren Richards (right) She is now warning of the dangers of the internet which she said can destroy lives. Mr Pattemore was convicted of involvement in a fraud and served 21 months in jail in 1997. But neither he nor Miss Bellingham had ever hidden the conviction. Miss Bellingham had previously explained that her husband had been 'a small pawn in a financial scam' and that the matter should be laid to rest given he had served his time. But Mr Richards accused Mr Pattemore of being involved in property fraud. The couple believed he was trying to stop customers using their property business . Miss Bellingham and her husband only discovered what had been written on the blogs when they were contacted by the British Franchise Association. Damages: Linda Bellingham became known as 'Oxo Mum' after starring in the television adverts . The couple applied to the High Court and were granted an 'unmasking order' which meant Google and Wordpress had to reveal the IP address of the computer which posted the blog. Mr Richards told The Sunday Telegraph: 'I had got the wrong end of the stick, I thought I was repeating what was already out there - namely his conviction for fraud. 'However I thought I had read it involved property, so I wrongly alleged it was property fraud and I'm happy to accept that I was wrong now.' Mr Richards set up a dating service after surfing the web when he came out of a long-term relationship. Having spotted a gap in the market, he set up DatingDirect.com . In 2007 he sold the company for £30million. Following on from the dating site and building up a successful multi-million property protfolio, Mr Richards set up his own estate agency services and launched EstatesDirect.com - a national estate agency. He now divides his time between the UK and Tenerife where he has business interests ranging from bars and clubs to holiday villas and apartments. When in the UK, Mr Richards like to fly his helicopter and has a collection of sports cars. Miss Bellingham has called for stricter policing of the internet following the case. Rupinder Bains, from Pinder Reaux law firm which represented Miss Bellingham, said: 'It's a victory for those who are abused and defamed online. 'But there are still problems with the anonymity of the internet which need to be addressed. 'Anyone can go to an internet cafe and write whatever they want about someone and can bring down a company - which they have effectively done in this case.'","Darren Richards wrote defamatory blogs about Linda Bellingham's property business .

"Former Blackburn Rovers striker Colin Kazim-Richards has been found guilty of making a homophobic gesture at a match while playing against one of his previous clubs. The 27-year-old claimed he was bantering with the crowd when he allegedly made a homophobic gesture towards them while playing against Brighton, a court has heard. But magistrate Darren Reynolds sitting at Brighton Magistrates' Court, told the footballer they accepted the evidence the four prosecution witnesses had given them. Case: Colin Kazim-Richards (centre) arrives at Brighton Magistrates Court to stand trial for allegedly making a homophobic gesture to Brighton fans . Kazim-Richards said he was being booed and being called names when he turned around and made a rude gesture behind his back to the crowd to join in with their banter, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told. He said: 'There were certain voices and certain things which stick in your head. There was this one lady who kept on giving me abuse and kept on doing that.' Simon Reiz, defending the player, asked him if he reacted in any way. Kazim-Richards demonstrated to the magistrates the sign he had made behind his back and told them: 'I was interacting with the fans. 'I was basically doing what they were doing to me. I was having a bit of banter back.' Controversial: Kazim-Richards claims he was just 'bantering' with the Brighton crowd . Prosecutor Simon Allen told the court that the player had mimicked pulling his shorts down, put his left arm behind his bottom and made a homophobic gesture towards the Brighton and Hove Albion crowd. At one point he was seen by a witness backing into Brighton player Wayne Bridge and simulating a sex act which was deemed to be homophobic, the court was told. Mr Allen said the Brighton and Hove Albion fans were chanting 'you fat b*****d' and 'you're fat and you know you are' at him. Unacceptable: Brighton have reported a long list of incidents of homophobic abuse to the FA . He said: 'It seems that the player reacted to this and he mimicked pulling down his shorts and with his left hand behind his back mimicked that he had something in his hand and moved it back and forward.' Mr Allen said that each time he did this the chants from the crowd grew louder. Christopher Cannon and his son Daryl, who were working as match day press stewards at the Amex, told the court they saw Kazim-Richards make the gesture more than once. Short spell: Kazim-Richards played for Blackburn between August 2012 and April 2013 . Both men told the court they found it offensive and perceived it to be homophobic. Mr Cannon junior said: 'I perceived it as a very wrong thing to do, particularly for someone who's involved with the Kick It Out Campaign. 'Racism and homophobia are on the same level.' Season ticket holder Darren Hastings, who sits in the lower west stand, said he noticed Kazim-Richards make the obscene gesture four or five times during the match. He said it was his perception that the player was trying to get a reaction from the crowd, and that he was succeeding. Return: The forward spent two years at at Fenerbahce and has now returned to Turkey to play for Bursaspor . He said he was disappointed that neither the linesman nor the referee reacted to what was going on and said: 'It was utterly disgusting. 'I understand that football players receive a number of gestures or comments from the crowd but I certainly did not expect to see a football player perform that gesture on the pitch.' But London-born Kazim-Richards, who now plays for Turkish club Bursaspor, said he did not agree with discrimination in 'any shape or form' and told the court he had been an ambassador for the Kick It Out Campaign. He described himself as a 'flamboyant' player who had interacted with the crowd to 'acknowledge' and 'accept' the banter but that he would never make a homophobic gesture. Kazim-Richard arguably enjoyed the best spell of his carrer at Sheffield United between 2006 and 2007 . Mr Reiz said that hand gestures were made during football matches all the time and that due to Brighton having a large gay community an innocent hand gesture made behind his back had been perceived as being homophobic. He said that Kazim-Richards 'promoted diversity' and that for him to put that to one side to make a homophobic gesture was 'beyond belief'. The court also heard from three character witnesses who described Kazim-Richards as polite, approachable and respectful.","Colin Kazim-Richards claimed hand gesture was 'banter' with Brighton fans .

"It was a case of life emulating art for British actress Linda Bassett, when she stripped off for a charity calendar - a decade after starring in smash hit film Calendar Girls. The award winning film told the true story of a group of Women's Institute members who posed naked to raise funds for Leukaemia Research. Now Ms Bassett, who played Cora in the film, has posed naked for a real charity calendar which was put together to support a dog rescue charity. Linda braved a naked calendar shoot for the month of October again - with her pet dog Dust . The 64-year-old bravely agreed to undress after adopting her own pet pooch from Safe Dog Rescue. It is the first time Ms Bassett has stripped for charity - despite the success of Calendar Girls sparking a craze for nude calendars in support of good causes. Nevertheless, Ms Bassett said her experience of playing Cora did help during the shoot, which saw her strike a pose alongside her dog, Dust. Ms Bassett adopted her 12-year-old Collie cross  after he was found injured and starving to death in a sewage pipe in Romania by Safe Dog Rescue. The 2015 charity calendar in which Linda Basset is featured - her second time posing nude . 'Appearing in Calendar Girls was I thought the first and last time I would pose naked for a calendar but it appears not,' explained Ms Bassett. 'I'm quite a bit older now than I was when we filmed Calendar Girls so you could say it was a brave move but I was more than happy to help such a fantastic charity. 'In fact on the day of the shoot I was probably the least nervous because of my past experience in the film and I was able to reassure the other women who either work for the charity or have adopted dogs, who were understandably a bit anxious. 'But of course we all had our dogs there with us and they were the real stars of the show. You would think getting 12 Romanian street dogs to pose might be tricky but they were wonderful and it just goes to show what beautiful animals they are.' Linda's original pose for the month of October in the 2003 film Calendar Girls . Linda thought the film would be the first and last time she would pose naked for a calendar . The charity Ms Bassett posed for helps injured and abandoned dogs from the UK and Romania and recently hit the headlines after raising £3000 for a set of bionic paws for a dog that had undergone a double amputation in Romania. The actress adopted her dog Dust 18 months ago, and finally realised her life long ambition of becoming a dog owner. 'I have always loved dogs and always wanted a dog but as an actress it can be tricky to juggle time and commitments,' she added. 'But I decided I just couldn't wait a minute longer and looked into re- homing an older animal because they are always the hardest to home.' She had read about Dust on the Safe Rescue website and says she knew instantly he was the one for her. 'When I read what Dust had been through, I just felt strongly he was the one so I phoned Safe Rescue and asked if I could come and meet him. 'I went that day and fell in love with Dust straight away but of course the charity wanted to give me the once over before they agreed I could take him.' Since the adoption Miss Bassett has become a firm supporter of Safe Rescue For Dogs - but admits she had to think twice when she was asked to strip naked again. 'Who wouldn't at my age?', she admitted. 'But in all honesty I actually felt very relaxed on the day and we all had a good giggle.' An out-take from Linda's calendar shoot with her pet dog Dust . Actress Linda pictured with her pet dog Dust, rescued from charity Safe Rescue For Dogs . Kelly Hare, who set up the charity and came up with the idea, said: 'We are always looking for new fundraising ideas and a calendar had been on the horizon for some time but it wasn't until we started planning it that I remember that we had an original Calendar Girl in our midst. 'I knew it was very cheeky to ask Linda if she might strip naked and be in our calendar but if you don't ask you don't get and to my utter delight she agreed.' The images were shot on a chilly morning at a farm near Great Yarmouth last month. 'I think anyone passing might have got a shock if they looked over to see the actress Linda Bassett naked in a field with her dog,' added Miss Bassett. 'She is a real superstar because not only is she a great actress, but a warm and kind human being who wants to help others. We can't thank her enough for her support.' But of course the real stars of the show are the dogs who have survived injury, attack and sickness to find new loving homes in the UK.

"The estate of a young woman who was mauled to death by a cougar while working at a wild-cat sanctuary in suburban Portland is suing the sanctuary and its owners. The lawsuit against WildCat Haven and owners Michael and Cheryl Tuller alleges the sanctuary is liable for the death of Renee Radziwon-Chapman because she was left alone with the animals despite expressing concerns about working solo. The 36-year-old animal keeper was found dead inside the animals' enclosure in November 2013, with two cougars roaming freely near her. She had been working at the sanctuary for eight years. Investigators say it was likely she was cleaning the enclosure when she was attacked and killed. Her family claim she sent a text message to the zoo's co-owner expressing her fears about working alone with the animals a day before her death. Victim: The lawsuit says says Renee Radziwon-Chapman sent a text message to co-owner Cheryl Tuller the day before her death expressing concerns about working solo with the animals at the animal sanctuary . Worker: Radziwon-Chapman (seen in 2011 near a tiger cage) was found dead inside the animals' enclosure in November 2013, with two cougars roaming freely near her . The lawsuit was filed last week in Multnomah County District Court. Radziwon-Chapman's estate seeks $6 million in damages for wrongful death, ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activity, intentional misconduct, employers' liability law, and violations of the Oregon Safe Employment Act. The suit says the beneficiaries of Radziwon-Chapman's estate include her husband, Aaron Chapman; baby daughter, Noa Elise Chapman; mother, Carol Radziwon; and father, John Radziwon. The Tullers did not return a call seeking comment. After Radziwon-Chapman's death, her mother Carol Radziwon had told The Associated Press the young woman had expressed concerns about safety measures at the facility. According to the lawsuit, Radziwon-Chapman had worked alone at the sanctuary the day of her death, as well as the day before. It says the keeper sent a text message to co-owner Cheryl Tuller the day before her death expressing concerns about working solo with the animals. 'Tuller reassured her that she would not be left alone with the cats, which would be a violation of WildCat Haven's protocols, both written and oral,' the lawsuit says. The sanctuary's protocol calls for two qualified workers inside an enclosure containing animals. Despite the protocols and Radziwon-Chapman's concerns, the suit says that on November 9, both the sanctuary owners and another employee who usually worked with the head keeper were not present at the facility — they were working at another property in another county, where the Tullers plan to eventually move the sanctuary. Deadly: Investigators say it was likely Radziwon-Chapman was cleaning the enclosure when she was attacked and killed . Trouble: An investigation found the sanctuary violated its two-person safety procedure by allowing employees to work alone with the wild cats on a frequent basis. A cougar that lives at WildCat Haven is seen here in 2011 . The lawsuit says Michael Tuller 'intentionally instructed' the keeper to work in the cages alone with the animals, in violation of the sanctuary's protocols. The lawsuit also says WildCat Haven failed to maintain adequate locks on the doors to the cages of the wildcats and that the gate did not latch properly. In June, the sanctuary agreed to pay $5,600 in penalties as part of a settlement with the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division. The state agency had found that WildCat Haven violated its two-person safety procedure by allowing employees to work alone with the wild cats on a frequent basis. The OSHA investigation cited the cellphone messages sent by Radziwon-Chapman as part of its investigation. Investigators also said the latches on a smaller cage where cougars were locked out of the larger enclosure were inadequately designed. The 'light duty substandard gate latch' was designed for easy operation in backyards, but it was 'inappropriate for securing dangerous cougars,' investigators wrote. To secure those inadequate latches, workers had to enter the large enclosure and hook a carabiner over each latch. 'In doing so,' OSHA said, 'they were exposed to cougars who were housed in a lockout that was not fully secured.' The sanctuary said it had addressed the state's safety concerns. WildCat Haven is a nonprofit that rescues wild animals such as cougars, bobcats, tigers, and other wild cats. It currently houses about 65 animals. The sanctuary is 17 miles south of Portland, in a secluded, wooded area. It is closed to the public but can conduct tours for donors.","Renee Radziwon-Chapman was found dead inside an enclosure last year at WildCat Haven in suburban Portland with two cougars freely roaming nearby .

"Britain’s two most powerful civil servants were today accused of having ‘prostituted your high office’ after writing an article about Margaret Thatcher. Labour MP Paul Flynn launched a lengthy attack against Sir Jeremy Heywood  and Sir Bob Kerslake, before storming out of a Commons committee. The mandarins had praised the Iron Lady as a ‘kind and considerate boss’ who would make shepherd’s pie for staff when working late in Downing Street. Scroll down for video . Head of the Civil Service Sir Bob Kerslake (left) and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote the article on Margaret Thatcher despite having never worked with her . Labour MP Paul Flynn said the positive article about Lady Thatcher's relationship with civil servants breached impartiality rules . Sir Jeremy, the Cabinet Secretary, and Sir Bob, the head of the civil service, were forced to deny being pressured into writing the piece by Tory strategists as they were accused of breaching rules on impartiality for Whitehall staff. The two men were giving evidence to the Public Administration Select Committee. Civil servants are supposed to remain impartial because they have to work with all political parties if they win a general elections. Mr Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, began the session with a 10 minute attack on the article. He said: ‘The main controversy going on in the country may have passed you by is on the verdict on Margaret Thatcher’s period in government, this is something which divides this country, it’s the hottest political issue of the moment. Margaret Thatcher, pictured in Number 10 in 1987, used to make shepherd's pie for staff if working late . ‘You penned an article that was . entirely sycophantic, no kind of criticism whatsoever. This is not what . civil servants traditionally should do.’ Sir Jeremy refused to apologise for . the article, insisting it was ‘about the civil service relationship with . Margaret Thatcher as a person, as a human being’. Sir Bob added: ‘The article is not intended to be a comment on her policies, critical or otherwise.’ Labour’s Kelvin Hopkins also . criticised the article while committee chairman Bernard Jenkin, a Tory . MP, questioned whether they ‘really think this was wise to enter this . controversy?’ Despite attempts to move on, Mr Flynn . returned to the issue. He told the pair: ‘I’m going to leave the . meeting, not entirely for this reason but I think there is no point in . continuing unless we can press this issue to a conclusion. ‘I believe what’s happened is breach of all the traditions of the civil servants. I believe you have prostituted your high office and deserted your political neutrality. ‘I believe you have both displayed disgracefully,’ he added, before walking out. The article, written for the Daily Telegraph, triggered a political storm in Whitehall after it hailed the ‘indelible impression’ Lady Thatcher  left on the Civil Service. She left the ‘landscape transformed and the Civil Service modernised’, they said. The Whitehall mandarins refused to apologise for the article, insisting they were not asked to write it by anyone in the Tory party . It went on: ‘Alongside radical tax reforms, the abandonment of exchange controls and prices and incomes policies, the introduction of Right to Buy, a major overhaul of industrial relations law and the world's first privatisation programme, Margaret Thatcher also led a significant programme of Civil Service reform. ‘Her infamous working hours allowed the prime minister to consume vast quantities of briefings and from her No 10 flat she would nourish her civil servants with home–cooked shepherd's pie whenever they were working late. ‘To the country she was an Iron Lady, to those who worked with her she was a kind and considerate boss.’","Paul Flynn launches 10-minute assault on Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service .

"An Australian actor has embarked on a radical diet for 60 days to highlight the shocking amount of sugar in low-fat supermarket products - and the dramatic effect they can have on your health. Damon Gameau, perhaps best known for his role as a Scottish drug mule in the second season of Underbelly, spent two months eating so-called 'healthy' foods such as juice, cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called That Sugar Film. But Gameau quickly discovered that appearances can be deceiving and before long started to experience some alarming health difficulties such as fatty liver disease and mental instability. Prior to filming Gameau had spent three years shunning all sugary products from his diet - and slowly re-introduced them as an experiment. Scroll down for video . Australian actor Damon Gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years and the results were shocking . In a new documentary The Sugar Film he aims to highlight the risk of sugars being hidden in supposed 'healthy' foods . 'Sugar is now found in 80 per cent of the food we eat, but with the constant confusion over its effects ... I feel like I need some definitive answers', the Underbelly actor says in the opening of the trailer. On average people are consuming a whopping 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - more than four times the recommended daily intake - but it's often hidden in places we don't expect. Even by cutting out soft drink, confectionery, icecream and other obvious offenders within just a few weeks Gameau had begun to exhibit signs of fatty liver disease. 'This is the first time I've seen that it can be developed in two or three weeks', one doctor says, shocked at the results. Gameau said he felt very unwell, was lethargic and very short-tempered on the diet . More than six million Australians suffer from fatty liver disease, but only one in 1000 of those suffer from it due to alcohol intake. He also felt lethargic, slow, said he had a short temper and despite 'eating the same amount of calories as I did before and I'm not feeling full'. But retired NASA physicist Thomas Campbell says Gameau's physical wellbeing and appearance is not the only thing that the high-sugar diet is affecting. 'Your mental function is just unstable,' he says in the trailer. Another expert warned that it didn't matter what form the sugar comes in, it can be damaging in a high amount. 'In any sugar, brown sugar, white sugar, fruit juice concentrate from fruit juice (they all have an) equal effect on your health,' he said. Gadeau is most famous for his role in the second season of Underbelly, but has branched out to documentary making . 'If I keep going to these levels would I be knocking on the door of obesity?,' Gameau asks a doctor at one point in the film, to which she responds: 'Definitely, you haven't got far to go.' The documentary has been endorsed by heavyweights such as world-famous chef Jamie Oliver who describes it as 'A definite must-see'. Stephen Fry also makes an appearance in the film saying: 'People on this planet are growing sicker every day, and many scientists now believe that fructose has a role to play.' Kathleen Desmaisons warns: 'Sugar isn't evil, but life is so much better when you get rid of it.' The documentary has been endorsed by heavyweights such as world-famous chef Jamie Oliver who describes it as 'A defininte must-see' Doctors said Gameau was on the road to obesity after just a few weeks of the diet . Speaking to Sunrise on Wednesday morning, Gameau said 'all the sugars that I was eating were found in perceived healthy foods.' 'Low fat yoghurts and muesli bars, cereals and fruit juices, sports drinks - these kind of things parents will often give their kids thinking they're doing the right thing,' Gameau told the program. The actor added that aside from the fact that hidden sugars were having an impact on physical health - as he put on 10 centimetres of visceral fat around his waist - there was also a potentially detrimental mental consequence too. The full documentary will be released in March 2015.","Damon Gameau conducted the experiment for his new documentary .

"Grave robbers are plundering the burial sites of thousands of German soldiers to feed the demand in Britain for Nazi memorabilia. Tens of thousands of troops from the Third Reich were killed in battlefields in east Europe during the Second World War. Alongside their fallen bodies were items such as dog tags, rifles, daggers and helmets. Organised gangs are now digging up the graves of the dead soldiers to make off with the valuable items. The trade in Nazi memorabilia is worth millions of pounds and Britain is one of a handful of European countries where it is still legal. Collectibles: A Nazi helmet, grenade, shoe and two weapons are unearthed from a site in France, similar to those being plundered by gangs on the Eastern Front . But Armed Forces groups have slammed the practice of unearthing the bodies of the men in the hunt for collectible items. The bones are simply scattered on the ground or tossed into mass graves, or in some cases they are even sold. Military archaeologist Peter Reed branded it 'wholesale looting' and said the men's skeletons are 'tipped into holes'. 'Second Word War archaeology is in its infancy at the moment, and these people are destroying our future, as well as desecrating the graves of fallen soldiers who do not deserve to have their bones dug up,' he told The Times. The trade is focused around battlefields in eastern Europe and Russia. Items being sold at recent fairs include those excavated from sites in Demyansk in Russia and Kurland in Latvia. Memorabilia: A Nazi helmet and medals like those that are being looted from graves. They are sought after items among collectors in Britain, where the items are legal to sell . Arms: The items being gathered by collectors often include rifles similar to these being carried by these German troops running on the Eastern Front in 1941 . Experts say that Russian authorities turn a blind eye to activities of the gangs, because they have 'little regard for Germans'. They added that the trade was 'almost mafia-run'. Memorabilia incudes troops' dog tags, coins, medals, helmets, rifles, daggers, ammo boxes, and any other pieces of equipment that have survived the decades in tact. The items are sold on eBay, various other online sites, through networks of dealers and trade fairs. At the recent War And Peace fair - the biggest in Europe - which took place at the Hop Farm in Paddock Wood, Kent, various Nazi collectibles taken from the graves are said to have been on sale. One trader was offering more than a dozen Nazi dog tags. He said that a tag that had been snapped in half was likely to be from a grave. According to a young female collector of war memorabilia, it is mostly historians who buy items from war graves and not neo-Nazis. The 20-year-old woman, known only as Virginia, said collectors 'know more than most the pure evil that was the Third Reich'. Attack: A German soldier in the front lines hurls a hand grenade during an offensive on the Eastern Front in 1941. They were eventually pushed back by the might of Russia . Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, left, and one of his closest deputies Rudolph Hess, right. Between them and other Third Reich chiefs they planned the battles in which the soldiers on the Eastern Front died . 'If you're a devout Nazi, you want something clean. With the relics, what you're doing is buying a piece of history.' She said a Hitler Youth dagger she had bought caused a 'very strong and sad' feeling in her, and that she would study each detail and mark on it. But despite the enthusiasm from collectors to get hold of relics, the trade has sparked anger from the German War Graves Commission. The organisation traces around 40,000 dead soldiers each year and reburies them. They say that the gangs are deliberately trying to obstruct their work. Charity president Fritz Kirchmeier said: 'Often staff discover that graves have been looted. Worst is the lack of dog tags, without which we cannot identify the soldiers.'","Looting burial sites of Third Reich troops slain on the Eastern Front .

"Police in a Massachusetts town have advised the public about a registered, homeless sex offender's decorated school bus. The bus features curtains, stickers and the words 'God Bus' - and it was revealed on Facebook by the Yarmouth Police Department its owner is convicted sex offender John Stangl. Stangl's mug shot, as well as a photograph of his bus, were uploaded on the Facebook page. The police department said in a November 6 post 'Level 3 Sex Offender John J. Stangl is a convicted felon and is legally registered as homeless in Hyannis. Vehicle: Level 3 sex offender John Stangl is homeless and living out of this school bus in Cape Cod . 'This is the vehicle that he uses and lives in and sometimes travels all over Cape Cod in. It was observed by the Yarmouth Police PAC UNIT Commander this morning at Chase Garden Park on Route 28 in West Yarmouth near Standish Way. 'Please be vigilant...' Yarmouth police said Stangl, 65, weighs 300 pounds and stands six feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was convicted in October 2008 for open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior 'x4,' police said. The Yarmouth Police Department posted a message to the public from Chief of Police Steven Xiarhos regarding Stangl on November 7. The message said 'Level 3 Sex Offender John Stangl is not wanted by the police and is currently following all of the rules and laws regarding registering as a Sex Offender. 'Mr. Stangl has the right to travel and drive anywhere and everyone should be reminded that he currently has the right to be free and no one should harass or intimidate him. It is a crime. 'Everyone should be aware of his status and feel free to take the time to become educated with the Sex Offender Registry Laws in Massachusetts.' Xiarhos, speaking to Boston Magazine, said 'Because we are who we are, we are very proactive in the use of social media and social policing. His home is the bus. I decided to put the picture out.' He also said that '[Stangl] came back in [following the picture's publication], he told us that he re-registered in Barnstable. You can be homeless, but you have to let them know you are homeless in their town. We were just educating the public. Our legal right and duty is to let the public know...but this man has done everything he is supposed to do, and he’s not wanted by the police.' Homeless: Sex offender John Stangl, pictured, was convicted in October 2008 . Xiarhos explained to the website 'This man is dangerous, it’s very clear he is dangerous, according to [the Sex Offender Registry Board]. That is their way of telling the public that. But we also have to defend his rights. We did take a unique step by putting up a picture of his home - which in a way is a mobile home - and now the public is reacting.' Capt. John Rogers with the Plymouth Police Department told Boston Magazine 'We have gotten a few calls. But there’s not a lot we can do about it. Because of the social media attached to this, any place he goes, we get a call about him. From a police perspective, he’s legally registered, and if he commits a crime we’ll investigate. But it’s the bus that’s the real draw on this [attention].' Like Xiarhos, Rogers also told the website that Stangl is not wanted. Stangl's bus has been in Kingston, Yarmouth, and Plymouth, the website reported on Tuesday. There was also a bus sighting in Taunton on Wednesday, MyFoxBoston reported.","Homeless level 3 sex offender John Stangl, 65, lives in a decorated school bus in Massachusetts .

"A mother-of-four who was stabbed-to-death alongside her children on Saturday night had repeatedly called family members to warn that her husband's jealous cousin was out of control but by the time anyone came to check on her, it was too late. Growing increasingly concerned by Mingdong Chen's behavior, Qiao Zhen Li, 37, tried desperately to get hold of her husband, who wasn't home, but couldn't reach him. She then called her mother-in-law in China who reached out to her daughter in the same Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood of Sunset Park, asking her and her husband to drop by the house. 'They bang on the door and they bang on the door,' Chief of Department Philip Banks III said. But they arrived too late. In custody: Mingdong Chen, center, a suspect in the murder of a five people in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, is walked by police from the 66th precinct, Sunday, October 27, 2013 . Horror: The Chinese immigrant, who neighbors said struggled to survive in America, was arrested in the stabbing death Saturday night of his cousin's wife and her four children . When . the door finally opened, there was Chen, 25, covered in blood. The couple called 911, and . officers investigating another matter nearby responded quickly, Banks . said, catching the suspect as he tried to flee. Three of the victims—1-year-old William Zhuo, 7-year-old Amy Zhuo, 9-year-old Linda Zhuo—were dead at the scene, . discovered in a back bedroom. A bleeding and unconscious Li . was rushed to the hospital along with her 5-year-old son Kevin after . they were found in the kitchen. Neither survived. 'They were cut and butchered with a kitchen knife,' said Banks. 'It's a scene you'll never forget.' The victims had wounds in their necks and torsos. The youngest child, the 1-year-old, was decapitated, according to reports. Chen had been staying with the family for just over a week after arriving in New York from Chicago. He had reportedly stayed with his cousin's family before without incident but this time Li felt he was acting suspiciously, according to neighbors and family members. Victims: Chen is accused of murdering 1-year-old William Zhuo, 7-year-old Amy Zhuo, 9-year-old Linda Zhuo, 5-year-old Kevin Zhuo and their mother Qiao Zhen Li. Two of the children are pictured . Pictured: Ming Dong Chen, 25, confessed to butchering his cousin's wife and her four young children with a meat cleaver in Brooklyn late Saturday . Distraught father: The father of the family arrived too late to help his wife and children . Horror: A body bag is loaded from a Sunset Park residence in Brooklyn, New York after five people--including an 18-month-old toddler--were stabbed Saturday . So much so that she had already tried to kick him out of the house, Li's cousin told Xiaowe Yang. 'She . told him to go home,' Yang told the New York Daily News. 'The guy is . very poor. He had no home. He had no place to live when he came to New . York. She told him, ""You just leave my house.""' Neighbors also said that days before the brutal killings, loud, late-night arguments could be heard from the street. Chen remained . 'bizarrely calm' as he was dragged past his family's corpses and during . his confession to police in which he said he was jealous of his victims' money. 'The family had too much. Their income (and) lifestyle was better than his,' a source told the New York Post. The family did not appear to be better-off than those who lived around them in the working-class Chinese neighborhood near Ninth Avenue in Brooklyn. They sent their three school-age children to a local public school, according to the Education Department and Li stayed at home with William. Witnesses said he was 'bizarrely calm,' even as body bags went past him as cops led him away . On Sunday, Mingdong Chen was charged with one count of first-degree murder, and two counts of . murder in the second degree, as well as five counts of criminal . possession of a weapon. He reportedly showed 'no remorse' as he told police what he'd done and then tried to attack a police . officer as he was being questioned at the 66th precinct. The children's father learned the horrifying news though a police interpreter of Chinese. He had been out working at a restaurant job in Long Island when the killings occurred, according to neighbors who saw him in the street following the gruesome discovery. 'The father was freaking out,' May Chan, a neighbor, told the New York Daily News. 'He just came home from work and saw the police and they told him. He was hysterical. 'I . always see (the kids) running around here,' he added. 'They run around by my garage playing. They run up and down screaming. They're little kids ... that's so heartbreaking. Innocent kids, my God.' Chen was unfazed, according to the New York Post, as body bags carrying the corpses of his alleged victims were wheeled by. 'He's . lazy. He doesn't work too hard,' Gao Yun, 29, told the Post through . sobs after learning of the rampage. 'The guy is crazy.' Heartbreaking: A 25-year-old male suspect covered in blood was seen being led from the scene of the grisly rampage after the heartbroken father of the child victims arrived too late to save them . Senseless: The victims are a 20-year-old woman, two girls aged nine and six, and two boys aged eight and eighteen-months-old . Gao also said Chen kept getting fired from various restaurant jobs after only a few weeks. She said she thought he had been fired again from a Sunset Park area restaurant on Saturday night. 'He was completely composed and . answering their questions - even as they brought out two black bags with . the kids in them,' a neighbor told the Post. 'He . was still calmly answering their questions as the stretcher with the . bloody child was rolled right past the car,' the neighbor added. Chen was taken barefoot, his feet caked in blood, from the home in handcuffs by police. Earlier reports said a sixth person is . in critical condition at a local hospital, but spokespersons for both . the NYPD and FDNY refuted that claim. Chen was in custody and not . immediately available to comment on Sunday; it was not clear whether he had a . lawyer. Bob . Madden, who lives nearby, was out walking his dog Saturday night when . he saw a man being escorted from the two-family brick house by police. He was barefoot, wearing jeans, and 'he was staring, he was . expressionless,' Madden said.

"Australian police discovered £99millon worth of crystal meth, which had been hidden in more than a dozen sea kayaks, at a Sydney warehouse. Customs and Border Protection found approximately 400lbs (183kg) of methamphetamine which had been contained in a shipment of kayaks from China to Sydney, Australian Federal Police said. Five people have been charged after 19 of the 27 kayaks shipped in a sealed container were found to contain drugs with an estimated street value of A$180million. Scroll down for video . Big shipment: The £99milllion worth of drugs had been smuggled to Sydney from China . Taken in: Five people have been arrested since the bust earlier this month, and are due to appear in court on Wednesday . Busted: 400lbs (180kg) of methamphetamine was found in a container of sea kayaks at a warehouse in Sydney earlier this month . Police arranged the shipment to be delivered to a storage facility in Hillsdale, Sydney, where the substance returned a positive reading for methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth. Four people - three men aged 35, 30 and 21, and one woman, aged 28 – all Taiwanese nationals, were taken into custody by Australian Federal police after they attempted to access the kayaks to retrieve the concealed substance. Further investigations resulted in the arrest of 32-year-old man at his Kensington residence. It will be alleged in court that this man was involved in the facilitation of the container. Australian Customs and Border Protection Service’s Regional Director NSW, Tim Fitzgerald, said the arrests are a combined effort by ACBPS and the AFP. ‘No matter the concealment, Customs and Border Protection has the technologies and systems to identify attempts to breach the border,’ Mr Fitzgerald said. Heavy drugs: The meth has an estimated street value of £99million (A$180million) and five people are set to appear in court following the drugs bust . Big crime: The bust was a joint effort between the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and Australian Federal Police . ‘By working with the Australian Federal Police, we have again stopped criminals seeking to damage our communities.’ AFP Manager Sydney Office Ray Johnson said this seizure is another example of collaborative efforts of law enforcement. ‘This . is a great example of authorities working together to identify and . disrupt criminals who are seeking to import drugs into Australia,’ Commander Johnson said. ‘The . AFP and its partner agencies will continue to stop these harmful drugs . from reaching our streets and affecting our neighbourhoods and . communities.’ Charged: Three men and one woman of Taiwanese origin were arrested at the scene, and one Australian man was taken into custody at his home in Sydney . Discovery: An x-ray image shows the crystal meth packages as dark squares inside the kayaks . The AFP through its International Network is liaising with its law enforcement partners in China and Taiwan as part of ongoing investigations into this matter. The 32 year-old Kensington man and the woman were each charged with one count of attempt to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, and the Taiwanese men were each charged with one count of possessing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. All five people were refused bail after appearing in Sydney Central Local Court on Wednesday, and will return to court in April. The maximum penalty for these offences is life imprisonment.","Australian police discover 400lbs of crystal meth hidden in sea kayaks .

"A court employee who retrieved photos and deleted text messages from Trayvon Martin's cellphone has been placed on administrative leave after an attorney testified that prosecutors didn't properly turn over the evidence to the defense. Among the withheld evidence was photos depicting guns and drugs, the lawyer said. Former prosecutor Wesley White said he was ethically obligated to reveal that Fourth Judicial Circuit information technology director Ben Kruidbos retrieved the data that weren't turned over. Kruidbos was placed on leave shortly after White testified during a hearing in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder case on Tuesday. Violations: A former prosecutor says he was ethically obligated to say that a court employee withheld evidence that was found on the cellphone of Trayvon Martin, right, in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, left . Lawman: Wesley White, pictured in a separate court testimony, said he was ethically obligated to reveal that Fourth Judicial Circuit information technology director Ben Kruidbos retrieved data that wasn't turned over . White said Kruidbos was interviewed by state attorney investigators twice before the action was taken. White said he wasn't surprised of possible evidence violations by Zimmerman prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. 'I was saddened by it, but I'm not surprised,' he said. White first learned about the evidence through Kruidbos more than a month ago, he said. Phone and email messages left at the office of Fourth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Angela Corey were not immediately returned. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in 17-year-old Martin's killing and has pleaded not guilty, saying he acted in self-defense. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson has denied a defense motion to delay the trial, which scheduled to begin on June 10. Holding firm: Circuit Judge Debra Nelson refused to allow jurors to travel to the shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay the trial set to begin June 10 . White led the Nassau County state attorney's office before resigning in December, citing differences of opinion with Corey. He is now in private practice. White said the photos Kruidbos retrieved were of a hand holding a gun and one depicted drugs. The content of the text messages wasn't specified. 'I'm an officer of the court and I'm obliged to inform the court of any misconduct or any potential misconduct coming before the court. Whether it's by the defense or prosecution,' White said. The defense released photos of a gun, marijuana plant and Martin's text messages publicly, saying that if prosecutors planned to paint Zimmerman as the aggressor and Martin as the innocent bystander, they wanted the information to defend him. Attorneys won't be able to mention the teen's drug use, suspension from school and past fighting during opening statements at the trial, Nelson ruled Tuesday. 'No angel': attorneys for alleged murderer George Zimmerman were denied a request for photos of Trayvon Martin smoking marijuana to be included as evidence in Zimmerman's murder trial . Defense: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara, left, has told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he confronted Martin last year . Nelson has set a full hearing on the turning over of evidence for next week. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara has previously brought a handful of motions alleging that the state attorney's office had been slow to turn over other evidence. White said his disclosure to the defense isn't sparked by any animosity toward his former employer. 'It has to do with the rule of law,' White said. 'When Mr. Kruidbos testifies next week, it will be his testimony and not my own.' O'Mara said Tuesday that he felt compelled to bring this matter to the attention of the judge after a hearing earlier this month in which De la Rionda was emphatic that he'd turned over all evidence related to Martin's cellphone. Self-defense: George Zimmerman claims that Trayvon Martin punched him repeatedly before he fatally shot him in February 2012 . George Zimmerman's lead counsel Mark O'Mara, left, has revealed that the defense fund for his client is down to $5,000 from $314,099 at the start of the year . '(Kruidbos) knew information that nobody else would know about what (the state attorney's office) didn't give us,' O'Mara said. 'The picture of the gun in the hand, for example, had not been turned over to us. But that had been created back in late January within the state attorney's office. 'That inquiry, if in fact it continues and it certainly should, could lead to some very dire consequences for those who made presentations to the judge that were not accurate.' O'Mara reported on the defense team's website Wednesday that Zimmerman's defense fund had less than $5,000 left. The fund had raised almost $315,000 by January. His attorneys are calculating that Zimmerman needs another $120,000 to put on a good defense, or even another $75,000 to give him a fighting chance.","Information technology director Ben Kruidbos accused of taking photos and texts from Trayvon Martin's phone and not giving it to the defense .

"Declined to comment: Mr Lavery is MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland . The son of an MP has been forced to apologise after describing Katie Price's disabled son as a 'vegetable'.

King Abdullah was shown in a picture with an oxygen tube beneath his nose. Details of his health are largely unknown among the Saudi people .

She . said she was amazed at how her 'stream of mediocre iPhone photos... managed to captivate, anger and surprise the country's vast Twitter . community.' Her Twitter feed became . the subject of a Al-Arabiya piece on Saturday and local newspapers . picked up her photos.

Brown admits she didn't fully realize . any of this when Marine One and a helicopter carrying a pool of White . House reporters and photographers swept across the desert towards .

But then they came across lush green grass and trees, and . a compound of lavish buildings and tents that reminded her of Las Vegas . for their contrast to the sand. After landing, security guards attempted . to block the US press from getting to the entrance of the building as .

"Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said the findings would affect Labour policy . Millions of Labour voters have deserted the party in protest over mass immigration. A poll reveals that nearly eight in ten former Labour voters support drastic curbs on migrant numbers. It also shows huge support for sharp cuts in arrivals among those who have remained with the party. In 1997, some 13.5million voted for Labour, but by the 2010 election that had fallen to 8.6million. Analysis of the views of some of the five million ‘lost’ Labour voters by YouGov shows 78 per cent want net migration cut to zero. That policy would mean foreign migrants would be allowed in only to replace people who left – in effect, a one-in-one-out rule. The YouGov poll, published in Prospect magazine, interviewed thousands of Labour 'defectors'. Pollsters also found that two-thirds of Labour party loyalists backed zero net migration. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think tank, said: 'This is stunning research which is bound to affect Labour’s immigration policies. 'We will see whether they have the courage to declare a limit on immigration or whether they try to duck this essential issue. The track record so far is not encouraging.' Ed Miliband signalled this month that he wanted more done to tackle immigration, saying low-skilled immigration into Britain was 'too high'. But the Labour leader offered no policy proposals for how he would fix the problem. Labour’s open-door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in Britain since the Saxon invasion. Between 1997 and 2010 the foreign-born population of the UK increased by three million, while nearly a million British citizens left the country. Last year net migration stood at 216,000, down from 252,000 in 2010. Home Secretary Theresa May has imposed a cap on migrant worker numbers and led a crackdown on family migration and bogus students.

"A suspicious wife’s attempt to prove her husband was having an affair backfired spectacularly when a tracking device fitted to his car was mistaken for a bomb. Diletta Bianchini had employed a private detective after her husband William Sachiti began working unusual hours. Unbeknown to her the investigator fixed a tracker, roughly the size of a cigarette packet, to the petrol tank of Mr Sachiti’s £40,000 silver Lexus using magnets. Suspicious: Diletta Bianchini, left, a specialist oncologist, had the GPS tracker device fitted to husband William Sachiti's Lexus SC430 . Huge mistake: Wife Diletta said: 'I'm just so sorry it happened. It was a huge mistake and I was out of my mind' And when the husband – a security consultant and entrepreneur – spotted the device flashing he feared the worst. He rushed to alert police, who blocked off a busy high street, evacuated a coffee shop and scrambled the bomb squad, fire engines and ambulances. Mr Sachiti, who as an entrepreneur once appeared on BBC programme Dragons’ Den, said: ‘When I first saw the device it was after I had my car washed. It was in Morrisons’ car park. At first I didn’t know what to do. ‘I called a friend and they were concerned it could be something dangerous. So I went straight away to the police station.’ The device was fitted to entrepreneur Mr Sachiti's Lexus SC430, pictured . Mr Sachiti thought the cigarette box-sized device was a bomb and went to a police station for help thereby sparking an emergency . Mr Sachiti said his work involved security and anti-fraud consultancy work with banks and he feared it could be computer hackers pursuing him. The police threw a cordon around his car and blocked off the high street in Sutton, South London, while they investigated. One resident who was caught up in the evacuation of a nearby Caffe Nero, said: ‘I was alarmed about what was happening. I was told to get off that part of the high street and to stay away from the cordon for my own safety.’ A police spokesman confirmed a section of Carshalton Road in Sutton was cordoned off on Sunday afternoon and the drama continued until officers were informed the tracking device had been fitted, at which point the bomb disposal squad, London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service were stood down. Making his pitch: Mr Sachiti tried to get investment for his 'Clever Bin' on Dragons' Den in 2009 . It turned out the device had been fitted to Mr Sachiti’s car at the couple’s home in Banstead, Surrey. He said: ‘It was the wife who hired someone to follow me as she was concerned about my new ambiguous work hours. Rubbish: Peter Jones told him part of his proposal, which was rejected by the Dragons, was 'the biggest load of bull I've ever heard in the Den' ‘She did not realise that they would put a device under my car and thought that they would only follow me and take pictures to confirm my whereabouts. ‘She may well have thought I’m having an affair but I’m not. My wife has always been that sort of person who has wanted to know where I am.’ And his wife certainly appears to regret her suspicions. Yesterday Miss Bianchini, 35, an oncologist who works at Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton, was pictured in a local newspaper embracing her husband. She said: ‘I’m just so sorry it happened. It was a huge mistake and I was out of my mind.’ Mr Sachiti appeared on Dragons’ Den two years ago to ask for money to invest in his ‘Clever Bin’, a solar-powered street bin, complete with an alarm and GPS tracking, which he was aiming to sell to local authorities. His proposal was turned down for investment after Dragon Peter Jones described it as ‘the biggest load of bull I’ve ever heard in the Den’. Respected: Dr Bianchini, a specialist oncologist at Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, said she had been 'out of her mind' when she had the tracker fitted .","'She may well have thought I'm having an affair but I'm not.

"The mother of an 11-year-old boy has received an apology after a school official told her son he would have to 'work harder in life' - because he is black. Rosamaria Failla, 34, discovered that a truancy officer had told her child Sonny that he would struggle in life because he is not a 'white British boy'. Sonny, who suffers from ADHD, had been struggling with teachers at Bowmansgreen School, Hertfordhire, when his attendance started slipping. Apology: Rosemaria Failla with her son, Sonny Lewis-Failla, 11, who is at the centre of a race row in St Albans after a truancy officer told him he would 'struggle' because he was not white . In a bid to make her British-born son feel better about education his mother arranged for council truancy officers to visit him at home in July. But Mrs Failla was upset when the officer gave Sonny a brutal evaluation of his life prospects, warning him he would 'have to work harder in life to gain people’s respect' because of his colour. She complained to police and the council about the comment, which she says was: 'Because you are not a white British . boy, you are going to have to work harder in life to gain people’s . respect and achieve high things,' which she claims is racist. Hertfordshire County Council has now launched a full investigation into the claims while the officer has written a letter of apology to the family. However the council refused to confirm if the officer in question could be sacked over the matter. Mother-of-two Rosamaria said she was 'absolutely gobsmacked' when she heard what the officer said. 'The comment was ridiculous and I am confused as to why she would say something like that,' she said. The Verulam School attended by 12-year-old Sonny Lewis-Failla. He was visited at home by the truancy officer . Negative comment: Sonny Lewis-Failla, pictured with his sister Gina . 'It was highly offensive and clearly racist. After the meeting, Sonny didn’t say much but you could see in the way he acted the comment had really got to him and he was clearly upset. 'It has become clear to me there is no racial equality within the council and it is of great concern to me that adequate training is not being provided to those who will be and are involved in my son’s future.' Sonny, who started secondary school at Verulam School in St Albans this month, said: 'It didn’t make me feel very nice and I didn’t feel very confident when starting a new school.' The schoolboy, who lives with his white mother, has grandparents on his father’s side from Grenada, in the Caribbean. But Miss Failla, whose mother was originally from Italy, says Sonny’s race should play no part in concerns about his school attendance. In the letter of apology to Miss Rosamaria and Sonny the white, female officer, who made the comments wrote: 'I am sorry for any hurt or upset that I caused to Sonny or yourself in conversation at this visit. 'This was not in any way intentional and I was concerned to hear that you felt that this was the case. 'I acknowledge that the comment I made may have not been helpful and I regret any negative impact it may have had.' A letter from Justin Donovan, director of children’s services at Hertfordshire County Council, read: 'I understand the officer is very upset that you found her comments offensive and she has written to apologise to you. 'Nevertheless she clearly should not have made the comment she did and I understand why you are so concerned.' A spokesman for Hertfordshire County Council said: 'We take any such allegation extremely seriously and will be conducting a full and thorough investigation.'","White truancy officer told boy he would 'struggle in life' as he was not white .

"The New Jersey high school cheerleader who lost a child support lawsuit against her parents has picked a college to attend next fall, bragging about winning a considerable scholarship in a Facebook post. On Sunday, 18-year-old Rachel Canning announced that she would be attending Western New England University - a medium-sized, four-year, private university in Springfield, Massachusetts. 'Decision made,' Canning, a Morris Catholic High School senior, wrote as reported by NJ.com. 'WNE U class of 2018 [biomedical engineering] major w/ 56,000$ [sic] scholarship.' Canning's scholarship is perplexing considering the estimated total cost of attendance is nearly $10,000 less than her award. Scroll down for video . College bound: In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'spoiled' private-school girl Rachel Canning announced she would be attending Western New England University next fall . Brag: Canning wrote that she won a $56,000 scholarship to attend the medium-sized Massachusetts school even though tuition is just $47,560 . Western New England University is a medium-sIzed, four-year, private college located in Springfield, Massachusetts. The school was founded in 1919 under the original name of Western New England College, but was changed to a university in 2011. U.S. News and World Report classifies the school as 'selective' with a 79 per cent acceptance rate. The campus is majority-male with women accounting for just 39.4 per cent of the student body. While there are over 60 clubs and organizations, there are no social fraternities or sororities on the campus. Most of the students on campus live in college-owned or operated housing with less than 30 per cent living off campus. WNEU has several sports team that compete on the NCAA division III level. The most popular majors on campus include business, management and marketing with engineering majors (what Canning plans to study) accounting for 13 per cent of the student body. According to the school's website, engineering students can expect to pay $47,560 a year to attend the school, an estimate that includes tuition, a student activities fee, services fee, and room and board. Following news of Canning's decision, a spokesman for Western New England University issued a statement saying they cannot comment on any particular student but explained further their scholarship policies. 'To be clear, Western New England University routinely offers merit scholarships to incoming freshmen based on academic achievement. These scholarships range from $5,500 to $16,500 annually and are renewable for four years – as long as a student continually meets certain academic benchmarks. 'Therefore, these merit scholarships can total between $22,000 and $66,000 over the course of four years. These scholarships are awarded to all incoming freshmen who meet the academic criteria, independent of financial need.' Canning made headlines last month after deciding to sue her parents Elizabeth and Sean Canning for child support and tuition when they kicked her out of the house for not obeying rules. Rachel moved out of her parents' home in late October after her parents refused to pay her bills if she refused to accept their house rules and break up with her boyfriend. In her lawsuit, Rachel had sought child support, private school and college tuition and payment of her legal bills. But . last week, the teenager returned home with her tail between her legs . after she dropped the case, and she was pictured outside the home with . her parents. Though . Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child . support after kicking her out for failing to abide by their rules, she . was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's . lawyers and the judge himself. 'Have . you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I . don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said at a . hearing last month. Starting afresh: She had sued Elizabeth and Sean Canning, pictured in court, after leaving home last year . Reunion: Mother and daughter were seen outside their house together last month after she returned home . Back to normal? The family was reunited a week ago after Mrs Canning called her daughter . He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?' Following the dropped case, the lawyer representing Rachel's parents held a . press conference confirming that the family had been reunited, but would not say what had sparked it. 'This is a long process, it's only the beginning,' Angelo Sarno said, according to the Daily Record. 'This . is a private matter. It should have never been brought to the court's . attention. It should have never been brought to the public.' He added: 'It's ancient history, it's done... This is a happy situation.' In shocking legal documents submitted . to the court throughout the process, the honor-roll student said her parents’ behavior . contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw . her weight plummet. She also said that her father had . an 'inappropriate affection' for her. Back home: Rachel's parents have welcomed her back to their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, pictured . She argued that since her parents . have a combined yearly income of between $250,000 and $300,000, she was . entitled to $654-a-week in child support. Her parents also refused to pay $6,000 owed in school fees for her Catholic High School. A Department of Children and Families . investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's . parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion . she was just 'spoiled'. Her parents had claimed their daughter ran off . to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by . rules they had set down, including to stop dating her boyfriend. The . judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit. He said: 'What kind of . parents would the Cannings be if they didn’t try to set down some strict . rules? Emotional: Both Sean and Elizabeth Canning began . crying in the courtroom earlier this month as their lawyers explained that they had to enforce their rules with their often . rebellious child . No cares: Rachel was seen . with her friend Jaime Inglesino, whose family took her in and paid her legal fees . 'I'm not going to put myself in anyone's shoes, he's (father Sean) trying to raise a child. It's clear to me all the positive qualities Rachel obviously has, in terms of sports and academics, but I’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks, to put it mildly.' Through the hearings, it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk. Judge . Peter Bogaard also read an expletive-laden and vicious voice message left by . Rachel to her mother, in which she said: 'I wanna s*** all over your . face'. Rachel’s . controversial legal battle was funded by the father of her best friend, . millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believed he enabled . their daughter's behavior.

"A millionaire CEO and his wife who died following a mysterious house fire had both been stabbed multiple times, it has emerged. Cooper Health System CEO John P. Sheridan Jr. and his wife, Joyce, were pulled from their house in Montgomery Township, New Jersey on September 28 after an 'intentionally set' fire, police said. Mr Sheridan, a 72-year-old ally of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, was pronounced dead at the scene, while his retired teacher wife, 69, suffered cardiac arrest and later passed away at hospital. Authorities have released few details about the investigation and have made no arrests in the case. Mystery: John Sheridan Jr., 72, and his wife Joyce, 69, both died after a fire was intentionally set at their New Jersey home. It has now emerged that both had suffered stab wounds before the fire . But a source familiar with the investigation told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Sheridan suffered stab wounds to his neck and on one side of his body, while his wife had been repeatedly stabbed in the upper body and chest. Two knives were recovered from the scene although a third weapon, which authorities believe caused the wounds to Mr Sheridan's neck and side, has not been found, a source said. Authorities have already said the fire, which was started with gasoline and confined to the bedroom of the couple's home, was intentionally set. The gas can was found in the bedroom. Investigators and lawyers from the Attorney General's Office and detectives from the New Jersey State Police have been drafted in to help with the 'very complex case', the paper reported. A possible motive has not been released by authorities but they have indicated that they believe the couple's four sons had no involvement in the deaths. Questions: Police tape can be seen outside the couple's Montgomery Township home in September. The fire was confined to their master bedroom and a gasoline can was found inside the room . This leaves open two possibilities: murder-suicide or homicide, the Inquirer reported. The Prosecutor's Office has said there is no threat to the public. Law enforcement officials have said they were awaiting additional test results and a report from the medical examiner's office to shed light on the Sheridans' cause of death. The couple's neighbor, who called 911 that morning after smelling burning, told the dispatcher that when he knocked on the Sheridans' front door, he could hear banging and what he believed to be a person trying to get out of a room upstairs, according to previous reports. But Captain Jack Bennett, a spokesman for the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office, said that what the man heard were actually the sounds from the raging fire, and not a person banging. The couple's sons released a statement on Tuesday reading: 'Real answers will only come after a full and thorough investigation. Connections: Sheridan (left) is pictured with, from left, George Norcross III, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Dr. Paul Katz during an event  in 2012. He was an influential member of the Republican party . 'We are committed to getting to the truth and that means we will not comment while the investigation is ongoing.' The men have hired Michael Baden, a top forensic pathologist, to assist them in the case. They have also started a process with the Somerset County Surrogate's Office to handle their parents' estate because a will for the couple has not been found. The couple owned two homes, the $512,000 house where the fire unfolded and another in New York. Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year. NJBiz valued his company at $913 million earlier this year. Sheridan, a Republican, also had ties to Governor Chris Christie and served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Remembered: Hundreds of people, including Christie, attended the couple's memorial in October . The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Chris Christie and four of his predecessors, former governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco. As well as their four sons, the couple left behind three grandchildren. In a case unrelated to the fire, one of the couple's sons, Matthew Sheridan, 40, was arrested hours after their deaths for cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia found in his car. The Prosecutor's Office has not yet pursued the charges against Matthew, who lived with his parents, but has five years to do so.","John Sheridan, CEO of Cooper Health System and friend of NJ Governor Chris Christie, and his wife Joyce died after a fire at their home in September .

"Broken: Michael Schumacher is paralysed and has memory and speech problems, another former racing driver has said . Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is paralysed and in a wheelchair, according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff. The 45-year-old seven-time champion cannot speak and has memory problems. Streiff, who is himself wheelchair-bound since a crash in Brazil during pre-season tests in 1989 left him a quadriplegic, was speaking on French radio. The Frenchman, who is a good friend of Schumacher's, said: 'He is getting better but everything is relative. 'It's very difficult. He can't speak. Like me, he is in a wheelchair paralysed. He has memory problems and speech problems.' Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France. Schumacher, was transferred to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva. Official news on Schumacher, who suffered a freak ski accident in the French Alps on December 29 last year, which left him brain damaged and fighting for his life, have been scant. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. Scroll down for video . For full interview click here. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analyzed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Full support: Corinna Schumacher, pictured with brain specialist Gerard Saillant, now cares for her husband in their home on the shores of Lake Geneva, Switzerland . Life-changing: Michael Schumacher suffered brain damage after afreak ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps on December 29 last year . Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. Friend: Former racing driver Philippe Streiff made the comments on French radio today . At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. And then on April 4, his spokeswoman Sabine Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. Today, Ms Kehm said Streiff's comments were 'his opinions' and she therefore did not want to comment. She added: 'He did not have contact with us.' Schumacher's wife Corinna has been a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. She once said: 'Michael's passion for racing is just huge, it would have been impossible without this deep passion; this passion has made him who he is. I got to know him as a racer, and I had previously always had fullest confidence in him.' He has referred to his marriage as 'total harmony', saying: 'We have the same vision of how we want to spend our lives. My wife Corinna and our harmonious family - that is my main force always at play in the background.' With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Michael Schumacher is paralysed and has memory and speech problems .

"Seized: Police swooped on Bulgarian murder suspect Tihomir Georgiev in South London . A notorious Bulgarian gangster who was one of the world's most wanted criminals has been seized by police - after being tracked down to a gym in South London. Shaven-headed Tihomir Georgiev, who was on Interpol's 'most wanted' list, was suspected of murder when he fled his native country for London. The 43-year-old, a boxer and former henchman to a Bulgarian mafia boss, reportedly has a fearsome reputation for slicing off the ears and fingers of his enemies. But after fleeing the Britain, . Georgiev was seized by officers from Scotland Yard's Extradition Unit . yesterday at a boxing gym in Bermondsey, South London, according to The . Sun. The Bulgarian was . still wearing shorts and fighters' bandages on his hands when police led . him away under a European Arrest Warrant, according to the paper . Georgiev, . suspected of murdering one of his own drug dealers for disobeying an . order, was part of a gang of criminals seized in Sofia, Bulgaria, in . 2010. But before the trial concluded, he skipped his £20,000 bail, fled to London, and lived on the streets for months until the owner of Rooney's Gym in Bermondsey took pity on him, allowing him to sleep and train at the facility. Police swooped on Rooney's Gym in Bermondsey, South London, to arrest Georgiev this week . Georgiev even took part in boxing events at the gym and his face was used on promotional posters for upcoming events. The Bulgarian fugitive was able to flee to the UK as his home country joined the EU in 2007, meaning his background would not have been checked when he entered Britain.

"Leon Taylor was sentenced to death for killing gas station attendant Robert Newton in 1994 . A man who killed a  gas station attendant in front of the worker's eight-year-old stepdaughter in 1994 was executed in Missouri in the early hours of this morning. Leon Taylor, 56, was sentenced to death through lethal injection for the murder of Robert Newton, who was shot in the head during a gas station robbery in Independence. Taylor also tried to kill Newton's young stepdaughter, but the gun jammed. In a final statement, Taylor apologized to Newton's family because 'our lives had to entwine so tragically' and thanked his family for their support and love. 'I am also sorry to have brought all of you to this point in my life to witness this and/or participate,' Taylor said. 'Stay strong and keep your heads to the sky.' His last meal consisted of eggs, bacon, doughnuts and an orange drink. Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell said Taylor later turned down the sedative Valium and the sedative midazolam. The convicted killer  could be seen in the execution chamber at Bonne Terre state prison talking to family members through the glass in an adjacent room, with his body covered by a white sheet. Once the state started injecting 5 grams of pentobarbital, his chest heaved for several seconds then stopped. His jaw went slack and he displayed no other movement for the rest of the process. Four of Taylor's family members sat in a room to his left and looked on without reaction as the drug killed Taylor in about eight minutes. Speaking after the execution, Mr Newton's brother, Dennis Smith, noted that it had been about 7,500 days since the killing and said the family has missed him every one of them. He described his brother as a hard worker, generous and with a memorable laugh. At times, Mr Smith paused to compose himself as tears rolled down his cheeks. 'It would just take a coward to want to hurt someone like him,' he said. According to court records, Taylor had decided to rob the gas station with his half brother and half sister  on April 14, 1994. He entered the store, drew a gun and told Newton, 53, to put $400 in a money bag. The half brother, Willie Owens, then took the money to the car, while Taylor ordered Mr Newton and the young girl to a back room. Mr Newton pleaded not to be killed in front of the little girl, but Taylor shot him in the head and then tried to kill the child. But the gun jammed, so Taylor locked her in the room and the trio drove away. 'She had the gun turned on her,' said Michael Hunt, an assistant Jackson County prosecutor who worked on the case. 'It didn't fire. If it had fired, we'd have had a double homicide.' Scroll down for video . The execution chamber at Bonne Terre state prison, Missouri,  where Leon Taylor received the lethal injection . He added that the child's testimony at trial was pivotal in the death sentence. 'You can imagine what a horrible crime this was, but when you see it coming out of a young person like that, it was hard to listen to,' Mr Hunt said. Taylor was arrested a week after the crime when police responded to a tips hotline call. His execution is the ninth in Missouri this year, meaning 2014 currently ties with 1999 for having the most executions in a year in the state. At a time when executions have gone awry in Oklahoma, Ohio and Arizona, Taylor's death occurred without any visible complications with the drug or equipment. Taylor's fate was sealed Tuesday when Governor Jay Nixon declined to grant clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down his appeal. Court appeals claimed the death penalty for Taylor was unfair for several reasons. The original jury deadlocked and a judge sentenced him to death. When that was thrown out, an all-white jury gave Taylor, who was black, the death sentence. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that only a jury could impose a death sentence. Taylor's lawyers contended that a Missouri Supreme Court ruling after the U.S. Supreme Court decision led the state to commute at least 10 other death sentences for inmates sentenced by a judge to life in prison - everyone except Taylor. Attorney Elizabeth Carlyle said Taylor essentially was penalized for successfully appealing his first conviction. The clemency request to Governor Nixon said Taylor turned his life around in prison, becoming a devout Christian who helped other prisoners. The petition also cited abuse Taylor suffered as a child, saying his mother began giving him alcohol when he was five and that he later became addicted to alcohol and drugs.","Leon Taylor, 56, died through lethal injection at Bonne Terre state prison .

"'Mistake': Next has removed the t-shirts from its stores following the outcry . Fashion chain Next has been slammed by Christian groups over a graphic ‘Sinners’  T-shirt which depicts women as sex objects and uses Bible references. A Twitter storm has erupted over the shirt with one blogger even claiming the shirt, image and message effectively condones rape. The T-shirt carries the headline ‘Sinners – The Night Before’ above the seductive image of a woman in black underwear lying on a bed. The image is surrounded by a series of slogans which read: ‘Live for the Day – Seize the Night and all it may hold’ Finally, there is a long smallprint passage which carries a number of definitions of sin including one from the Bible from epistle to the Romans, chapter seven. Gareth Davies, of Christian Action Research and Education, contacted Next via its official Facebook page to complain about the T-shirt. He asked: ‘Why are you marketing graphic T-Shirts with misogynistic poses of women in underwear and promoting such images using The Bible?’ Mr Davies said: ‘The image itself is very unhelpful. It gives a message about availability and vulnerability of women. They are then using the word sin and words from the Bible to suggest this is both naughty but nice. ‘The whole concept is wrong-headed and demeaning to women. Human dignity should be cherished and women should not be reduced to the level of an object.’ A number of Christian and non-religious individuals joined the condemnation using Twitter and personal blogs. One female blogger complained the image was effectively soft core pornography that was more the remit of a top shelf magazine than a family store. She said the woman was presented as simply being available for a man’s sexual pleasure. Boss: Simon Wolfson is chief executive of the Next chain of stores . Most controversially, she described the lines ‘Live for the Day – Seize the night and all it may hold’ as a rape fantasy slogan. The issue of rape has been headline news in recent weeks with comments from the Respect MP George Galloway and a leading US politician apparently attempting to downplay the crime.Mr Galloway suggested the women alleging rape against the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange should not be believed.The blogger wrote in an open letter to Next: ‘In the wake of the summer of rape apologists - Galloway, Assange et al -  the very last thing we need are T-shirts that tell people that a woman is theirs for the seizing.’ Other Christian commentators on Twitter condemned the T-shirt’s images and messages, but rejected any suggestion it condoned rape. Director of the Family Education Trust, Norman Wells, criticised Next for stocking the T-shirt.He said: ‘It beggars belief that a company that has a well-established reputation as a respectable family store should be marketing such a cheap and tawdry product that demeans women and encourages a casual attitude to sex.‘We hope that Next will think again and take the socially responsible step of withdrawing this product rather than risk having its good name dragged through the gutter.’ Next is run by Simon Wolfson, who is a prominent supporter of the Conservative party and was made a life peer by David Cameron’s government. Last night the company admitted it had been a mistake to stock the T-shirt.A spokesman said: ‘Next has received some customer complaints regarding a man’s T shirt and sweatshirt.  On reflection we agree it was a mistake for us to sell these garments and we are therefore removing them from sale.’","'Sinners' t-shirt carried a seductive picture of a woman in underwear as well as references to the Bible .

"Pub bosses have been branded sexist for using a barmaid's cleavage to advertise their new ales. Staff at The Victoria, in Birmingham city centre, posted the picture of Lucy Wedge, 22, posed between the pumps of their guest ales, on the venue’s Twitter and Facebook profiles. Miss Wedge was wearing a low-cut black vest in the photo, exposing her cleavage, and numerous complaints were posted under the image, claiming it objectified women. The picture that was posted onto The Victoria's Facebook and Twitter profiles to advertise the guest ales . The photo was quickly removed from Facebook and an apology was posted, saying: 'It was meant as a light hearted joke between two female bartenders and a few of our regular guests and we could not have predicted the strong response it would receive.' However, the image can still be seen on The Victoria’s Twitter page, which has 5,513 followers, along with the caption 'Come get a #realale from a #realwoman'. Pub regular Annie-Marie Hopper, 34, said: 'It was a very tasteless and old-fashioned way to shamelessly promote the pub. 'They should be ashamed they have reduced themselves to this very blatant sexual objectification of a lady in such a sexist manner.' Lucy Wedge, 22, who posed for the photo, said the image was not provocative . Other customers have come out in support of the pub, branding those who complained 'jobsworths'. Commenting on the Facebook apology, Lee Amber wrote: 'Some people need to get a hold of themselves. Why even waste energy getting offended by a light hearted image. F****** jobsworths.' Miss Wedge herself has also come out to support the marketing ploy. The self-proclaimed tomboy said: 'It wasn't like pose by this pump with your boobs out. 'I leaned in and she took the pic and, to be honest, I was more concerned it was going to be embarrass as everyone would know it was me by my tattoo. 'The next day I saw that Steph [another barmaid who runs the pub's social media] had removed it and I apologised, . 'If I had been there with my boobs out then fine but a bit of cleavage isn't a big problem. It wasn't a provocative photo. 'I drink pints with the blokes and I think that my attitude isn't represented in the photo. People might think I'm one of those girls who loves male attention but I'm not.' Julian Rose-Gibbs, 40, owner of The Victoria, said if it had been left up to him the photo would not have been taken down. He said: ""Steph was really upset but she did the right thing by apologising and removing it after the comments she was receiving. 'We give her free roam on our social media and stand by her decisions. 'However if I had been aware at the time I wouldn't have removed it.'

"A Barbie book titled I Can Be a Computer Engineer has triggered outrage over the seemingly 'sexist' and patronizing message it sends to young girls. The $4 book, which was published by Random House and is aimed at three to seven-year-olds sees Barbie - supposedly a computer engineer - make a number of technical blunders before turning to her male friends to fix her issues. 'It's incomprehensible how misogynistic it is,' reads one of the book's many overwhelmingly negative Amazon reviews. Sexist? A Barbie book entitled I Can Be a Computer Engineer (pictured) sees the famous blonde doll make a number of technical blunders before getting her male friends to fix them all . The book, written by author Susan Marenco and published in July 2013, opens with Barbie 'hard at work' on her laptop, as she explains to her sister Skipper: 'I'm only creating the design ideas. I'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a real game!' One irate reviewer writes on Amazon: 'Literally six sentences into the story, and already Barbie can NOT do it. 'She immediately admits she doesn't know how to actually do computer engineering, and like a Disney princess, needs a white knight to rescue her.' Wheel in the men: Barbie, while 'hard at work' on her laptop,  explains to her sister Skipper (pictured), 'I'm only creating the design ideas. I'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a real game!' The next scene sees Barbie get hit with a 'weird' virus on her laptop, before borrowing her sister's computer to finish her work, only to inadvertently infect hers too. Having lost all of Skipper's 'unsaved' homework and music files, Barbie announces she is sorry, but she has to 'run off to school now.' Skipper 'playfully hits Barbie with a pillow,' and Barbie heads to school for a computer lesson from her glamorous female computer teacher. But alas, things don't start looking up until she turns to her two male friends for help. Pillow fight: The next scene sees Barbie (right) get hit with a 'weird' virus on her laptop, before borrowing Skipper's (left) computer to finish her work, only to inadvertently infect hers too . Speed is of the essence: Despite taking a computer lesson as school, things don't start looking up until Barbie enlists the help of two male friends (pictured) who can fix the issue 'faster' 'It will go faster if Brian and I help,' suggests Steven, before he and Brian fix the virus and retrieve all of Skipper's files. Barbie then heads home to 'surprise' her sister with the good news. 'You are just too cool Barbie! You fixed my computer and saved my homework!' Skipper exclaims. Reviewer Rachel Appel points out: 'Barbie takes 100per cent of the credit for fixing something to which she contributed nothing.' She adds: 'I work as a software engineer, which is a male dominated field. 'It is exactly these stereotypes and portrayals of girls like the one in this book that are the driving force behind the lack of girls wanting to enter these lucrative technology fields.' Steven saves the day: The book, written by author Susan Marenco, was published in June 2013 by Random House and is aimed at three to seven-year-olds . Sister act: In one of the final plot-twists, Barbie seemingly takes all the credit for fixing Skipper's laptop, despite Brian and Steven actually doing all the work . Another reviewer, also a computer engineer, writes: 'As the father of two daughters who are both in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, my only recommendation for this book would be to set it on fire.' The only customer to defend the book, wrote: 'All you feminists in uproar over Barbie asking for her male friends' help in this book don't even fit the profile for buying a Barbie book. 'It's called free speech! Not every woman is just as competent as some men in certain areas and vice versa.' One female computer programmer by the name of Kathleen Tuite, based in Santa Cruz, California, set up a comical blog entitled Feminist Hacker Barbie, which invites users to re-write pages from the book. Alternate ending: One computer programmer by the name of Kathleen Tuite set up a blog entitled Feminist Hacker Barbie, which invites users to re-write pages from the book and includes this submission (pictured) Poking fun: Another user puts their spin on the inflammatory children's book (pictured) 'Barbie's new book tells girls they need boys to code for them,' the site's description reads. 'Help Barbie be the competent, independent, bad-ass engineer that she wants to be.' Submissions include Barbie, rather that turning to her male friends for help, suggesting: 'It will go faster if you boys just get out of here and let me work. Maybe make a Taco Bell run?' In a statement made to MailOnline today, a Barbie representative said: 'This book was published in 2010. Since that time we have reworked our Barbie books. 'The portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn’t reflect the Brand’s vision for what Barbie stands for. We believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits. 'We apologize that this book didn’t reflect that belief. All Barbie titles moving forward will be written to inspire girls imaginations and portray an empowered Barbie character.'","The $4 book is aimed at three to seven-year-olds and sees Barbie as an incompetent 'computer engineer'

"'It's always something with him': Debra Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate, speaks during a 2009 parole hearing for Manson follower Susan Atkins . The sister of Manson family victim Sharon Tate has denounced cult leader Charles Manson's prospective marriage to a 26-year-old fan as 'ludicrous' and 'insane'. Debra Tate, whose pregnant sister was slain in 1969 by Manson's murderous followers, has spent much of her life trying to divert attention from the cult leader and keep him in prison. Her job has got more difficult however with the news that the 80-year-old has been granted a marriage license to wed Afton Elaine Burton, who moved from the Midwest to California nine years ago to be near him. 'It's always something with him,' she said. Ms Tate's comments came as prison officials told TMZ that Manson will be allowed to kiss his bride on their wedding day for as long as they want, but warders will step in if the couple become too intimate. Manson will reportedly not be restrained during the ceremony but he won't be allowed physical contact with Miss Burton beyond holding hands and locking lips during the ceremony. Manson must be in his prison scrubs as dressing up in a morning suit or tuxedo is forbidden, but Miss Burton can wear whatever she likes. Catering will be from prison vending machines. Ms Tate said Manson's bride-to-be, known as 'Star,' seems to believe the killer is leading a movement to save the environment. Its name, ATWA — which stands for air, trees, water, animals — was emblazoned on a T-shirt worn by Miss Burton when The Associated Press interviewed her on Monday. 'I wonder how long it will take for her to figure out this is just a con,' Ms Tate said. 'It makes me wonder what is missing in her life that she would want to marry an 80-year-old man. Is she a victim? Is she mentally deranged?' Miss Burton has said she loves Manson and wants to help exonerate him. Marrying him would provide access to information denied to non-relatives, she said without elaborating. She left her home in the Midwest to move near Manson's prison in Corcoran, California, nine years ago. She runs several websites maintaining the killer's innocence. Scroll down for video . Well suited? Charles Manson, left, 80 has been in prison since 1969. His fiancée Afton Elaine Burton, right, 26, moved from her home in the Midwest to Corcoran, California, nine years ago to be close to his prison . Strict rules: Manson will reportedly not be restrained during their wedding ceremony but he won't be allowed physical contact with Miss Burton beyond holding hands and a kiss to seal their union . Tate, 62, recently published a coffee table book about her sister. 'There are no M words in the book. No Manson, no murder,' Tate said Tuesday. 'It's a celebration of Sharon's life, her fashion sense, her physical beauty and her spirit.' With an introduction by Sharon's widower, director Roman Polanski, the book is titled Sharon Tate Recollection. Sharon Tate was 26 and more than eight months pregnant when she was killed with four other people. The next night, grocers Leno and Rosemary La Bianca were stabbed to death across town. Manson later stood trial with Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten. All were sentenced to death as was a fifth killer, Charles 'Tex' Watson. When the death penalty was outlawed briefly in 1972, their sentences were commuted to life in prison. A self-imposed purgatory followed for the Tate family. Her mother and two sisters committed themselves to attending every parole hearing for every Manson family member to argue against their release. Debra Tate is one of the few people still alive to carry on that cause. Foremost in her mind is preventing the spread of Manson's internet following. 'I don't want any more heinous actions by another family like his because of something I didn't do,' she said.

Sharon Tate at London Airport in 1966: She was 26 and more than eight months pregnant when she was killed . The Kings County marriage license, viewed on Monday by The Associated Press, was granted on November 7 for Manson and Miss Burton. The license does not specify a wedding date and indicates the couple has 90 days to get married or they will have to reapply. Miss Burton told the AP that she and Manson will be married next month. 'Y'all can know that it's true,' she said. 'It's going to happen.' 'I love him,' she added. 'I'm with him. There's all kinds of things.' California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton confirmed  that the license had been transmitted to the prison. Manson on his way to a 1971 sentencing hearing: When the death penalty was outlawed briefly in California in 1972, his and his followers' sentences were commuted to life in prison . Ms Thornton said each California prison designates an employee to be a marriage coordinator who processes paperwork for an inmate's request to be wed. In most cases, she said, the department of corrections approves of such weddings as 'a tool of family reunification and social development.' But Manson's case is difficult. Miss Burton said the wedding might have happened earlier if Manson did not have 'some situations' at the prison. Ms Thornton explained that in February, Manson had three violations for possession of a weapon, threatening staff and refusal to provide a urine sample. Further details on the violations were not immediately available. Miss Burton said the prison holds marriages on the first Saturday of each month. She expects to be married in an inmate visiting room at the prison. Ms Thornton confirmed that Manson can have a wedding at the prison and invite an officiate from outside the prison to perform the ceremony. He and his prospective spouse also would be allowed to invite 10 guests who are not inmates. Manson's life was one of crime even before he became the 20th Century's most notorious serial killer. He was born Charles Miles Maddox to a 16-year-old girl during the Great Depression on November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was abandoned by his mother and father before ending up living on the streets, where he began to steal cars, write fraudulent checks and became involved in prostitution. By the time his followers committed their gruesome murders that shocked the world in 1969, Manson had already spent half his life in prison.","Debra Tate, who has spent her life campaigning against Manson's release, has described has upcoming wedding as 'insane'

"Images have emerged showing a security guard unconscious on the floor after he was knocked out by a teenager at a school struggling with discipline. Alphonso Stevenson, a 63-year-old conflict resolution specialist hired to quell the violence at Bartram High School in Philadelphia, was allegedly assaulted by a 17-year-old student on March 21. Stevenson was greeting students as they walked to class when the teenager knocked his clipboard from his hands, and when Stevenson went to reach it, the boy allegedly pushed him against a wall. The staff member's head smashed against a wall, knocking him unconscious and leaving him with a fractured skull, concussion and other injuries, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Scroll down for video . Attack: Alphonso Stevenson, a security guard at Bartram High School in Philadelphia is pictured on the floor after a 17-year-old student allegedly hit his head against a wall following an argument . 'It sounded like a melon hitting the wall,' social studies teacher Stephen Pfeiffer said. As he lay on the floor, students swarmed around him and snapped photographs before sharing them on social networks. Meanwhile, the teenager who had allegedly assaulted him ran off. But he was stopped by school police and has been charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, simple assault and other charges, authorities said. Stevenson has been . released from hospital and is recovering at home. Hurt: The 63-year-old suffered a fractured skull, concussion and other injuries and the teen was arrested . This is just the latest violent act at the school, which employees complain is understaffed and where students say their classmates rule the hallways. The school has struggled with fights, drug use and violent crime, as well as teachers and principals transferring out after just weeks on the job. Cars and laptops have also been stolen at the school. 'I had a better chance in Vietnam,' Pfeiffer, an Army veteran, told the Inquirer. 'Here, you lock your door and pray no one comes in.' The school has long endured unruly students - in 1999, an assistant principal was shot by a student - but teachers claim that the teenagers are even more out of control now. They largely put it down to budget cuts, which has left them with 100 extra students from a nearby school that closed but the same number of staff. Troubled: Bartram High is understaffed and struggles with violence, theft and drug use, teachers have said . Teachers told the Inquirer that they have been told not to ask for help before 9.30am because there are no staff members to help them. 'There are fights constantly,' one teacher said. 'I call . downstairs for help - sometimes they answer and sometimes they don't.' Another added: 'I'm even getting anxious to walk the halls any more.' The school district superintendent has acknowledged that the school has problems and he is sending a respected former district principal in an effort to calm the school, he said.

"Andy Burnham roused deflated Labour activists yesterday with a pledge to put the brakes on healthcare privatisation – despite a warning from the head of the NHS that it would be impossible. A day after Ed Miliband’s lacklustre speech to his party’s conference, the shadow health secretary received a series of standing ovations as he promised a ‘rescue plan for a shattered service’. But it emerged yesterday that NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens had thrown a spanner in the works by writing to Mr Burnham to dismiss Labour’s call to block all new contracts between hospitals and the private sector. Scroll down for video . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham had tears in his eyes after 91 year old Harry Smith attacked David Cameron in a speech at the Labour conference . Mr Smith told Labour activists about his childhood growing up in a 'barbarous, bleak and uncivilised' Barnsley slum . Members of the audience were visibly moved by the emotional section of the conference dedicated to the NHS . Embarrassingly for Mr Burnham, Mr Stevens told him that rules introduced by Labour itself in 2006 meant there must be competition over who provides services. In another blow for Labour, it was revealed that Mr Miliband’s pledge of a cash boost for the NHS actually amounts to less than the budget increase granted by Margaret Thatcher every year she was in power. On Tuesday, the Labour leader announced a new £2.5 billion fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 extra GPs, 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives. But the money amounts to an increase of just 2.2 per cent on the £111 billion budget planned by the Government. While Mrs Thatcher was prime minister, the lowest cash increase was 6 per cent – and between 1949 and 2010, the average annual growth in NHS spending was 4 per cent. Mr Burnham used his speech to pledge that, if Labour wins power, carers will be given better support with funding for breaks and annual health checks. And there will be a new promise that everyone who wants to die at home rather than in hospital should be able to, if clinically possible. But much of the barnstorming address was an attack on what he claimed was the Tories’ creeping privatisation of the NHS – even though he signed off on increased use of private firms to provide care when he was Health Secretary. Catherine Atkinson, who is standing to become a Labour MP in Erewash, took her baby Jacob on to the stage . She was seen holding her son while trying to get conference organisers to let her address the audience . Shadow Cabinet sources claim Mr Burnham has toughened up his position on privatisation to win support from the Left of the party in anticipation of a leadership bid. ‘Andy’s on manoeuvres,’ said one. In his speech, Mr Burnham said: ‘The party that created the NHS in the last century today sets out a plan to secure it in this. A rescue plan for a shattered service. Miss Atkinson said she did not want Jacob to grow up 'saying 'we used to have an NHS for all' ‘But more than that. A vision for a 21st-century NHS there when you need it, personal to you and your family, with time to care. 'A national health and care service based on people before profits. Today we place that proud Labour plan at the centre of our election campaign.’ Mr Burnham said that days into office in 2010, ‘the Tories set about dismantling your NHS’. 'And the plan that dared not speak its name before the last election is now plain for all to see: run it down, break it up, sell it off,’ he said. ‘So today we serve notice on Cameron and Clegg: Thursday, May 7, 2015 – your day of reckoning on the NHS. ’ Mr Burnham added: ‘Our ten-year plan for the NHS is founded on people before profits. We will free the NHS from Cameron’s market and, yes, repeal his toxic Health and Social Care Act. 'We will ask hospitals to collaborate once again and reinstate the NHS as our preferred provider. The public NHS, protected with Labour. Not for sale. Not now, not ever.’ Labour insists the Government’s restructuring of NHS commissioning, which came into force in 2013, has led to privatisation by the back door. 'But use of the private sector by the NHS doubled in the last four years of Labour, a far bigger increase than under the Coalition. Since 2010, a further 1.3 per cent of the NHS budget is spent in the private sector, with the total standing at about 6 per cent. In a letter to Mr Burnham, seen by the Daily Mail, Mr Stevens flatly rejected his call for a moratorium on any new deals with the private sector as impossible. A Labour spokesman said: ‘David Cameron’s reorganisation forces the tendering of contracts, not the EU. ‘We still believe these large contracts should be halted until there’s an NHS debate at the election.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham gave a passionate defence of the health service, urging Labour activists to 'battle for the soul of the NHS' Mr Burnham's barnstorming speech stole the show at the Manchester central conference centre . The positive reaction from activists came as the party was left reeling by Ed Miliband's meandering speech, in which he forgot whole sections on the deficit and immigration . To promote his promise of £2.5billion for the NHS, Mr Miliband visited Salford Royal Hospital today, but faced more questions about what he left out of his speech .","Bookies cut the odds on shadow health secretary becoming Labour leader .

"Marriage itself only lasted for 72 days . Humphries did NOT attend court . Sombre Kim attended as per judge orders . Kris Humphries has decided to settle with Kim Kardashian in their divorce case after battling for a year and a half - and over five times as long as the marriage itself lasted.

He was then forced to consider mounting legal costs and the prospect of losing any pay-out from his estranged wife - a pre-nup would be invoked if the trial got to court. Dressed for the occasion: Pregnant Kim Kardashian emerged from court after her marriage to Kris Humphries was finally dissolved on Friday . This means that Kris has most likely . agreed to a divorce - as Kim wished - and dropped his pleas for an . annulment based on fraud, and sources are saying the judge has signed off divorce papers and dissolved the marriage.

"A millionairess has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her husband with cyanide, as it emerged he was her seventh partner to have dropped dead in two decades. Chisako Kakehi, 67, has been the beneficiary of a combined 800million yen (£4.3million) in insurance money and other assets received after the deaths of her seven exes. If she is found to have been behind the deaths of her partners, she will become the latest example in Japan of a 'black widow', named for the female spider that devours its mate after coupling. 'Doomed by fate'? Japanese millionairess Chisako Kakehi, 67, is arrested in Kyoto on November 19 on suspicion of poisoning her husband with cyanide in the latest 'Black Widow' case . Husband number four Isao Kakehi fell sick suddenly at home and was confirmed dead at a hospital in December last year, less than two months after the couple married. A post-mortem examination found highly toxic cyanide compounds in his blood. That came after the September death of a 75-year-old boyfriend, who fell suddenly ill after the couple ate together at a restaurant, Jiji Press reported. Kakehi's dalliance with death began in 1994 when her first husband passed away at the age of 54. In 2006 her second husband, whom she had met through a dating agency, died of a stroke aged 69, while the third marriage ended in 2008 with the death of her 75-year-old partner, Jiji said. A boyfriend, believed to have been suffering from some form of cancer, died a year later, and in 2012 her then-fiance met his fate after collapsing while riding a motorbike. Traces of cyanide were detected in his body, media reports said. 'Black widow': Kakehi pictured in March. She has previously insisted she was not involved in the deaths . Kyoto, Japan: If Kakehi is found to have been behind the deaths of her partners, she will become the latest example in Japan of a 'black widow', named for the female spider that devours its mate after coupling . Kakehi was arrested on Wednesday by police in Kyoto on suspicion of murdering her latest husband. She has denied any involvement in his death. 'We suspect she did it for money,' said a detective investigating latest death, without giving details of the amount involved. Lonely hearts killer: In 2012 Kanae Kijima was sentenced to hang for murdering three men - aged 41, 53 and 80 - she met through internet dating sites . Police are now working on the theory that she may have been behind the deaths of at least some of the other six. 'We can't say how many now... Given their advanced age, we have to proceed carefully to judge whether their deaths were actually the result of foul play or not,' the investigator told AFP by phone. Questioned by reporters earlier this year, former bank worker Kakehi protested her innocence. 'If people suspect murder, I'd find it easier to bite my tongue off and die,' she told reporters in March. Jiji Press quoted her as saying in an earlier interview that she was 'doomed by fate' to suffer a series of deaths among those close to her, and protesting that she had no access to poison. Japan has seen several 'black widow' multiple murderesses in recent years. In 2012 Kanae Kijima was sentenced to hang for the murders of three men, aged 41, 53 and 80, whom she met through internet dating sites. Kijima, who was at one time a paid-for mistress, poisoned her victims with carbon monoxide by burning charcoal briquettes after drugging them with sleeping tablets. She is in jail awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the supreme court. Another woman, fomer bar hostess Miyuki Ueta, is also waiting on the outcome of a supreme court appeal against a death sentence for the killing of two men.","Chisako Kakehi has got a combined 800m yen from ex-partner's deaths .

"The world’s carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control. Scientists from the UN have warned that emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), need to follow suit so that, overall, greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero between 2080 and 2100. Scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels (pictured), should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels . A certain level of carbon is emitted naturally, but the report refers to reducing man-made emission to zero - referred to as net zero. The stark report, by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said that emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century, in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions, such as widespread droughts. Countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2°C - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but UNEP said that if the world carries on as it is, greenhouse gas emissions will be ‘way beyond safe limits’. It warned that even if countries meet their existing pledges to cut emissions, the world will exceed the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted to keep temperature rises within safe levels - by 10 billion tonnes by 2020, and 17 billion tonnes by 2030. Countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2°C - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected, such as melting ice caps and rising sea levels (illustrated) - but UNEP said that if the world carries on as it is, greenhouse gas emissions would be ‘way beyond safe limits' To have a good chance of staying below 2°C, greenhouse gas emissions should drop by around 15 per cent or more by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, and be at least 50 per cent lower by 2050 on the way to net zero emissions. The report said that there could still be room for some emissions at the end of the century if they are compensated for by measures that take in carbon, such as planting trees, to achieve ‘carbon neutrality’. But delaying taking stringent action now until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and greater risks to society. Carbon emissions from human activities must be cut to net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) must reach net zero by the end of the century . Emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century. Delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life. The Emissions Gap report is published ahead of UN climate talks in Lima, Peru, which are working towards a new global deal to tackle climate change that it’s hoped will be agreed in Paris next year. UNEP executive director Achim Steiner said: ‘An increase in global temperature is proportional to the build-up of long-lasting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. ‘Taking more action now reduces the need for more extreme action later to stay within safe emissions limits.’ WWF chief executive David Nussbaum said the report was another stark reminder of the ‘worrying chasm’ between what scientists said needed to be done to avoid dangerous climate change and what governments have promised to do so far. ‘If we don’t close this “emissions gap” within this decade, our task will not only become harder and more expensive, but threatens the very survival of some of the world’s most vulnerable communities and habitats,’ he said. ‘Prevarication and delay are our enemies. As the report rightly notes, postponing rigorous action until 2020 will lock in much higher costs and risks later on. This is an unacceptable legacy to bequeath to our descendants. ‘We must end the era of dirty fossil fuels and move to an era of clean renewable energy as fast as possible. ‘We cannot ignore one of the report’s key findings, namely, that energy efficiency offers a triple win: emissions reductions, energy security and green jobs.’","Scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 .

'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber and defended Senior VP Emil Michael who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company . Outburst: Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack Sarah Lacy, the journalist who has criticized the company . 'So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. The actor's attempt to defend Uber quickly provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company and of unfairly describing Lacy as shady for reporting facts about the service. 'A journalist harassed by a company you invested in. Nice' tweeted @tiedtiger. 'What makes her shady?' wrote @KeenPOV. 'Pointing out how some Uber drivers are sexual assailants?' Not long after Kutcher decided it might be best just to apologize. 'U r all right and I'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. I just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures,' he tweeted. Target: Kutcher was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . Kutcher's attempt to defend Uber provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company . In 2011, Kutcher was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after tweeting that the sacking of Joe Paterno as head coach of Penn State showed 'no class' and was an 'insult' to his legacy. Many people labelled Kutcher an idiot for his view and after a barrage of complaints he deleted his tweet and recanted his stance. 'This is an insane story, I just heard paterno was fired, getting the rest of the story now... Wow,' he wrote. He added: 'Heard Joe was fired, fully recant previous tweet! Didn't have full story. #admitwhenYoumakemistakes' Kutcher's Uber comment come a day after Emil Michael was forced to make a grovelling apology over his controversial comments. The senior vice president was speaking at a private dinner in Manhattan on Friday, when he said that he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. The sinister scheme - which was targeted at a Silicon Valley editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - drew an outraged backlash when it became public. Tweets: Kutcher made a series of tweets on Wednesday in which was critical of journalist Sarah Lacy  before seeking to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber . A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber . Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press and responded that Uber should consider hiring researchers to snoop on writers . In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.' After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized. In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his or Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.

"Probe: The man who handed himself in to authorities in Cyprus has facial similarities with reconstructions of how Ben may now look, the family said . This young man could be missing Briton Ben Needham, Greek authorities have revealed. Ben was just two went he went missing from his family while they where holidaying in Kos, in 1991. But after 22 years, police have called for DNA tests on the member of a Roma family living in Cyprus who they claim could be the long-lost child. Police have even handed Ben's mother Kerry an image of the tall, blue-eyed man they are testing, with light brown hair, wearing a blue and white striped rugby top. There is also a video of the 22-year-old man, which has been viewed by authorities. The . man came to the attention of the Greek police when he fled the mainland . with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service. After seeing the image, Kerry, 41, told the Sunday Mirror that she believes the man in the photograph could be Ben, who would now be aged 23. She said: 'I’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how Ben might now look. 'As a family we’re greatly . lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the Greek . authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress. 'We’ve never given up hope of finding Ben and we are encouraged that the police in Greece are continuing to investigate.' The image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the Lawyers Association in Kos. Breakthrough: Ben, pictured left, has never been found but new images and a video show a Roma man with light brown hair and blue eyes, as in the artist's impression above, right. Police want to find and DNA test him . Panayiotis Avrithis, the president the association, realised the potentially explosive nature of the images and handed them to Alexandra Moussoura, the area's District Attorney. The video clip shows a man Greek sources say is between 20 and 25, with four other men from the Roma community, attending a church service in Limassol, Cyprus. It was published with the photograph on Greek news site Zougla. The development has been described as 'highly significant' by Greek police, who are now expected to work with their Cypriot colleagues to track down the man and establish his identity. Ben disappeared on July 24, 1991, while his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham were looking after him in the Greek resort. Hope: Ben Needham's mother Kerry, right, pictured on Kos with her mother Christine, left, said she has been 'lifted' by the breakthrough . Despite a move by Greek police to excavate land in Kos in a bid to uncover Ben's body, his mother Kerry has refused to believe that her son died after being taken. Last year, officers from South Yorkshire police travelled to the island to conduct their own land search, but no major new leads emerged. The case bears strong links to the tale of little 'Maria', the four-year-old blonde girl who was found living with Romas Greece this month, after allegedly being 'trafficked'. It has since emerged that she is the daughter of a Bulgarian woman called Sasha Ruseva after DNA tests proved biological link. Mrs Ruseva, 35, claimed she handed her daughter over to a Roma family after she gave birth in Greece and could not afford to register the new born. But she and her husband Atanas, 37, could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold Maria for profit. Regardless of the conclusion, the evidence of Romas having acquired children who are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children could have ended up in the impoverished communities. Maria's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery. Disappearance: Ben's family were on a trip to Kos, above, in 1991 when the toddler went missing . Search goes on: South Yorkshire Police Officers, above, travelled to Kos last year to conduct their own search for missing Ben . Covering old ground: The officer's search was without success but the new breakthrough has been welcomed by Ben's mother Kerry . Gerry and Kate McCann were alerted to the case after Police in Portugal agreed to reopen their investigation into missing Maddie. Authorities in Ireland too, seized two children from a Roma family to two test if they were living with their biological parents. In . both cases, police suspected that the children, a seven-year-old girl . from Dublin and two-year-old Iancu Munteau from Athlone, might be . victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike . the rest of their immediate family. Tests have since shown that both children were living with their real parents. Pictured: The case has echoes of the story of young 'Maria', above, who was found to be living with a Roma family last week.

"Two Church of England vicars conducted 'hundreds' of sham marriages to help illegal immigrants stay in Britain, a court heard today. The Reverend Elwon John, 44, and Reverend Brian Shipsides, 55, performed the sham wedding ceremonies at All Saints Church in Forest Gate, east London, jurors were told. Once wed there were a 'strikingly high . proportion' who then made applications to the Home Office for the right . to remain in the country. In the dock: The Reverend Elwon John, left, is alleged to have performed sham wedding ceremonies at an east London church. Reverend Brian Shipsides, right, has already pleaded guilty . In some cases, EU nationals were even flown into Britain just so the marriages could take place before being flown straight out again, Inner London crown court heard. According to the prosecution, 31-year-old 'fixer' Amdudalat Ladipo . - herself an illegal immigrant - arranged the weddings between mainly . Nigerian and EU nationals. It was not until officers from the Metropolitan Police and UK Border Agency caught wind of the scam that the trio were finally rumbled on July 31, 2010. All three are now charged with conspiring to facilitate unlawful immigration. Shipsides has already pleaded guilty. Ladipo and John deny the charges. David Walbank, prosecuting, said: 'This case involves a massive and systematic immigration fraud. 'At the centre of this fraud is one particular parish church in the east of London, All Saints Church in Forest Gate. Wedding venue: All Saints Church in Forest Gate, east London, has been at the centre of the sham marriage investigation . 'The Crown’s case is that there took place in that church over a two-and-a-half year period a very large number indeed of sham marriages entered in to for the purpose of immigration. 'Most of the so-called couples participated in these marriage ceremonies were not actually couples at all. 'They were married in that church not because they wished to spend their lives together and wanted the blessing of the church, most of the persons married there for a very different reason. 'Their ultimate purpose was to obtain enhanced rights to enter and live in the United Kingdom.' Mr Walbank told jurors the majority of the marriages which took place were between Nigerians and nationals from the European Economic Area (EEA), mainly from Portugal and the Netherlands. He added: 'The fraud, the Crown suggest, wasn’t confined to one or two, or even a couple of dozen of ceremonies. We are concerned in this case with hundreds of sham marriages. 'On some occasions EEA nationals were flown into the UK specially for marriages to take place and then flown back out again.' Accused: The jury was told that Amdudalat Ladipo - herself an illegal immigrant - arranged the weddings between mainly Nigerian and EU nationals . The court heard Nigerian Ladipo may also have been involved in fixing sham marriages at other churches, although the jury were told she only faces charges in relation to weddings at All Saints. When police attended the church in July 2010 after being told a number of sham weddings were due to take place there that day they found Ladipo there. The court heard one of the officers approached her and asked her why she was there. She replied one of her friends was getting married. However, when asked for her friend’s name she is said to have become agitated and was later seen trying to get rid of a brown envelope under a bush in the church grounds. When seized the enveloped was found to contain a number of ID documents which were not hers and sham paperwork relating to the marriages and she was arrested. Rev John, the curate at All Saints Church, and parish priest Rev Shipsides were arrested a few days later on August 3. Mr Walbank told jurors: 'If the sham marriages hadn’t been stopped they would have continued at a rate of knots as there were many more booked at the church that would have taken place.' Jurors heard Ladipo herself may have entered into a sham marriage with a Dutch national in February 2010. 'Her reason for going through with the marriage we suggest is entirely consistent with the motive of others at All Saints Church during the indictment period, to stay in the country,' said Mr Walbank. Shipsides, of Forest Gate, east London, has already admitted conspiring to facilitate unlawful immigration. Ladipo, of Dagenham, and John, of Barking, both in east London, deny the same charge. Ladipo also denies possessing false identity documents. The trial, expected to take four weeks, continues.

"The son of singer Marvin Gaye is recovering at home after a successful kidney transplant and he has an appearance late last year on Entertainment Tonight to thank for finding a donor. Marvin Gaye III appeared on ET in November after he filed a lawsuit against the writers of Robin Thicke's smash hit, Blurred Lines. In the suit, filed in October, Gaye claimed that Blurred Lines was an illegal rip-off of his father's 1977 funk/disco classic Got to Give It Up. Scroll down for video . Marvin Gaye III appeared on Entertainment Tonight in November after he filed a lawsuit against the writers of Robin Thicke's smash hit, Blurred Lines . When Gaye appeared on ET to discuss the lawsuit, his lawyer David Rudich also put out an appeal out for a new kidney for his client. At that point Gaye had been receiving dialysis for renal failure for three years as a result of hypertension and diabetes. A previous public appeal to find a donor hadn’t met with any success, but his appearance on ET changed all that. Rick Greene of Cincinnati came forward after being moved by Gaye's plea for help. In the lawsuit, filed in October, Gaye III claimed that Blurred Lines was an illegal rip-off of his father's 1977 funk/disco classic Got to Give It Up . A spokeswoman for Gaye said he underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center last week. ET is currently preparing a follow-up segment to air in the coming weeks. The lawsuit - which remains unresolved - also involved Thicke's co-writers Pharrell Williams and rapper T.I. (real name Clifford Harris Jr.). Strangely, Gaye filed the claim to counter a suit filed last August by Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on Gaye's copy written work. The original suit followed internet rumblings that the song bore a striking resemblance to Got to Give It Up. Getting . in first: Co-writers Pharrell, Robin and T.I. lodged a preemptive suit last August asking a judge to rule that they had not copied their hit . Attorney Owen Sloane explained why the plaintiffs filed first, saying, 'They wanted to do a preemptive move. There was a dispute and they could've waited to be sued, but it looks worse if they're on the defending side.' According to Gaye, he may not have even pursued legal action had he not been sued first. 'It didn't even get to that point,' he said. 'They felt the need to jump the gun, so here we are.' He said his lawsuit had one main objective, 'I want to see my father get credit for his work,' he said.

"A U.S. academic has been gang raped in Papua New Guinea by nine armed men who hacked off her blonde hair and left her husband tied naked to a tree. The 32-year-old woman, who was conducting research into exotic birds in a remote forest on Karkar Island, was walking along a bush track with her husband and a guide on Friday when they were set upon by the gang armed with knives and rifles. Her husband and the guide were stripped and bound by the men, who then used a bush knife to hack off the woman's hair before raping her in a terrifying ordeal lasting 20 minutes. 'Act of animals': The U.S. academic, 32, was with her husband and a guide when they were ambushed by nine men armed with rifles and knives - she was gang raped and her blonde hair hacked off . The woman chose to speak out about the horrific attack - condemned by the country's prime minister Peter O'Neil as 'the cowardly act of animals' - to highlight the violence that women in Papua New Guinea experience. The brutal gang rape came less than a week after an Australian man living in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea was shot dead and his Filipina girlfriend gang raped when a group of men broke into their house. The U.S. woman, who posed for a photograph but did not want to reveal her identity, spoke to media in Port Moresby as she and her husband waited for a flight to leave the country. 'I was walking along a bush track with my husband and our guide when we were ambushed by nine men armed with rifles and knifes,' she said. Relaying an ordeal that has sent shock waves throughout the country, the woman said the men first ordered her husband and the guide to strip naked before they were tried to trees. Then they turned to the woman. Her clothes were torn off, her hands were bound and her blonde hair was chopped off with bush knives. She was then raped one by one by the gang for a terrifying 20 minutes. Her ordeal ended only when something in the forest startled the gang and they ran away. The U.S. couple's guide managed to . break free and released them, before they all ran naked along jungle . tracks for several hours, determined to put as much distance as possible . between themselves and the scene of the attack in case the gang came . back. Eventually they reached a remote village where they were given some clothing and from where they were able to raise the alarm. Violence: The woman, who was on her fifth visit to Papua New Guinea, was conducting research into exotic birds and climate change on the remote island off the country's northern coast . Remote: The 32-year-old academic was working on remote Karkar Island during her fifth trip to Papua New Guinea when she was attacked . They later made their way back to Madang, on the northern coast of the mainland, before flying to the capital Port Moreseby. A local photographer working for AFP helped the couple file police reports and organise a flight out of the country. 'This . story should not come out just because I am white,' said the woman, who . was on her fifth visit to the country since her first trip in 2010. She . would stay for up to four months conducting her research into exotic . birds and the impact of climate change on the forest. 'My . story should come out in the hopes that it empowers Papua New Guinean . women to stand up and say no more violence against women in this . country,' said the woman, who did not want to reveal her identity. 'I hope my story can make a change.' But senior police admit they have heard such calls before from tribal women all around Papua New Guinea. Wives suffer extreme violence in some cases from their husbands over domestic issues, and brutal punishments are handed out to women accused of witchcraft, which is practised in remote parts of the country. In February a 20-year-old mother accused of witchcraft was dragged from her village, taken to a rubbish dump, stripped and burned alive near Mount Hagen, in the centre of the country. And earlier this month an elderly woman was beheaded with a bush knife after being accused of sorcery. The U.S. woman's terrifying story has been reported to the US Embassy in Port Moresby, but a duty officer today gave no comment. A spokesman for the police in Port Moresby said a statement had been taken but no arrests had been made.","The woman was researching exotic birds in the jungle on Karkar Island .

"Nurse Julie Shorter, 52, is suing East Surrey Hospital for £250,000 claiming she was left with 'psychological injuries' after her sister died . A nurse is suing the NHS claiming £250,000 for a 'broken heart' after she watched her pregnant sister die from a brain haemorrhage following a 'catalogue of errors' by hospital staff. As a senior sister in a neurological care unit, Julie Shorter had witnessed the deaths of dozens of patients, watching their families' grief as part of her day-to-day job. But the 52-year-old said it did not prepare her for the 'sledgehammer' emotional blow of witnessing her sister Lucia's death from a brain haemorrhage, aged 39. Her lawyers said the tragedy came after a 'catalogue of errors' by staff at East Surrey Hospital in 2009. Mrs Shorter is suing the NHS Trust which runs the hospital, for up to £250,000 citing the nervous shock and 'psychological injury', she suffered. Her professional understanding of medical matters made the experience even more traumatic for her than for ordinary members of the public, the High Court heard. But the trust which runs the hospitals argues Mrs Shorter is not entitled to a penny, adding her expertise and experience should have 'prepared her for what she would encounter'. Bosses said they have already admitted liability in relation to Ms Sharma's death and have paid her family two compensation claims since 2009. Mrs Justice Swift was told that Lucia Sharma was pregnant with her third child when she was admitted to the hospital in May 2009. Charlotte Jones, representing Mrs Shorter, said that the mother-of-two had been experiencing headaches, stiffness in her neck and nausea. But a CT scan carried out on May 5 at the hospital was reported to her as showing 'no abnormality' in her brain. A week later, however, as her symptoms worsened and she began to suffer fits, it was discovered that the scan in fact showed she had suffered a brain haemorrhage. 'The bleed had been missed,' Miss Jones told the court, adding that Lucia was 'reassured and discharged'. She argued that that was just one of 'a catalogue of errors' in her treatment, which included delays in Lucia being transferred to a specialist brain unit. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she died after being transferred to St Georges Hospital, Tooting. Her life support machine was turned off on May 13, before her sister's eyes, the court heard. Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust has admitted liability in relation to the expectant mother's death and has already paid out on two compensation claims by her family. However, the trust denies that Mrs Shorter is entitled to a penny, saying it could not reasonably have foreseen her powerful reaction to what she saw. Mrs Shorter, of Burgess Hill, West Sussex - who works for the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust - told the judge that the shock of witnessing her sister's end, and in particular her deeper medical understanding of the situation, have left her emotionally scarred and suffering from flashbacks. She said she 'became a mother figure' to her sister after the early death of their mother from leukemia and that the pair had been 'particularly close'. She had been left 'heartbroken' by her loss, she added. Hitesh Sharma holds a picture of his wife Lucia who died at the age of 39 in May 2009 . Describing the trauma of watching Lucia's condition worsen, she told the judge: 'My worst fears were being realised. I was absolutely terrified. 'I was very frightened, but I didn't want that to come across to Lucia - she was frightened enough. 'When you are an adult that's what you have to do. I didn't think it would help if I started crying along with her or freaking out.' She told of her horror at seeing her sister put on to life support, saying that, as a senior nurse, she knew how grave the situation was. 'It hit me like a sledgehammer. I felt sick and horrified,' she told the court. 'For me, seeing someone lying there in that position is not the same as for someone who doesn't have the medical knowledge that I do of these patients. 'It hit me like a blow. I've seen lots of people being respirated in my time as a nurse, but I don't think anything ever prepares you for seeing a loved one on a respirator. 'We see lots of families and relatives who are losing their loved ones, and now I was that person. 'Nothing can prepare you for that. I was absolutely heartbroken. 'I remember feeling absolutely bereft, devastated and helpless. There was nothing I could do. I knew I'd lost her,' she said. Miss Jones told the judge that, due to her emotional trauma, Mrs Shorter was plunged into a 'major depressive episode' and still experiences chest pains and flashbacks. The High Court heard the trust which runs the hospitals argues Mrs Shorter is not entitled to a penny, adding her expertise and experience should have 'prepared her for what she would encounter'. Bosses said they have already admitted liability in relation to Ms Sharma's death and have paid her family  compensation . Whilst managing to hold down her job, she has to take time off regularly and her condition 'renders her employment status precarious', the barrister said. The trust denies liability for Mrs Shorter's mental injuries, arguing that Lucia's death was a 'gradual drawn out process'. It insists that what happened was not 'shocking or horrifying' enough to foreseeably trigger such an extreme response in her sister. Mrs Shorter's professional training, the trust argues, 'prepared for what she would encounter' when she witnessed her sister's final hours. Julian Matthews, for the Trust, confirmed outside court that it had admitted liability in the two previous claims in relation to Lucia's death. The High Court hearing, set to last for three days, continues.","Julie Shorter, 52, told the High Court she was left heartbroken by the death of her sister Lucia Sharma, aged 39 .

"The global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine, according to experts. Diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago, but experts say ADHD is 'more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one'. After examining the growth of ADHA in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Brazil, they concluded there are five trends which contribute to its growth. The global surge in ADHD diagnosis and treatment with drugs has more to do with marketing than medicine, and in years to come we may regret treating children with drug, experts warn in a paper (file pic) They blame the rise on lobbying from drug companies, who have spurred some countries to relax the restrictions put on stimulants like Ritalin, the most well-known drug used to treat ADHD. Psychoanalytic treatment of the condition, usually with talking therapies, is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs, they said. More psychologists and psychiatrists are now adopting the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) standards, which are broader and have a lower threshold for diagnosing ADHD, they added. There has also been a rise in vocal advocacy and support groups for the condition, who often work closely with pharmaceutical companies to promote treatment with drugs. Lastly, the rise in internet use makes finding information on the condition, and diagnosing oneself, easy. This prompts people to ask their doctor for drug treatment, they said. ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Use of the extremely common ADHD medication Ritalin can cause dangerously long-lasting, unwanted erections with long-term use. The Food and Drug Administration said it has  updated its advice on Ritalin to include a warning about priapism, a condition that can permanently damage a patient's penis. The stimulant drug in Ritalin, methylphenidate, is also found in the brand names Daytrana and Concerta--an extended release version often prescribed to adutls--among many others. The agency warned people to talk to their doctors before halting the drugs and said priapism has only occurred from use of methylphenidate in rare cases. It has come under much controversy in recent years, with some health professionals voicing concerns that diagnosing such a cluster of symptoms as one overarching disease means we are medicalising normal human behaviour. In the paper, researchers cited websites promoting ADHD drugs, offering checklists with questions like 'Do you fidget a lot?' , 'Is it hard yfor you to concentrate?', 'Are you disorganised at work and home?' and 'Do you start projects and then abandon them?' Writing in the report, Professor Peter Conrad, of Brandeis University, U.S. said: 'These checklists turn all kinds of different behaviors into medical problems.' 'The checklists don't distinguish what is part of the human condition and what is a disease.' The researchers said in the U.K., diagnosis of ADHD in school-age children grew from less than one percent in the 1990s to about five per cent today. In Germany, prescription ADHD drugs rose from 10 million daily doses in 1998 to 53 million in 2008. Growth in Italy and France has been slower, in part due to those countries' more restrictive pharmaceutical drug laws. However, researchers said even those nations are now becoming more lax. In Brazil, a rising number of ADHD advocacy groups, many with close ties to the pharmaceutical industry, are raising awareness of the disorder. Professor Conrad voiced concerns about the rise of prescription treatment for ADHD, which he believes may be socially constructed. 'Call it an economic and cultural plague, but not necessarily a medical one.' Psychoanalytic treatment of the condition, usually with talking therapies, is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs such as the stimulant Ritalin, researchers said . 'There is no pharmacological magic bullet. No drug can account for non-medical factors that may contribute to behavior. A fidgety student may be responding to the one-size-fits-all compulsory education system, he said, not a flaw in his brain chemistry. ADHD continues a long history of medicalising behaviors, especially in the U.S., he added. One example he cited was masturbation, which was considered a disease a century ago. Men and women diagnosed with masturbatory insanity were institutionalised or subjected to surgical treatment. 'I think we may look back on this time in 50 years and ask, what did we do to these kids?' Professor Conrad concluded. The paper was published in the journal  Social Science and Medicine.","ADHD is 'an economic and cultural plague than a medical one'

"A senior Church of England clergyman yesterday became the first to enter into a gay  marriage – in direct defiance of the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby – plunging the Church into a fresh crisis. Canon Jeremy Pemberton tied the knot with Laurence Cunnington under new laws allowing same-sex marriages pushed through by David Cameron in the face of bitter opposition from backbench MPs and the Church. But Canon Pemberton, 58, now faces disciplinary action from the Church and could be expelled from his work as a priest because the House of Bishops has barred clergy from entering such unions, saying they undermine its traditional teaching that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. Canon Jeremy Pemberton tied the knot with Laurence Cunnington, a move that may well cause his removal from the church . Archbishop Welby defended the policy in a radio interview last week, saying that if the Church accepted gay marriage it could be ‘catastrophic’ for Christians in Africa, hundreds of whom had been killed by people who associated Christianity with homosexuality. But the Oxford-educated Canon Pemberton, a hospital chaplain from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘I love this man and I want to be married to him. 'That’s what I want. It is the same as anyone who wants to get married.’ Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, he described  the private ceremony in front of family and friends in a local hotel as ‘very joyous, very happy’. He said he had told the Bishop of Lincoln, Christopher Lowson – in whose area he works as deputy senior chaplain of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust – of his intention to marry Mr Cunnington, 51. But he refused to comment on the conversation, saying he was fully aware of the Church’s position. Asked how he expected to feel after the ceremony, he said: ‘We will feel married.’ Bishop Lowson confirmed he had told Canon Pemberton of the House of Bishops’ statement but would not say if he was planning disciplinary action. Archbishop of Canterbury,The Most Rev Justin Welby, who is now under immense pressure from members of the church . Canon Pemberton, a former parish priest and a divorced father of five, held his wedding under new laws that came into force last month giving gay couples the same rights to marriages as heterosexuals. Gay clergy can already enter into civil partnerships if they promise to remain celibate, but these are primarily legal arrangements while marriages include public vows. Under guideline from bishops published in February, clergy are not only barred from gay marriages but they cannot conduct them for others or bless such unions in church. The House of Bishops’ Pastoral Guidance on Same-Sex Marriage admitted there were disagreements even among the bishops, but said: ‘We are all in agreement that the Christian understanding and doctrine of marriage as a lifelong union between one man and one woman remains unchanged.’ The guidance, signed by Archbishop Welby and his counterpart in York, John Sentamu, said the House of Bishops ‘considers it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church’s teaching in their lives’. The bishops will now come under huge pressure to crack down on Canon Pemberton, especially as there are other clergy lining up to enter into gay marriages. One senior traditionalist cleric in the Church’s General Synod said: ‘This will become  a crisis if no action is taken. ‘People are looking to the Church to enforce its teachings and discipline. The clergy have taken vows of obedience in  public and they ought to live by that. Canon Pemberton should be stripped of his right to function as a clergyman. ‘This is a test of the authority of the bishops and a critical test for Archbishop Welby.’ But one leading liberal cleric said: ‘This is wonderful. I congratulate the couple and hope the Church will accept gay  marriage very soon.’","Canon Jeremy Pemberton married Laurence Cunnington under new laws .

"The British nurse who survived Ebola has criticised the international response to the crisis as being 'woefully slow', after returning to help treat victims in Sierra Leone. The 29-year-old, from Eyke, Suffolk, said arriving back to the country where he contracted the deadly disease, he was left shocked at 'seeing so many dead people'. He returned to West Africa last month, and is treating patients in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone - one of the three countries worst hit by the epidemic. The outbreak has killed almost 5,200 people, almost all in West Africa, according to the World Health Organisation. WHO experts said yesterday they hope the numbers of cases will start falling sharply in the new year as they stressed the need to develop new diagnostic tests to identify the disease in the later stages of the outbreak. Scroll down for videos . British nurse Will Pooley, 29, from Eyke in Suffolk has criticised the international response to the Ebola crisis as 'woefully slow', after he returned to Sierra Leone to help treat victims after recovering from the disease . Pierre Formenty, said: 'We are looking at where we will be in four to six months from now when the cases (could) decrease sharply and we will try to find the very last cases.' 'We're not saying it's over,' he stressed, but added that the WHO hopes that by March the three countries worst hit by this outbreak - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - will be seeing between five and 10 cases a week. But four months into the crisis in Sierra Leone the number of cases are still rising. Mr Pooley said vast numbers of people, including young children are dying because of the 'slow' response by European nations and the U.S. The nurse, who described seeing between eight to 10 corpses a day, said: 'The response has been woefully slow. 'People don't have any appreciation of the numbers of people, little kids that are dying. 'Because people are being too slow back in Europe and the States and elsewhere.' He is working at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown, run by British-based King's Sierra Leone Partnership. The 18-bed Ebola isolation ward is full, meaning one victim has to recover or pass away from the disease before another person can be helped. A screening tent in the hospital grounds holds those people medics suspect are infected. Currently Mr Pooley said there are four people waiting to for treatment inside the tent, some will likely perish there. 'We've got one bed at the moment and there's four suspects in the tent,' he said. The BBC reported all four patients appear terrified. Mr Pooley said vast numbers of people, including young children are dying because of the 'slow' response by European nations and the U.S. He was repatriated to the UK in August after being contracting the virus while he worked in the Kenema, in eastern Sierra Leone . He was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was given the experimental drug Zmapp. He was discharged after fully recovering on September 3 . One, a woman, lies on the floor retching. Despite her dire state, visibly reeling from the effects of the vicious disease, this woman is one of the 'lucky' ones. Mr Pooley decides she will move to inhabit the free bed on the isolation ward, while her fellow victims inside the tent will have to wait. As Christmas approaches the 29-year-old's mind is clear. While the thought of celebrating at home in Suffolk is obviously appealing, his duty is to remain on the front line where he can make a difference. 'The thought of Christmas at home is great in some ways,' he said. 'But you're not going to be able to switch off and enjoy your roast and relaxing with your family when you know what's going on here. 'When you know what you should be doing.' Mr Pooley was the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola. He was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at London's Royal Free Hospital. He received the experimental drug Zmapp, and was discharged from hospital on September 3 after making a full recovery. Last month he made the decision to return to West Africa, driven by his desire to help the people and communities at the heart of the catastrophic outbreak, the most deadly since Ebola was first discovered by scientists in 1976. In October Mr Pooley returned to Sierra Leone with the King's Sierra Leone Partnership to treat victims on an isolation ward at Freetown's Connaught Hospital . A health worker from Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team carried the corpse of a child in Freetown . Another corpse is removed from a home in Freetown. Mr Pooley said he was surprised on returning to West Africa at 'seeing so many dead bodies' Mr Pooley said: 'The real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them.' He joined the King's Health Partnership in October - a partnership between King's College London and three NHS trusts - Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley. The virus, which  emerged in a small village in Guinea last December, has ravaged the country, as well as neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. In August the WHO declared the crisis, an international emergency. A British patient is currently awaiting results of a test to establish whether he has Ebola, after arriving at a GP clinic in Hereford on Monday with diarrhoea and reporting he had recently travelled to West Africa. On Sunday, David Cameron announced plans to invest a further £1.34 million with the Wellcome Trust, in new research to fight the deadly virus. The Prime Minister pledged the new funds after securing a commitment from leading world powers at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, to 'do what is necessary to ensure the international effort can extinguish the outbreak'. The funding will support five projects run by leading British and international researchers in a bid to improve evidence and understanding of the Ebola outbreak. The UK, which has so far committed £125 million to tackling Ebola, has put pressure on other wealthy countries to do more to combat the spread of the virus.","Will Pooley returned to treat victims in Freetown, Sierra Leone in October .

"She has already moved on just two months after divorcing her husband of 23 years, Bruce Jenner. But now, Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner, 59, has been warned about the disturbing past of her new boyfriend Corey Gamble, who at 33-years-old, is young enough to be her son. Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan, 43, - who dated Corey for three years - has labelled him a 'money-hungry opportunist' and even claims he became violent after they split in 2010, in a new interview with InTouch. Scroll down for video... 'Watch out, Kris': Jenner, 59, is warned over her 33-year-old boyfriend Corey Gamble (pictured here last month) ...as he branded a 'money hungry opportunist' by his ex . 'I know Corey. He's all about power and money and will do whatever it takes to get it,' Sheree tells the publication. Corey is said to work as a road manager for Justin Bieber, and Sheree suggests that he is somewhat of a social climber. 'He sees the Kardashians as media's first family,' she says, and adds that Kris is not even his type. What she knows: Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan, 43, - who dated Corey for three years - has labelled him a 'money-hungry opportunist in a new interview with InTouch . Disturbing past: InTouch Weekly revealed this temporary protection order that Sheree was granted against Corey, after he allegedly became violent with her . 'Khloe is more his type. Kris is a little too old. But with her power and money, Kris could have been Betty White and Corey would still have hit on her!' Worryingly, InTouch have also obtained court documents that show how Sheree took out a protection order against Corey in 2010, after he allegedly 'grabbed and bruised her' after they had split. Kris recently said she felt 'so blessed' to have celebrated her 59th birthday with new boyfriend Corey. That's a bit awkward: Corey's ex claims that Kris Jenner is 'too old' for him and says her daughter Khloé Kardashian is 'more his type' She flew to Las Vegas to host a special party at 1Oak nightclub earlier this month and was thrilled to have her new toyboy and a small entourage, including her daughter Kourtney Kardashian's boyfriend Scott Disick, by her side. Asked about the gifts she received, she said: 'I'm always so blessed to have such great friends and great gifts, but you know the thing that matters to me the most as the years tick on is just being with friends and family, and being so appreciative of the life that I have. It's delicious.' Kris began dating Corey last month and he is the first person she has romanced since splitting from Bruce Jenner, 64, in October 2013 after 23 years of marriage. A fan of celebrities: Corey Gamble is said to work as a road manage for pop star Justin Bieber . Celebration: Kris and Corey pictured at her 59th birthday bash in Las Vegas earlier this month .

News earlier this month: 'What started off as a friendship has turned romantic, but it's all very new.' The couple didn't seem worried about hiding their blossoming romance as they arrived back in California following their trip and were spotted looking 'loved-up' at the airport in Van Nuys at the time. A source said: 'They looked like a loved-up couple. In the brief time they were loading up luggage, Corey put his arm around Kris and she reached out to hold his hand.' The pair are thought to have met through mutual friends at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday in Ibiza in August.","Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan, 43, dated Corey, 33, for three years .

"Recommendations: The report was put together by former civil servant Sir Joseph Pelling, pictured . Gay couples should be allowed to have their relationships blessed in church, the Church of England said yesterday. Bishops should lift their official ban on ceremonies to mark civil partnerships and the relationships of gay and lesbian churchgoers, a long-awaited CofE report said. It signalled an end to the Church’s longstanding insistence that gay relationships are sinful and less worthy than heterosexual marriage. The report, written by former civil servant Sir Joseph Pilling and a team of senior churchmen and women, may now open the way for a reversal of the CofE’s opposition to same-sex marriage and the eventual appointment of actively homosexual priests and bishops. It was published seven months after the Church first indicated it is looking at ‘accommodations’ for same-sex couples and four months after the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, told Church leaders that ‘we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality.’ Archbishop Welby said yesterday that bishops will now ‘consider the report and decide how such a process might best be shaped.’ In its key paragraph the Pilling report declared: ‘We believe there can be circumstances where a priest, with the agreement of the parish, should be free to mark the formation of a permanent same-sex relationship in a public service but should be under no obligation to do so.’ Acknowledging arguments among the report team, it added: ‘Some of us do not believe that this can be extended to same-sex marriage.’ Current CofE guidance laid down by bishops forbids priests to conduct same-sex blessing services. Nevertheless, some estimates say 200 such services a year are carried out in Anglican churches. Bishops could permit gay blessing services simply by changing their guidelines. Their first opportunity to do so will come at meetings next month and in January. The Pilling report calls for two years of ‘facilitated conversations’ on a series of ideas that will sweep away the decades of opposition to gay rights if a majority in the Church accept them. Such talks may prove ‘difficult and divisive’ a statement by Archbishop Welby admitted. It called for the talks to end the rule dating from 1991 that says gays are welcome in the pews but that clergy must not be actively homosexual. ‘The Church’s present rules impose different disciplines on clergy and laity in relations to sexually active same-sex relationships,’ the report said. ‘It will be important to reflect on the extent to which laity and clergy should continue to observe such different disciplines.’ The report suggested that reforms might go ahead through bringing in different rules for junior clergy and for bishops - rules similar to those which currently allow women priests but not women bishops. The row over gay bishops has been toxic for the Anglicans since the last Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Williams, prevented the appointment of openly gay Canon Jeffery John as a bishop in 2003. Dr John is now Dean of St Albans. Under consideration: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the Church will now consider the recommendations . In a series of calls for new thinking, the report said the Church should show ‘real repentance for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past’. However, it added: ‘No-one should be accused of homophobia solely for articulating traditional Christian teaching on same-sex relationships.’ The report suggested that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality and said no-one should teach that it does. It also warned that liberal attitudes to homosexuality in western countries can cause trouble in countries where Christians are vulnerable to attack. Congregations in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan, where homosexuality is universally condemned by Muslims, have been subjected to violence in recent years. The report said: ‘It is important, for some a matter of life and death, that the Church and church people speak with great care and attentiveness to how their words will be received, not only in their own culture but in cultures where Christians are marginalised.’ The CofE set itself against the gay rights agenda in 1987, at a time when pressure for recognition of gay relationships by Anglicans was just beginning. Its parliament, the General Synod, said then that gay sex was sinful. Last year the Church strongly opposed David Cameron’s same-sex marriage legislation, saying it would wreck traditional marriage and undermine families. The Pilling report said that there should be no formal liturgy for same-sex blessing services, but consenting priests and parishes should be allowed to work out their own form of service. It hinted strongly that full acceptance of same-sex marriage is on the way. ‘A willingness to offer public recognition and prayer for a committed same-sex relationship would, in practice, be hard to implement now for civil partnerships without also doing so for same-sex marriage,’ it said. One member of the report team, the Bishop of Birkenhead, the Right Reverend Keith Sinclair, said he was unable to accept the recommendations.","Report signals an end to Church stance that gay relationships are sinful .

"Disillusioned: Anne said she 'could not adapt' to the pace of modern life and new technology . A retired art teacher committed suicide at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland after she grew weary of the pace of modern life and how technology was changing society. The 89-year-old felt that her failing health, as well as her belief that people were becoming ‘robots’ attached to their gadgets, gave her little reason to live. The woman, who wanted to be known only as Anne, had suffered from worsening health in recent years, but was neither terminally ill nor disabled. Her . case will stoke the ongoing debate over balancing a right to die . against the dangers that vulnerable people could be exploited. Yesterday . critics warned that any relaxation in the law in Britain could lead to . increased risks for the elderly and disabled. Anne . gave an interview days before she died in which she said computers and . email had taken the humanity out of social interaction. A . keen environmentalist, she also said she worried about the impact of . overcrowding and pollution on the planet, adding that the only thing . that gave her pleasure was feeding birds in her garden in Sussex. She . described her feelings as she walked down supermarket aisles looking . for fruit and vegetables to make soup, only to be appalled by the mass . of ready meals. In the . interview, published in The Sunday Times, Anne said: ‘Why do so many . people spend their lives sitting in front of a computer or television? 'I . have never had a television, I have only had a radio ... people are . becoming more and more remote. We are becoming robots. It is this lack . of humanity. Controversial clinic: The retired art teacher committed suicide at the Dignitas clinic (pictured) in Switzerland . ‘I find myself swimming against the current, and you can’t do that. If you can’t join them, get off.’ She . said she was dismayed that ‘all the old-fashioned ways of doing things . have gone’, adding: ‘They say adapt or die. At my age, I feel  I can’t . adapt, because the new age is not an age that I grew up to understand. I . see everything as cutting corners.’ Anne was born in Kenya and never married or had children. A . former electrician with the Royal Navy, she was also a keen sportswoman . and played tennis until the age of 70. As she grew older, her health . became increasingly poor and she suffered from heart and lung disease. She described a recent 11-day stint in hospital as ‘unadulterated hell’ and lived in fear of ending up in a nursing home. She . committed suicide by taking a lethal overdose of barbiturates on March . 27, after saying: ‘I don’t want to die whimpering, but go out with a . bang.’ In her submission to . the Dignitas clinic, she wrote: ‘My daily action to feed birds in the . garden is a joy. However, my lack of strength and energy and declining . health is a life with no enviable future. ‘My life to date has been full, with so many adventures and tremendous independence.’ Her . niece Linda, 54, who also wanted to be known only by her first name, . agreed to accompany her aunt to Switzerland where they spent a few days . sightseeing before going to the clinic.

"A father who claims he and his family suffered food poisoning after eating at a curry house is facing jail after campaigning to stop other diners going there. Nick Diver-Legge, 48, became ill after a chicken tikka and salad meal at the B26 restaurant in Birmingham. He spent the following weeks determined to spread his views about the restaurant – writing a scathing online review and posting flyers warning that 'the B26 should be avoided at all costs if you value your health'. His campaign was so successful the restaurant suffered a 30 per cent fall in trade, leading the owner to contact police, who charged Diver-Legge with harassment. At Birmingham Magistrates' Court, district judge Robert Zara said the father, of Hall Green, Birmingham, had gone beyond what was 'justified'. He faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced later this month. However, he plans to appeal against his conviction. The plumber, who claims he lost thousands of pounds while off work ill, said the court's decision was a breach of his freedom of speech, adding: 'I am the innocent party.' He said he and his 18-month-old son were sick for a week and his wife Jennifer for two weeks. B26 owner Mitt Balli described the campaign as 'very upsetting' and said he had had to lay off staff as a result of the fall in takings. Guilty: Nick Diver-Legg stuck up hundreds of 'public health warning' flyers, and wrote a damning online review, a court was told . Diver-Legg, his wife and two other members of his family had gone for a meal at the restaurant last November, Andrew Crump, prosecuting, said . They had subsequently suffered from food poisoning and just over a week later the defendant went to the premises and demanded compensation. Diver-Legg also told the manager, Mitt Balli, that he was going to hold a protest barbecue outside the restaurant and invite friends and the police. Two weeks after visiting the restaurant, he posted a review on a website complaining of what had happened to him and his family. It warned readers that if they wanted to suffer from projectile vomiting and the ‘worst diarrhoea they could imagine’ then B26 was ‘ideal’. Location: He visited the B26 curry house in Birmingham to demand compensation and his campaign led to a big drop in trade for the restaurant . In addition he handed out leaflets and stuck up hundreds of flyers on a bus stop, a bank and other buildings, warning people not to eat there. Mr Crump said Diver-Legg made numerous phone calls and when he visited the restaurant refused to leave until the manager called the police. 'Basically what he has said you don’t have the right to public protest or freedom of speech. It has been really stressful. I just wanted to have a meal without it resulting in me and my family becoming seriously ill' Nick Diver-Legg . Mr Balli told the court he had felt ‘very down’ and said what had happened was ‘very upsetting’. Diver-Legg was convicted of harassment in court but said he would appeal. He said outside court: ‘Basically (the judge) has said you don’t have the right to public protest or freedom of speech. It has been really stressful. ‘I just wanted to have a meal without it resulting in me and my family becoming seriously ill. I feel it should be the restaurant that should be convicted.’ He told the court he was targeting a ‘business entity’ and not the manager. But District Judge Robert Zara said he had gone beyond what was ‘proportionate and justified’ and adjourned sentencing until September 28.","Nick Diver-Legg 'threatened protest barbecue outside'

"Stacey Mccormack suffered from Crohn's disease, which required her to take medication that suppressed her immune system . A mother died from chickenpox after medication she was taking for an unrelated health problem left her body unable to fight the infection. Stacey Mccormack was just 32 when she was struck down by the illness and rushed to hospital. Her condition became so bad that doctors were forced to place her in an induced coma, and told her family she may not make it through the night. The mother-of-one eventually passed away weeks after contracting the illness when her family made the heart-breaking decision to turn off her life support machine. It is thought she was unable to fight off the simple infection as her immune system had been left so weak due to medication to control her Crohn's disease. The long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. It’s thought to occur when the immune system mistakes bacteria normally found in healthy intestines for invading substances. It then attacks this bacteria, causing inflammation which damages the surrounding tissue. Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon. There is no cure but there are medications which keep symptoms at bay by suppressing the immune system. However the problem with suppressing the immune system is that is it is then compromised when trying to fight infections - such as chickenpox. Ms Mccormack, from Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease four years ago after continually complaining of stomach problems. But her family said she refused to let her condition rule her life. Her mother, Karen Mccormack, 57, said: 'Stacey had always suffered with pains in her stomach. 'It wasnt until she was about 28 or 29 when she was finally diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. 'She just got on with life. She suffered terribly with it, but she always had a smile on her face.' Ms Mccormack had worked as a carer with South Tyneside Council since she was 16. Her partner Graham Muirhead, with whom she had a six-year-old son, Liam, added: 'She was so helpful, she really would help anyone. It is thought Ms Mccormack (left) was unable to fight off the chickenpox infection as her immune system had been left so weak due to the medication . Ms Mccormack, with her partner Graham Muirhead and their six-year-old son Liam, died just weeks after developing the infection. Her family had to make the agonising decision to turn off her life support machine . 'Whenever anyone was in trouble, it was Stacey they would go to for help or advice. She had such a caring nature. 'But her immune system was affected by the Crohn's disease and the medication she had to take to control it.' It was in spring of this year that Ms Mccormack contracted  chicken pox. She was initially admitted to South Tyneside District Hospital and when her condition worsened was put into an induced coma. At the same time medical staff set about locating a free extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMCO) machine. This was to support her heart and lung functions and it was hoped it would improve her prognosis. Despite one being located in Leicester, her organs began to fail before it could be used. On May 11, her family made the gut-wrenching decision to turn off her life support machine. Ms Muirhead said: 'Liam has been so brave. I took him to see his mam and he held her hand and kissed it, then started talking to her as though nothing was wrong. Even though he was only five at the time. 'He has been so brave. We miss Stacey every single day but Liam really has been the one who has kept me going.'","Stacey Mccormack was suffering from debilitating Crohn's disease .

"It has baffled boffins with its metal rich core. Now, researchers say they have solved the mystery of how Mercury became the 'iron planet' - with its massive core making up 65% of its mass. They key was a giant interplanetary 'hit and run' with either Earth or Venus. New simulations show that Mercury and other unusually metal-rich objects in the solar system may be relics left behind by hit-and-run collisions in the early solar system with Earth or Venus. Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days. Unlike Earth, which as several plates of crust, Mercury has just one rigid, rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction. The small, innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet. Its iron core makes up about 65 percent of Mercury’s total mass; Earth’s core, by comparison, is just 32 percent of its mass. According to a study published online in Nature Geoscience July 6, Mercury and other unusually metal-rich objects in the solar system may be relics left behind by collisions in the early solar system that built the other planets. Mercury, the small, innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet. Its iron core makes up about 65 percent of Mercury’s total mass; Earth’s core, by comparison, is just 32 percent of its mass. Arizona State University professor Erik Asphaug said Mercury may have lost half its mantle in a grazing blow into a larger planet (proto-Venus or proto-Earth). One or more hit-and-run collisions could have potentially stripped away proto-Mercury’s mantle without an intense shock, thy say, leaving behind a mostly-iron body. Mercuryfrom the Messenger spacecraft. The bright crater just south of the center of the image is Kuiper, identified on images from the Mariner 10 mission in the 1970s. Asphaug and  Andreas Reufer of the University of Bern developed a statistical scenario for how planets merge and grow based on the common notion that Mars and Mercury are the last two relics of an original population of maybe 20 bodies that mostly accreted to form Venus and Earth. These last two planets lucked out. 'How did they luck out? Mars, by missing out on most of the action – not colliding into any larger body since its formation – and Mercury, by hitting the larger planets in a glancing blow each time, failing to accrete,' explains Asphaug. The main bodies of the solar system, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, from left in foreground, Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, from left in background. The Moon, the Earth's natural satellite, is seen at right in foreground, as the relative size of the orbits of the planets is not respected. 'It’s like landing heads two or three times in a row – lucky, but not crazy lucky. 'In fact, about one in 10 lucky.' 'The surprising result we have shown is that hit-and-run relics not only can exist in rare cases, but that survivors of repeated hit-and-run incidents can dominate the surviving population. 'That is, the average unaccreted body will have been subject to more than one hit-and-run collision,' explains Asphaug. 'We propose one or two of these hit-and-run collisions can explain Mercury’s massive metallic core and very thin rocky mantle.'According to Reufer, who performed the computer modeling for the study, 'Giant collisions put the final touches on our planets. 'Only recently have we started to understand how profound and deep those final touches can be. 'The implication of the dynamical scenario explains, at long last, where the ‘missing mantle’ of Mercury is – it’s on Venus or the Earth, the hit-and-run targets that won the sweep-up.'","Mercury, the small, innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet .

"A man who was allegedly caught speeding by a speed camera in Plano, Texas is fighting back,  basing his appeal on several constitutional arguments and even a complicated mathematical formula. In his note pleading not guilty to the ticket he received, the man, who is not identified, says he received a letter claiming he was speeding in Plano on March 20. But before he even presents his argument, he suggests that the charges be dropped 'out of respect for tax payers, and my desire that their hard earned money not be wasted in such proceedings.' In Plano, appeals of speeding violations require a court hearing. A copy of the appeal of a speed camera violation a man sent to a Plano, Texas court with some rather unique arguments .

He also cites the 5th Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. But . the man doesn't stop there. He goes on to ask for 'evidence the . prosecution may have of my involvement in the ""offense.""'

"It is a mystery dating back millennia. But apparently, the long-lost Holy Grail has finally been found - on display in a Spanish museum. The onyx chalice has been sat in the Basilica of San Isidoro in Leon, north Spain, for 1000 years - touted to visitors as a goblet belonging to 11th century Queen Urraca. The Holy Grail? There is no doubt this chalice, which once belonged to Queen Urraca of Spain, contains the onyx goblet Jesus Christ drank from at the Last Supper, two Spanish historians have claimed . On show: It has sat in the Basilica of San Isidoro in Leon, north Spain, for 1000 years and went on display when the church opened its museum in the 1950s . But in fact, there is 'no doubt' it contains the cup which touched the lips of Jesus Christ, two historians claim. In an explosive book charting three years of 'scientific research', Margarita Torres and Jose Ortiza del Rio reveal there is conclusive evidence from scrolls in Egypt that confirm their theory. The onyx vessel made between 200 BC and 100 AD, they claim, is trapped inside a bejewelled medieval chalice. According to two medieval documents written in Arabic, it was stolen from Jerusalem by Muslims, who gave it to the Christian community in Egypt. On show: The onyx chalice is in the Basilica of San Isidoro in Leon, north Spain touted as a goblet belonging to 11th century Queen Urraca . The cup was used by Jesus then centuries later gifted to Spain by Egyptian royalty as a thank you for sending aid during a famine, they claim . Margarita Torres and Jose Miguel Ortega del Rio claim Arabic manuscripts prove Christ's onyx chalice was stolen from Jerusalem by Muslims and disguised with jewels . Centuries later, in around 1050 AD, it was sent as a gift to King Fernando I of Castile to thank him for sending aid during a famine, they say. By that point, it had been concealed with opulent decorations. Gold inside, with patterns etched around . the edges, the revered ornament is covered with pearls, emeralds, amethysts and sapphires, which the Egyptian kings will have designed to honour the well-liked Fernando. It was given to Queen Urraca, daughter of Fernando I, king from 1037 to 1065 . It was housed and used in the Basilica . of San Isidoro, where it remained in storage until it was put on . display in the museum which opened in the 1950s. Ms . Torres, a history professor at the University of Leon, said: 'The only . chalice that could be considered the chalice of Christ is one which went . via Cairo to León, and this chalice did so. 'This is a very important discovery because it helps solve a big puzzle. 'We believe this could be start of a wonderful stage of research.' Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade charts one of the most famous theories: SS chief Heinrich Himmler travelled to Spain during WWII believing the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona . This is hardly the first time a church or museum has laid claim on the historical phenomenon. The Saint Mary of Valencia Cathedral houses the Valencia Chalice, a top contender for the title. Having been used as the official chalice for many popes, it is a popular theory amongst Catholics. Many believe it was taken from Jerusalem to Rome by Saint Peter before 100 AD. Saint . Lawrence, the story continues, then took it to Huesca in Spain in the . third century, where it was protected by monks from Islamic invaders, . before making its way to its current home. An . emerald chalice at Genoa was hotly tipped during the 1700s - until it, . being transported from one holding place to another, it was dropped and . restorers discovered it was merely green glass. Last year, it emerged S.S. chief Heinrich Himmler allegedly visited Spain during the war because he believed the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona. It was a failed expedition, but one that inspired the blockbuster hit Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, in which Harrison Ford treks to find the revered vessel.","Chalice belonging to Queen Urraca of Spain 'contains Christ's onyx goblet'

"The first life on Earth may have emerged in polar seas and originated from underwater 'icicles of death', according to a new report. A team of scientists suggest that rather than life beginning in warm oceans, life may have been made possible by sea ice. They argue that the formation of brinicles, which are also known as sea stalactites, may have produced the conditions necessary for first life. Scroll down for video . Life on Earth may have originated in polar seas through the formation of brinicles, pictured . The existence of brinicles was discovered in the 1960s and were not filmed until 2011 when their formation in the Antarctic Ocean was captured by the BBC's Frozen Planet team . Brinicles grow downwards in polar seas when impurities such as salt water are forced from the ice as it freezes. Scientists only discovered the existence of the sea stalactites in the 1960s and they only filmed for the first time in 2011 in a BBC documentary. Writing in the American Chemical Society journal, the scientists say brinicles may also have fostered conditions suitable for life on other planets and moons, including Jupiter's moons Ganymede and Callisto. The report 'Brinicles As A Case Of Inverse Chemical Gardens' states: 'Beyond Earth, the brinicle formation mechanism may be important in the context of planets and moons with ice-covered oceans', according to the research. Sea stalactites are formed when sinking brine is so cold it causes the seawater to freeze around it. BBC film crews recorded the natural phenomenon for the first time in the Antarctica. In the footage, featured in the BBC One programme Frozen Plant, when the stalactite hits the seabed, a web of ice spreads killing sea urchins and starfish. The so-called 'icicles of death' are formed when brine sinks from ice and freezes . It was captured using timelapse technology but camera crews said it grew so quickly it could be seen moving before their eyes. Brine falls to the seabed because it is more dense than seawater. When the seawater freezes as it comes into contact with the brinicle it is a lot more spongelike than normal ice. In the report, scientists say the effect of brinicles can be compared to a 'chemical garden'. The experiment, often performed in classrooms, results in plant growth within minutes or hours of adding solid metal salts to an aqueous solution of sodium silicate. Bruno Escribano and colleagues write that the purifying effect of the process of salt rejection from sea ice supports theories 'for a cold origin of life on our planet or elsewhere in the universe'. They write: 'The origin of life is often proposed to have occurred in a hot environment, like the one found in hydrothermal vents. 'But there is a different school of thought that presents sea ice as a promoter of the emergence of the first life. 'Brine rejection in sea ice produces all the conditions that are considered necessary for life to appear. 'As brinicles play an important role in the dynamics of brine transport through sea ice, they might also play a role in this scenario of a cold origin of life, just as hydrothermal vents do in the hot environment theories, and in both instances chemical garden processes are fundamental.' If the conditions are right, a brinicle can reach the sea bed and trap and freeze any creatures below . The existence of brinicles has only been known about since the 1960s and were not filmed until the BBC's Frozen Planet team captured them on camera in 2011. The brinicle, or sea stalactite, is formed from sea ice when brine is ejected from the freezing salt water. The hollow pipe is filled with cold, supersaline water and at first is fragile before the ice thickens and the brinicle becomes more stable. Brinicles can grow for several feet and reach to the seabed where it freezes and traps and kills creatures like sea urchins or starfish. Sea ice is porous and spongelike, as it needs to force out impurities, such as brine. As the salt is rejected, the surrounding water becomes more saline and this lowers its freezing temperatures and increases its density. Therefore, the water does not freeze to ice immediately and its higher density means it sinks, creating so-called brine channels. The colder saline water creates more ice as it reaches unfrozen seawater and grows downward.

"People in China are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voice more masculine or feminine . People in China are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voices more masculine or feminine. Voice operations are the latest in a booming cosmetic surgery market, with doctors offering the procedures reporting that demand for the surgery has risen steadily in recent years. Several clinics now offer people the surgery - which was traditionally carried out on patients undergoing a sex change. This is despite the known risk that surgery can cause loss of voice altogether, as well as pneumonia. Academics say the rising popularity of these procedures shows the pressure Chinese people are under to conform to gender stereotypes. One person who has had the surgery is Lu Xiang, 23, who endured years of being mocked for his 'girly' high pitched voice. 'For many years, my classmates and colleagues made fun of me because of my voice, calling me a sissy,'  Lu told Global Times journalists. 'I couldn't get a girlfriend either. 'Women didn't see me as a real man, and instead treated me like one of their female friends because of my girly voice.' Lu's voice did not drop during puberty and in his job as a call centre operator, he was frequently mistaken for a woman. People also assumed he was gay because of the way he spoke. So despite the potential risks of the surgery, he decided to go ahead and have an operation which would make his voice lower. It involved cutting a segment of cartilage from his larynx and injecting Botox into his vocal cords. Mr Alasdair Mace, an ENT surgeon at Charing Cross hospital in London, told MailOnline that Botox causes the vocal chords to become shorter and more loose, deepening the voice. Mr Mace carries out around two ‘voice surgeries’ a month, usually on patients undergoing a sex change, or patients with a defect in their voice through birth or injury. He said Lu's case is unusual because normally females transitioning to becoming male who are hoping for a deeper voice would be given testosterone therapy which works well to deepen their voice's pitch. Mr Alasdair Mace, an ENT surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital in London, carries out two 'voice surgeries' a month,  usually on patients undergoing a sex change, or patients with a defect in their voice through birth or injury. Here, he explains to MailOnline how a procedure to lower the pitch of the voice would work... Mr Mace said: ‘The pitch of the voice is determined by length, the thickness, and the tension of the vocal chords. ‘You can stretch the vocal chords - the thinner they become, the higher the voice will go. ‘The thicker and the more lax the vocal chords, the deeper you’ll go. ‘Botox makes the chords shorter, flatter and more floppy, deepening the voice. ‘The chords are also attached to a bit of horse-shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage. ‘If you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back, this shortens, stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper.’ He added that the Botox injection is usually temporary. ‘It’s a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal chords because it’ll wear off. So they keep having to come back.' He added that the procedure carries well-known risks. He said: ‘If you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you’ll lose your voice. ‘The reason we have vocal cords is originally to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way. ‘There’s a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them. 'People having the procedure would have to know about the risks: losing the voice, the chest infections.’ Lu underwent a surgical procedure presumably because he was already male and so testosterone therapy would not be appropriate.. He explained how the procedure works: ‘The vocal chords are  attached to a bit of horse-shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage. ‘If you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back, this shortens, stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper.’ ‘Injecting Botox makes the chords shorter, flatter and more floppy, deepening the voice. However, he added that the Botox injection is usually temporary. ‘Botox paralyses muscles. You use it for wrinkles; It only works for three to six months. Which is why people have to keep going back for more. 'It’s a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal cords because it’ll wear off. So they keep having to come back for more injections.' Patients risk losing their voice temporarily, and catching chest infections, he added. He said: ‘If you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you’ll lose your voice. ‘The reason we have vocal cords originally is to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way. Even animals who don't speak have vocal chords for this purpose. ‘There’s a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them. People having the procedure would have to know about the risks: losing the voice, the chest infections.’ One Chinese doctor says he has performed more than 200 vocal surgeries over the last four years. Huang Yideng, a doctor from The Chinese People's Liberation Army 118 Hospital, said most people who came to him for surgery were men like Lu with a high-pitched voice but wanted to sound more 'manly'. Women with low-pitched voices who wanted to sound more 'girly' also opted for the procedure. One manager at a centre that carries out the operations said demand for the surgery from China has risen in recent years. Zhou Meiling, a manager of the Yeson Voice Center in South Korea, said four years ago about 20 Chinese clients came to the clinic each year. Last year, around 100 Chinese patients visited, she said. Scroll down for video . One 23-year-old man had a procedure which involved cutting a segment of cartilage from his larynx and injecting Botox into his vocal cords. He wanted to sound deeper after years of his 'girly' voice being mocked . Many were seeking to improve their competitiveness in the job market. Different procedures exist, but one option is to place titanium plates between the throat muscles, causing the vocal chord to stretch, raising the pitch, the Telegraph reports. An incision can be made in the vocal chord, or part of it can be burnt away with a laser. This causes scarring which stiffens the chord, making the pitch higher. Many might dismiss such cosmetic surgery as a symptom of vanity, but some academics blame rigid Chinese gender roles. 'Gender is performed, in the sense that men are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of masculinity, and women are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of femininity,' Chen Yaya, of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. People who already have normal voices, but still seek vocal surgery are doing so out of pressure to conform more fully to gender stereotypes, she said. She added: 'Our society needs to be more inclusive of differences within genders, so that people with unconventional voices or other characteristics that don't conform to their gender stereotype won't be pressured into the pain of surgery.'","Chinese people undergoing surgery to make voices masculine or feminine .

"Labour's pensions spokesman was branded 'out of touch' today after admitting she did not know how much the state pension was worth. Rachel Reeves blundered during a live radio interview, when she insisted that 'of course' the payment was worth 'just under £100-a-week'. When the shadow work and pensions secretary was told the true sum is actually £113.10, she tried to insist it depended how long people had been working for. Wrong-footed: Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves was put on the spot during an interview on LBC with presenter Nick Ferrari . It is an occupational hazard for politicians to be put on the spot about the cost of everyday items – pints of milk, loaves of bread and the weekly shop have caught out David Cameron and Ed Miliband in the past. But voters could expect Miss Reeves to know how much pensioners will receive each week from the state, as she draws up Labour's reforms to how people save for retirement. Appearing on LBC radio, live from the Labour conference in Manchester, Miss reeves was asked how much the state pension is currently worth. Host Nick Ferrari said: 'How much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person? What do they pull in a week now?' Miss Reeves' blunder at the party conference in Manchester today is a setback for one of Labour's strongest media performers . Miss Reeves replied: 'It's just under £100 a week, the basic state pension, of course. Mr Ferrari asked 'Is it?' and she again insisted 'yes'. But pressed again, Miss Reeves modified her answer to 'around £100 a week, of course', before Mr Ferrari put her right and stated it is worth £113. 'So you don't actually know what the pension is?' the broadcaster declared. Forced on to the back foot, Miss Reeves added: 'It depends how many years you're contributed.' However, the gaffe was ridiculed by the government, accusing Labour of not being on top of the detail of pensions policy. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb told MailOnline: 'Sometimes when Labour criticised us on pensions, you wonder if they fully grasp how things work. 'For a shadow pensions minister not to know the value of the state pension suggests it is actually the opposition who are out of touch with our pensioners.' Embarrassingly, Miss Reeves' error came less than 24 hours after she accused the government of overseeing an 'utter shambles'. In her speech to the Labour conference, she claimed Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is a man 'with his own special Midas touch - everything he touches turns to a complete and utter shambles'. Ms Reeves said the flagship reform universal credit was 'stuck in first gear', while work capability assessments were 'in meltdown' and the youth contract was an 'embarrassing flop'. She said: 'It would be comical if it wasn't so criminal. We should be angry that taxpayers' money is being squandered. 'That vulnerable people are being ill-treated. That lives are being scarred. That talent is being wasted. 'We should be angry - and they should be ashamed. 'The Tories will leave a truly toxic legacy. And for all their talk about cutting welfare, they've overspent on social security by £13 billion in this Parliament with a rising in-work benefits bill left for the next government.' Rachel Reeves used her conference speech to accuse the government of an 'utter shambles' During an interview on LBC radio, breakfast show host Nick Ferrari asked what seemed like an easy question for Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary. But her answer suggested she is not on top of the detail of her brief, as this transcript shows: . Ferrari: How much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person? What do they pull in a week now? Reeves: It’s just under £100 a week, the basic state pension, of course. Ferrari: Is it? Reeves: Yes. Ferrari: The basic state pension is just under £100? Reeves: It’s around £100 a week. Of course… . Ferrari: I thought it was £113. Reeves: It’s around £100. If you… . Ferrari: So you don’t actually know what the pension is? Reeves: It depends how many years you’re contributed. Ferrari: Right. Ferrari: I’m told the pension figure is £113.10, do you recognise that figure? Reeves: It does depend, Nick, on how many years… . Ferrari: Well you’ve just said it’s under £100. It can’t be under £100. Reeves: Well it depends on how many years you’ve contributed.","Senior frontbencher put on the spot about her brief during LBC interview .

"The use of well-known brand names in school tests has led to accusations that education boards are making product placement deals. Nike, Barbie and iPod were among the more famous brands to have appeared in a recent New York Common Core standardized English test taken by more than a million students in grades three to eight. Other brands included Life Savers and Mug Root Beer. Outraged parents have demanded an explanation for why specific brand names were used in the tests - with some suggesting they've become little more than just another way of advertising to young children. But New York state education officials and the test publisher insist the brand references were not paid product placement and just happened to be contained in previously published passages selected for the tests. Little more than an advert: The use of specific brand names in a New York Common Core standardized English test has been criticized by parents and pupils . In one test scenario, a busboy has to clean up some spilled root beer. But rather than just saying 'root beer', the exam used the specific brand name 'Mug Root Beer' Some critics claim the use of brand names for whatever reason is still commercializing exams. Josh Golin, associate director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said: 'It just seems so unnecessary. It would be horrible if they were getting paid for it. But even if they're not, it's taking something that should not be a commercial experience and commercializing it.' The test questions have not been made public and teachers have been barred from discussing them. But some have still posted complaints about the tests anonymously on education blogs. They said many students were confused by the brand names, which were also accompanied by trademark symbols. One mother Deborah Poppe, from West Hempstead, Long Island, claimed her eighth-grade son complained to her about named brands in the test. Big list: Barbie, iPod and Life Savers were also named in the test which was taken by more than a million children this month . In one question a busboy failed to clean some spilled root beer — Mug Root Beer, to be exact, a registered trademark of PepsiCo. She said her son asked: 'Why are they trying to sell me something during the test?', adding: 'He's bright enough to realize that it was almost like a commercial.' Others claimed Nike appeared in a question about being a risk taker and included the line: '""Just Do It"" is a registered trademark of Nike'. Sam Pirozzolo, from Staten Island, whose fifth-grader encountered the Nike question, said there was apparently no reason for such a specific brand. 'I'm sure they could have used a historical figure who took risks and invented things. I'm sure they could have found something other than Nike to express their point.' The use of brand names was one of several complaints raised by some educators and parents about the statewide tests, aligned to the Common Core standards intended to increase academic rigor. Some contend they are too difficult and don't measure what students are actually learning. While such general complaints about Common Core tests have arisen elsewhere, advocates said the prevalence of brand names appears to be specific to New York. Representatives of the New York State Education Department and Pearson, the education publishing giant with a $32 million five-year contract to develop New York's tests, said the companies did not pay for the exposure. 'There are no product placement deals between us, Pearson or anyone else,' said Tom Dunn, an Education Department spokesman. 'No deals. No money. We use authentic texts. If the author chose to use a brand name in the original, we don't edit.' Pearson spokesman Stacy Skelly said neither the company nor the education department received any compensation for the mentions. And if any brand comes up in a passage, she said, 'the trademark symbol is included in order to follow rights and permission laws and procedures'. Nike and Wrigley, the maker of Life . Savers, said they were unaware they were mentioned on the tests. Other . companies declined to comment or did not return messages. Branding: Nike also appeared in one exam question about taking risks. The company said it had no knowledge its name was being used in the test . Education officials said brand names such as iPod, pictured, were only used if they appeared in previously published pages selected for the tests . Some advertising experts said the idea of product placement on a test is inappropriate and fraught with peril. 'If any brand did try to place there, what they would lose from the outrage would surely trump any exposure they got,' said Michal Ann Strahilevitz, a marketing professor at Golden Gate University. Kelly O'Keefe, a marketing professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said he is a fan of brands but there are places where they don't belong. 'Education, religion and civic life are places where brands are unwelcome,' O'Keefe said. 'It would be wise for Pearson to avoid using brands in their testing even if they're not paid for by the brand itself.' Others endorsed the position of New York state educators — that brand names belong on the tests because they are part of the world students inhabit. 'Brands are part of our lives,' said Allen Adamson, managing director of the New York brand consulting firm Landor Associates. 'To say they don't belong in academia is unrealistic.'","Brand names appeared in a New York Common Core standardized test .

"Cambridgeshire County Councillor Gordon Gillick  faces complaints for his comments to three children who had been in care . A UKIP councillor faces an investigation after asking children in care how it felt ‘to be takers from the system’. A dozen complaints have been lodged against Gordon Gillick who also demanded to know when the children would ‘give back to society’. The 74-year-old Cambridgeshire County Councillor left other councillors stunned with his remarks, but his wife insisted he was 'challenging them' like US President John F Kennedy with his famous 'Ask not what your country can do for you' speech. Mr Gillick was among several councillors invited to a briefing on their responsibilities as ‘corporate parents’ to protect children from abuse. Three youngsters had made a film about their experiences in foster homes, and were explaining it to the councillors when Mr Gillick interrupted. He asked: ‘How does it feel to be takers from the system?’ He reportedly also asked the youngsters when they would ‘start giving back to society’ before walking out of the session. Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors have all submitted complaints about the incident. A spokesman for Cambridgeshire County Council said: ‘The council has received 12 complaints against Cllr Gillick and these are now being looked at. ‘It would be inappropriate for the council to comment further.’ The incident is the latest embarrassment for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, which has been dogged by the outspoken remarks of its elected representatives, many of whom were only elected in May's local elections. Conservative councillor Steve Criswell, who was at the meeting, said: ‘His comments were demeaning and totally unwarranted and he should be ashamed of himself. ‘The three young people were fine examples of how we make a difference helping them overcome adversity.’ The comments are the latest embarrassment for UKIP Leader Nigel Farage, who saw the party win 147 councillors in May . Gordon Gillick was not even supposed to be a councillor. He was elected to Cambridgeshire County Council in May, despite not making any calls or issuing a single leaflet. ‘I just put my name down and that was that. I didn’t even ring anyone up,’ he said at the time. His . election in the Wisbech ward was among 147 UKIP candidates elected in . the local elections as the party enjoyed a major surge in the polls. The former teacher is now a theatre designer and restoration painter. The . 73-year-old is married to Victoria Gillick, a well-known campaigner who . fought for doctors to be banned from giving contraception to under-16s . without parental consent. They have 10 children, including twin sons James, an artist, and Theodore, a sculptor. Lib Dem leader Cllr Maurice Leeke added: ‘To be saying these people are, through no fault of their own, takers from the system, would be totally the opposite of what we should be doing. ‘Our role should be supporting them to become worthwhile adults, not rubbishing the situation they find themselves in.’ However, Mr Gillick has received the backing of UKIP, which is the third largest group on the authority. Group leader Peter Reeve said: ‘As long as he’s being honest and transparent and saying what he believes, I’ve no problem with that. ‘It may or may not be that I agree with him or that people find his views offensive, but I would rather a councillor is honest than cover up their beliefs because they are worried about it not being politically correct.’ Mr Gillick, a former teacher, artist and theatre designer, was unable to comment on the case. But his wife Victoria told MailOnline: ‘He is very, very popular with young people. He has 15 teenage grandchildren. ‘None of the county councillors have ever been inside a classroom. Their understanding of how you talk to 17 and 18-year-olds is you patronise them. ‘The tendency is to regard looked-after children as somehow retarded when in fact that is not the case. ‘His approach is to challenge them. He was doing a JFK: “Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country”. ‘He was asking them: have you thought of working and doing things for other people? For young people that’s an open challenge which starts a discussion.’","A dozen complaints made against Gordon Gillick after meeting .

"John Prescott has dismissed shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna as 'Chumbawamba' at a Labour Party conference event. Lord Prescott made the baffling remark after being asked what he thought about modern Labour politicians, and the speeches they make. For reasons known only to the former Deputy Prime Minister, he likened Mr Umunna to the anarchic 1990s band who famously poured a bucket of ice cold water over him at the Brit Awards. Scroll down for video . Former deputy prime minister John Prescott has dismissed the speeches of shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, declaring: 'I keep making a mistake of calling him Chumbawamba so I get into all sorts of bloody trouble' Lord Prescott's appearances at Labour conferences were once seen as a highlight of the annual party gathering. His tub-thumping address closing the gathering was not to be missed. But in recent months his interventions have become increasingly difficult to fathom, and have left the Labour leadership baffled and frustrated. Last night the 76-year-old was appearing on stage at the Comedy Store in Manchester, being interviewed by comedian and former Labour adviser Matt Forde. Forde asked: 'Do you find it difficult? ... When you are watching people do speeches, like ... Chuka Umunna?' Lord Prescott added: 'I keep making a mistake of calling him Chumbawamba so I get into all sorts of bloody trouble. 'Water's in fashion and it certainly was when I went to whatever it was and chucked it over me. 'It's a new voice, he actually expresses the details, he's an intelligent guy putting across the case. 'But he does sound a bit quiet doesn't he? You don't walk away saying, 'Christ, we're now on the way'. ''You've got to do somehow do that, and that's when the raucous and passion... passion is still an important part of politics. 'Where are the awkward buggers going to come from? Those awkward buggers have had experience.' The Labour grandee was drenched by Chumbawamba frontman Danbert Nobacon at the 1998 Brit Awards when he poured a bucket of ice cold water on him. Lord Prescott was famously drenched by Chumbawamba frontman Danbert Nobacon at the 1998 Brit Awards . When the group announced their split in 2012, Lord Prescott took to Twitter to express his delight. He wrote 'Chumbawho?' and said he would mark the moment by going to buy their greatest hits album. Last night's wide-ranging interview also covered topics like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the threat of Islamic State and the infamous punch in 2001 when he lashed out after being hit in the face with an egg. But it is the latest in a growing list of bizarre interventions from Lord Prescott. Yesterday he tried to criticise the government's welfare reforms, including Labour's attack on the so-called bedroom tax. But he instead declared: 'We will repeal the breakfast tax.' And earlier this month he turned up to a campaign speech in Scotland with the name of the cross-party campaign against independence scrawled on the back of his hand. On a campaign visit to Scotland this month, Lord Prescott appeared to have been given instructions not to forget to mention the cross-party Better Together - with reminders on his notes and even the back of his left hand . The Labour bruiser was supposed to take the fight to the SNP in defence of the 300-year-old Union, but instead launched a bizarre attack on the Tories, told a story about buying whiskey at an airport and boasted of being Welsh. The former Deputy Prime Minister also set out a bizarre idea to merge the English and Scottish football teams to 'beat the Germans'. Oddly, the more eccentric elements of the speech appeared to have been planned in advance, with numbered notes written in thick black pen on a series of white cards. He told a large crowd of supporters: 'Here's a revolutionary thought for you, perhaps if England and Scotland together had one team we could at last beat the Germans.' He also suggested Labour voters were not clever enough to understand the arguments about independence, leading one senior party source to brand him a 'f****** moron'. Mr Umunna has come up against other Labour big beasts in recent weeks. Yesterday MailOnline revealed Gordon Brown gave the Labour rising star the 'hairdryer treatment' in a blistering phone call after the shadow business secretary publicly blamed him for Labour's struggles on the economy. Mr Brown attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former Labour leader's failure to confront Britain's ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election. Mr Umunna said Mr Brown's refusal to even talk about Government 'cuts' was still costing Labour support, because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit. Labour are currently 25 points behind the Tories on which party is best for the economy.","Former Deputy Prime Minister ridicules shadow business secretary .

"A court today upheld a three-month suspended prison sentence against Jean-Marie Le Pen after he described the Nazi occupation of France as ‘not especially inhumane'. The court decision could not have come at a worse time for the notorious politician, as his daughter is hoping to run for French president in the Spring. Marine Le Pen took over the leadership of the far right National Front (FN) last year, modernising its image and trying to underplay its connections with racism and anti-Semitism. Controversial: A court today upheld a three-month suspended prison sentence against Jean-Marie Le Pen, pictured with his daughter Marine yesterday, after he described the Nazi occupation of France as 'not especially inhumane' Today, the Paris Appeals Court confirmed Mr Le Pen’s sentence, which also included a 10,000 euro fine. In 2005, Mr Le Pen had told Rivarol magazine that ‘in France, at least, the German Occupation was not especially inhumane, even if there were a few excesses - inevitable in a country of 550,000 square kilometres.’ In fact, thousands died after imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Nazis, including some 70,000 Jews who were deported from cities like Paris to concentration camps. Mr Le Pen, who has previous convictions for Holocaust denial, was not present for the court ruling. In 2002, Mr Le Pen, a former French paratrooper, sent shockwaves around Europe after coming second in the presidential election to Jacques Chirac. Last year, he handed over control of the FN to his daughter, and she is currently running third in the polls, with around 20 per cent of the vote. She needs to get the backing of at least 500 mayors across France to confirm her candidacy and appears on course to do so. Close: Mr Le Pen's conviction is bad timing for Marine, who took over the leadership of the National Front last year, modernising its image and trying to underplay its connections with racism and anti-Semitism . Mr Le Pen founded the FN in 1972 and has since been convicted of racism or anti-Semitism on a number of occasions. In 1987 he described the Nazi gas chambers as ‘a detail of history’, and has always been a vehement opponent of allowing foreigners into France. Ms Le Pen has maintained her father's anti-immigration policies, and is particularly critical of concessions being made to France’s sizeable Muslim community. However, she has rejected most of his anti-Semitism, and believes that the FN now represents working-class fears about Europe and globalisation. She remains extremely close to her 83-year-old father, who is expected to campaign for her before the April/May two round-election.","Former leader of far-right National Front made comments in 2005 magazine interview .

"A fraudster who claimed to be Scottish nobility has pleaded guilty to welfare fraud while living a life of luxury in a lakefront mansion with millions of dollars stashed in the bank. 'Lord' Colin Chisholm III is facing 21 months in jail after admitting that he claimed thousands of dollars in benefits in Minnesota while owning a $1.2million yacht in Florida. The 62-year-old appeared in court on Monday to plead guilty to one count of wrongfully obtaining public assistance and one count of theft by swindle over $35,000, according to the Hennepin County attorney's office. Colin Chisholm III (pictured at court in April) is facing 21 months in jail after admitting that he claimed thousands of dollars in benefits in Minnesota while living in a mansion and owning a million-dollar yacht . 'Lord' Chisholm, pictured with his wife 'Lady' Andrea Chisholm and their son, kept quiet about their profitable business breeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniels while claiming welfare . In court on Monday, Chisholm said he had filled out forms which allowed him and wife Andrea to siphon off benefits they were not entitled to. Colin Chisholm told the court: 'I received benefits from Hennepin County I really wasn’t entitled to. I’m taking full responsibility for that.' Along with his 52-year-old wife Andrea, Colin Chisholm allegedly received $167,000 in Medicaid and food stamps - although he disputes this amount. The couple have also been ordered to pay restitution which will be decided at a later hearing. The phony aristocrat is due to be sentenced in January and prosecutors hope to send him away for 21 months. Prosecutors claimed the Chisholms ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bedroom palatial home on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, a $1.2 million yacht, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds. Because Chisholm admitted to 'major economic crimes', it allowed the attorney's office to seek prison time. In a statement, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said: 'Too often, people think that only poor people commit crimes. We know that is not true and the Chisholms are a perfect example. 'What they did was abominable, stealing from the government and the taxpayers while living a luxurious lifestyle. That’s why we pushed for a tougher sentence than the probation he normally would have received.' Andrea Chisholm pleaded guilty to wrongfully obtaining welfare in August and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, with credit for 142 days already served. ‘It’s appropriate that Andrea Chisholm spend time behind bars for cheating the public of welfare dollars,’ Freeman said at the time. Andrea and Colin Chisholm III, who claimed to be descended from Scottish nobility, appear in court together in April after being caught out in a massive welfare fraud . Large-scale fraud: The so-called 'Lady Chisholm' and her husband, Colin Chisholm III (right), 62, reportedly collected more than $167,000 in fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims for seven years . Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland . The family’s web of lies began unraveling, according to officials, as investigators tightened the net around them earlier this year, forcing the couple to flee to the Bahamas along with their seven-year-old son and their dog. According to a criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps, first in Minnesota and then in Florida. Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute. Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a broadcasting business, while Lady Chisholm kept quiet about being the owner of a dog kennel which bred elite Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Mr Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Caribbean. More than $1million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, a criminal complaint stated. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. Living the dream: The couple moved into this sprawling lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 . Lap of luxury: The seemingly destitute couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus . However, for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claimed. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis Heidecker died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

"Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb said Tuesday he is 'seriously looking' at a Democratic presidential campaign in 2016, a move that could create a challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton if she seeks the White House again. Webb said at a speech to the National Press Club that he has talked to respected advisers about a presidential bid and will continue to have those discussions during the next four or five months. 'I'm seriously looking at the possibility of running for president. But we want to see if there's a support base from people who would support the programs that we're interested in pursuing,' he said. Speaking at the National Press Club, Webb told reporters that he's gauging the 'support base' for his policy priorities and that he will decide on a run 'in a few months' Former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb said he's 'seriously looking at the possibility of running for president' Webb, 68, is a veteran of the Vietnam War who served as assistant secretary of defense and Navy secretary during the Ronald Reagan administration. He defeated Republican George Allen in his 2006 Senate campaign and served one term. Clinton is the leading Democratic contender for president if she seeks the White House again but Democrats expect her to face a primary challenge. In addition to Webb, the field could include Vice President Joe Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and others. Webb said Tuesday that U.S. foreign policy has been 'adrift' since the end of the Cold War and the nation's debate over domestic policy has become increasingly polarized. 'Not surprisingly the American people have grown ever more cynical about their national leadership in both parties and increasingly pessimistic about the future,' he said. Webb has made campaign appearances in Iowa on behalf of Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate, and state Sen. Jack Hatch, who is challenging Republican Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad.

"A former Navy SEAL who was nearly hit by a car in parking lot then shot by its driver chased his assailant before driving himself to a police station to seek treatment. In a sequence straight from an action movie, 44-year-old Christopher Mark Heben only sought help after realizing he was bleeding profusely after being shot in broad daylight in Akron, Ohio on Friday. He is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery and authorities are searching for his attackers. The former SEAL, who has served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, was walking to the Mustard Seed Market & Cafe at 5.30pm on Friday when he was almost struck by a car backing up. On the mend: Christopher Mark Heben, 44, shared this photograph of him in hospital after he was shot in a parking lot in Akron, Ohio on Friday after exchanging words with a driver who nearly hit him . Feeling good: Heben, a former SEAL, had a bullet removed from his abdomen, which was then stapled, right . The occupants of the car started shouting profanities at him, police said, NewsNet5 reported. He continued to the cafe - before turning back to his car after realizing he had left his wallet behind. As he walked across the parking lot, the vehicle pulled alongside him again and Heben realized he had been shot, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely told the Akron Beacon Journal. He then jumped into his car and followed the vehicle - a gray sports car with tinted windows - as it drove north and headed to Interstate 77, McNeely said. But realizing he was covered in blood, Heben drove himself to the Bath Township Police and Fire Department to seek treatment. Minor incident: Heben, who has served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Africa and Pakistan, initially followed his attacker after he was shot but eventually drove to a police department to seek treatment . Inspiration: Since returning from service, Heben has worked as a special operations expert on TV and radio . 'He indicated to us he actually plugged . the hole in his abdomen to stop the bleeding as he drove to the . station,' McNeely told NewsNet5. He was hospitalized at Akron General Medical Center, where a 'brass projectile' was removed from his abdomen and then the wound was stapled shut. Authorities are still hunting for the suspect or suspects and are reviewing numerous videos from local businesses to look for further information. The police chief added to the Beacon Journal that publicity about the incident had already generated good leads. Heben has been updating his Facebook group with information about his recovery. Not to be messed with: He plugged his own wound as he drove to the police department for help . Expert: Heben has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows . 'I've been up walking around, . yesterday and again this morning,' he wrote on Sunday, two days after . the shooting. 'The nurses are telling me to ""take it slow"".....YEAH . RIGHT! 'The best thing for me to do is to keep my spirits up and to just keep moving! Onward and upward!' He has also uploaded pictures to the Facebook page, which has more than 16,000 likes, showing his medication and of his abdomen covered with a large bandage. According to online bios, Heben, a father, served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan and since returning, he has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows. He has appeared on shows that have aired on the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Scene: He was shot in this parking lot in Akron, Ohio after arguing with a driver that backed up into him . His website adds . that he is the founder of INVICTVS Group, a special operations . consortium, and holds a master's degree in physician assistant studies, . specializing in sports medicine and emergency medicine. He is also a public speaker and is to release his first album, The Patriot Project, this spring. Back at the scene of the shooting, shoppers said they were impressed by Heben's quick thinking.

"An Englishman's home may be his castle but this American's home genuinely is a fortress. Brent Snr began constructing his own castle deep in the Appalachian Mountains of Carolina back in 1999 to protect his family from marauding hordes. The father-of-ten believes that one day there will be a massive electromagnetic pulse, caused by either a solar flare or nuclear explosion, which will be so devastating it will shut down power across the world and throw society back hundreds of years to the Dark Ages. Scroll down for video . Domesday: Brent Snr with five of his children who appear in the show about his quest to build a castle . Work in progress: The show follows the development of the castle . Protection: Brent Snr believes the castle will protect them if civilisation is on the brink of collapse . Called Doomsday Castle, he and five of his children are now the subject of a new real life documentary series from the National Geographic Channel. The show follows Brent Snr and five of his children as he puts the finishing touches to his fortress, which comes complete with a drawbridge, portcullis, battlements a giant catapult and a battering ram, in case they ever come under siege. None of the family divulge their surnames and the castle's precise location is being kept a closely guarded secret. Brent Snr told the show, which first aired on Tuesday, that in 1859 a solar flare wiped out the world's telegraph system. He said: 'If that solar flare were to happen today it would destroy not only the US, but the world, and would put us back to the Dark Ages. 'That's a natural disaster that we've got no control over.' In an interview with LiveScience he further elaborated on his theory which he says came to him amid the Y2K furore. Building: All six family members lend a hand . Family affair: Brent Sr and five of his children - three daughters including Dawn Marie, left, and Ashley, right, take part in the project . Fortress: The series follows the family as they fulfill their dad's dream to build a doomsday castle . Bonding: The shows reveal how the family come together in their common purpose . 'I was worried the computers that control everything, from natural gas to electricity, would go down. When they didn't, I cooled off for a couple years because I didn't want people to think I was crazy, but then got back into it,' he said. 'A man with 10 kids has a godly obligation to take care of his children, and I've set up a 100-year trust so the castle can't be sold. Each kid will get the castle for five weeks every year.' As the castle's imposing architect, the former army infantry training officer cuts a scary sight in full combat gear, however, he insists his project is about caring rather than anything violent. Responding to skepticism around his theory, the father-of-10 adds: 'It's a real possibility. Nuclear explosions can create EMPs — if one was detonated in the high atmosphere, it could knock out power to one-fourth of the United States by destroying computers that run everything. Solar flares are also a risk for EMPs. 'Most people have enough food for about 10 days. If there are no trucks to replenish the food supply, though, that's a major problem. If the government isn't there to help them out, fighting and looting will eventually start — like you saw during Hurricane Katrina — and could eventually reach the countryside. 'The calmest person in the world will turn into a savage if he sees his baby crying and his children go hungry. I built the castle to defend against marauders and to have a place that could function without electricity.' His son Michael adds: 'We believe in the bible. [Armageddon] may not be in my father's time or our time but it may be in my kids time.' Hunter/gathering: Michael and the other children have been brought up to survive in the wilderness .

Building: The series follows the family as they push to get the castle completed . Family affaiir: Brent Jr says he is taking part for the sake of his father . His twin Dawn-Marie adds: 'Ever since I was little I have heard my dad talk about the castle - 'when's it going to get finished, how's it going to get finished'. He wants things to be done his way and he wants it done in a timely manner.' 'I know there's people who look at us and at my father and say 'this man's crazy' but it's the one thing he wants done before he dies and I am determined to play my part.' 'Ever since we were little my dad has put a crossbow in our hand, put a gun. I think the first time I held a gun I was probably six years old. He has taught me pretty every tool in the toolbox.' Among his feats of strength Brent can be seen felling trees the old fashioned way with nothing more than an axe. His five children have been trained in . how to use bow and arrows effectively, and in one scene the five adults . are filmed running through the woods armed with various lethal weapons, . including a hatchet. Armed: The family are trained to hunt and protect themselves . End in sight? Brent Snr has made the castle his life's work . In another scene, called The Army of Armageddon, Brent Snr plans a surprise attack on the castle, carried out by 20 of his friends, to demonstrate to how vulnerable it is.

The family panic and can be seen running through the castle like scared 'mice'. One by one they are brought down by their assailants, who also have German Shepherds with them. Two of the girls jump out of the windows, but one is quickly apprehended. Another makes it into the woods, but is later caught by a man on a quad bike. 'None of them escaped,' said Brent Snr ruefully.","Carolina family's fortress to defend themselves from future Armagaddon .

"A shocking video of university students singing sexist songs on a packed public bus has gone viral. The mobile phone footage shows male members of the University of Stirling’s hockey club drinking beer and shouting derogatory sexual and racist chants while other passengers look on. The students from the university in Scotland are filmed laughing at a joke about miscarriages and at one point even appeared to make mock Nazi salutes after a joke with a German-related punchline. Scroll down for video . The students from the university in Scotland are filmed laughing at a joke about miscarriages and at one point (above) even appeared to make mock Nazi salutes after a joke with a German-related punchline . On board: The video has been viewed around 35,000 times on YouTube after being posted on Monday . The video - filmed on November 6 as students took the 63 bus from the university into Stirling town centre - has been viewed around 35,000 times on YouTube after being posted on Monday. Women on board were clearly uncomfortable about the antics of the team - who were singing the traditional drinking song I Used to Work in Chicago - and one said: ‘This is quite scary.’ The students involved are now facing the prospect of disciplinary action from university bosses. Richard Raymond, vice-president of education at the university's student union, was on the bus and has apologised for not doing more to stop the singing. He can be seen at the start of the film walking away from the chanting group to the front of the bus. Mr Raymond also said members of the hockey team would now undergo anti-sexism training. He told student newspaper The Tab: ‘Firstly I would like to apologise for my actions, they are not acceptable and I deeply regret it. I tried to remove myself from the incident by moving to the other end of the bus. Moving away: Richard Raymond, vice-president of education at the university's student . union, can be seen at the start of the film (right, in blue jumper) walking away from the . chanting group to the front of the bus . ‘The men's hockey team will be receiving a discipline internally. We will be organising training for sports teams, which the hockey team and myself will be attending. Sorry: Student union officer Richard Raymond has apologised for not doing more to stop the singing . ‘This will help start to tackle the cultural aspect of lad culture and show that it is not acceptable under any circumstances. I offer my apologies again, this is something that I am ashamed of and will have to deal with for a long time. ‘I realise that as an elected officer that even after my discipline is completed I am still accountable to the student body who have elected me into this role.’ Sean Betteridge, a student who was also on the bus, told the university's student newspaper Brig that he was embarrassed by the behaviour of the hockey players. He said: ‘I felt generally angry. There's little you can do when there's a big group of people chanting like that on a bus. Any kind of challenge just fuels it. I was happy when I noticed it being filmed though, if you're going to spout this offensive nonsense in public then you have to expect to be held accountable. ‘Whilst I'm not happy that events like this occur, I am happy with the way the video has become a talking point over night. It's a discussion which needs to be paid attention to.’ A Stirling University spokesman said: ‘The university has been made aware of the video featuring our students and is now investigating this further. We take incidents of this nature very seriously and, where appropriate, disciplinary action will be taken.’ Last year, Glasgow University was at the centre of a sexism row after accusations that a female debator from Cambridge University was heckled.

"The son of an artist at the centre of a row over a school mural featuring a golliwog last night insisted his father was ‘no racist.’ But Henry Westwater said he could understand why the image, which sparked an on-going police investigation, was controversial – and would have no objection if it was replaced. It was reported yesterday that a complaint about the 1930s painting - by RH Westwater - had been logged by Police Scotland as a ‘hate incident’. The mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels, features a golliwog . Visiting parent Margaret Rocha, 43, who is herself black, made an official complaint after touring Wardie Primary School in north Edinburgh with her son who was at that time a prospective pupil. The image is contained in a mural, based on Alice in Wonderland, which was lovingly restored two years ago and now takes pride of place in the school’s assembly hall. Last night Henry Westwater, 74, of Tain, Inverness-shire, said golliwogs had once been common, though he could understand why the image had proved offensive. But he suggested treating the situation as a ‘hate incident’ may be a flawed approach and said that while he would not want part of the mural to be ‘hacked out’, he could understand why some would want the golliwog image to be removed. Mr Westwater said: ‘It was painted in 1936, when people’s perception of things was somewhat different. ‘I remember that I had a golliwog when I was a small boy; many children did. They used to be popular.  For this woman, her response to that image was obviously compelling and overwhelming. ‘I saw photographs of the mural when it was restored, and I dug out my copy of Alice in Wonderland. ‘My neighbour, for some reason, had collected 12 copies of Alice in Wonderland in different editions, and of course there was no golliwog in any of them. Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons . ‘It may be he felt the fantasy element of the story gave him some licence to create a new character.‘But my father didn’t have any views at all on other races, and he was certainly no racist.’ He added: ‘I can see why it could be a bit offensive – I didn’t give our children or grandchildren golliwogs. ‘This woman has every right to complain.  But this painting is from another time. ‘I would not wish to criticise the police, as I understand the legislation is framed in such a way that they are obliged to investigate complaints and I wouldn’t want to presume to lecture the council’s education department. ‘But for a “hate incident”, there has to be a “hater” - and that seems to be something missing from this case - while the artist [who died in 1962] is long-dead.’ Scottish artist Robert Heriot Westwater, who painted a mural depicting Alice In Wonderland at Wardie Primary School in Edinburgh in the 1930s . He added: ‘I wouldn’t like the mural to have a bit of it hacked out, but if someone feels strongly enough that it should be painted out, and replaced with something else, that would be okay.’ Fife-born Robert Heriot Westwater, who was born in 1905, was responsible for well-known portraits of poet Hugh MacDiarmid and Sir Compton Mackenzie, who wrote the comic novel Whisky Galore, later turned into a hit Ealing comedy movie. Last night Police Scotland said Mrs Rocha’s complaint was still being considered. Mrs Rocha was astonished to find the mural, which features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels. It was restored in 2011 with a £17,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). Mrs Rocha, who said she would now find a different school for her son, said she found the image ‘deeply offensive’ and struggled to believe the recent restoration had been be allowed. She said: ‘I raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and didn’t seem to think it was an issue. ‘It’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall. It’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition, where you might explain what a swastika was or Ku Klux Klan outfit. ‘It goes back to the American Black Sambo - the blacked-up face.’ In the mural, the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the Alice in Wonderland figure in the mural’s central panel. The mural and Wardie school’s distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles. Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, has contacted the school over the future of the artwork, with further discussions likely to take place later this week. Last night the City of Edinburgh Council reiterated its position – that it will not consider covering up the image. But officials have said they will now use additional teaching packs from Show Racism the Red Card campaign at the school. A council spokesman insisted the council and school took diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously.","Henry Westwater said he understands why the image was controversial .

"A New York City businessman who once brawled with Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi has been banned from the tiny seaside kingdom. Adam Hock pleaded guilty to socking Princess Grace's grandson in the jaw in the 2012 Meatpacking District dust-up, so when he arrived in Monaco via yacht in May he thought everything was on the up and up. Hock soon learned he was wrong. Prince Albert himself, still sore from the 'Battle Royale' embarrassment, ordered the financier to stay out of the country just after he'd arrived. Royal pain: New York businessman Adam Hock arrived in Monaco with friends in late May and was told that Prince Albert himself had banned him from the tiny kingdom because of his infamous 2012 dust up with Princess Grace's son--and Monaco prince--Pierre Casiraghi . Page Six said the ban immediately became the hot topic of the ritzy riviera town. 'The incident was the talk of Naomi Campbell’s birthday at the Billionaire Club in Monte Carlo, which Adam was supposed to attend, on May 23,' revealed the Page Six source. Adam reportedly arrived in Monaco from Cannes with his friend, Cirque du Soleil CEO Guy LaLiberte. Hock would not be allowed back into Monaco, 'on the orders of Prince Albert,' reports Page Six, despite the pleas his wealthy friends would make on his behalf. '[Adam’s friends] had to take his belongings off the yacht, which remained in Monaco, while Adam went on to Ibiza,' said the source. Adam Hock agreed to plead guilty to . disorderly conduct in the year-long legal saga that began at Manhattan's . Double Seven Club in 2012. When . Casiraghi and his two friends filed a lawsuit against the Double Seven . Club and Hock, both parties responded by blaming the prince and his . entourage for starting the fight in February of that year. Battle Royale: Prince Pierre Casiraghi (pictured here with Beatrice Borromeo in March) accused Hock in 2012 of drunkenly punching him in Manhattan's trendy Double Seven Club. Hock initially blamed Casiraghi and company as the aggressors but eventually pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct . In reply papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Hock claimed that Casiraghi, art dealer Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld and banker Diego Marroquin were the aggressors in the violence in a VIP area in the early hours of February 18, 2012. According to the New York Post, Hock said in the paper the three young men were helping themselves to his vodka and were jealous because they were with women the young men were interested in. He said the trio were 'visibly intoxicated' and attacked him in an 'unprovoked and unjustified assault'. The club owner was also named in the . suit, with Hock alleging that Jeffrey Jah should have been keeping a . closer eye on the prince and his friends because they have a reputation . for such 'violent, belligerent and disruptive tendencies'. The . prince's lawsuit said the club, in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, . shouldn't have served alcohol to Mr Hock, a former owner of Times Square . nightspot Hawaiian Tropic Zone, and should have known he was a fighter, . or 'a person of pugilistic propensity'. Not so elegant: Prince Pierre is the grandson of American movie star-turned-European royal Grace Kelly (right). He sued financier Adam Hock for slugging him in a drunken 2012 Meatpacking district brawl . We are not amused: Prince Albert reportedly personally banished Hock from his glitzy kingdom . Patrons who witnessed the incident . said Prince Pierre, who was quaffing $500 bottles of champagne with his . entourage, which included Paris Hilton's ex-boyfriend Stravros Niarchos, . was 'jealous' of Mr Hock because he was sitting with a woman he was . interested in. After . approaching their table, Mr Hock punched the prince and sent him flying . into a table on the other side of the room, where he landed with blood . pouring from his face. Hock was arrested and charged with four counts of assault against Casiraghi and a number of his friends. Hock initially pleaded not guilty but finally agreed to enter a guilty plea in February 2013. He . was sentenced to 12 weeks of anger management classes and 10 days . community service. Afterwards, prosecutors said they'd drop any criminal . charges from his record. Sorry/Not sorry: Hock, seen here with his arm in a sling following the February 2012 brawl, initially fought the prince's charges, but royalty trumped the American's financial heft in this case--Hock agreed to plead guilty and serve a community service sentence in 2013 .

"An Italian Trade union has been slammed by Jewish groups for offering a spoof 'Hitler Prize' to people who work with animals, who have been targeted by extremists. Feder Fauna, a union for people working commercially with animals such as breeders and farmers, named the prize because the Nazi leader created a law to protect animals while ordering human experiments. The union has called on its members to nominate those they considered 'most worthy' of receiving the award such as those who have suffered violence from animal rights activists. Crass: A poster for the Italian trade union's 'Hitler Prize', which has enraged Jewish groups . Massimiliano Filippi, general secretary of Feder Fauna, said: 'The Hitler Prize represents a condemnation of those who trample on human rights in the name of the ideology of ""animal rights""! 'I find that asking to stop experiments on rats and proposing instead experiments be done on prisoners has a close affinity to Nazism.'A poster for the prize features a . picture of Hitler feeding two deer at the entrance to the Auschwitz . concentration camp in occupied Poland where 1.3 million people were killed. After coming into power in 1933, the Nazis brought in a raft of laws to protects Animals. The first was a law banning vivisection which was enacted in August 1933, by Hermann Göring as the prime minister of Prussia. In November 1933, the Reichstierschutzgesetz (Reich Animal Protection Act) was brought in banning, among other things, the force-feeding of birds, commercial animal trapping and the docking the ears and tails off dogs without anesthesia, was also banned. Regulations were placed on the boiling of . lobsters and crabs in restaurants and in one case, Goering even sent a . fisherman to a concentration camp for cutting up a frog to use as bait. Severe restrictions were placed on hunting, and the shoeing of horses became regulated. The Nazis also established nature preserves, and introduced a . school curriculum for the humane treatment of animals. It features the slogan Animal Rights' with the word ‘rights’ replaced with ‘Reich’. However despite having an anti-Nazi message, the prize has been condemned for diminishing the suffering of those who died in the holocaust and because it could be seen to show Hitler in a positive light. Italy's only female Rabbi Barbara Aeillo told the Local that the prize 'exemplifies a disturbing trend of intolerance and hate that is on the rise not only in Italy but throughout Europe. 'Creeping Nazism is a slow but steady trend that minimizes the Holocaust, demeans the memory of those murdered and diminishes the suffering of the survivors. 'The fact that a competition like the Hitler Award is even conceivable, let alone celebrated, is more than troubling and indicates a significant change in the Italian public’s general tolerance for anti-semitic remarks and activity.' Angelo Bonelli, leader of Italy's Green party, described the prize as a 'sordid provocation'. Last week former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi provoked outrage when he said his children are persecuted 'like Jews under Hitler'. Asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave Italy to escape his legal troubles, Berlusconi said: 'My children say that they feel like Jewish families in Germany under Hitler's regime. Truly, everyone is against us.' Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler murdered an estimated six million Jews during World War Two.","Trade Union Feder Fauna slammed over controversially-named prize .

Made to sleep on the floor, Erwiana said she worked 21-hour shifts, had no days off, was fed just a single bowl of rice a day and was beaten constantly, sometimes for no apparent reason at all.

Justice: Protesters on Sunday including maids, rights activists and migrant group members marched through the commercial area of Wanchai . In the final weeks of her ordeal, she . said blood and puss ran from her wounds so badly that her employer . complained it was staining the carpet. Rather than take her to a doctor, she said her boss wrapped her injuries in bandages and plastic bags, but it still seeped out. Finally, when her injuries had become so severe that she could no longer work, her boss bought her a ticket home, gave her 70 Hong Kong dollars (£5.50) and dumped her at Honk Kong airport, making her swear never to mention what had happened to her. 'She told me that she knew a lot of people in Indonesia and if I said anything she would have my parents killed,' Erwiana told Al Jazeera, surrounded by her family in a hospital bed in Sragen, Central Java. Healing: Doctors at Amel Sehat Islamic Hospital said she is suffering from swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head and her feet are brown and swollen with cellulitis - an infection of the skin that resulted from her long-untreated wounds . Brutal: Erwiana said her employer beat her on a daily basis with a lot of different implements, usually with the handle of her mop, mostly on her head . Doctors at Amel Sehat Islamic Hospital said she is suffering from swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head. She also has several broken teeth, a broken nose and her hands and feet are bruised and swollen with cellulitis - an infection of the skin caused by her untreated wounds. 'When I first came to Hong Kong I thought it was a kind of luxurious place, an amazing place. But it was not the reality for me,' she added. 'She would beat me with a lot of different implements, most usually with the handle of my mop. She would hit me all over, but mostly on my head. 'I had to work for 21 hours a day. I didn't have my own room so whenever I could sleep I would sleep on the floor. Demands: They handed a petition to Hong Kong Police Commissioner Tsang Wai-hun urging faster progress in the case before marching to the city's government headquarters . 'No more torture': Many of the protesters brandishing the Indonesian national flag, chanted slogans and waved banners with the words 'Justice for Erwiana' 'If [one of her two teenage] children found me sleeping when I wasn't supposed to be they'd tell her and she'd beat me again.' Protesters on Sunday including maids, . rights activists and migrant group members marched through the . commercial area of Wanchai, many brandishing the Indonesian national . flag and chanting slogans including 'Justice for Erwiana'. They . handed a petition to Hong Kong Police Commissioner Tsang Wai-hun urging . faster progress in the case before marching to the city's government . headquarters. 'We want the . investigation to speed up and we demand the Hong Kong government to stop . abuses on domestic helpers in Hong Kong,' Eni Lestari, chairwoman of . the International Migrants Alliance and rally spokeswoman, told . reporters at the protest. Also yesterday a 28-year-old maid, known only as Bunga, said she experienced ten months of abuse while working for Erwiana's alleged abuser. 'One time the employer got so angry she dragged me onto the balcony and threatened to throw me off it. She made me beg for my life,' Bunga said. 'I told her that she could beat me as much as she wanted but I went on my knees and begged her not to kill me because I had a son.' Bunga said she was never allowed outside the Tseung Kwan O flat and would be locked inside when the family went out. 'The woman threatened to pay the Indonesian police money to kill my entire family if I talked to others about the beatings,' she said. She was eventually helped to leave by an employment agency, but the agency urged her not to press charges. Campaign of torture: The march comes as a second Indonesian domestic helper came forward to claim that she had suffered similar beatings and death threats at the hands of the same employers in 2010 . Groundswell: Organisers claimed around 5,000 people participated in the rally . 'I'm speaking out now because I feel so sad I didn't do anything to help Erwiana,' she said. The allegations have renewed concern about the treatment of domestic helpers in the former British colony following a spate of similar abuse cases and recent criticism by rights groups. Hong Kong police had at first categorised the alleged torture as a miscellaneous case but last week launched a criminal investigation after an outcry by domestic helpers in the city. On Friday authorities said investigators will travel to Indonesia to speak to Sulistyaningsih, who remains in hospital in Sragen on the main island of Java. 'Without this kind of protest the case of Erwiana will never go to the public or go to the court. There will be no justice,' Lestari said, adding that two other maids have since come forward alleging abuse at the hands of the same employer. The agency that employed Erwiana has said they were unaware of her injuries until they were notified by their corresponding agency in Indonesia. More claims: The second alleged victim claimed the employer got so angry she dragged her onto the balcony and threatened to throw her off it before making her beg for her life . Growing trend: The semi-autonomous Chinese city is home to nearly 300,000 maids from mainly Southeast Asian countries - predominantly Indonesia and the Philippines - and criticism from rights groups over their treatment is growing . Organisers claimed around 5,000 people participated in the rally, a sharp increase in numbers from a similar march on Thursday which drew several dozen protesters. Hong Kong police were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. The semi-autonomous Chinese city is home to nearly 300,000 maids from mainly Southeast Asian countries - predominantly Indonesia and the Philippines - and criticism from rights groups over their treatment is growing. A Hong Kong couple were jailed in September for attacks on their Indonesian domestic helper, which included burning her with an iron and beatings with a bike chain. Amnesty International in November condemned the 'slavery-like' conditions faced by thousands of Indonesian women who work in the Asian financial hub as domestic staff and accused authorities of 'inexcusable' inaction. It found that Indonesians were exploited by recruitment and placement agencies who seize their documents and charge them excessive fees, with false promises of high salaries and good working conditions. Domestic helpers in Hong Kong are paid about HK$4,000 (£313) a month.","Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 22, was unable to walk after 8 months of abuse .

"There were few wealthier men in the United States than Henry Graves Jr. Born into an august banking family, he had spent his life accumulating a multi-million-dollar fortune by investing shrewdly in railways and banking. Like many rich men, Graves liked to collect objects as well as money. While most ordinary men collected stamps or coins, he acquired holiday homes, modern art, motorboats and expensive watches. His favourite boat was his 50-foot speedster, the Eagle, on which he liked to potter around the Upper Saranac Lake in upstate New York. Scroll down for video . Time lord: American Banker Henry Graves Jr (left) commissioned the 'Holy Grail' of watches (right) in 1925 only to suffer its curse . One afternoon late in 1936, Graves took out the Eagle with his daughter Gwendolen, who found her father in a morose mood. Her eyes widened when he pulled a large watch out of his pocket and looked at it intensely. ‘Such things bring one nothing but trouble,’ said Graves, who by then was in his late 60s. ‘Notoriety brings bad fortune.’ Gwendolen knew that this was no ordinary timepiece. It was the ultimate expression of her father’s obsession with collecting watches and, in particular, those made by the Swiss firm Patek Philippe. This week, that watch broke records at auction when it was sold by Sotheby’s in Geneva for £13.4 million to an anonymous bidder. With auction house costs, the mystery buyer will have to fork out a total of £15.1 million. It comes as no surprise, for the watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made, the ‘Holy Grail of Horology’. Graves had been buying watches from Patek Philippe since 1903, and by 1910 he had started to commission them. Many were engraved with the family’s coat of arms. But he wanted more than mere engravings to make his watches special. He wanted his Patek Philippes to be the most complex watches in the world, including as many ‘complications’ as possible - the horological term for any feature of a watch that goes beyond simply showing hours, minutes and seconds. Such was his obsession that he started competing with James Ward Packard, a luxury car manufacturer, to see who could produce the most impressive timepiece. Graves secretly approached Patek Philippe in 1925. He wanted, he insisted, nothing less than ‘the most complicated watch’ on the planet, one that was ‘impossibly elaborate’. What followed was, in the words of author Stacy Perman in her book A Grand Complication, ‘a nearly eight-year odyssey’ in which teams of Patek Philippe’s craftsmen, scientists and engineers did, indeed, create the most complicated watch made before the age of computer-aided design. Made by Patek Philippe, the Henry Graves Supercomplication is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and took five years to make . They spent three years researching the project and five years making the watch. In total, the timepiece — with two clock faces, one on each side — has 24 complications. One shows the phases of the Moon, others the times of sunset and sunrise in New York and even the pattern of the stars each night above Mr Graves’s apartment in the city. There are complications revealing the days of the week, an alarm, a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar. Grave’s masterpiece blew Packard’s out of the water. Packard had got there first and his was the first watch to feature a sky chart, including 500 golden stars, centered above his home in Ohio. Yet the masterpiece that became known as the Graves Supercomplication never brought its owner the pleasure he expected. Far from it. After he had taken delivery of it in 1933 at a cost of $15,000 (about £650,000 at today’s prices) the Supercomplication seemed to bring him not only unwanted attention but great misfortune - so much so that on the Eagle on that day in 1936, Graves cut the engine of the boat and looked from the watch to the water. ‘What is the point of being wealthy and owning such objects if something like this could happen?’ he asked his daughter. It was the time of the Great Depression, and Graves had become a figure of public resentment after people who were starving and destitute discovered that he could spend thousands on such luxuries. In total, the timepiece - with two clock faces, one on each side - has 24 complications. One shows the phases of the Moon, others the times of sunset and sunrise in New York and even the pattern of the stars each night above Mr Graves’s apartment in the city . But the banker believed the watch had brought him far worse than opprobrium in the public prints. In fact, he became convinced that it had come with a deadly curse. Just seven months after Graves received the watch, his best friend died. And worse was to come. In early November 1934, Graves answered the telephone to be told that his youngest son, George, had been hurtling in a car down a boulevard in Pasadena, California, and crashed, killing himself. The news was devastating, and made even worse by the fact that Graves had lost his eldest son, Harry, in a car crash in 1922 when he was just 25 years old. For Graves, the Supercomplication was a bad talisman, something that was meant to have brought him joy but had, instead, ushered in grief and hateful publicity. At one point he had come close to selling the watch, but decided against it. As the boat bobbed in the water, Gwendolen watched her father pull back his arm. In his hand was the Supercomplication and he was about to throw it into the lake. ‘No, Daddy!’ Gwendolen implored. ‘Let me hold on to that. Some day I might want that.’ Graves slowly let his arm fall to his side. Gwendolen reached forward gingerly and took the watch from his hand, then put it in her pocket. With auction costs, the final price paid by a 'man in a red tie'b at the auction in Geneva, Switzerland, was £15.1 million -  a new world record . From then on, Gwendolen held on to the watch. Her father lost interest in an item that he had craved all his life - a life that was to end in 1953, when he was 86. After his death, Gwendolen inherited the Supercomplication and in 1960 passed it to her son, Reginald ‘Pete’ Fullerton, who sold it to an industrialist from Illinois for $200,000 — some £1million today. Until 1999 the watch was displayed in a museum in Illinois, then it was sold to a private collector by Sotheby’s in New York for $11 million (about £10 million today). The auction house will not be drawn on the identities of either the seller or the buyer. But both will for ever thank Gwendolen Graves for stopping her father throwing the world’s most extraordinary timepiece into a cold lake in upstate New York all those decades ago.","US banker Henry Graves Jr ordered the 'Supercomplication' watch Swiss manufacturer Patek Philippe in 1925 .
