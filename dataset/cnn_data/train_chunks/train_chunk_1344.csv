"After the second strong earthquake in as many weeks, seismologists have warned that Friday's 5.1 tremor that rumbled through Los Angeles could herald a much larger quake. The series of earthquakes began at 8.03pm, peaking at 9.09pm with a tremor centered near Brea in Orange County causing Disneyland to close, gas leaks, water main breaks and a rockslide near the epicenter, according to authorities as up to 100 aftershocks were felt. US Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said that, 'There could be an even larger earthquake in the next few hours or the next few days,' as more than two dozen aftershocks ranging from magnitudes 2 to 3.6 were recorded, according to the USGS. Scroll Down for Video . Tremor: A broken block wall blocks the sidewalk Saturday, March 29, 2014, after an earthquake hit Orange County Friday night in Fullerton, Calif.  More than 100 aftershocks have rattled Orange County south of Los Angeles . A CalTrans worker and a geologist look at a rock wall where a rockslide closed Carbon Canyon Road near Carbon Canyon Regional Park in Brea, Calif., . Rocked: Customers flee Disneyland as the park is shut down following a 5.1 earthquake in L.A. And on Saturday afternoon, a shallow magnitude 4.1 earthquake was reported hitting Rowland Heights. This quake was centered not far from Friday's epicenter in La Habra and out of the hundreds of aftershocks this would have been the largest. The 4.4 quake was felt across a large area of Southern California. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. 'Tonight's earthquake is the second in two weeks, and reminds us to be prepared,' Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a written statement released about an hour after the shaking stopped. Geologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the quake was shallow, at a depth of only 1.2 miles. 'We have to analyze that to make sure of the exact depth but it is relatively shallow,' said Robert Graves of CalTech. 'Earthquakes in California tend to be deeper than that so it's a little bit anomalous.' Graves said that there was a five percent chance that the quake was a precursor to a stronger quake. On March 17, a 4.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Los Angeles basin and was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The reported damage was slight according to authorities. At the time, Lucy Jones said, 'It's not that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have across the state once every couple of months. But we haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.'

Clean-up: A man picks up fallen goods at a CVS store after an earthquake on Friday, March 28, 2014, in La Mirada, California . Experts said that the earthquakes occurred on the Puente Hills thrust fault, which stretches from  the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles. Last night's quake was shallow, which 'means the shaking is very concentrated in a small area,' said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. Hauksson revealed that the earthquake was unusual because the 5.1 quake was preceded by the weaker foreshock. Scientists such as Hauksson are very concerned about the Puente Hills fault because it runs directly under downtown Los Angeles. 'This is the fault that could eat L.A.,' seismologist Sue Hough told The LA Times in 2003. Residents across Los Angeles reported swinging chandeliers, fireplaces dislodging from walls and burglar alarms being set off by the quake. Enforcement: A police officer controls the traffic as workers shut off the water valve on Friday, March 28, 2014, in Fullerton, California . Off road: In Brea, the earthquake triggered a landslide that left this car upside down, with only minor injuries reported . Eyewitness photos and videos show bottles and packages strewn on store floors. Southern California Edison reported power outages to about 2,000 customers following the quake. More than two dozen aftershocks ranging from magnitudes 2 to 3.6 were recorded, according to the USGS. Earlier in the evening, two foreshocks registering at magnitude-3.6 and magnitude-2.1 hit nearby in the city of La Habra. Public safety officials said crews were inspecting bridges, dams, rail tracks and other infrastructure systems for signs of damage. The Brea police department said the rock slide in the Carbon Canyon area caused a car to overturn, and the people inside the car sustained minor injuries. Callers to KNX-AM reported seeing a brick wall collapse, water sloshing in a swimming pool and wires and trees swaying back and forth. One caller said he was in a movie theater lobby in Brea when the quake struck. 'A lot of the glass in the place shook like crazy,' he said. 'It started like a roll and then it started shaking like crazy. Everybody ran outside, hugging each other in the streets.' Fullerton resident Daniel Taylor told the station everything fell down in his home. 'My 100-gallon fish tank went down. Water damage everywhere from the tank. My water pipes under my sink cracked,' he said. One viewer in Walnut said the power went out for 10 minutes. 'The whole room was shaking. My bed was rolling for longer than most I've felt,' said another . Watch Video Here: . Comedy: Dane Cook took to Twitter to joke about how unaffected he was by the quake .

Wreckage: Edison reported approximately 2,000 customers were out of power in the aftermath . Lucky: Despite the damage only minor injuries have been reported . Scope of the problem: The US Geological Survey released this map showing the location and intensity  of the 5.1 Richter scale earthquake . A helicopter news reporter from KNBC-TV reported from above that rides at Disneyland in Anaheim — several miles from the epicenter — were stopped as a precaution. Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully was on the air calling the Angels-Dodgers exhibition game in the sixth inning at Dodger Stadium. 'A little tremor here in the ballpark. I'm not sure if the folks felt it, but we certainly felt it here in press box row,' Scully said. 'A tremor and only that, thank goodness.' Tom Connolly, a Boeing employee who lives in La Mirada, the next town over from La Habra, said the magnitude-5.1 quake lasted about 30 seconds. 'We felt a really good jolt. It was a long rumble and it just didn't feel like it would end,' he told The Associated Press by phone. 'Right in the beginning it shook really hard, so it was a little unnerving. People got quiet and started bracing themselves by holding on to each other. It was a little scary.' Smashed: Though damage was minimal, people reported dishes, bottles, and other perishable items breaking during the quake across L.A. Be safe: Authorities advised residents to secure bookshelves and any precious items . Flipped: Authorities said information about this earthquake could help them better understand the region's faults . The party's over: Orange County residents said they felt gradual shaking for roughly 10 seconds followed by 20 aftershocks . Friday's quake hit a week after a pre-dawn magnitude-4.4 quake centered in the San Fernando Valley rattled a swath of Southern California. That jolt shook buildings and rattled nerves, but did not cause significant damage. Southern California has not experienced a devastating earthquake since the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge quake killed several dozen people and caused $25 billion in damage. Preliminary data suggest Friday night's 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Puente Hills thrust fault, which stretches from the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles and caused the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said. 'It's a place where we've had a lot of earthquakes in the past,' she said. The 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake killed eight people and caused $360 million in damage. Just the start: Authorities said there was a 5 per cent chance a larger earthquake would follow in the next three days .

"One of Britain's top police dogs who has sniffed out more than £11million worth of drugs, cash and guns has retired. Springer spaniel Alfie joined Staffordshire Police in 2006 and his work with handler Julie Hargreaves has led to more than 400 arrests. The nine-year-old, who was used by the force to sniff out illegal substances and stolen cash, was also used to educate schoolchildren about how to stay safe around animals. Springer spaniel Alfie joined Staffordshire Police in 2006 and his work with handler Julie Hargreaves has led to more than 400 arrests. He has sniffed out £11million worth of cash, drugs and guns in his eight-year career . Alfie's handler said: 'He's the best dog I could ever have asked for - he constantly goes above and beyond' Alfie was originally donated to Staffordshire Police by a family in Nottinghamshire after they found him to be too hyperactive. Ms Hargreaves has been his handler since he arrived with the force after his special training . Ms Hargreaves, 45, said she was sad to see her beloved partner retire but said she was immensely proud of the work they achieved together during Alfie's eight year career. She said: 'He's the best dog I could ever have asked for - he constantly goes above and beyond expectations. 'It's difficult to keep count of the times that he has found things we had been desperately looking for with no luck and kept the community safe.' During his eight years in the force, Alfie has sniffed out £8million in drugs alone. During a raid on a car by the Central Motorways Police Group in August, Alfie came up trumps with one of the biggest single finds in history. Police stopped a vehicle where intelligence suggested drugs may be concealed on board but officers searched the vehicle inside out and could not find anything. It was only when Alfie was left to sniff around the car that he unearthed a large quantity of Class A drugs with an estimated street value of £4million. His ability to smell traces of ammunition and weapon components means that Alfie has also helped to take guns off the streets with a total find value of £1million. Alfie sniffed out one of the biggest finds in history - £4million worth of drugs during a car raid in August . After an armed robbery in Alsager, Cheshire, in 2011, Alfie searched the house where the perpetrators had hidden the weapons and managed to find them, which meant they could later be used in evidence. In another search, he recovered more than £1million in cannabis resin from a container stored on a yard near Burton. And, in a car where officers were unable to find anything, the springer spaniel was able to sniff out £500,000 worth of heroin and a further £250,000 in cash. Thanks to extra training, he is also able to detect the special ink used to print money and can sniff out all sterling and euro notes. He once found a haul of £10,000 in cash believed to be the profits of crime. As well as sniffing out illegal substances and cash, Alfie and his handler  also found time to work on education programmes for children. The pair visited up to six schools a month teaching young people how to stay safe around animals and giving them their first introduction to the work of the police. Alfie was originally donated to the police by a family in Nottinghamshire after they found him to be too hyperactive. Ms Hargreaves, who has been in the police since she joined the cadets at 16, said: 'He was way too much for an ordinary family - a bit overzealous and hyperactive - but that's exactly what we look for in a search dog. 'He is ball crazy and that's the first thing we need - a dog who loves the reward of chasing a tennis ball.' After being assessed by a team of officers, it was clear that he was perfect for the job and Alfie was inducted into the force with eight weeks of training with his handler. She said: 'I was new to being a specialist dog handler too. Although I'd had a general purpose dog before, Alfie was my first search dog. 'He's turned out to be the finest dog the force has ever known. 'Both dogs lived with me - it's part of the bond between the dog and the handler. The nine-year-old springer spaniel will now be cared for by the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme . 'And Alfie has always been 100 per cent professional - that's what makes him such a special dog - even when he was doing shift patterns. 'He did exactly the same hours as me, even when I was working nights or from the early hours of the morning. 'As soon as I put my uniform on, he was ready to work.' Alfie retired in October and is being supported by the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme now he is no longer in active service. Ms Hargreaves said: 'Although I was very sad to see him retire I know he'll enjoy his new home. 'But I will be fundraising for the Staffordshire Retired Police Dogs Scheme to make sure he has a comfortable retirement.'","Police dog Alfie responsible for more than 400 arrests with his handler .

"Under the water: Hock Ma, 84, was discovered in a rooftop hot tub by a patron of a New York spa . A woman climbing into a hot tub at a high-class spa found a man's body underneath her feet. Hock Ma, 84, was submerged in warm water at the rooftop pool of the Spa Castle center in Queens, New York - and went undiscovered until the unnamed patron felt him underneath her. It is unclear how Ma, who was later declared dead, ended up slipping beneath the water unnoticed on Sunday evening. The woman ran out of the pool, screaming for help after making the macabre discovery, according to NBC4 New York. Staff gave emergency aid to the man while medics were called - but Ma was later declared dead in hospital. A friend of the woman who found Ma's body said: '[She was] actually walking into the water and felt something by her feet - It was the gentleman. He went under and no one noticed him.' New York City regulations demand frequent monitoring of spa pools by officials. It is not clear why nobody had noticed Ma. However, small print on the website of one Spa Castle location emphasizes that guests have to use 'caution' around the pools and that it will not be responsible for any injuries caused by people swimming, running or diving around the water. Ma's son, James, demanded an investigation into the death. He said: 'It does warrant a closer look so this doesn't happen to someone else and it's a shame it happened to my father,'. Unnoticed: Ma was in the warm pool on the roof of Spa Castle's Queens location, pictured . The New York City Health Department is understood to be looking into the incident. A spokesman for the spa told DailyMail.com: 'Safety is a priority at all of our facilities. 'On Sunday evening a guest visiting Spa Castle with his family was pulled unconscious from one of the Bade pools - a shallow spa pool. 'CPR was initiated by a certified manager and the patron was taken by ambulance to a local hospital.' 'Safety precautions are clearly posted in our facilities and the staff in the area is CPR certified. Our thoughts are with the family at this time.'","Patron at Spa Castle, in Queens, found Hock Ma, 84, under the water .

"Just when you thought unemployment was dropping and stock markets were surging back, these three analysts today sent out a stark warning to Americans to brace for another financial crash. Trend forecaster Gerald Celente advises buying a gun to protect your . family, stocking up on gold if the dollar crashes and planning a . getaway, so it’s no shock he’s preparing for an ‘economic 9/11’. Share prices and unemployment are posting their best figures in four years since the recession hit, but Mr Celente, along with authors Harry Dent and Robert Prechter, says the rebound won’t last. Going down: Gerald Celente is one of three analysts outside of Wall Street sending out stark warnings to Americans to brace for another financial crash, just as things seem to be getting better . All three were profiled in a USA Today . feature on Monday. Mr Dent, who had The Great Crash Ahead published . last September, believes stocks are simply experiencing an artificial . short-term boost. Mr . Prechter, who had a new version of Conquer the Crash published in 2009, . is fearful of today’s economic similarities to the Great Depression and . says the brief recovery will fail like in the 1930s. ‘The . economic recovery has been weak, so the next downturn should generate . bad news in a big way,’ he told USA Today, saying the markets look 'very bearish' for the third time in 12 years. Mr . Celente, who works as an analyst at the Trends Research Institute, . which he founded in Kingston, New York, has been doom-mongering for . years - so his latest concerns are hardly surprising. Fear: Authors Harry Dent, left, and Robert Prechter, right, insist the current stock market rebound won’t last . Looking for work: Job seekers attend an employment fair in New York. Unemployment fell last month to 8.3 per cent, a three-year low, and weekly jobless claims are at a four-year-low. But the doom-mongers aren't happy . But he told USA Today that a potential run on banks by savers could cause the government to invoke a national holiday and temporarily close them all, which happened during the Great Depression. 'When money stops flowing to the man on the street, blood starts flowing in the street' Gerald Celente, trend forecaster . It comes as billionaire Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett today painted a happier picture of stocks, which he said are relatively cheap compared to other investments as the economy improves. Meanwhile contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes neared a two-year high in January in further evidence the housing market was slowly turning the corner, an industry group said today. However oil prices have been spurred higher by worries over disruptions to Middle East supplies due to sanctions against Iran and expectations for greater demand from an improving U.S. economy. Stronger shares: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan on Monday. The Dow Jones index is now trading around the 13,000 mark - but not everyone is convinced it will stay high . Economic violence: Occupy Wall Street protesters clashed with riot police on many occasions last autumn, including in November after being ordered to leave their camp at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan, New York . But on the markets, the S&P 500 has risen nearly nine per cent so far this year and the Dow Jones is trading around the psychologically-important mark of 13,000. But the three experts aren’t happy. Billionaire Warren Buffett said today that U.S. stocks remain relatively cheap compared to other potential investments as the economy continues to improve. The chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway (pictured) said even though stocks aren't as cheap as they were during the depths of the recession in 2008, they're still a more attractive long-term option than bonds, gold, cash or anything else. 'Equities are still cheap relative to any other asset class,' he said, adding that houses are another attractive investment at current prices. Meanwhile Mr Buffett reiterated his call for tax reforms and a higher tax rate for wealthy investors like himself and said the U.S. is simply spending too much and bringing in too little revenue. Mr Prechter told USA Today both markets will crash back below their lows hit at the height of the financial crisis in March 2009. Unemployment fell last month to 8.3 per cent, a three-year low, and weekly jobless claims are at a four-year-low. But Mr Dent believes that people will be left out of work again in 2013 or 2014 and U.S. markets will crash because central banks have been pumping so much money into markets that they are unrealistically strong. The economy is proving to be the major issue in this autumn’s presidential election, with every Republican candidate berating President Barack Obama for his handling of the recession. Mitt Romney said on Monday that his major rival Rick Santorum is ill-prepared to deal with the nation's economic woes, calling his GOP rival a nice guy who never held a job in the private sector. But Mr Santorum has mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge against Mr Romney ahead of the primary in Michigan tomorrow, despite accusations from his rival that he doesn't know how to create jobs. Mr Celente told USA Today that a higher unemployment rate will cause social unrest and there will be a growing rich-poor divide. This would no doubt help fuel movements such as Occupy Wall Street. ‘When money stops flowing to the man on the street, blood starts flowing in the street,’ he said.","Gerald Celente, Harry Dent and Robert Prechter all predicting big trouble .

"A couple have been charged with murder after a grandfather was found shot in the head inside his burning truck. Cleate Davis, 50, was allegedly robbed and left for dead by Aleasha Cox, 34, and Morrieo Allen as he sat in his Ford pick-up in Millington, Tennessee, on December 18. Police discovered the burning vehicle in a ditch at the side of the road with Davis'  charred body still inside. Cleate Davis, 50, was robbed, shot twice in the face and left for dead  as he sat in his burning Ford pick-up in Millington, Tennessee, on December 18 . The pair, who reportedly knew Davis, are believed to have shot him twice in the face during a robbery gone wrong. His grieving family said his death came just days after they discovered he had beaten cancer for the second time. Authorities said that Allen was seen running from the scene and was arrested and detained two days later following a manhunt. Cox was caught a short time later and has already admitted her part in the murder, according to My Fox Memphis. His daughter, Rachel Davis, told the station that she still has one Christmas gift left to unwrap, the one from her grandfather. She is now trying to figure out how to explain what has happened to his two granddaughters, aged just two and six. He had bought one of them a bike for Christmas and never got to watch them open it. Aleasha Cox, 34, (left) and Morrieo Allen, who knew the grandfather, have both been charged with his murder . 'I mean how do you tell a two-year old that grandpa's not here anymore?' she said. 'That was her hero, and she loves her grandpa more than anything.' Davis' other daughter Rochelle Weber said: 'We're just still kind of shell-shocked about it. We're glad that both of them are in custody now.' The pair made their first court appearance on Monday morning and were read their rights before they were returned to custody. Their family claim they both knew Davis and how 'kindhearted' he was.

"Hackers have used photos to recreate the fingerprint (stock image) of a German politician . Hackers have already proved they can bypass Apple's fingerprint scanner using a collection of household items to make a latex replica print. And now, one expert has recreated the fingerprints of Germany’s Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen, using just a photo of her. The security researcher known as Starbug, used publicly available software called VeriFinger with photos of the finger taken from different angles. Starbug, whose real name is Jan Krissler, told attendees of the Chaos Computer Club’s (CCC) 31st annual congress in Hamburg, Germany, how he achieved the hack. Mr Krissler obtained a high-resolution photograph of the politician’s thumb using a ‘standard photo camera’ during a press conference. He also used other 'good quality' photos of the politician, taken from a variety of angles. From these images, he reconstructed an accurate thumbprint using the VeriFinger software. This software is good enough, according to CCC, to fool fingerprint security systems. ‘These fingerprints could be used for biometric authentication,’ it wrote in a blog post. Hackers have previously demonstrated how easily fingerprints can be stolen from an individual who has touched a shiny surface, such as a smartphone screen, . But CCC said that with ‘this knowledge there will be no need to steal objects carrying the fingerprints anymore,’ meaning that people could potential steal someone's fingerprint identity from photos posed on social networks, for example. Starbug said: ‘After this talk, politicians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public.’ One expert has recreated the fingerprints of Germany’s Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen (stock image), using photos taken at a press conference. From these images, he reconstructed an accurate thumbprint using the VeriFinger software.This software is good enough to fool fingerprint security systems . A security researcher known as Starbug, used the publicly available software, plus a variety of photos of a finger taken from different angles to replicate the fingerprint. Starbug previously hacked Apple's iPhone 5S fingerprint sensor (pictured) just two days after the phone launched in 2013 . In September 2013, hackers from CCC used a photograph of a fingerprint on a glass surface, scanned it and then used a laser printer to print it onto a transparent sheet. They then poured latex milk or white wood glue into the print pattern created by the toner onto a transparent sheet. Starbug obtained high-resolution photographs of Germany’s Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen's thumb, which were taken at a press conference. He used the images, which were taken from different angles to reconstruct a fingerprint with a sense of depth. To do this, he used publicly available software called VeriFinger, demonstrating that anyone with the necessary skills could do the same. The copy is good enough to trick fingerprint systems for biometric authentication, he said. Once the glue had dried, they peeled off the thin latex sheet and pressed it on the scanner of the iPhone to unlock the handset, which launches two days earlier. During the launch, Apple claimed the new iPhone with a fingerprint sensor was 'much more secure than previous fingerprint technology.' At the time, Starbug said: 'As we have said now for more than years, fingerprints should not be used to secure anything. 'You leave them everywhere, and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints.' CCC first published the steps taken to bypass fingerprint scanners in 2004 and they claim that it uses everyday household items - meaning anyone can do it. In September 2013, hackers from CCC used a photograph of a fingerprint on a glass surface, scanned it and then used a laser printer to print it onto a transparent sheet to make a new print using wood glue. This technique relied on a print obtained from a glass surface (pictured) whereas the new one only needs photos . Security expert Graham Cluely said: 'It’s worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets. 'You literally leave them lying around everywhere you go, and they could be picked up by others. Relying on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security – but you shouldn’t depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect.'","Security researcher known as Starbug used photos and software called VeriFinger to copy the print of a German politician .

"Hundreds of illegal migrants heading for Britain have moved into a vast new heated hostel in Calais – as local authorities confirmed a formal ‘welcome centre’ will open in January. The prefecture responsible for the port town in northern France opened the so-called ‘cold weather centre’ over the weekend as temperatures plummeted to freezing. A more formal ‘welcome centre’ is, meanwhile, likely to be up and running by January 15. Scroll down for video . A warm place to rest: Migrants bed down for the night at a warehouse in Calais, northern France, which provides mattresses and bedding for migrants sleeping rough in the town as winter temperatures drop . ‘It will provide hot meals, toilets and phone charging points,’ said William Alexander, the CEO of Active Life, the French agency running it. He said there had been delays in the building of some of the facility - set in an old leisure centre - but ‘the entire site will be completed in early April’. Referring to the temporary cold weather centre which opened on Friday night, a spokesman for the Calais Prefecture said: ‘We had around 500 people in over Friday night, and numbers should increase up to around 1,500 over coming days. ‘At the moment the centre is a provisional one, but it will become more permanent as the winter progresses.’ Situated around two miles from the centre of Calais, the centre is in a 40,000sq ft warehouse with mattresses and hot showers. It is in easy walking distance of the main ferry port, where those staying at the centre make regular attempts to get aboard ferries heading for the coast of England. Once there the vast majority of mainly young men will claim asylum, or else disappear into the black economy. Bedding down: The centre is a in warehouse with mattresses and hot showers around two miles from Calais . 'Humanitarian gestures': The top local official said the new centres would not be like Sangatte-type hostels . While refugee groups say the centre is essential for the 2500 migrants sleeping rough in the Calais area, others fear it will become a magnet for even more. Immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters, writes Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail. Over the past year it has moved ahead of the economy as the British public’s top priority, according to YouGov. Since May, voters have put it above or tied with the economy in every survey conducted by the organisation. At one point, in September, it was selected by 58 per cent of voters as one of the three most important issues for the country while only 48 per cent had the economy in their top three. YouGov chose ‘Immigration becoming the public’s most important issue’ as one of its top five public opinion trends of 2014. Will Dahlgreen, from YouGov, said: ‘Although immigration began to narrow the gap at the end of 2013, 2014 is the first year since 2010 when the economy has not been the top issue. ‘Immigration had an average lead of one point over the whole year, compared to a deficit of 18 in 2013 and 32 in 2012.’ It is the first large-scale facility since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees over six years. Calais prefect Denis Robin said the new centre would only be open on certain nights, with migrants being forced out by 9am each morning. He said: ‘The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall. ‘We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.’ A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants is also set to be opened in January. Mr Robin insisted the shelters were ‘humanitarian gestures’, adding: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.’ Tensions have been mounting in the town in recent months as hundreds more people from countries including Afghanistan, Syria and Eritrea flood into the town. Brawls between rival gangs and people smugglers left more than 70 people injured during July and August. At least 15 migrants died during 2014 as they tried to get to Britain from France too, either by drowning in the sea, or being knocked over by lorries. Security measures: A part of the metal fence erected to keep UK-bound illegal immigrants from getting into the port at Calais is seen after it was toppled by high winds on Saturday night . In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal. The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart blames the UK’s generous state benefits for their influx of migrants, saying Britain was viewed as ‘an Eldorado’. It came as high winds in Calais knocked down part of a new metal fence erected to prevent migrants from getting on to UK-bound ferries. Sections of the fence, which was only put up last month, were flattened by winds of up to 100mph.","Numbers at 'cold weather centre' expected to rise to 1,500 in coming days .

"President Barack Obama's party, having been pushed aside in the last election, will slide into the minority in the Senate next week when Congress reconvenes, giving Republicans full control of the legislative branch. But Obama still has a powerful weapon in his arsenal - the presidential veto - and in an interview with NPR that aired this morning he warned Republicans he will use it if they come after his trademark legislation. 'I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office, partly because legislation that I objected to was typically blocked in the Senate even after...Republicans took over the House,' he said. 'Now I suspect there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out. 'And I'm going to defend gains that we've made in health care; I'm going to defend gains that we've made on environment and clean air and clean water,' Obama added. Scroll down for video . 'I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office,' President Barack Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired this morning. 'Now I suspect there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out,' he added. Obama sat for the interview with NPR before leaving for his annual, Hawaiian vacation, which he is still on . Obama again said he'd rather work with Republicans than against them, however, and he's 'hopeful' that GOP leaders John Boehner, House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the incoming Senate majority leader, will take the same approach. 'I want to get things done. I don't have another election to run,' he said, moments before vowing to be 'as aggressive as I can be in getting legislation passed that I think help move the economy forward and help middle-class families.' But the president may have already 'poisoned the well' for bipartisan action in some areas, according to Republicans. After the GOP wiped enough Democrats off the map in the midterm elections to gain a majority of seats in the Senate, Obama took executive action to enforce his favored immigration reforms in a move that Republicans have attacked as unconstitutional. In memorandums distributed to the Department of Homeland Security last month Obama ordered the agency to stop deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2010, as well the parents of legal U.S. residents. The directives are expected to effectively protect as many as 5 million immigrants illegally residing in the country from removal until a new president takes office in two years and decides to extend authorization allowing them stay or send them back to their native countries. Republicans on Capitol Hill begged Obama to leave the policy making to Congress and cautioned him that by taking matters into his own hands he would destroy any chance of a working relationship with their party. Obama acted anyway, and next week he'll get to see if he called their bluff or stirred the pot. The president told NPR that just because he and Republicans 'disagree on one thing [that] shouldn't prohibit us from getting progress on the areas where there's some overlap.' 'Now you've got Republicans in a position where it's not enough for them simply to grind the wheels of Congress to a halt and then blame me,' he said. 'They are going to be in a position in which they have to show that they can responsibly govern, given that they have significant majorities in both chambers.' In a statement responding to Obama's interview with NPR, McConnell put the onus on the president to determine how much Republican-passed legislation actually becomes law. 'Bipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the President's desk, and he'll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class,' McConnell told the Associated Press. 'There's a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don't like.' You've been warned: Obama said at his year-end presser earlier this month that Republicans on Capitol Hill will 'meet stiff resistance' from him if they try to repeal Obamacare and his other trademark legislation . Since November's elections Obama has been waving his veto pen in the face of Republicans, lest they follow through on their promise to use their newly established power to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. 'On health care, there are certainly some lines I’m going to draw. Repeal of the law I won’t sign,' Obama told reporters a day after his party's downfall in the midterms. 'Efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we're not going to support.' Continuing, he said, 'In some cases there may be recommendations that Republicans have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law, and I’ll be very honest with them about that and say, look, the law doesn't work if you pull out that piece or that piece.' The president indicated that he would be 'very open and receptive' to 'responsible' changes to the health care reform law that improve on it, though, and 'make it work better.' 'There’s no law that's ever been passed that is perfect,' he said, and 'there are some other areas where we think we can do even better. 'But what I will remind them is that despite all the contention, we now know that the law works.' Obama again threatened Republicans with presidential vetos at his year-end presser ahead earlier this month just before he jetted off with his family for a vacation in Hawaii. 'If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me,' he assured reporters. 'If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no. 'And I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions,' he said. It would take a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress to overcome a presidential veto. With just 54 members of the Senate in their column, the GOP would need to convince a dozen Democrats to join them in defying the president in order to overwrite his check on their powers. And despite winning their largest majority in the House since WWII, Republicans have nowhere near enough seats in the House to challenge a presidential veto. Roughly four dozen Democrats would have to append their names to GOP-backed legislation in order to reach the requisite number of yea votes, a very unlikely scenario.","'I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office,' he said .

"The former Bank of England governor risked an angry backlash  after describing the economic crisis as ‘great fun’. At a time when thousands of Britons lost their jobs and struggled to pay their bills, Mervyn King appeared to be having the time of his life, as head of the UK’s central bank. Lord King said that it was ‘exciting’ working at The Bank of England as they battled to prevent a repeat of the economic depression of the 1930s. Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, described having 'fun' with Ben Bernanke when chairman of the US Federal Reserve . His admission comes at a time when the effects of the financial crash are still keenly felt around the world, with the eurozone still facing crisis. The economist fondly reminisced about his turbulent 10-year reign as the governor of the Bank as he guest edited Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday. He said he wanted his staff to ‘enjoy’ working during the financial crisis and said ‘moments when laughter plays a big role’. But he also issued a stark warning that Britain was not yet strong enough to withstand another economic meltdown, saying: ‘I don’t think we have yet got to the heart of what went wrong’. Interviewing the ex-chairman of the US Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke about working together during the crisis, he said: ‘It was great fun and fascinating to work with you during the crisis despite the fact we were dealing with really serious problems. ‘I hope the experience was also fun for you?’. Mr Bernanke denied it was fun, instead describing it as ‘challenging’ and ‘incredible stimulating’. ‘Fun wouldn’t be quite the right word’, the American said, adding that while it was ‘very satisfying’ to help to solve the world’s financial problems, but was ‘not an experience I would voluntarily repeat’. Lord King, as head of the Bank's monetary policy committee between 2003 and 2013, was at the heart of the response to the global crash as he was in charge of setting Britain's interest rates and controlling the supply of money. The peer revealed that once US banking giant Lehman Brothers collapsed in late 2008, triggering the beginning of worldwide economic collapse, he found the crisis easier to handle. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It was exciting and it was fascinating and it was the sort of problem that we had trained to deal with over many years.’ The two men exchanged memories about the boring meetings and 'fun' had during the financial crisis, which saw the collapse of US banking giant Lehman Brothers in late 2008 . But Lord King suggested that, while Britain was on the road to recovery, it was not yet able to survive another economic crisis. He said: ‘We have made the banking system safer, that is true, but is it really safe enough? ‘Would we survive another big financial crisis which could yet come? ‘I don’t think we are yet at the point where we can be confident that the banking system would be entirely safe.’ He added: ‘I do not think that the next financial crisis will come from the banking sector. ‘I think it will come from somewhere else, but who knows where it will be.’","Mervyn King appeared to be having the time of his life during crisis .

"A baby boy has been born with three arms due to a rare condition which affects one in a million infants. The baby was born with his right arm in the normal place, but two arms on his left side. He was brought to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital in Gujarat, India, in December, where doctors carried out a procedure to remove the extra limb when he was just over two weeks old. The boy, who is originally from Bhavnagar, also in Gujarat, suffers from a rare condition called Polymelia, which causes a person to be born with extra limbs, often arms or legs. Scroll down for video . A baby boy from Bhavangar, in Gujarat, India, was born with three arms (pictured) due to due to a condition called Polymelia. It affects just one in a million infants, causing them to be born with extra limbs . The boy was rushed to specialists at a hospital in Ahmedabad, also in Gujarat, India, where he underwent a succesful operation to remove his extra limb. He is pictured after the procedure . The rare disorder occurs in the womb when the cells form abnormally during embryonic development. The embryo begins to develop as conjoined twins. But one twin stops growing, leaving the remaining developments - often limbs - of the undeveloped twin attached to the body of the live baby. There are very few known cases of Polymelia around the world. A CT scan at the hospital revealed the boy was also born with a club foot, was missing a kidney and one of his testicles was inside his stomach, the Ahmedabad Mirror reports. The boy, who was born to diamond worker Ramesh Makwana and his wife, was originally taken to Bhavnagar Civil Hospital. Baffled doctors referred the case to specialists at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, nearly 200km away. In Ahmedabad, Dr Rakesh Joshi, head of paediatric surgery at the hospital performed a procedure to remove the extra limb on Wednesday, December 17. Before carrying out the procedure, Dr Joshi told the Ahmedabad Mirror: 'We realised that apart from the extra arm on the left side and baby had a right club foot and a missing kidney. Polymelia is a rare birth defect that only affects only one in a million infants and causes sufferers to be born with extra limbs. The rare disorder occurs in the womb when the cells form abnormally during embryonic development. Sometimes an embryo started as conjoined twins, but one twin degenerated completely except for one or more limbs, which end up attached to the other twin. There are very few known cases of Polymelia around the world. In 2005, a baby girl named Destiny was born with a fully formed extra leg in Detroit as a result of a conjoined twin not fully developing in the womb. In March 2006, a baby boy identified only as Jie-jie was born in Shanghai with a fully formed third arm. In July 2007 a child was born with four legs at the Lebowakgomo hospital outside Polokwane in South Africa. Most well known is the case of Lakshmi Tatma who was born with eight limbs in India in 2005. Two years later in 2007, doctors at Bangalore's Sparsh Hospital in Bangalore, India, successfully removed her extra limbs . They would also straighten the club foot by putting it in plaster, he said. He added that a lack of a kidney will not hamper the child's health or his ability to lead a normal life. The baby boy's father told the newspaper: 'We have a daughter. We were hoping for a baby boy to complete our family and were happy when our son was born. 'But when we came to know about his condition, we were worried - all we wanted was a healthy baby. 'However the doctors have assured us our son will be alright.' The boy will now have to undergo physiotherapy for his functional left hand and his club foot. In 2012 MailOnline reported on a newborn girl from Pakistan who was born with a third arm due to Polymelia. The extra arm was joined to her back near her spinal cord. At just four years old the baby girl, who was from the Dera Ghazi Khan District in the Punjab province of Pakistan, underwent an operation to remove the extra arm. She is among a handful of patients worldwide who suffer from Polymelia. In the same year, a three-year-old boy from Peru underwent an operation remove the body of a 'parasitic twin growing inside of his stomach. The most well known case of the condition was Lakshmi Tatma, from India, who was born with eight limbs. A parasitic twin who had stopped developing and died in the womb was attached to her body. Doctors removed the extra limbs in 2007. The baby was born with his right arm in the normal place, but two arms on his left hand side. There have only been a handful of cases of Polymelia reported worldwide . The boy was also born with a club foot, was missing a kidney and one of his testicles inside his stomach.

"In yet another Christmas tragedy, the teenager who had his legs severed by a train on the New South Wales mid-north coast four days before Christmas  has died. On Tuesday police said Adrian Simon died at John Hunter Hospital on Christmas Eve, three days after he was hit by a train after he fell asleep on the tracks. ABC News reported that the 18-year-old was asleep on the tracks at a railway crossing near Taree on December 21, police said. He had been celebrating his 18th birthday and was hit by a train at about 4:30am, severing both his legs. Scroll down for video . An 18-year-old has had both his legs cut off when he was struck at a railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast . When the accident happened the 18-year-old's father allegedly attacked the ambulance vehicle after they arrived to save his son. Police officers and paramedics who arrived on the scene were forced to take refuge in the train driver's cabin, along with the 33-year-old train driver, after they were hurled with rocks by a group of people. Paramedics were also blocked, pushed and verbally abused by the group during their initial attempts to treat the teen, and an ambulance vehicle was damaged from the rocks. Taree Inspector Allan Fidock told Daily Telegraph the father of the victim 'smashed the windscreen of the ambulance'. 'Today the father has been better to us and is apologetic for his actions,' he said. 'We are trying to find people and get an ID on a couple who threw rocks and smashed windows. 'It is horrific to have to deal with that and then deal with alcohol-induced friends and family. And they are having a go at the cops and ambulance officers. Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast . 'Initially we had two officers out there. We had to close the station down then because we had five people (at the scene). 'Then there was three or more police who rushed out there when they started in the morning. All up there would have been a maximum of eight police.' The 18-year-old, who was celebrating his birthday with family and friends, was taken to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition. The train driver,  from Queensland, who managed to stop the train soon after the accident and contact emergency services, was taken to Manning Base Hospital for mandatory blood and urine testing. A crime scene was established and specialist officers attended the location and an investigation is currently underway into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Police will also examine the actions of the group of people who threw rocks. Police reinforcements were called and a number of other officers attended the location and dispersed the group. No one was injured as a result. Emergency services found the man on the tracks with his legs severed, at about 4.30am on Sunday. He was taken to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition .

"From fossilised iguanas to Obama's head, conspiracy theorists appear to have found all manner of things on Mars. And now an alien coffin can be added to the list, after one Maryland-based UFO hunter spotted what he believes to be a 'decorative' box on the red planet. The 'coffin' was discovered by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. Scroll down for video . The so-called 'coffin' was found by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. The image pictured inset has been edited . 'This little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner,' he wrote on his YouTube channel. 'As well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions.' Alien researcher Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily said he believes the coffin was made from a stone-like substance. 'What would it take to get Nasa to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box?,' he said. Can you spot the coffin? Alien researcher Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily said he believes the coffin was made from a stone-like substance . 'What would it take to get Nasa to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box?,' said Mr Waring. But while it has captured the imagination of UFO bloggers, scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a phenomenon called pareidolia - a psychological response to seeing items in random places . Many scientists believe that seeing strange objects, such as a 'coffin' on Mars, is simple a case of pareidolia. This is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary’s face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. 'It looks to be about 3.2 ft (one metre) across and 1.5ft (0.4 metres) wide and high. 'Lots of alien species are short, including a species of grays.' UFO researchers use the term 'grays' to describe alien visitor with an oval shaped head and large eyes – similar to the depiction shown in the film 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. But while its strong lines have captured the imagination of UFO bloggers, scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places. It has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment, and to help them recognise friends in a crowd. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. However, Mr Farrar isn't convinced. 'We're not being told a whole bunch of stuff, so I don't know what the truth is here,' he said. 'In reality UFO enthusiasts just spend far too much time searching Nasa images for the slightest glimpse of anything weird and finding proof that fits their own ideas,' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual told MailOnline. 'In addition to the discovery of this coffin, way back in March 2014 'Truthseeker' posted on Youtube a picture taken by the Curiosity rover that seemed to show a cross, which he thought was connected to a religious ceremonial religious structure. Mr Waring suggests the coffin may hold a species of grays.  UFO researchers use the term 'grays' to describe alien visitor with an oval shaped head and large eyes - similar to the depiction shown in the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (pictured) 'He went on to speculate that it marked the position of a tombstone and claimed to have seen other images of the cross on the Martian surface. Christian worshipping aliens on Mars? 'The possibilities are intriguing but there isn't much firm evidence except that it does underline the adage that ""seeing is believing"".' The find follows a similarly bizarre claim made in November, when a lady claiming to be a former Nasa employee said she had seen humans on Mars. The woman, named 'Jackie', called into American radio station, Coast to Coast AM, with a 'confession' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979. Other objects found in images of Mars include what some UFO hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana (left). Stock image of an iguana is pictured right . Jackie said she was working as part of a 'downstairs' team downloading telemetry from a Viking Lander when she saw the humans via live feed. 'I wonder if you could solve a 27-year-old mystery for me,' she asked the presenter. 'That old Viking rover was running around. 'Then I saw two men in space suits - not the bulky suits we normally used, but they looked protective. They came over the horizon walking to the Viking Explorer.' Earlier this year, Dr John Brandenburg, a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies, said he believes an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. Dr Brandenburg claimed ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. He claimed his theory could explain the Fermi Paradox - namely why, if the universe is abundant with life, we haven't heard anything from anyone else yet. Earlier this month, UFO enthusiasts claimed to have spotted Barack Obama's head on the Martian surface. They say a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the Spirit rover shows a rock shaped uncannily like his head .","'Coffin' was found by Will Farrar on an image taken by Curiosity rover .

"Former Labor government Minister Gary Johns says people on welfare payments should take contraception or lose their right to any benefit payments. He told Daily Mail Australia that the radical proposal would apply to anyone applying for unemployment payments (or other government assistance) and they must provide proof from a doctor of their contraception plan or forfeit access to the taxpayer money. Writing in The Australian newspaper Mr Johns, who was a former Minister in the Keating Labor Government, stated that 'if a person's sole source of income is the taxpayer, the person, as a condition of benefit, must have contraception'. Scroll down for video . Former Labor government Minister Gary Johns says people on welfare payments should take contraception or lose their right to any benefit payments . Mr Johns told Daily Mail Australia that 'of course all parliamentarians should consider this. People assume that someone has a right to a benefit, but all benefits come with obligations and this is another obligation and not a particularly difficult one' He also wrote that 'such a measure will undoubtedly affect strugglers, it undoubtedly will affect Aboriginal and Islander people in great proportions, but the idea that someone can have the taxpayer, as of right, fund the choice to have a child is repugnant'. In his column he cited the Cairns massacre as an example, 'a single mother with nine children from five fathers ... better this woman had fewer children'. However, he told Daily Mail Australia that did not mean he thought the tragedy would have been avoided had his plan been in place. 'We simply use this as an example but I don’t suggest I know all the background,' Mr Johns said. 'It is highly probable that a person who would have fewer children and indeed is left on her own to bring them up would be better served if they were given access to long term contraception. 'I cannot make an explicit connection to that case but we all know of other instances of very large families. It was a terrible situation (in Cairns).' The mother of seven of the children and aunt to the eighth, Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, 37, has been charged with eight counts of murder. The father of three children (second from right) who were among eight children allegedly murdered by their mother, attends a memorial service in Cairns . The tight-knit community in Cairns has been devastated by the murders of eight children. Gary Johns wrote in defending his call for no dole payments to those who don't take contraception 'better this woman had fewer children .. better men on benefits also could be prevented from having children' Mr Johns, 62, was Special Minister of State in the Keating Government. As for how such a plan would be implemented, he stressed it would be for new applicants only. 'This is the first point,' he said. 'While we wish men to be responsible, we do know that women can access certain contraceptive drugs. 'So when a person applies for a benefit you have to bring along a note from the doctor, that I have now taken the following drug, and will remain on it while I am on the dole. 'Most people are not on the dole for that long, that’s a simple thing, and this is about making people make the connection in their mind .. to say ""hello, I am in strife here"" and it's not about getting money for having a child. 'They must know that falling pregnant while on a benefit can harm me. I am actually interested in the kids already born into a poor family.' 'It is simply a conversation that we need to have, it's about inter-generational poverty.' Mr Johns has called for bi-partisan support. 'Of course all parliamentarians should consider this. People assume that someone has a right to a benefit, but all benefits come with obligations and this is another obligation and not a particularly difficult one. 'For some women they may not know the access they can have to contraception.' As to when benefits would be cut off should parents fail to adhere to such an agreement. 'You would always err on the side of generosity but not to the point where you nullify the whole effect, this is not about punishing. 'There is plenty of support (for his proposal) .. this just needs a calm conversation and I think we will have it, people are thinking bloody hell what do we do and we are getting a little bit sick of the next charitable group coming forward and saying give me more money. 'What we are saying now is what about an ounce of prevention?'","Gary Johns says that if you can't prove you are on contraception plan then you don't get dole payments .

"Several major fashion retailers have been busted for marketing their items as 'faux fur' when in fact they are crafted from real animal pelts. In an investigation led by NBC's Rossen Reports, stores including Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom Rack Gilt Groupe and Belk were found to be selling mislabeled jackets, sweaters and boots from brands including Michael Kors, Aquatalia, Jacadi and Cluny. Tests performed at the Microtrace Laboratory in Chicago proved that all four of the 'faux fur' items purchased and examined under the microscope contained real fur from coyotes, rabbits and raccoon dogs. Busted: This Cluny sweater (left) was advertised by Nordstrom Rack as being 'faux fur-trimmed' but is in fact  rabbit fur, and this Michael Kors coat (right) was described by Belk as being 'faux' but is actually coyote fur . All the brands concerned issued statements in which they apologized for their actions and unanimously declared these hiccups were clerical errors rather than deliberate deceptions. Nordstrom Rack pointed out that the Cluny 'faux fur-trimmed sweater' it sold had the correct 'real fur' label sewn in, but a website copywriter had wrongly described it as 'faux' on its site. Gilt Groupe referred to the 'inaccurate description' of its Jacadi faux fur-trimmed jacket as 'a result of human error by a Gilt staffer.' The fur was in fact from a raccoon dog. Jacadi added that it would no longer be selling real fur after its Winter 2014 collection. Neiman Marcus blamed its vendor Aquatalia for mislabeling a pair of 'faux fur-trimmed boots.' Aquatalia confirmed that 'a small quantity of rabbit fur boots were mislabeled' as a result of an 'inadvertent error.' Belk admitted it had sold six Michael Kors coats which were labelled as 'faux' but were in fact made from real fur, again due to a 'clerical error.' Caught red-handed: Neiman Marcus blamed its vendor Aquatalia for mislabeling a pair of 'faux fur' boots (pictured) for which Aquatalia apologized, citing an 'inadvertent error' Pierre Gryzbowski, who runs the Humane Society of the United States' fur-free campaign, isn't convinced. 'Some of the good faux furs can be more expensive to use when making jackets or other garments than low-quality animal fur,' he explains. 'They may use animal fur just because it's cheaper.' He added: 'It's outrageous. We're talking products made from animals who probably suffered, and certainly died, for a product that is not even what the customer wanted.' U.S. animal advocacy nonprofit Born Free, states that more than 50 million animals are violently killed for use in fashion every year. According to the Fur Information Council of America however, the fur industry is entirely justifiable due to it being a 'historically significant' trade and 'a highly desirable consumer product.' Proven: Tests performed at the Microtrace Laboratory in Chicago (pictured) proved that all five of the 'faux fur' items purchased and examined under the microscope contained real fur . U.S. fur sales for 2013 were $1.39 billion – a ten per cent increase over the previous year. Still, according to a May 2014 Gallup poll, nearly 100 million Americans said they considered buying and wearing real fur to be 'morally wrong.' NBC's latest expose is just the latest in a string of similar 'mislabeling' incidents regarding the sale of faux fur. In September, Kohl's was found to be selling coats labelled as 'faux fur' but actually made from raccoon dog pelts. The retailer predictably apologized, blamed its vendor and stopped selling the coats. Ours to wear? Jacadi's 'faux fur' coat was found to be made from raccoon dog fur (left), while a mislabeled Michael Kors coat was made from coyote pelt (center) and Aquatalia used rabbit (right) And last year, the Federal Trade Commission charged Neiman Marcus with the same offense, after which Neiman Marcus settled and promised not to do so again. In a statement to MailOnline, PETA said: 'Companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are not misleading customers who don’t want to support animals being bludgeoned, electrocuted, or skinned alive for their fur. 'PETA’s advice is that if there’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux, it’s best just to avoid it altogether.'","Four 'faux fur' labelled items were purchased from various online stores by NBC's Rossen Reports and then examined in a laboratory .

"Police and paramedics have come under attack again, less than a week after emergency services workers were pelted with rocks while trying to save a man whose legs were severed by a train. A 17-year-old man has been charged after allegedly bottling a 22-year-old in the eye at a party in Bourke, in the central west of New South Wales. But police allege partygoers hurled bottles at officers and paramedics as they tried to rush the man to hospital to save his sight. The man is now blind in his left eye. Scroll down for video . An 18-year-old has had both his legs cut off when he was struck at a railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast . Last week, the father of a teenager whose legs were cut off by a train allegedly attacked an ambulance as it arrived to save his son. Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast to find the 18-year-old on the tracks with his legs severed at about 4.30am on December 21. But police officers and paramedics who arrived, were forced to take refuge in the train driver's cabin, along with the 33-year-old train driver, after they were hurled with rocks by a group of people. Paramedics were also blocked, pushed and verbally abused by the group during their initial attempts to treat the teen, and an ambulance vehicle was damaged from the rocks. Taree Inspector Allan Fidock told Daily Telegraph the father of the victim 'smashed the windscreen of the ambulance'. 'Today the father has been better to us and is apologetic for his actions,' he said. 'We are trying to find people and get an ID on a couple who threw rocks and smashed windows. 'It is horrific to have to deal with that and then deal with alcohol-induced friends and family. And they are having a go at the cops and ambulance officers. Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast . 'Initially we had two officers out there. We had to close the station down then because we had five people (at the scene). 'Then there was three or more police who rushed out there when they started in the morning. All up there would have been a maximum of eight police.' The 18-year-old, who was celebrating his birthday with family and friends, was taken to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition. The train driver,  from Queensland, who managed to stop the train soon after the accident and contact emergency services, was taken to Manning Base Hospital for mandatory blood and urine testing. A crime scene was established and specialist officers attended the location and an investigation is currently underway into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Police also planned to examine the actions of the group of people who threw rocks. Police reinforcements were called and a number of other officers attended the location and dispersed the group. No one was injured as a result. Emergency services found the man on the tracks with his legs severed, at about 4.30am on Sunday. He was taken to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition .

"Most of us will have been caught out when our smartphone runs out of battery at the worst moment. But soon, taking a walk could solve this problem thanks to the development of an insole that converts steps into electricity. The SolePower Ensoles claim to provide two-and-a-half hours of phone charge from a one-hour walk - and they could soon be sold in shops. The SolePower Ensoles, which are currently under development and are intended to fit inside everyday shoes (illustrated), claim to provide two-and-a-half hours of phone charge from a one-hour walk . The insoles are currently under development and are intended to fit inside everyday shoes. They connect to a power pack fitted outside the show, and collects kinetic energy using a mechanism that converts linear motion - generated while walking - into rotational motion, which is capable of spinning a generator. The insoles fit into shoes and the wire is wrapped through the laces. The charging wire from the insole is plugged into the battery pack, which sits outside the shoe - either fastened around the ankle, or clipped onto the top of the footwear. An embedded mechanical system inside the soles generates the electricity. During the heel strike of each step, kinetic energy of the foot is transferred into the mechanical system. This uses the energy to spin a micro-generator. Wearers walk for an hour to generate two-and-a-half hours’ worth of power for a smartphone. When the battery pack is charged, it can be unclipped from the shoe and connected to a smartphone, or other device using a USB cable. The device is set to go on sale soon. Davit Davitian, head of business development for SolePower, explained: ‘Our EnSoles have an embedded mechanical system inside of them, which is what generates the electricity. ‘During the heel strike the kinetic energy of the foot is transferred into the mechanical system, which uses it to spin a micro-generator.’ This generator allows power to be built up in an external battery pack connected by a cable, called a PowerPac, tied onto the laces so it sits on top of a shoe. It contains a USB port, allowing a variety of items to charge off it, including smartphones. Mr Davitian said: ‘The PowerPac is attached to the shoelaces, as you walk you are charging the PowerPac. ‘When you wish to charge your phone, you simply detach the PowerPac from your shoelaces and plug into the available USB port.’ The SolePower company is a spin-out from Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania, which received $60,000 (£38,591) of money from a 2013 Kickstarter campaign. While the insole is still in the design phase, the company intends on launching it ‘as soon as possible’. The insole connects to a power pack (pictured) and collects kinetic energy, with a mechanism that converts linear motion - generated while walking - into rotational motion, which is capable of spinning a generator .

It contains a USB port, allowing a variety of items to charge off it, including smartphone (illustrated left) It is not the first time designers have attempted to harness power produced by walking in order to charge devices. In 2013, mechanical engineering students from Rice University in Houston, Texas, created a prototype shoe capable of charging a mobile phone. Their PediPower shoes featured a shoe-mounted generator instead of an insole, which they designed to charge medical equipment in remote areas of the world. The prototypes delivered an average of 400 milliwatts, which is enough to charge a battery through what looked like a metal heel, attached to the back of the shoe. It is not the first time designers have attempted to harness power produced by walking in order to charge devices. A team of engineers from Rice University (pictured) created a shoe with an unusual heel attachment designed to generate electricity needed to charge medical equipment in remote areas . A Manchester-based company called Nifty is raising funds on crowd funding website Indiegogo to put its leather XOO Belt into production. It looks like a normal belt, but can recharge gadgets while they are safe in a user's pocket, because the buckle incorporates a charger that is held in place by magnets so it can easily be connected and disconnected. The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours. The XOO Belt can recharge your smartphone (pictured) and other electronic devices while they are still safety hidden away in your pocket, so you never run out of power when you need it . The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which itself contains a new type of flexible battery, which its makers claim is the first of its kind in wearable technology. There are six overlapping layers of this Lithium Ceramic Polymer flexible battery sandwiched between the belt leather. The company also says that it is weather resistant and durable.","Ex-students of Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania, invented insole .

"Personal drones proved one of the most popular Christmas gifts this year but owners are now discovering just how difficult it can be to successfully fly them. Since Christmas morning many people have taken to social media to share their experiences which in a lot of cases have resulted in drones getting stuck in trees, lost, broken or even injuring someone. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, drone-related incidents increased throughout 2014 and the number is only expected to get worse in the coming months. Scroll down for video . Since Christmas morning many people have taken to social media to share their experiences which in a lot of cases have resulted in drones getting stuck in trees, lost, broken or even injuring someone . Learning to fly a drone — flying devices that often carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers — is something that requires some time and patience say experts. 'To properly know how to use the system, I would say you need about two weeks, 20 hours a week,' said Adam Gibson, boss of Ctrl.Me, and a professional who regularly organizes training sessions for beginners. To avoid accidents, you need to both be able to pilot it and configure it correctly in the first place. If it is not set up right, the machine risks crashing. 'A lot of the crashes that we see are from not properly calibrating the compass or it could also be that someone has painted it and when they paint it, it interferes with the GPS,' said Gibson. Last year Best Buy sold just one kind of drone, but this year it has expanded its selection to eight different models in stores and five more online because of rising demand. BHPhoto.com now offers 140-plus models online that range from $50.99 to $6500. Amazon alone is selling 10,000 drones per month and says the Parrot's $160 MiniDrone Rolling Spider and DJI's Phantom 2 Vision+ Quadcopter, which costs about $1,000, have been 'popular sellers.' Ahron Young tweeted this photo on Christmas Day along with the words 'Dad flew his new drone over the fence. Father = son' Michael Perry, spokesman for DJI, which makes the popular Phantom 2 Vision+ and new Inspire models, said demand for drones has moved 'pretty dramatically out of being a pretty niche field into more of a consumer electronics field.' Safety concerns have grown with the popularity of drones. In Belgrade in October, a drone carrying a banner over a soccer field ignited an on-field brawl. A plane in London's Heathrow airport had a near-miss with a drone in December. And in October an Oregon man pleaded guilty to violating a ban on drones in national parks by flying a one near bison and over Yellowstone's Midway Geyser Basin. Drone makers say they have put safety measures in place to prevent accident. All drones are recommended for use in large open areas, not near crowded spaces. DJI said its latest drones have an automatically capped height of 400 feet, even though technically it could go up to 1200 feet. Geosensors also won't let the drones fly close to any major airports. Parrot, which makes the $500 BeBop drone, also ensures drones do not go above 400 feet. Scottwitty posted this photo on Instragram and wrote: '10 mins in and my brother is already fishing my nephews drone out of the tree #itschristmas' All three of the biggest personal drone makers — DJI, Parrot and 3D Robotics — have formed a coalition to lobby the FAA to help develop standards for personal drone use. 'It's important, no matter how small the drone is, to be aware of your surroundings, making sure you're not operating the drone in a fashion that would endanger anybody,' said former White House advisor Lisa Ellman. In addition, you have to be sure 'that you're not spying on your neighbors in your backyard,' she added. Drone industry officials have also teamed up with the U.S. government and model aircraft hobbyists to launch a safety campaign. The campaign includes a website — www.knowbeforeyoufly.com — which advises both drone operators of FAA regulations and how to fly their unmanned aircraft safely. The industry also said it plans to distribute safety pamphlets at industry events and work with drone manufacturers to make sure safety information is enclosed inside the packaging of new drones.

"Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov has pleaded not guilty to a felony domestic violence charge, setting the stage for a March trial. Voynov, 24, denied causing his spouse corporal injury with great bodily injury at his re-arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday . The Russian Olympian was arraigned after his arrest October 20 but had to go through the process again after a judge found earlier this month that there was enough evidence to proceed to trial. Scroll down for video . Denial: Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov has pleaded not guilty to punching and choking his wife during an argument in October. This image shows the NHL star in court during his arraignment Monday . Standing by her man: Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova, (pictured) wrote a letter to prosecutors saying her injuries were accidental and that her husband did not intend to hurt her . A preliminary trial date of March 2 was set, and Voynov is due back in court January 28 for a pretrial hearing. If convicted, he could face up to nine years in a state prison, reported The Daily Breeze Monday. The two-time Stanley Cup champ is accused of choking and hitting his wife and pushing her into a a flat-screen TV in their bedroom after an argument that began at a Halloween party October 19. A cut over her eye required eight stitches. Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova, wrote a letter to prosecutors saying her injuries were accidental and that her husband did not intend to hurt her during an argument, though a judge didn't accept that evidence during the preliminary hearing. The woman moved back with the hockey star a short time later. Voynov has been indefinitely suspended by the NHL while the case is pending. During a preliminary hearing two weeks ago, officer Gregory Wiist, of the police force in suburban Redondo Beach, said he spoke to Marta Varlamova in a hospital after the domestic incident in October. 'She was crying, sobbing,' Wiist said. 'I saw tears streaming down her face. She was an emotional wreck.' Wiist said Varlamova had a bleeding cut above her left eye and red marks on her neck and told him she was involved in a physical altercation with her husband. Sidelined: Voynov, who won two Stanley Cup championships with the Kings in 2012 and 2014, has been indefinitely suspended by the NHL . According to Wiist's testimony, Varlamova told him the couple argued at a Halloween party on the night of October 19, where Voynov punched her in the face. When they went home, the argument continued and Voynov threw her to the ground repeatedly, kicked her and choked her in an attack that continued until she was pushed into a television, suffering a cut on her head. Voynov, who took his wife to a hospital, was later arrested there after medical staff called police. Voynov, who has denied wrong-doing, was promptly suspended by the NHL, who fined the Kings $100,000 this month for allowing him to skate with the team during a practice. Voynov, of Chelyabinsk, Russia, won two Stanley Cup championships with the Kings in 2012 and 2014. The NHL star's attorney, Craig Renetzy, has said that the incident was no more than an accident. The couple were reportedly shocked when officers arrested Voynov at the hospital.","The 24-year-old Russian pleaded not guilty to felony count of corporal injury to a spouse with great bodily injury .

"Two Detroit men who became friends after being drafted for the war on the same day and who later served in the same infantry, were neighbors for almost two decades and didn't even know it. Dave Brown and Roger Watson trained together at FT. Hood in Texas after being drafted in 1966, and were combat engineer demolition specialists in the 9th Infantry. But the pair lost contact during the war. Roger Watson, left, and Dave Brown, who were drafted to the Vietnam war on the same day and trained together, were reunited recently when they learned they had been living next to each other for 18 years . After running into someone from Mr Watson's company, Mr Brown heard his friend had been injured. Mr Watson had been shot seven months into his tour on March 8, 1968 and had lost a kidney and several feet of his small intestine, as well as damaging his liver. Mr Brown later searched the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington for word of his training partner's fate, but never learned if he had survived the war. But just before Halloween this year - some 40 years after the pair had last seen each other - they crossed paths again, at a fence adjoining their Berkley properties. For 18 years the pair had lived nearly back to back without even knowing it. The reunion came about through Mr Brown's wife Peggy Brown, middle, who sparked up a friendship with Mr Watson through their shared interest in birds . The men had 'wondered' about each other for 40 years after losing touch, and exchanged war stories and went through old service pictures when they came together recently in Berkley . Mr Brown, 68, told USA Today of finding out about Mr Watson: 'I was absolutely delighted. 'I wondered about you for 40 years.' Mr Watson, 67, echoed his friends sentiment, saying he was 'almost shaken' as the pair exchanged war stories recently at Mr Watson's home. Mr Watson recalled being shot. Mr Brown spoke of the first body he encountered. Both men had since become husbands, fathers and grandfathers.

Mrs Brown had noticed her new friend's Purple Heart licence plate and his 9th Infantry Vietnam Veterans cap in the window of his car - observations she later shared with her husband. Then, during an email exchange about a picture of a hawk, Mrs Brown mentioned her husband had also served in Vietnam and Mr Watson realized she was talking about his old friend. After looking at photos of the pair as soldier, the newspaper reports that Mrs Brown wrote: 'This has to be coincidence of the century. Dave cannot believe all this and we've been here for 18 years in Berkley. What are the odds?' Mr Watson said he had only caught glimpses of his neighbor over the years. And both men said their gardens often blocked out each other's backyards. Mr Watson said: 'It's sort of amazing we've been neighbors this long.' Brown concluded: 'It's just great to see him alive. 'It makes me happy.'","Dave Brown and Roger Watson were drafted on the same day in 1966 .

The unidentified man, hailed by witnesses as a hero, was driving along a road in the city of Southlake near Dallas, Texas, when he saw  a driver attacking the female passenger . Video footage captured by witness Lindsey Bryant on her cell phone shows Nwaiwu stepping out of the vehicle and holding his hands up. She was sitting on a nearby intersection when she started filming and asked her sister Mistina Donald to call 911. Moments later, patrol cars arrived at the scene and pointed their guns at the unnamed man, but they then took Nwaiwu into custody. Donald told CBS DFW: 'It was intense not knowing whether bullets were going to start flying from either side of the street. 'It’s amazing that in this day in age that people are willing to reach out and help.' Police arrived moments later and ordered the motorists to surrender, however they later arrested the suspect in the red car . Bryant added: 'I hope more people see this and are willing to go the extra mile for someone who like this woman, didn’t have a voice and couldn’t speak up for herself.' Southlake Police Chief Steven Mylett said in a statement: While we commend this citizen's willingness to get involved in order to protect a victim of crime, the Southlake Police Department does not encourage the public to expose themselves in such a manner.' MacMichael Nwaiwu, 28 has identified as the man in the red car and is in Keller Jail facing charges of assault . He insisted that instead witnesses call 911. Nwaiwu was booked into the Keller Jell following his arrest for arrest. In a post on the Southlake Department of Public Safety's Facebook page, Mylett added: 'Preliminary investigation revealed the individual with the firearm had observed an assault in progress inside a vehicle; specifically, a man physically assaulting his female front seat passenger. 'The witness, a concealed handgun license holder, believed the female passenger to be in imminent danger of a felony offense. When both vehicles stopped, the witness exited his vehicle and confronted the suspect of the assault at gunpoint. 'Vehicular traffic stopped in both directions on FM 1709 until police arrived. 'The suspect of the assault, identified as MacMichael Nwaiwu was arrested at the scene and transported to the Keller jail. 'Due to the unusual circumstances in this case, the Southlake Police Department consulted with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office to determine if the witness had committed any violations of law. 'Based on the available information at the scene, the District Attorney's Office did not believe the witness violated any State law. The Southlake Police Department continues to investigate this incident and will work closely with the District Attorney's Office until this investigation is closed.'","The unidentified man was driving in Southlake near Dallas, Texas .

"Chinese Gmail users have been unable to access their accounts since Friday after the service was apparently blocked across the country. Google data shows real-time traffic to its email service in China dropping significantly on 26 December - and this traffic has not yet been restored. It has also been reported that users of Google's search engine have today been hit with the same issue. Gmail users in China have been unable to access their accounts since Friday. The block is said to be a move by the government to crack down on outside web services. However, the Foreign Ministry said it wasn't involved and added it was committed to providing a good business environment for foreign investors . It is said to be the latest move by the Chinese government to crack down on outside web services, but the Foreign Ministry has denied any involvement. Earl Zmijewski, vice president of data analytics at the New Hampshire firm Dyn, told the Washington Post the changes aren't accidental. 'This was deliberate,' Zmijewski says. 'It was pushed out to the whole country at once.' The gmail block was reported by GreatFire.org - a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group - and was later confirmed by Dyn Research group, and Google's Transparency Report. Google's report tracks and monitors ongoing disruptions to Google services around the globe. Traffic is shown rising and falling at normal levels in the build up to Christmas, before dropping at the start of Boxing Day, and plummeting further as the day went on. China has a history of censoring sites that have potential to distribute anti-government content. It has previously blocked services including Facebook and Twitter. In 2010, Google partially removed its search engine from the country after a cyberattack was linked to the accounts of human rights activists. Instead, the company routed users visiting its Chinese site through Hong Kong. Earlier this year, a number of Google services were disrupted ahead the 25th anniversary of of China's crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square on 4 June. GreatFire.org has blamed the latest Gmail block on the government, and Google said it has not been caused by a problem with its servers. However, the Foreign Ministry has denied any involvement. Users are still reporting problems this morning - but the exact number of affected accounts is not known. 'I think the government is just trying to further eliminate Google's presence in China and even weaken its market overseas,' said a member of GreatFire.org, who used a pseudonym. 'Imagine if Gmail users might not get through to Chinese clients. 'Many people outside China might be forced to switch away from Gmail.' And a Singapore-based spokeman for Google said: 'We've checked and there's nothing wrong on our end.' Almost all of Google's services have been heavily disrupted in China since June this year, but until last week Gmail users could still access emails downloaded via protocols like IMAP, SMTP and POP3. These had let people communicate using Gmail on apps such as the Apple built-in Mail app and Microsoft Outlook. The latest so-called block restricts access from an IP level, which means it catches people trying to access the service on any device or app when connected to a network. China has a history of remaining tight control over the web, and challenging services that appear disruptive to the ruling Communist Party's leadership. The country is host to the world's most sophisticated internet censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall of China. Google's Transparency Report (pictured) shows real-time traffic to Gmail dropping significantly on 26 December. Traffic is shown rising and falling at normal levels last week, before dropping at the start of Friday. Users are still reporting problems this morning, but exact number of affected accounts is not known . The block was reported by GreatFire.org - a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group - and was later confirmed by Dyn Research group on Twitter (pictured) Critics say China has stepped up its disruption of foreign online services like Google over the past year to create an internet cut off from the rest of the world. The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 4 June, 1989. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not know anything about Gmail being blocked, adding the government was committed to providing a good business environment for foreign investors. 'China has consistently had a welcoming and supportive attitude towards foreign investors doing legitimate business here,' she said. 'We will, as always, provide an open, transparent and good environment for foreign companies in China.' One way for companies and people to get around China's internet censorship is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) which allows unhindered access to blocked sites and services. 'It's becoming harder and harder to connect and do work in China when services like Gmail are being blocked,' said Zach Smith, a Beijing-based digital products manager at City Weekend magazine. 'Using a VPN seems to be the only answer to doing anything these days online in China.'","Gmail users have been unable to access accounts in China since Friday .

"At least 41 members of Boko Haram  have been killed in clashes with the army in Cameroon this weekend, the government said today. The Cameroonian army launched a series of air strikes and on-the-ground attacks on the  militant Islamist group after it crossed the border and seized a military base. President Paul Biya personally ordered the retaliation attack which forced Boko Haram  to flee the military base at Assighasia, a government representative said in a statement late Sunday. Fighting back: At least 41 members of Boko Haram, pictured is their leader Abubakar Shekau, were killed in several retaliation attacks by the Cameroonian Army this weekend . 'Fighter planes went into action for the first time since the start of the conflict on the Cameroonian side of the frontier, after several months of deadly cross-border Boko Haram raids', Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. 'After two strikes and heavy fire... the assailants fled the Assighasia camp... losing several fighters,' he said. Military operations were still under way, he added, saying that 'the toll from combat will be released once the operational evaluation is complete'. The extremists of Boko Haram, have made frequent raids into neighbouring Cameroon since they began their insurgency in northern Nigeria in 2009. Orders: The attacks against Boko Haram were ordered by Cameroon's president Paul Biya . Boko Haram tactics include massacres of civilians on both sides of the frontier, bomb attacks on state institutions and schools, and the razing of villages and mass kidnappings. Since early in 2014, the movement has sent growing numbers of fighters into Cameroon, prepared to battle the army head-on as well as attacking and intimidating villagers. On October 15, Boko Haram forces equipped with a captured tank and an armoured vehicle attacked a military base at Amchide, near the border, in a raid that killed several dozen civilians and eight soldiers, according to officials. The air strikes marked 'a new escalation in the Cameroonian response... to multiple enemy attacks by the Boko Haram terrorist group,' the statement said, but it also sent a signal to other countries. Cameroon's neighbours, together with former colonial power France, have long criticised the authorities for what they considered a passive response to the actions of the jihadist movement even as its members used Cameroonian territory to rest and buy food and weapons. When a French family was kidnapped in 2013, along with two Italian priests and a Canadian nun, President Biya sent major army reinforcements to confront the Islamists in 'Operation Alpha'. The hostages were freed this year in Nigeria. Some 2,000 Cameroonian troops patrol the far-north region, but security sources say that many more are needed because the area is so remote with a very porous border. Military sources accuse Nigeria's army of failing to do enough against jihadist forces who have taken control of large swathes of the northeast of the country.","Cameroon launched air strike on Islamist militants based in Nigeria .

"A young woman diagnosed with cervical cancer managed to save her fertility as well as beat the disease after ignoring doctors' advice and seeking a second opinion. Naomi Orme, 34, from Tamworth, West Midlands, feared the worst when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer just five months ago. Doctors said her only chance of survival was to have a hysterectomy to remove her womb – but this would ruin her chances of ever becoming a mother. Devastated - and desperate to keep her fertility  - Ms Orme began researching other options online. Scroll down for video . Naomi Orme, 34, had never missed a smear test, but noticed she was bleeding after sex, so went to her GP. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer five months ago. She is pictured here before being diagnosed . Ms Orme (pictured before her diagnosis) was told her only option of survival was a hysterectomy to remove her womb, which would leave her infertile. Devastated, she began researching other options online . She found she was eligible for a second opinion and for a trachelectomy procedure. This removes the cervix and upper vagina, but leaves the womb in place so doesn't harm fertility (she is pictured before surgery) The trachelectomy procedure to remove the cancerous tumour, is performed through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery.  Pictured are Ms Orme's scars following the operation, which was a success . She found she was entitled to a second opinion and that another operation existed that could cure her cancer but wouldn't destroy her chance of motherhood. Ms Orme eventually underwent a trachelectomy – a procedure which removes the upper part of the vagina and the cervix, but without damaging fertility as the womb is left in place. She documented her entire cancer journey through her blog and hopes that by sharing her story, other women will seek a second opinion. Ms Orme, an air hostess, said: 'I am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the New Year. 'I still don't believe I've actually managed to beat cancer. 'Since my diagnosis in July, I have had to battle with doctors to get the right treatment plan. 'If I wasn't so persistent about getting a second opinion, I would be infertile now. 'Beating cancer was always my main goal but I wanted children in the future and I knew deep down there was a way to keep my dream alive.' Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35. Ms Orme, who has never missed a regular smear test, first noticed something was wrong when she began bleeding after sex. Ms Orme is now in remission, meaning she is cancer free, but will have to go for regular check ups every three months for the next two years. She is pictured here as a bridesmaid, before being diagnosed . Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35, according to Cancer Research UK. Rates of the disease had decreased by nearly half between the late 1980’s until the early 2000s. But the last decade has seen an increase in rates in younger women. The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus virus, which is spread during intercourse. Worldwide, more than 527,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2012, with incidence rates varying across the world. Survival is higher in women diagnosed at a younger age. Ninety per cent of women diagnosed with cervical cancer under age 40 survive for at least five years. However women under 25 in the UK are not offered a smear test as cervical cancer is deemed so rare in women that young. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. However campaigners argue that with more young women suffering from the disease - the age should be lowered or smear tests at last be made available on request. She said: 'I'd had a smear test just eight months before so I wasn't too concerned but when it happened a second time I started to worry. 'I was living in Dubai at the time and two weeks later I booked in to see my regular doctor. 'Just weeks later I was diagnosed with cervical cancer, I booked a flight home the same day. 'I needed to be with my friends and family in England order to beat the disease.' Terrified, she had to wait a week for an MRI scan before she was told how advanced her cancer was. She said: 'I was luckily diagnosed with the early stages of cervical cancer but I still needed surgery to remove the tumour. 'I underwent a minor operation to remove the cancerous tissue from my cervix but doctors then found another deadly tumour. 'I was then told me that my only option of survival was to have a hysterectomy. 'I was devastated as I really want to be a mother one day and to have that suddenly ripped away from me was heart breaking.' She urges other women in the same situation to seek a second opinion and carry out their own research, as this is how she found out about the trachelectomy surgery that meant she could save her fertility. 'After seeking a second opinion I found that I could keep my fertility, I was so relieved I burst into tears, it was life changing,' she said. 'I had wanted a trachelectomy from the beginning of my cancer journey but surgeons recommended the minor operation instead. 'I am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the New Year,' she said. She is pictured (left) celebrating the good news (right) in hospital for her trachelectomy procedure . Ms Orme (pictured centre) just before her surgery, now urges other women to ask for a second opinion. 'If I wasn't so persistent about getting a second opinion, I would be infertile now,' she said . For some women with a very early cancer of the cervix, it may be possible to have a trachelectomy. In this type of surgery the cervix and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the rest of the uterus (womb) is left in place. The lymph glands in the pelvis are also removed. The operation may be done as an open operation of through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery . As the uterus is not removed, a trachelectomy allows for the possibility that the woman could have children. During the operation or during pregnancy, a stitch is made at the bottom of the uterus to keep it closed. There is a significantly higher chance of miscarriage or premature delivery after this procedure and the baby will be delivered early by Caesarean section. Trachelectomy is only suitable for women with early stage cancer of the cervix. This type of surgery is not common and is only done in Specialist Gynaecological Cancer Centres. Women interested in discussing this procedure should ask their gynaecologist to refer them to a specialist hospital. Source: Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust . 'If I had just been given what I thought was best in the first place I wouldn't of had to go through two operations and weeks of sleepless nights. She underwent the operation at the beginning of December and is now cancer free. She said: 'I was so happy when I found out on December 18 that I was in the clear. 'It was a miracle that I had managed to keep my fertility but I fought so hard to be given the right procedure. 'I hope other women read my story and seek a second opinion, I have changed my future. 'Even though I've recently separated from my husband I hope one day to have children and that has always been something I have dreamed of.' Ms Orme has documented her entire cancer journey online so she can help other women who are going through something similar. She said: 'I started my blog just days after I was diagnosed, I was keen to get my thoughts written down. 'My experience of avoiding a hysterectomy was a difficult one, in some cases it can't be avoided but I would always recommend researching your options as it can be life changing. She is now in remission, but will have regular check-ups every three months for the next two years. 'I can't wait to start 2015, I feel as though my life has just started over again and I'm excited to make plans for the New Year,' she said. 'When I was first diagnosed I never imaged I'd be cancer free and still able to have children just months later.'

"A tech wizard who set up a website helping people get cheap flight tickets is being sued by an airline. Aktarer Zaman, 22, from New York City founded Skiplagged.com last year which used the technique described as 'hidden city' ticketing. Now he is subject to a lawsuit by United Airlines and Orbitz Travel whom claim the strategy creates 'unfair competition', and are asking for $75,000 in damages. Aktarer Zaman, 22, from New York City founded Skiplagged.com last year which used the technique described as 'hidden city' ticketing . The site has a method which means customers can get lower fares by booking their final destination as a stop-over. For example if you wanted to fly from New York to Charleston, South Carolina, you would instead book a ticket to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and choose Charleston as the stopover. The strategy is only successful if you book a one-way ticket with no bags. It does not work for every single desired journey, but has the desired end result the majority of the time. Zaman, who was born in Bangladesh but grew up in Brooklyn, told CNN that he was expecting the lawsuit, but insists there is nothing illegal about his website and says he is just exposing an 'inefficiency' in the pricing system. He told the site: '[Hidden city ticketing] has been around for a while, it just hasn't been very accessible to consumers.' Zaman is currently working at a tech start-up and says Skiplagged is simply a 'side project'. Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Company, an airline consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y,  told the station travellers will still use similar techniques even if the site is shut down. Michael Boyd, President of Boyd Group International, said he worked for American Airlines as a ticket agent 30 years ago and was trained to look out for 'hidden city' ticket sales.

"One month after his owner died and willed him to be killed and buried with her, Bela the German shepherd had a new home where he can live out the rest of his life in peace. Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah this weekend after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio. Bela was rescued after animal lovers rallied to his defense and got a stay of execution for him early this month. Scroll down for video . Saved: Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Society in Utah this weekend after making the 1,700-mile cross-country journey from southern Indiana . Bela will be allowed to live out the rest of his life at the shelter, where he will be given special care and attention by the Best Friends handlers . Best Friends says Bela has a history of 'intermittent aggression,' but that he is otherwise a sweet, friendly dog . When his owner, Connie Lay, died on November 25, she said that he should be either sent to the Best Friends shelter or put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers. Ms Lay's attorney, Doug Denmure, said Ms Lay didn't have enough money to send her pet to Utah - so the only option was to euthanize him. News of Bela's fate was widely reported and sparked a #saveBela campaign on social media. Following outrage from the community, Best Friends stepped in and said the shelter would take Bela and have him transported to Utah. Mr Denmure now claims it was never his intention to have the dog put down. 'It was this lack of information and the unfounded social media backlash about Connie Ley, myself, and the provisions in her will about her pets, that caused the delay in resolving Bela’s future,' he said, according to a blog post from Best Friends. Bela was scheduled to be euthanized early this month but got a stay of execution following an outcry from animal lovers . Under Indiana law, Bela is considered property and his fate was entirely up to his owner Connie Lay . Bela was picked up by Best Friends and driven 1,700 miles to Utah after Christmas . However, Mr  Denmure never contacted Best Friends and the shelter learned about Bela's fate from media reports. Mr Denmure had previously told WCPO-TV that Bela was Ms Lay's property and was hers to 'dispose of' as she wished. 'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' he said. 'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.' Best Friends say Bela has a history of 'intermittent aggressiveness' and will need some special care. 'Bela’s situation is a poignant reminder that our animals are our family, and families need to plan for their pets who survive them,' the shelter's co-founder Francis Battista said. Cruel fate: Bela was due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month .","Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Society over the weekend after he was driven 1,700 miles from Indiana to Utah .

"Americans again named former First Lady Hillary Clinton as the woman they admire most in the world and sitting President Barack Obama as the most admired man in a repeat of last year's winners. Clinton has taken the top spot among women for the last 13 consecutive years, and Obama has topped the list of men for the last seven. Neither were as popular in Gallup's annual survey as they were last year, but they still managed to edge out other notable figures with 12 percent and 19 percent of the vote totals, respectively. Also making an appearance on this year's list were Princess Kate and potential Clinton presidential rival Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and progressive icon. Former First Lady Hillary Clinton and sitting President Barack Obama were again named the most admired woman and man in the world by Americans in Gallup's annual, year-end survey . Clinton has taken the top spot among women for the last 13 consecutive years, and Obama has topped the list of men for the last seven . The Duchess of Cambridge received just two percent of the vote, but she was still the favorite of more Americans than Warren and former First Lady Laura Bush, both of whom were mentioned by just one percent of Americans polled. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and actress Angelina Jolie were also acknowledged by two percent of respondents. Current First Lady Michelle Obama did only slightly better, claiming three percent of the vote. Nabbing the top spots after Clinton were talk show host Oprah Winfrey (eight percent), women's rights activist Malala Yousafzai (five percent) and former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice (four percent). Clinton, a probable 2016 presidential candidate, has long been admired by most Americans, beating out her competition in the last 17 out of 18 years and earning the distinction a total of 19 times beginning in 1993 during her husband's first year in the Oval Office. The last time she was dethroned was in 2001 when then-First Lady Laura Bush claimed first place three months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Clinton holds Gallup's record as the most-admired woman ever, having been ranked No. 1 more times than any other woman since the polling company began conducting the annual survey seven decades ago. In terms of total number of appearances on the top 10 list, however, Clinton comes in fifth with 23 showings. Outdoing her are Queen Elizabeth II with 46, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 34, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis with 28 and Oprah Winfrey with 27. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pictured here as they leave St Mary Magdalene Church  in Norfolk following the traditional Christmas Day service. Princess Kate was named as one of the top 10 most admired women in the world by Americans this year. Her husband, William, the future king of England, didn't break one percent of the vote . President Obama has made the list every year since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. Like most incumbent presidents before him, he has been named most admired man every year since he was elected president. He also received the honor during President George W. Bush's final year in office amid the financial crisis of 2008. Bush has been named to the most admired list more times than Obama, though, with 14 appearances in the top 10 compared to Obama's nine, so far. Evangelical preacher Billy Graham has charted on the most admired list of men more times than any other male since 1946 with 58 mentions. His popularity surpasses former Presidents Ronald Reagan, 34, Jimmy Carter, 28, Bill Clinton, 23 and George H.W. Bush, 20. He also beats out Pope John Paul II's 27 mentions. Graham came in fourth on the 2014 list with two percent behind Obama, Pope Francis (six percent) and Bill Clinton (three percent). Rounding out the latter part of this year's most admired men survey were George W. Bush with two percent and retired neurosurgeon and potential GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, physicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir all with one percent.","Clinton has taken the top spot for the last 13 consecutive years, and Obama has topped the list of men for the last seven .

"At-home DIY tattoo kits, otherwise known as 'stick and poke' tattoos, are predicted to be one of 2015's most popular cosmetic trends, despite official warnings from the FDA about the risks involved in at-home inking. According to fashion website Style.com, stick and poke body art, which is created by repeatedly puncturing the skin with a needle that has been soaked in tattoo ink, is set to be one of the New Year's biggest crazes, thanks in large part to a range of budget-friendly kits currently being sold through a variety of retailers for just $40. 'Tattoos are back and the coolest style to have is a stick and poke,' the website's shopping editor Steff Yotka wrote. Scroll down for video .

But the website's decision to encourage readers to try out the controversial trend has been met with outrage by some of its readers, who claim that DIY tattoos are 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous'. 'In no way should you be encouraging anyone to tattoo themselves that is inexperienced, outside of a sterile shop, and not done by a professional,' user Kayti Hurd commented on Style.com's Facebook page. 'Tattoos are lifelong markings, not some trend that you can ditch the next year when something new comes along. Shame.' Amy Jessica Lipson added: 'Style??!! Jailhouse tattoos are the antithesis of good style. (Or common sense for that matter.)' A spokesperson for the FDA told MailOnline that anyone wanting to try a stick and poke tattoo for themselves should first be aware of the risks involved in at-home inking. Steady hand: The art of stick and poke tattooing involves puncturing the skin repeatedly with a needle that has been soaked in special ink . 'The most commonly reported problem involves microbiological contaminants, which may be introduced into bottles of ink during manufacturing or packaging, or when the inks are being prepared for injection,' FDA press officer Lauren Sucher said. 'Injecting contaminated ink into the skin, using contaminated needles or poor site preparation may result in infections at the site of the tattoo that can spread throughout the body via the blood, a condition known as sepsis. 'These infections can be severe and require extensive treatment with antibiotics, hospitalization, or surgery. Symptoms of illness after receiving a tattoo include redness, swelling, itching or blemishes in the tattoo, or pain in the tattoo that does not go away. 'Once the infection has healed, the area may remain permanently scarred. 'Other potential health threats may include increased sensitivity to sunlight or exposure to toxic constituents present in some inks.' Let it go: Critics have hit out at the trend, claiming that it is 'ridiculous' and 'dangerous' Ms Sucher added that the FDA have already recalled a large number of stick and poke kits, after they were found to contain toxic inks or unclean needles. 'At-home tattooing can be more dangerous if the individual does not know how to select good quality inks and equipment including sterile needles,' she added. 'If purchasing kits online for home use, consumers should not use and should dispose of tattoo inks and tattoo kits that have been recalled. 'The consumer should know how to properly prepare the skin for tattooing and apply the ink. Proper pre- and post-tattooing hygiene and after care are important in preventing complications.' Stick & Poke, a popular DIY tattoo kit brand, also warns customers against the potential dangers of at-home body art, urging people to ensure they are protected against toxic inks, unclean supplies and dirty needles, some of the most common causes of infection. On its website, the company also offers a list of 'six things not to do when tattooing', which includes helpful tips such as: '[Don't] be drunk or under the influence of a state altering drug.'","'Stick and poke' tattoos are created by poking an ink-soaked needle into the skin .

"Treasure hunters are still flocking to a beach five months after an artist buried 30 pieces of gold worth £10,000 because more than two thirds of it could still be out there. Michael Sailstorfer hid dozens of 24-carat gold bars on Folkestone's Outer Harbour beach in Kent in August this year as part of an arts festival - but only eight have been found. Dozens of beach combers are seen walking the sands every day with metal detectors and spades in the hope of striking it lucky and finding one of the bars, which range in value from £250 to £500. Michael Sailstorfer hid dozens of 24-carat gold bars on Folkestone's Outer Harbour beach in Kent in August this year as part of an arts festival . Dozens of beach combers are still seen walking the sands every day with metal detectors and spades . But organisers have said that some of the gold may never be found because of the shifting sands and said even the artist couldn't find it all now. The project was so popular that sales of digging tools including trowels, shovels and spades increased by almost 500 per cent at the local B&Q store, and people were even spotted combing the sands on Christmas Day. Kevin Wood and his girlfriend Kirsty Henderson were the first to find one of the 30 gold bars hidden on the beach by the Berlin-based artist. Describing the moment he struck gold in August this year, Mr Wood, 28, said: 'My legs went from under me and I started shaking.

The gold rush project was so popular that sales of digging tools including trowels, shovels and spades increased by almost 500 per cent at the local B&Q store . 'I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half way home, we pulled over for a drink.' Ioannis Ioannou from project managers Creative Foundation, said: 'We know that eight people have come forward having found gold. 'We don't know how many more people have found some, but decided to keep quiet about it. 'Of course, as part of the project, people were entitled to keep the gold they found. 'An important piece of this project was that we will never know if there is more gold out there, or if it has all been dug up - I personally believe that there is more. 'Even the artist couldn't find it all now, because sand shifts, so there is no way of knowing where it has disappeared to.'

"A grand wooden staircase with connections to the famous Brontë sisters that was sold in auction in the 1950s has been tracked down to a family home in Long Island, New York. The Queen Anne staircase was sold off from Blake Hall in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, when the house was demolished in 1954 - and now a Brontë enthusiast has managed to trace it to  the other side of the Atlantic. Anne Brontë, the youngest of the sisters, worked as a governess at the house in 1839, looking after five of the children of the Ingham family. The Queen Anne staircase was sold off from Blake Hall in Mirfield, West Yorkshire (left) when the house was demolished in 1954 - and now a Brontë enthusiast has managed to trace it to a home in Long Island (right) Lifelong Brontë enthusiast Imelda Marsden, 68, who tracked down the staircase in Long Island, explained: 'There was Tom, aged six and Mary-Anne, who was about four or five. 'The story goes that Tom was a bit of a handful and used to do all sorts of nasty things and Anne Bronte had trouble controlling him. 'On one occasion, she tied the children to chairs. The family must have found out about this and they dismissed her the same year. She would have worked there for about nine months in all.' Imelda, known as the 'Miss Marples of Mirfield', said: 'The staircase was once part of Blake Hall and I can remember going there as a very small child. Anne Bronte, the youngest of the sisters, worked as a governess at Blake Hall (pictured) in 1839, caring for five of the Ingham family children. The building was demolished in 1954 and the staircase sold at auction . 'But the mansion was demolished and today it's a housing estate. Bits of it were sold to dealers and the staircase went to one in Kensington, London. Anne Brontë, the youngest of the sisters, worked as a governess at Blake Hall in 1839 . 'It was sold at auction to a Mr and Mrs Toppings, who had just built themselves a new house on Long Island and were in London looking for things to fill it with. 'They took the staircase and installed it in their house and there it stayed.' Opera singer Gladys Topping and her husband bought the staircase in 1958 for their new home in Quogue, Long Island. But six decades down the line no one knew if it was still in the house. Through tireless research, and the help of the Quogue Long Island Historical Society, Imelda managed to track the stairs down. In a strange twist to the tale, it was claimed Mrs Topping had seen the ghost of a woman on the stairs in 1962, believed to be Anne Brontë. The figure, her hair in a bun, was dressed in a long full skirt with a tri-cornered shawl. Mrs Topping was convincecd Anne's ghost had been exported 3,000 miles away with the staircase. Indeed, the discovery, which was aided by museum staff in New York, came as a complete surprise to the current owners of the building. Fellow Brontë enhusiast Hilary Wainwright said: 'The staircase represents a slightly more unusual connection between Mirfield and Anne Brontë. 'Some will know she worked as a governess at Blake Hall for nine months in 1839 and she depicts her experiences there in the first half of Agnes Grey, renaming the hall 'Wellwood' and the Ingham family the 'Bloomfields.' She wrote two novels, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (left). She died of tuberculosis on 28 May 1849 and was buried in Scarborough, North Yorkshire (right) 'That house was demolished in 1954 and, although the interior parts were dismantled and auctioned off, their fates were lost in the mists of time. 'With one exception. Due to a short article in the Mirfield Reporter back in the 1960s, the wonderful Queen Anne staircase, hand-carved in burled yew, went to a London dealer. 'He then sold it to Allen and Gladys Topping, an American couple he met at Kensington Antiques Fair in 1958 and they installed it in their house on Long Island, New York. 'The story goes that Mrs Topping saw a ghost on the stairs in 1962. Was it Anne? Who knows? The Bronte sisters (pictured l to r Anne, Emily and Charlotte) were part of a literary family, who lived in Haworth in Yorkshire in the 19th century . 'Having checked this much out, our 'Miss Marples of Mirfield' made inquiries abroad but things did not look promising. People seemed to think that the house had been lost in one of the many hurricanes that occur so commonly there. 'The breakthrough came when a keen local librarian suggested contacting the Quogue Long Island Historical Society and they tracked down the exact location of the house and contacted the current owner. 'Much to their joy they discovered that not only was the staircase intact but the current owner was unaware of its origins and delighted to invite them over to see it. 'Now Mirfield and Quogue are working together to document this little-known link between them with a view to incorporating it in the bicentenary celebrations.' The quirky find has come at an important time as preparations are being made to mark the bicentennial of the birth of Charlotte Brontë in 1816. A number of events are planned both here and in the U.S. to mark the occasion and now the staircase has been found, it is hoped it will become a part of it. Bronte bicentenaries are going to be celebrated from 2016 to 2020 starting with Charlotte Brontë's birthday on April 21, 1816 followed by Emily's on July 30, 1818 and Anne's on January 17, 1820.

The staircase was traced to Long Island in New York, some 60 years after it was sold at auction .

"Greece will hold a snap general election late January  after MPs today failed to vote for a new president sparking fears of a new eurozone crisis. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras had brought forward the presidential vote in a move he hoped would avoid a general election. But his gamble has backfired spectacularly with the government's candidate Stavros Dimas failing to win a majority after three rounds of voting. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras called a presidential vote in a bid to avoid a general election but his candidate  failed to poll a majority meaning an election will be held early next year . Under Greek law, a parliamentary election must now be called, leaving financial markets and Greece's European Union partners facing weeks of uncertainty that could undermine fragile signs of economic recovery and derail its public finances. It opens the door for the radical left-wing Syriza party which is currently ahead in the opinion polls on promises to to tear up Greece's bailout agreement with the EU, abandon  austerity  and renationalise key parts of the economy. Investors sold off Greek stocks Monday, with the Athens stock exchange's benchmark general index losing 7.3 percent in midday trading, after falling as much as 11.3 per cent just after the vote. In two previous ballots,  Dimas, 73, a conservative former minister and European environmental commissioner, won 160 and 168 votes, respectively. He needed at least 180 votes to win today but again won only 168. Radical policies: Syriza party leader, Alexis Tsipras has pledged to re-nationalise parts of the economy . Mr Samaras announced the election will be held on January 25. He gave a televised address just after the presidential vote, saying: 'The country has no time to waste. 'I am here to guarantee that the country continues on a safe course ... so that the sacrifices made and the (economic) recovery are not endangered.' But Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said the vote marked a 'historic day for Greek democracy'. 'When the majority of the people is determined to end the policies of the bailout agreements and austerity, then lawmakers can do nothing else than respond to their duty to keep in line with the will of the people. 'Today Mr Samaras's government, which for two and a half years plundered our society and had already decided and committed to take new measures, belongs to the past. With the will of our people, in a few days, the austerity agreements will also belong to the past.' 'They will be remembered by everyone, especially history.' Syriza, and its charismatic leader Alexis Tsipras triumphed at the European Parliament elections in May and are the current favourites to win a General election. Tsipras has promised to abandon the tough austerity measures that Greece has endured for the past two years, and renationlise parts of the economy, restoring wages and re-employing sacked public sector workers. A poll on Saturday by the Alco institute showed Syriza leading the government's New Democracy party by 3.3 points, a slightly narrower lead than in the previous poll. It put support for Syriza at 28.3 percent and for New Democracy at 25 percent. Greece has been making a slow and painful recovery thanks to record tourist receipts and the deficit has come down faster than in many other crisis hit countries from 15 per cent in 2009 to an expected three per cent in 2014. But a Syriza election win would likely mean Greece returning to policies of  unsustainable borrowing and could have a disastrous knock-on effect for the eurozone. Mr Tsipras said he had growing support in other countries struggling in the crisis. 'In Europe, sentiment is changing. Everyone is getting used to the idea that Syriza will be the government and that new negotiations will begin,' he wrote in his party newspaper on Sunday. The real prospect of a radical socialist party coming to power in Greece is terrifying many within the EU and has a damaging effect on markets. Greek stocks plunged at the opening on Monday ahead of a final parliamentary vote to choose a new president and avert a snap election that could bring a radical leftwing party to power. The Athens bourse sank 5.24 percent to 808.46 points shortly before the 1000 GMT vote. Ugly scenes: Petrol bombs are hurled at police during an anti-austerity protest  in central Athens in 2012 . In 2012 Greece was awarded €240million in bailouts on the condition in return for accepting tough austerity measures which saw thousands of government workers made redundant and the minimum wage slashed by 22 per cent. The move provoked widespread dissent with days of rioting which saw protesters clashing with police and hundreds of buildings being burnt down. Spyros Lykoudis, an independent who voted with the government in the second round before Christmas, said he was not optimistic that the parties would overcome their differences. 'Unless there is a surprise, unless a party changes its stance, I don't expect parliament to elect a president tomorrow given the current circumstances. 'Nothing can be ruled out, but parties are in any case preparing for elections.' Samaras, who spent much of Sunday following the dramatic rescue of hundreds of passengers from a burning ferry, has appealed to parliament to support his nominee. But having offered a deal to bring forward elections scheduled for mid 2016 to the end of next year, he ruled out new concessions to the opposition parties and independents expected to hold the key to the result.","Election to be held on January 25 with radical socialists ahead in the polls .

"Preston Pollard, a 23-year-old man from Texas, got behind the wheel of his Honda on Christmas Eve and set out on a 1,100-mile to visit the family of his ex-girlfriend. He was armed with a gun. More than 15 hours later, Richard Hutson, 36, was found shot dead and his 55-year-old wife, Mary Lou Hutson, was critically wounded inside their Ocala, Florida, home. In the early hours of Christmas Day, Pollard was discovered dead inside his car on Interstate 10 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his upper torso. Christmas Day tragedy: Police say 23-year-old Preston Pollard (pictured) drove for 16 hours from Venus, Texas, to Ocala, Florida, with the intent to gun down his girlfriend's parents . Torn apart: Richard hutson, 36 (right) was shot dead inside his bedroom, while his 55-year-old wife, Mary Lou Hutson (left) was left clinging to life after being shot on the doorstep . According to police, Pollard was driven by a desire to take revenge on his girlfriend's stepmother after the 18-year-old was unable to join him in Texas for the holidays. Pollard's father, Stephen Pollard, claimed the 23-year-old was not a violent or 'mean' person.' Mr Pollard said Preston had purchased a plane ticket for his girlfriend to come to Texas to spend the holidays with him, but when her plans changed, he decided to drive to girl’s home in Florida and get her. ‘Something went wrong,’ Mr Pollard told WFAA. ‘Nobody really knows what happened… They say he opened the door and started shooting. That doesn’t sound very likely to me. ‘Why would he drive all that way to kill somebody? He was driving that way to see his girlfriend.’ According to Preston’s father, the 23-year-old, a recent graduate of Air Force basic training Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in San Antonio, did not own a gun. Police say Preston Pollard reached the Hutson family’s home in Marion Oaks just after midnight on Christmas Day. Retaliation: Police say Pollard drove down to Florida to kill Mrs Hutson after her stepdaughter was unable to join him in Texas for the holidays . As Mary Lou Hutson, 55, came to the door, the 23-year-old allegedly opened fire on her, leaving the woman gravely wounded. He then moved on to her husband, fatally shooting Richard Hutson in the bedroom. Pollard’s girlfriend said when she heard gunfire in the house, she locked her three nieces and nephews in a bathroom and then jumped out the back window to go for help, according to ConnectAmarillo. Mary Lou Hutson was rushed to Ocala Regional Medical Center, where she remained in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery. Gravely wounded: Mrs Hutson has undergone surgery and remained in critical condition after the Christmas Day shooting that took her husband's life . Following the shooting, Preston Pollard got back in his blue 2002 Honda Civic car and drove off. Police spotted his vehicle at around 5.30am about 350 miles away from the crime scene on Interstate 10 in Okaloosa County and attempted to pull him over, prompting Pollard to turn the gun on himself. ‘He came to Marion County for the sole purpose to commit murder,’ said Lauren Lettelier, a spokeswoman with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department in Ocala. ‘And he wanted to kill the wife.’","Preston Pollard, recent graduate of Air force basic training, drove 1,100 miles from Texas to Florida to take revenge on girlfriend's family .

"The car ferry that caught fire in the Adriatic Sea killing ten people and injuring dozens more was found to have serious safety flaws during an inspection just 10 days ago. The Norman Atlantic was examined by the international maritime authority Paris MoU earlier this month and found to have faulty fire doors, too few life rafts and poor emergency lighting. The vessel, which was operated by Greek shipping company Anek Lines, was also criticized for its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency - raising serious questions over whether the tragedy could have been prevented. The news comes as Italian officials launch an investigation to establish whether the fire started in one of the many lorries transporting olive oil from Greece to Italy, or if the highly flammable cargo simply added fuel the flames and made the deadly blaze even more intense. Inspection: The Norman Atlantic (pictured) was examined by the international maritime authority Paris MoU just 10 days ago and found to have faulty fire doors, too few life rafts and poor emergency lighting . Details of the Norman Atlantic's 'grave failings' in regard to fire safety were published on Greek and Italian websites this morning, citing a inspection by Paris MoU officials on December 19. Six 'deficiencies' are understood to have been identified relating to emergency lighting, fire doors and  'life saving appliances' that were deemed not to meet international safety standards. Officials are believed to have given Anek Lines 15 days to amend the problems but there is not yet any indication as to whether they had been addressed by the time the ferry left Patros in western Greece on its doomed voyage to Ancona in eastern Italy. Trade unions have been quick to attack Greek shipping operator Anek Lines and Italian shipowner, Visemar Navigation Ltd, claiming corners were cut to increase profits. Trapped: Passengers, who were travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona, Italy, became trapped on the top decks as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts . A statement from four trade unions representing Greek shipping crews read: 'Once again, it is proven that shipowners' hunt for profit overrides the necessary measures for the protection of human life at sea.' 'As has been revealed behind the tragic shipwreck and fire there are serious failures in sea worthiness of vessels with painful consequences for passengers and ship workers,' it added. 'With the fire that broke out in the car decks of the Norman Atlantic the lives of 478 passengers was put at risk,' the four unions went on to say. Carlo Visentini, owner of Visemar, fought back however, saying his company had worked alongside the rescue operation and helped save the lives of several hundred people. An injured passenger is transported to hospital in the Italian port city of Bari after being rescued . In the southern Italian city of Bari, where many of those rescued from the Norman Atlantic were taken for treatment, Judge Giuseppe Volpe this morning opened an investigation into how the disaster occured, raising the possibility that individuals could be charged with 'culpable shipwreck.' The probe also aims to establish whether the fire could have started in one of the many lorries on board carrying a cargo of olive oil. Such claims are bound to raise questions over whether the correct procedures were followed to prevent the highly flammable liquid coming in to contact with naked flames, and if there was sufficient equipment was on hand that could have prevented a small fire becoming a deadly blaze. Trade unions have also raised the suggestion that the vessel may have been overcrowded, and there remains much confusion over exactly how many people were on board the car ferry. Italian coast guard teams at Brindisi harbour carry the body of on of those who died on board the ferry . This afternoon the Italian authorities said the total death toll for the disaster had risen to ten, adding that they they are checking to see if anyone else might still be missing. Italy's transport minister, Maurizio Lupi, said the total of 427 rescued included all 56 crew members. The original manifest listed 478 passengers and crew, with officials earlier saying they are unable to immediately explain why only 435 individuals had been accounted for. Lupi said it was premature to speculate on whether people were still missing, but suggested that there might have been some people who reserved a spot on the ferry but did not board. An official said that among the survivors, there were also people not listed on the manifest, indicating the possibility that some on board were traveling illegally. Specialist Italian coast guard are continuing to search the interior of the ferry amid flames and heavy rain, and five Greek helicopters, a Greek frigate and another ship are still in the area.","Norman Atlantic was found to have faulty fire doors and too few life rafts .

"Stunned shoppers were showered with sewage when an overfilled septic tanker blew up. The passers-by sought medical attention after having their faces covered in foul-smelling brown sludge in Hechi, China - and the owner of this shop was even less fortunate. He complained it would take a week to clean up after almost every item on sale was coated in thick, hazardous slurry. Sludge: Unsuspecting shoppers were showered with slurry when a septic tanker blew up in Hechi, China . Eyewitness Dong Tang told local television: 'I noticed some people gathered in the street and thought there had been a car accident. 'I wasn't really paying attention, but then the smell hit me. It was disgusting. 'Then I realised that a tank filled with some disgusting brown liquid had exploded, scattering it all over the street and the people who were shopping or walking past. 'At one of the shops, just about every item on display was covered in brown liquid. The shopkeeper was highly agitated. 'He complained that everything was ruined and said he needed to shut the business for a week to clean up the mess.' Stench: Some walked away from the scene covering their noses, while others sought medical assistance . Any hope of compensation looks futile however - because the firm which made the truck has blamed the firm which operated it, and vice versa. A spokesman for the company that handles the collection and storage of waste in the south western city said the incident was caused by a technical fault with the vehicle. The company said those affected should seek compensation from the vehicle manufacturer. The manufacturer, meanwhile, told local media that explosions typically result from poor maintenance and failure to follow the proper operating instructions. Police said the contents of the truck had mainly been from local sewers, but it also emptied septic tanks from public toilets from time to time. Spokesman Cai Chin said: 'No-one suffered physical harm, but many of those covered sought medical attention for fear that chemicals used in the cleaning process, or indeed diseases from the sludge, could cause harm to those affected by the blast.'

The Republican politician, who has represented his Staten Island constituency since 2011, initially said he would continue serving after admitting to hiding $1 million worth of wages and receipts from a Manhattan restaurant he partially owns. But now he says he will step down, allegedly as a result of a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner. The 44-year-old will leave office on January 5. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT . Change of heart: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm  plead guilty to a federal tax felony last week but said he would not resign his congressional seat. Now he says he step down after 'much thought and prayer' Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but copped to a crime after he won re-election . In a statement released Monday, Grimm said: 'After much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress effective January 5th, 2015. This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constituents, whom I care about deeply. 'The events which led to this day did not break my spirit, nor will of the voters. However, I do not believe that I can continue to be 100 percent effective in the next Congress, and therefore, out of the respect for the Office and the people I so proudly represent, it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life. 'It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the hardworking families on both sides of the Verrazano, and I am sincerely grateful for the love and support that I have received from so many over the past few difficult months. 'I have seen first-hand how extraordinary the people of this district are - their values, their love of community, and their care for each other in the best and worst of times - it is humbling. I am grateful, and I will always keep them in my prayers.' Boehner lauded Grimm's decision in a statement on Tuesday but did not address rumors that the New York representative was leaving Congress at his urging. 'Rep. Grimm made the honorable decision to step down from his seat in Congress. I know it was made with the best interests of his constituents and the institution in mind, and I appreciate his years of service in the House,' the GOP leader said. Grimm's resignation means Governor Andrew Cuomo must call a special election for New York's 11th congressional district. Prosecutors have suggested Grimm should spend 24 to 30 months in prison; Grimm's lawyer suggested 12 to 18 months to Federal Judge Pamela Chen. But a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com previously that the Republican lawmaker doesn't expect to go to jail at all. 'I'm going to get back to work and work as hard as I can,' Grimm said last week. His fate will be up to Chen when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring. Grimm entered a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.' Sentencing is months away – on June 8, according to the Associated Press. Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008. Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general. By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, Grimm avoided a trial that was scheduled to convene in February. Jurors would have heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010. He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him. Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. Upon leaving the court last week Grimm acknowledged his wrongdoing and apologized for his actions. 'I should not have done it and I am truly sorry for it,' he said, per AP. The confession was a far cry from Grimm's claims when he was first charged that prosecutors were on 'a political witch hunt.' 'I'm a moral man, a man of integrity,' he said at the time. The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election to a third term in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months. He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 percent margin to win a third term in office. If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer was expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation. The House Ethics Committee had let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turned. But given last week's admission, the committee may have been planning to throw him out. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been pressuring Boehner to confront Grimm and request that he vacate his seat. 'Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders’ continued complicity in letting Michael Grimm stay in Congress despite his guilt of felony tax evasion is a disservice to the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and a stain on the institution of the United States House of Representatives,' a statement from House Democrats' campaign arm said. Boehner 'owes it to the constituents and the Congress to make sure Michael Grimm doesn’t serve in this next Congress,' it continued. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had also called on Boehner to step in. According to the Associated Press, Grimm told reporters last week that he had spoken GOP leadership in the House but did not offer any additional details and again said he would continue to serve as long as he is able to. Asked a similar question during his re-election campaign in October, the two-term congressman said, 'Certainly, if I was not able to serve, then of course I would step aside.' Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes . The court case against Grimm centered on his investment in Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant. Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage. The government claims Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs. When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash. In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances. Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Barack Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28. The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.' Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol . Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment. But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked. 'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.' 'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded. 'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back. 'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.' Grimm apologized the following day. His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions. In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed.

"Sydney to Hobart yacht race competitors fished aviation headphones and an aircraft headrest out of the sea near where a light plane crashed into water in southeast Tasmania. Two men - pilot Samuel Peter Langford, 29, from Mount Nelson and photographer Timothy Peter Jones, 61, from Hobart - were on board the single-engine Cessna when it plunged into waters off the Tasman peninsula about 6.20pm on Monday. They had been taking photos of race yachts on the approach to Hobart, Tasmania. Police commander Tony Cerritelli said the plane was flying in less than ideal weather conditions and was just 300 metres from a race competitor when it went down. 'It was flying at around mast level and plunged nose-first into the water,' he said on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Tim Jones (left) and Sam Langford (right) were on board the single-engine Cessna when it plunged into waters . A Cessna 172 (stock photo shown) is believed to have crashed with two people on board while filming the Sydney to Hobart race . Race competitor Mistraal radioed for help as it rushed to where crew members saw the plane's tail disappear beneath the waves. The Mistraal team sent a mayday call, which has appeared on social media. 'Mayday, mayday, mayday. We have a plane in the water. Plane in the water at 43 14 147 50. This is Mistraal. Mistraal,' it said. The crew then radioed to say they were at the crash site. An oil slick has been found in the area and there is still oil coming to the surface, marine rescue services inspector Lee Renshaw said. A few 'unique' items have also been retrieved. Owner and skipper Simon Kurts and his Sydney to Hobart yacht Love and War is reportedly helping to search for the plane . 'It's a headrest, a set of headphones and a cover off one of the earpieces on aviation headphones with a boom microphone,' Insp Renshaw said. However, there has been no sign of the plane or the men as an extensive search continues. Waters in the area are up to 90 metres and too deep for divers. Police boats are using sonar and Insp Renshaw insisted the operation remains a search, not a recovery operation. 'We are pretty confident we can pinpoint the location of the aircraft.' Three-time winner Love & War joined in the initial search, along with Mistral, Enchantress, Inner Circle, Helsal III and Wax Lyrical. The crash is thought to have happened around 30nm from the race finish in the Derwent River in Hobart . Two Ambulance Tasmania helicopters continued the search on Tuesday morning, just after 6am. A statement from race organiser, Cruising Yacht Club Of Australia commodore John Cameron, said: 'We know of several yachts that were in the vicinity that may have diverted to render assistance.' The Cessna 172 is owned by Airlines of Tasmania, the ABC reports. The managing director of Airlines of Tasmania, Shannon Wells, said there were two people on board the plane 'which was conducting aerial photography of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race'. 'At this time our thoughts are with the families of the persons on board,' he told the ABC.","The Cessna was filming the yachts as they sailed past the Tasman Peninsula .

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was booed today by the newest members of the New York Police Department as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony. Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops. At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!' the New York Post reports. Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. Scroll down for video . Booed: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was heckled and booed as he spoke at the NYPD academy graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden . Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York . The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers. On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold. In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD. Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn. At least one of the new NYPD academy graduate shouted 'traitor!' as the mayor took the podium in front of 884 newly minted cops .

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.' City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.","Low boos could be heard as Bill de Blasio took the podium in front of the NYPD's 884 newest officers on Monday .

"A tiny village in central France is appealing for funds to help preserve the bedroom of a  First World War  soldier that has remained completely unchanged since his death in 1918. Dragoons' Second lieutenant Hubert Rochereau died in the back of a British field ambulance after being wounded during fighting for the village of Loker in Belgium almost 100 years ago. His body was originally buried in a British cemetery, and his parents, who initially had no idea where their son's body was, decided to preserve his old bedroom as a permanent shrine. Time capsule: The bedroom of First World War soldier Hubert Rochereau which has remained untouched for almost 100 years. The local mayor is appealing for funds to help preserve the unique historical site . Second Lieutenant Rochereau's body was eventually repatriated to his home village of Belabre in 1922, but his parents decided to continue to keep his room exactly as it had been when he left to fight in the war. When they sold the large family house in 1936, they bricked up the entrance to the room and stipulated that it should not be changed for another 500 years. The house was sold to French General Eugene Bridoux who went on to become secretary of state during the Vichy regime helping to deport thousands of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps. Bridoux escaped the death sentence for war crimes by fleeing to Franco's Spain where he died in 1955. Meanwhile the house was rented to a family of solicitors before being reclaimed in the 1950s by his granddaughter whose husband Daniel Fabre still lives there. Relics: The fallen soldier's medals  sit on the wrought iron bed alongside pictures of his friends who also died in the war, left, while a moth-eaten uniform still hangs from the wall . Mr Fabre has preserved the bedroom in its original state and said he hopes any new owner will do the same. The bedroom has since remained untouched but  there are fears that a future owner could clear it out as the 500 year clause in the original 1936 sale document has no basis under French law. Mr Fabre told the Nouvelle Republique newspaper: 'This clause had no legal basis, but we believe the room should be left unchanged. 'If we sell, we will be looking for a new owner that respects Hubert Rochereau's memory and keeps this extraordinary museum piece intact.' Now the Mayor of Belabre Laurent Laroche is appealing for benefactors to help preserve the unique historical site by transforming it into a museum. He told the Guardian: 'They knew about the room at the end of the corridor but had never seen it because it was bricked up. So they broke down the wall and made this strange discovery. 'It would be a great shame for it to disappear. As someone who loves history, I feel it's also important not to forget the sacrifice made by men like Rochereau.' Rochereau, who was born  in Belabre in 1896, received a posthumous croix de guerre and the Legion of Honour for his courage in battle - the medals now sit on his old bed surrounded by photographs of his friends who also died in the war. On his desk a pipe sits still filled with tobacco alongside a packet of cigarettes and  a vial labelled 'the soil of Flanders on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years.' On his desk a pipe sits still filled with tobacco alongside a packet of cigarettes and a vial labelled 'the soil of Flanders on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years.' A moth-eaten army uniform is still on its hanger. Schoolbooks and military manuals still sit on the shelves while the walls are adorned with his sword, a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols. The regiment's history, seen by the Guardian, records Rochereau's commander was killed by a bullet to the head after giving a 'heroic' order to counter-attack in Loker, which changed hands several times. Rochereau, a second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, received a posthumous croix de guerre medal for his extreme bravery on the battlefield. He was one of 580,000 soldiers who died on that part of the western front in the 1914-18 war. He is also remembered on the village war memorial and on a monument to the fallen in Libourne.","Dragoon Hubert Rochereau was killed in Belgium in 1918 but his parents preserved his room as a shrine .

"Jane Wilde and Stephen Hawking were married for 30 years. Pictured together at The Theory of Everything premiere . Stephen Hawking’s first wife has revealed how the scientist’s devotion to ‘the goddess Physics’ and his fame and success damaged their marriage and saw him neglect his family. Jane Wilde was married to the professor for 30 years, helping him defy doctors who gave him only two years to live after he was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease as a 22-year-old Cambridge graduate. Now she has spoken about the severe problems caused by his growing renown, the pressure she came under to idolise him and her guilt at relying on their son Robert to care for his father when the boy was only ten. Her decision to leave Professor Hawking for choirmaster Jonathan Jones is also discussed in an interview with Radio Times, given to mark the release of the film The Theory Of Everything based on her memoir Travelling To Infinity and starring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking and Felicity Jones as Jane. Miss Wilde, 70, said ‘the goddess Physics’ became ‘Stephen’s idol’ and he would sometimes spend ‘a whole weekend in his wheelchair, elbow resting on his knee like Rodin’s Thinker. He wouldn’t take any notice of the children, or of me, and I would become very worried’. In 1988, shortly after the publication of his book A Brief History Of Time, which has sold 10million copies in 40 languages and in which he explains how our universe began, Miss Wilde said ‘life became very complicated. ‘I rather felt that the family had been left behind. To me, Stephen was my husband and the father of my children; one does not say to one’s husband, “Oh, you’re so clever! I must worship the ground under your feet, or in this case, wheels”. I found this kind of sycophantic attitude – the attitude adopted by so many people around Stephen – exceptionally frustrating.’ Professor Hawking’s condition has left him in a wheelchair for almost half a century and able to communicate only through a voice synthesizer operated by a muscle in his cheek. Scroll down for video . Wedding day: Jane Wilde marries Stephen Hawking in 1965, left, and right, the couple portrayed by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in the movie . Miss Wilde has three children, Robert, Lucy, and Tim, with Professor Hawking, now 72. As his health deteriorated, they shunned help from carers for many years and Miss Wilde confesses she turned to Robert, the eldest child. She said: ‘There were times when it became all too much. The hardest thing was that in my exhaustion I grew to depend on Robert, when he was only about ten years old. Our gorgeous child who was so willing to help was having to do things for his father that children really shouldn’t have to. ‘Stephen didn’t want to admit that we needed “outside” help because every stage of deterioration – walking with a stick, having to be fed, having to resort to a wheelchair – hit him very hard. Naturally he was in denial but also his mind was so deeply involved with the intellectual realms of research into the origins of the universe that he did not have time to think about more mundane matters.’ When carers were eventually brought in, the scenario was not as Miss Wilde had hoped: ‘I expected that carers came into the home to help look after the disabled person and respect the rest of the family. Very few of them did that. I was desperate; I didn’t think I could carry on, because I was so drained.’ Professor Hawking, pictured with Jane and their children. The couple separated in 1990 and later divorced . She met musician Jonathan Jones through singing in a church choir and a deep friendship followed. Realising they were drawn to each other, she wrestled with her feelings and the tie to Professor Hawking she did not feel able to sever. She said: ‘It would have been easier, in some ways, simply to have walked away, but I could not contemplate doing that because I had devoted myself to Stephen and the children for so long.’ Miss Wilde hints a third party may eventually have caused the breakdown of her marriage, saying: ‘The end of the marriage was very traumatic. It was predictable that someone would exploit the situation and tell Stephen that he shouldn’t be putting up with such an arrangement.’ She separated from Professor Hawking in 1990 and they later divorced. He went on to marry his carer, Elaine Mason, in 1995, and their marriage, which ended after 11 years, was dogged by allegations that Miss Mason physically abused him – claims he has always denied. Miss Wilde married Mr Jones in 1997 but says she always remained in Professor Hawking’s life: ‘After all the years that Stephen and I were together, all we had achieved together and the three children we had had together, I still felt that I was needed in a rather ill-defined, protective way. ‘After Stephen’s second divorce, it became possible for us to communicate again. He lives ten minutes from us and I call in every so often to discuss family matters. When the family are here in Cambridge, we have meals together.’ This month the pair were pictured together at the premiere of The Theory Of Everything.

"Archaeologists in Israel have unearthed fragments of a glass bracelet stamped with seven-branched menorahs. The bracelet remains were found on the second night of Hanukkah in Mount Carmel National Park - once a large settlement during the late Roman or early Byzantine period. The 1,600-year-old glass piece was hidden in an uncovered box, containing a number of other glass fragments that had been discarded as waste. Archaeologists have unearthed fragments of a glass bracelet stamped with seven-branched menorahs . 'After cleaning, we were excited to discover that the bracelet, which is made of turquoise coloured glass, is decorated with symbols of the seven-branched menorah,' said Limor Talmi, an excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority. '[This is] the same menorah which according to tradition was kept alight in the temple for eight days by means of a single cruse of oil.' The fragment shows two menorahs with seven branches each. One of the menorahs has a single flame depicted above each branch. Also found in the same refuse pile was the base of a large glass bowl and a lumps of debris from a glass kiln. The bracelet remains (pictured) were found on the second night of Hanukkah in Mount Carmel National Park - once a large settlement during the late Roman or early Byzantine period . The 1,600-year-old glass piece was hidden in an uncovered box, containing a number of other glass fragments that had been discarded as waste . Archaeologist Limor Talmi of the Israel Antiquities Authority holds the base of a large glass bowl that was found in the same refuse pile as the fragment of glass bracelet . These 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold . If you dug these up in your garden, you probably wouldn't think twice about throwing them away. But the unassuming objects are 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold. Unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on Dartmoor last year, they were heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century. Jane Marchand, senior archaeologist from Dartmoor National Park, described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century. She said: 'The amber beads probably came from the Baltic – and meant they were long-distance trading 4,000 years ago. 'These artefacts show Dartmoor wasn't the isolated, hard-to-reach place we thought it was. This mystery is unfolding. 'This has been fascinating to work on, but it's just one piece in a puzzle. The story is only part-told.' Glass bracelets and pendants from these periods decorated with symbols of a menorah are well known in Israel, Lebanon and Syria. But the researchers explained that archaeologists usually found this kind of jewellery as part of funerary offerings. 'It is unusual to find such objects in settlement strata, and even rarer to discover them in an ancient refuse pit,' said Yael Gorin-Rosen, one of the Antiquities Authority researchers. She added that the findings may provide proof that Jewish people lived in the ancient settlement. Another theory is that the bracelet came from a workshop in the area and had been intended for other markets. 'Glass jewelry was used extensively in the late Roman period, and we can reasonably assume that those items that were specially decorated were more expensive than the plain, unornamented ones,' the researchers said. 'The refuse that was discovered in the pit included numerous glass vessels and fragments of glass window panes, as well as a selection of jewelry, indicative of a population that lived a life of comfort and affluence.' The fragment shows two menorahs with seven branches each. One of the menorahs has a single flame depicted above each branch . This lump from a glass kiln was one of many pieces of glass in stages of production found in the refuse pit .

"Pianist Lucy Parham had severe labyrinthitis . Concert pianist Lucy Parham was recovering from a virus last Christmas when she was overcome by a violent wave of dizziness and nausea. 'I was watching a film at the cinema and suddenly the whole room was spinning around me,' recalls Lucy, 48, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music, London. 'I felt like I was standing on a ship, swaying on the deck - and that I was about to be ill. It only lasted about three minutes but I rushed home in a taxi as my legs still felt like jelly and I couldn't walk normally. I had no sense of balance.' When Lucy reached her home in Central London ten minutes later, she lay down, but still felt as if the room was spinning. 'It was like I was on the Titanic and my bed was going up and down violently in a sea swell,' she says. 'I found it frightening.' The next day, she went to her GP, who diagnosed her with severe labyrinthitis. This is a common ear infection where the labyrinth, the innermost part of the ear, becomes inflamed or damaged, typically as a result of a viral infection such as cold or flu. The labyrinth not only contains the cochlea, which relays sound to the brain, but also the vestibular system, a complex set of fluid-filled channels that sends messages to the brain to help with balance. Labyrinthitis is similar to vestibular neuritis, where an infection damages the vestibular nerve, causing faulty messages to be sent to the brain. Indeed, doctors often treat labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis as one condition, as the symptoms - and treatment - are largely the same (the only difference is that labyrinthitis may also causes hearing loss). The most common symptoms of both conditions are vertigo (an intense spinning sensation), as well as nausea, vomiting and a feeling of unsteadiness, explains Andrew McCombe, a consultant ENT surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey. The classic pattern is acute vertigo for a few days, which then settles, but a sense of unsteadiness and dizziness can persist for a few weeks,' he says. 'This happens because the brain is receiving faulty signals from the damaged labyrinth and/or vestibular nerve in one ear and becomes confused as it is out of sync with signals coming from the other ear.' Scroll down for video . Those affected are often told to lie down until the acute symptoms ease after a few days. However, longer term, lying down may be the wrong thing to do . Treatment includes anti-sickness drugs such as prochlorperazine to reduce activity in the central nervous system or steroids to reduce inflammation. Those affected are often told to lie down until the acute symptoms ease after a few days. However, longer term, lying down may be the wrong thing to do, experts say. 'For both labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis GPs often prescribe rest and anti-travel sickness tablets, but while medication may help in the first day or two, when symptoms are more severe they will not help in the long term and may delay recovery,' says Linda Luxon, professor emeritus of audio-vestibular medicine at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London. 'They stop the brain readjusting to the faulty signals the ear is sending. Patients need to keep moving so that their brain starts to recalibrate and ignore the faulty signals - staying indoors and not moving is the worst thing they can do.' And although most cases of both conditions will resolve completely within three to eight weeks, about 10 per cent will have permanent damage to the labyrinth or vestibular nerve, and dizziness persists. These patients should be referred for specialist assessment, says Professor Luxon. This may involve 'vestibular rehabilitation' or physiotherapy, learning special exercises that compensate for the faulty signals coming from the balance sensors. These exercises typically include eye and head movements - such as teaching the patient to focus their eyes on a fixed object while moving their head. They may also watch videos of people walking down busy streets so their brain can start to 'relearn' its balance in a safe, controlled environment. 'Physiotherapy is very effective and can be a great help,' adds Professor Luxon. However, patients who need it often don't get this specialist treatment. Patient stories on the labyrinthitis.org.uk website complain that GPs can seem reluctant to refer patients, with some waiting six months or more to see a specialist. The good news is that even if a patient has suffered severe dizziness for months they can benefit from specialist vestibular physiotherapy, says Nova Mullin, a physiotherapist in balance and dizziness at Aintree University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool. 'I recently treated a patient who has been effectively housebound for three years because his balance was so bad. He improved dramatically within three months. 'Unfortunately, if patients don't get better within a few months they're often told by GPs there's nothing that can be done for them. It's not true. Vestibular rehabilitation is a very effective treatment, helpful in approximately 80 per cent of patients.' Lucy finally saw a specialist vestibular physiotherapist once a week for a month . Lucy's GP initially prescribed anti-nausea drugs and reassured her that the dizziness should clear up within weeks. 'My first thought was how it was going to affect my work as I had a series of concerts booked for the following month,' says Lucy, a former winner of Young Musician of the Year. 'But I accepted my GP's advice to rest and take a low dose of prochlorperazine. However, after two months her symptoms hadn't improved and reluctantly she had to cancel three concerts last February. Daily life was also proving difficult. 'I couldn't shop or drive or use public transport as I still felt so dizzy,' she says. 'One day I tried to walk and I was clutching at the railings to keep upright - I must have looked like I was drunk. 'I started to seriously worry about how this was going to affect my career. I could still play the piano - it seemed like when I was performing I just got a massive dose of concentration that seemed to override everything else. 'But as soon as I stopped playing the dizziness would return.' By March, Lucy had recovered enough to perform again, but still had to be driven to recitals. 'I felt a general dizziness most of the time punctuated with more violent spinning vertigo attacks - it was so unpredictable it wouldn't have been safe to drive. 'I was just existing - I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I started to worry I may have something more seriously wrong, such as a brain tumour.' Lucy went back to her GP in March. She was sent for an MRI scan but the results were clear. Other causes of dizziness include neurological conditions, stroke and multiple sclerosis, and it is important these are ruled out. By April, she was so desperate, Lucy used her private medical insurance to see a vestibular medicine specialist at the London Hearing and Balance Centre. 'One test involved trickling water into my right ear - it measures the difference in function between the two ears and from that my specialist was able to diagnose vestibular neuritis. 'She explained the vestibular nerve was sending faulty signals and that my brain needed help to learn how to recalibrate and ignore these signals,' says Lucy. She then saw a specialist vestibular physiotherapist once a week for a month. 'She taught me exercises to practise twice a day,' says Lucy. 'These included standing on a huge pile of sofa cushions with my eyes shut and trying to balance. I also had to walk backwards and forwards, looking up and down and from right to left. 'Within a month my symptoms had improved by 50 per cent and I felt much more able to get on with normal life. It's a huge relief.' Lucy is now feeling fine and is able to work and drive again. 'I want to let people know labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis don't always go away on their own - and there is specialist help available.' lucyparham.com, labyrinthitis.org.uk .","Concert pianist Lucy Parham, 48, from London was overcome by dizziness .

"Nearly 7,000 properties in England and Wales will be allowed to fall into the sea this century, it was revealed today. The homes and buildings - worth more than £1billion combined - are expected to be victims of coastal erosion because that is much cheaper than protecting them, according to experts. More than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years, and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place. Scroll down for video . Collapsed: A house falls over dunes into the sea after storm damage at Hemsby in Norfolk in December 2013, following the 'most serious' tidal surge to hit the east coast of Britain for 60 years . Off the cliff: Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby (pictured) in Norfolk, coastal erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea . Environment Agency analysis, revealed by Guardian reporter Damian Carrington, suggests the most at-risk area in the next two decades is Cornwall, with 76 properties expected to be lost. And three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead - these being Great Yarmouth (293), Southampton (280) and Cornwall (273). Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby in Norfolk, cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea. Coastal community campaigners claim that the Government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere, if it cannot defend their properties. Professor Rob Duck, a coastal erosion expert at Dundee University, told the Guardian: ‘It is a very difficult issue, but we can’t defend everything at all costs. Mapped out: The EA figures presume that funding is maintained for  'shoreline management plans', which include four policies to either 'advance the line', 'hold the line', 'managed retreat' and 'no active intervention' On the edge: Houses on the east coast close to Skipsea in East Yorkshire, pictured in 2007. Nearly 7,000 properties in England and Wales will be allowed to fall into the sea this century, it was revealed today . ‘There are just not the resources to do it and keep on doing it. But it is not just about money, often people have lived in places for generations and there is a lot of history and memories.’ The figures from the EA presume that funding is maintained for what are known as 'shoreline management plans', which include four policies to either 'advance the line', 'hold the line', 'managed retreat' and 'no active intervention' There would be more than 74,000 properties lost in the next century without this intervention. Current guidance from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says more than 200 homes are at risk of being lost to coastal erosion in the next 20 years. But the EA analysis puts this at 295, or 430 in the case of very extreme weather. Last year’s tidal surge which hit the east coast was described as the ‘most serious’ for 60 years. Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the North Sea reached higher levels than the 1953 floods, and two people died - in West Lothian and Nottinghamshire. Falling value: This three-bedroom bungalow with views over the North Sea in Happisburgh, Norfolk, was bought for £20,000 in 1987 - and the Daily Mail reported in 2008 how it was worth £1.

"A mother in Washington state is accused of sex-trafficking her own teenage daughter. The 44-year-old was recently arrested by sheriff's deputies in Snohomish County  and is facing charges of promoting the sexual abuse of a minor - a Class A felony. Detectives started tracking the teen late last year through a classified advert offering her services on backpage.com for liaisons at motels in Everett, Edmonds and Fife. The advert claimed the girl was 18, but she was actually 15 at the time. Detectives started tracking the teen late last year through a classified advert offering her services on backpage.com for liaisons at motels in Everett, Edmonds and Fife . A search warrant  of texts on the girl's iPhone from a five-week period late last year uncovered more than 400 messages from potential clients. More than a dozen others involved discussions related to drugs, reports The Daily Herald. The exchanges also included texts allegedly from the girl's mother, asking her for her motel room number and what city she was in. After the teen allegedly had a client walk away without paying, the woman allegedly wrote text messages telling her 'Never give (people) anything without paying upfront' and 'Next time get paid upfront.' At one point, the mother allegedly wrote her daughter to find another hotel room for the night rather than come home.

An acquaintance of the teen told the detective that the girl said 'her mom was very well aware of what she was doing and encouraged it because she enjoyed the money.' In an interview with the sheriff's detective earlier this month, the teen allegedly said her mom knew about her work as a prostitute. She reportedly estimated that she gave her mom about $2,000 from her earnings as a prostitute over the past year and that her mom often picks her up at motels.","The woman from Snohomish County, Washington state, is accused of sex-trafficking her own teenage daughter .

"Tributes have begun to flow in for a 17-year-old boy who died after being attacked by what authorities believe was a four to five-metre-long great white shark. Jay Muscat, who police said was spearfishing at the time, was attacked at about 12:20pm local time on Monday at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany. Police are still investigating the incident, but Western Australia's Department of Fisheries have confirmed a boy was bitten by a shark. Although police are yet to formally identify him, they have contacted his family and tributes across social media have begun to appear. Jay Muscat was spearfishing when he was attacked by the shark at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast . One boy, who identified himself as Mr Muscat's best friend, wrote: 'I can only think about how much I loved this guy, from admiring the zero amount of f*** he gave about anything, living his life to the fullest and never letting anyone tell him what to do, him wearing his hawthorn shirt everywhere, his love for the water and fishing and where his heart was at most, spearing fishing [sic]. 'This guy was always the life of the party and one of the greatest guys to be around. 'I love you so much Jay and I'll never forget you bro, I don't know how I'll get over this man or who I'll go fishing with or just be around all the time. 'I love you so f***ing much and I'll miss you for the rest of my life, rest in peace brother.' Scroll down for video . Mr Muscat, 17,  died after being attacked by what authorities believe was a four to five-metre-long great white shark . The beach has been closed as police investigate the incident and a WA Department of Fisheries spokeswoman confirmed that drum lines have been deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark . A WA Department of Fisheries spokeswoman has confirmed that capture gear and baited lines have been deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark, which was likely to be a four to five-metre-long great white. 'At this stage it's highly likely that if we capture the shark that's likely to have been involved in the incident it will be destroyed,' Rick Fletcher, a Department of Fisheries spokesperson, said according to the ABC. The 17-year-old is the second Australian teen killed while spearfishing this month, following the death of Daniel Smith, 18, at Port Douglas in far north Queensland. Iain Suthers, a professor in marine science from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science told Daily Mail Australia that spear fishers carry a higher risk of being attacked by sharks. 'All spear fishers are a little more exposed to risk even though the risk is still entirely low,' Mr Suthers said. 'Sharks do not just forage for food purely by smell or by sound; they also have these little sensory organs distributed along their lateral lines and under their snout – ampullae of Lorenzini. 'These sense electrical stimuli in the water and if the fish it still shaking and trembling – in close range of the shark - it adds to the attraction that sharks feel. 'It's the old expression of blood in the water. The safest thing is to spear the fish and immediately go back to your boat and put it in a bucket so you don't have the smell of blood and trembling fish around you.' Mr Muscat is reported to have been approached by the shark while spearfishing with his friend Matt Pullella, at the popular Three Stripes spot, The West Australian reports. The 17-year-old is the second teen to be killed while spear fishing this month, following the death of 18-year-old Daniel Smith (pictured), at Port Douglas in far north Queensland. Iain Suthers, a professor from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science said that spear fishers carry a higher risk of being attacked by sharks . Department of Fisheries spokesperson Rick Fletcher said the great white shark could be injured as a spear was fired at it when it attacked Mr Muscat . Police said that Mr Pullella  is not believed to have received any serious injuries. The shark, however, is believed to have been injured during the attack, when Mr Pullella fired a spear at it after it attacked Mr Muscat. 'They had been spearfishing and it's our understanding they had already captured some fish,' Mr Fletcher said. 'It appears the shark swam past one diver and bit the other on the leg.' A nearby fisherman is believed to have then brought Mr Muscat's body to shore on a boat, shortly before police were contacted by someone claiming they found his body in the water. Cheynes Beach is home to a caravan park and surrounded by bushland. It is at maximum capacity, full of campers and families during the busy Christmas season. The Department of Fisheries said that beaches in the region are likely to remain closed tomorrow and urged locals and holiday makers to stay out of the water. Remote: Cheynes Beach is home to a caravan park, is surrounded by bushland and is often the subject of day trips for families at this time of year . Map: The attack occurred around 70km south of Albany, in WA's south . A monster 4.1m great white was snared in fishing nets off Cheynes Beach in April. Shark expert Dr Jonathan Werry told Daily Mail Australia white sharks 'certainly' move in the Albany region. Larger species, such as whaler sharks, also live in the area, Dr Werry said. Australia has witnessed a number of shark attacks this year, some fatal. In September, British expat Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed in a shark attack in Byron Bay, at the eastern-most point of New South Wales. Sean Pollard, 23, from Bunbury, WA, lost an arm and both hands when he came under attack by a great white in October. Premier Colin Barnett's government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks earlier this year. The policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed. The Environmental Protection Agency sunk the policy in a ruling earlier this year. The government is still able to use drum lines if they are threat to beachgoers, Mr Barnett was quoted saying in September.

"Katie Hopkins is over the moon that she has managed to drop from a size 18 to a size 8 in just a few months - but her husband will be equally chuffed with his new slimline wife. Because the star has revealed that she banned her partner from sex after piling on the pounds as an experiment for a new television show, which airs on Friday. Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit. Scroll down for video . Katie Hopkins gained three stone, then lost the weight for a new TV show. She originally weighed 8st 12lb (right) but ate her way to 11st 13lb (left), then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab . But in her heavier months, the 39-year-old refused to make love to her husband Mark Cross because she believes fat people aren't sexy. She told The Sun: 'After I put on my first stone, I stopped having sex with my husband. 'As a fat bird, I stuck to my pyjamas and getting naked in the dark. 'A fat belly is not an attractive thing, fat people aren't sexy.' Katie caused an uproar last year, when she told an obese woman on This Morning that she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy. But she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project, by gaining and losing 3st for a documentary to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight. The weight gain hit Katie's emotions harder than she expected, with the mother-of-three often reduced to tears over her size, especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror. The documentary 'Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story' follows Katie Hopkins as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise . Katie told the newspaper that she hadn't cried for years, either at the birth of her children or her two weddings, but that gaining 3st 'killed her' and she often sobbed at how unhealthy she felt during this project. Previously a slim size eight, weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement. With an apparently naturally high metabolism, Katie struggles to bring her weight up over 11st despite her high-calorie intake. The documentary sees her draft in ex-army personal trainer Christian who devises a military style program of what he terms 'circuit eating' to help her gain the final pounds. Diving a table into four, Christian places different foods in each section and makes Katie rotate the table six times, eating the small but high calorie foods at each point. Similar in form to exercise circuits, the idea is to maximize calorie intake, and the circuits have to be repeated every two hours. Katie Hopkins refused to be intimate with husband Mark Cross, pictured, after she gained a stone in weight . After one particular feed, clearly uncomfortable with a distended stomach, Katie rants: 'It is just ridiculous what people do to themselves. Fat people, I mean really I don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror.' Having reached 11st 13lb, with a 38in waist and a BMI of 26, the documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, which is due to air on TLC this Friday and Saturday, then follows Katie as she loses the weight on a strict diet and exercise regime. In the TLC documentary, we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments. Make-up free and in a pair of stripped pyjamas, Hopkins breaks down over her larger body. After a weight-gain diet that included daily 'snacks' of a litre-and-a-half of Mars milk drink, an entire tub of Pringles, cheese on toast, Dairy Milk and Galaxy chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast, Katie then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500. As well as a low fat diet of porridge, salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato, Hopkins upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour-long runs a week. Following this self-devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months, shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended. The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st 'killed her' and left her in constant floods . Katie kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her  strong views on fat people. One video sees her explaining: 'One of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you don't want to go out so much. You feel like you don't really want to go out because you can't fit into the things you would like to wear. 'I'm not sure if that's something many fat people suffer from because I see a lot of fat people out and about. Whether that's out of choice I don't know but I'm surprised that fat people go out at all.' The former Apprentice contestant, turned columnist said in the Sun: 'I think I have proved there are no excuses to be overweight, but I've also shown that it affects you more than physically. 'I still wouldn't employ a fat person after living a fat life. 'Being fat is hard work. You can't be fat and happy. If you're too lazy to make a change then you're going to be fat.' But despite the hardships that she suffered after gaining weight, Katie maintains that she still wouldn't employ a fat person. She also suggested a radical weight-loss scheme in her interview with The Sun, which would see children weighed at the school gates. The fattest 10 per cent of children would then be reported to social services. The controversial former reality star has been as active as usual on Twitter, defending her views on being overweight . Katie first embarked on the weight-gain and weight-loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size. Speaking on ITV's This Morning in September she said: 'One in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese. 'People have always said to me, ""You're lucky, you're skinny,"" and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more. 'I saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an end to this.' While she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues, Katie is continuing to be outspoken on the topics, using her Twitter account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood. She recently tweeted: 'My local over/under active thyroid self help group meets in KFC.' She also posted: 'I see you all down there with your excuses, but a third of the planet is obese. The first step to slim is NO EXCUSES. Own your problem.' Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, airs Friday and Saturday, 2 and 3 January at 9pm on TLC.","Katie Hopkins went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb in just a few months .

"A  twin who was one of the most premature ever to survive  is set to defy doctors by taking his first steps – thanks to Botox injections. Two-year-old Archie Garthwaite was diagnosed with cerebral palsy in June, after a host of complications when he and his brother Harley were born 17 weeks early. Doctors told his devastated parents Hayley Kennedy, 22, and Billy Garthwaite, 23, that he would never walk. But Archie defied medics to learn to crawl and doctors are now preparing to inject his legs with Botox, which they say could relax his tightened muscles and help him walk. Two-year-old Archie Garthwaite (right) and his twin brother Harley (left) were born 17 weeks early. Archie has cerebral palsy and will soon receive Botox injections to relax his muscles and help him walk . At first, doctors said Archie (right) would never walk like his brother Harley (left), but he defied medics by learning to crawl. Now, his parents hope the Botox treatment will allow him to take his first steps . Archie (left) and Harley (right) amazed doctors after they survived being born more than four months premature. Both were born with holes in their hearts, and had to undergo surgery just weeks after being born . Ms Kennedy, from Hartlepool, Cleveland, said: 'At first the doctors said he would never walk and it absolutely broke my heart for him. 'But now they've come up with the idea of Botox and a walking frame because they're really impressed at how much he's come on. 'His physio says it's incredible.  It has given us a renewed hope for him.' Although Botox first achieved fame as a cosmetic drug used by celebrities to smooth out wrinkles, it also has a number of medical uses such as treating migraines and incontinence. Botox uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin, derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning. The deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing. Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination. Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles, according to the NHS website. The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth. The main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. They are: Muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems. Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected. How Botox can help . Botox uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin, derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning. The deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing. In tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses. This allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening. The effects last between four and six months. In tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses. This allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening. The effects tend to last from four to six months. Although Botox treatment is now becoming more common for some cerebral palsy patients, not all NHS Trusts will fund it and there are often long waiting lists for treatment. Archie was diagnosed with cerebral palsy earlier this year. This followed a series of complications when he and his brother were born 17 weeks early, and became the most premature twins ever to survive in the UK at that time. They were delivered at just 23 weeks, on June 13 and 14, 2012, weighing just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz – much less than the UK average of 7lb 8oz. The boys both had holes in their tiny hearts and at just two weeks old Archie had to undergo open heart surgery, with his brother Harley following two weeks later. Medics also operated to correct bowel problems, performed laser treatment on their underdeveloped eyes, and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them to breathe. But despite the odds, the pair survived and while Harley has eyesight and lung problems, he can walk and talk like any normal toddler. Archie's cerebral palsy means his muscle's don't work as well, and he can't talk as well as his brother. But regular physiotherapy has seen him learn to crawl and now it is hoped the Botox - usually used to smooth wrinkles - will relax his tightened legs. The twins' recovery was hailed as a miracle given how premature and unwell they were. They are pictured with parents Hayley Kennedy, 22, and Billy Garthwaite, 23, two years ago . While Archie (far right) can't walk and just makes noises rather than talking - Harley (far left) can understand him and tells parents Hayley Kennedy, and Billy Garthwaite (pictured) what he wants . Ms Kennedy, who is Archie's full-time carer, said: 'There is a lot of brotherly love. Harley will get two of everything, one for him and one for Archie. 'It breaks my heart because I always wonder if Archie is thinking 'why can't I do what Harley is doing?' 'Archie doesn't talk as much, he just makes noises, but Harley knows what Archie wants and he tells us so that we know. 'They are both a credit to us. I do cry on a night - I wouldn't wish what they've been through on anyone. 'I think ""poor little souls"". It's awful but they are getting there. I wouldn't be without them.'","Archie and Harley Garthwaite, from Hartlepool, were born 17 weeks early .

The clip shows three men armed with an axe and a knife enter a petrol station in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, at around 6pm on Saturday. One of the men threw a brick at one of the shop assistants in the Texaco petrol station in Oldham Road. Three men armed with an axe and a knife stomed a petrol station in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, at around 6pm on Saturday . One of the men threw a brick at one of the shop assistants in the Texaco petrol station in Oldham Road . They then move behind the counter and using the axe and knife, shepherded two victims into the staff kitchen at the back of the building. The offenders then kicked down a door and attempted, but failed, to open the safe. Instead they grabbed cash from the till and drove off in a grey BMW 3 Series with the licence plates covered. The first offender is described as white, around 6ft tall with a slim build. He was wearing a long-sleeved black top, black trousers, black gloves and a black mask covering his face. Packets of cigarettes flew from the shelves behind the till after the brick was thrown . He was carrying a knife, described as 1ft long with a slightly curved blade. The second offender is described as white, 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in tall with a slim build. He was wearing the same clothing the first offender, but carrying an axe which had a 1ft long handle and a silver straight blade. The third offender stood at 5ft 6in tall and was wearing the same black clothing as the other two men. Threatening the victims with the axe and knife, they shepherded two victims into the staff kitchen at the back . The offenders then kicked down a door and attempted, but failed, to open the safe and instead grabbed cash . Detective Constable Mike Hayman said: 'The two victims were fortunately unhurt, but were understandably left shaken by the force and aggression shown by these males. 'As you can see from the CCTV, the shop assistant was inches away from serious injury as the brick thrown by one of the men smashes into the cigarette display. 'The offenders were armed and used force to get what they wanted, it is vital that we track them down as quickly as possible.' Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9080 or Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

"Students wishing to safeguard their careers against changes in the job market should opt for science rather than arts degrees, according to a survey of undergraduates. Engineering and chemistry were considered to be the most ‘future proof’, as they are courses most likely to lead to an enduring and adaptable career. Students polled by a college were broadly optimistic that their chosen courses would prepare them for a world in which the job market could change dramatically during their working lives. In a recent poll of undergraduates engineering and chemistry were considered to be the most ‘future proof’ degrees as students believe they are courses most likely to lead to an enduring and adaptable career . But opinion was sharply divided over which degrees were best for future-proof careers. Eighty-two per cent of respondents believed engineering would help develop future-proof skills, with 74 per cent believing the same of chemistry and 73 per cent of computer science. But just 33 per cent of undergraduates believed history would lead to a future-proof career, and 40 per cent English. However more than two thirds of students - 67 per cent - thought the world of work would be significantly different or completely unrecognisable in 20 years. The findings, published today, come after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan sparked controversy with claims that teenagers should steer clear of the arts and humanities and opt for science or maths subjects if they want to access the widest range of jobs. The findings come after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) sparked controversy with claims that teenagers should steer clear of the arts and humanities and opt for science or maths subjects . She said that in previous decades students would only take maths or science if they wanted to pursue a specific career such as medicine or pharmacy, but nowadays that ‘couldn’t be further from the truth’. ‘If you wanted to do something different, or even if you didn’t know what you wanted to do…then the arts and humanities were what you chose. Because they were useful – we were told – for all kinds of jobs. ‘Of course now we know that couldn’t be further from the truth, that the subjects that keep young people’s options open and unlock doors to all sorts of careers are the STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects.’ She also described maths as ‘the subject that employers value most’ and said that pupils who study A-level maths will earn 10 per cent more over their lifetime. ‘These figures show us that too many young people are making choices aged 15 which will hold them back for the rest of their lives,’ she said. However the remarks prompted an outcry among supporters of the arts and humanities, with critics maintaining that creative subjects were vital to Britain’s economy. Later in the month, it emerged that a leading investment bank was aiming to hire a new generation of arts graduates because it blames ‘linear thinking’ mathematicians and economists for elements of the financial crisis. Royal Bank of Scotland launched a recruitment drive on campuses targeting humanities students to bring greater ‘diversity’ to its workforce. More than two thirds of students thought the world of work would be significantly different  in 20 years . Outlining the move, Tim Skeet, managing director of RBS capital markets, said: ‘We still need the mathematicians and economists, we still need those disciplines but what we need to do is leaven it, we need an input from people who have left-field, blue-sky creative thinking, who can bring the ability to ask the tough questions. ‘If going through this crisis we had had a few more people who could have said - look, explain that to me in plain English...I think we might have avoided some of the problems.’ The poll of undergraduates, which questioned 1,000 students on the outlook for the jobs market, was commissioned by Pearson College, billed as the first institution run by an FTSE 100 company to offer degrees in the UK. As well as variations across subjects, men were notably more confident than women about their prospects, with 78 per cent saying their degrees would prepare them for future jobs, against 67 per cent of women. Roxanne Stockwell, principal of Pearson College, said: ‘Undergraduates in the UK know they face a rapidly changing world – but they are confident that their studies will prepare them for the challenges ahead. 'That’s an incredibly positive message to all those students who are spending the festive season revising for exams and finishing university applications. ‘Applicants need to be canny when looking at university courses and to make sure their choices develop the attitudes and aptitudes required to adapt to this rapid change.’","Survey of undergraduates found science beat arts for future proof degrees .

"She's one of the most polished A-listers in Tinseltown so it comes as little surprise that Victoria Beckham is passing on her beautifying tips to daughter Harper. The fashion designer has revealed that she and her three-year-old often have 'nail afternoons' - and they're not the only members of the family to enjoy some pampering. Speaking to Vogue magazine, the mother-of-four said: 'I'm very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we're in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw-pedicure.' Scroll down for video . Perfectly polished: Victoria Beckham, who recently unveiled her collaboration with Nails Inc, has revealed that she and her three-year-old daughter Harper often have 'nail afternoons' The 40-year-old was promoting the new luxury nail polish duo she created in collaboration with Nails Inc. The two limited-edition shades - a warm tomato red and a pale bone hue - are inspired by the designer's yet-to-be unveiled Victoria Victoria Beckham spring/summer 2015 collection. While we saw the main Victoria Beckham collection at New York Fashion Week in September, the new polishes offer us a first hint of what Mrs Beckham has in store for her second fashion line next season. According to a press release, the upcoming VVB collection features subtle nods to Japanese culture, and this is certainly reflected in the nail polish names - Judo Red and Bamboo White. The mother-of-four told Vogue: 'I'm very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we're in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw-pedicure' Beauty collaboration: Victoria Beckham's nail polish duo with Nails Inc was one of her highs of 2014 . The exclusive formulation of the new nail varnishes features silica-rich bamboo extract, which apparently conditions and feeds the nail bed with essential nutrients. She and Harper both love the orangey red shade. 'I choose it when I'm wearing something uncomplicated, like all black,' she added. The collaboration is a final highlight in what has been a busy - and successful - year for Mrs Beckham. The designer was given the prestigious Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards 2014. Impeccably manicured Victoria  picked up the Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards earlier this year . Proving all of her early critics wrong, Victoria Beckham has doubled sales of her fashion business to £30.39million in just two years. The businesswoman reported sales of £15.76million in 2012. And according to The Sun, Victoria Beckham Ltd made a £1.3m profit in 2013 - selling £83,000 worth of stock (or 55 handbags priced at £1,500) per day. The designer, who debuted her first collection of dresses at New York Fashion Week in 2008, has expanded her business to include handbags, shoes, sunglasses, denim, a sister line titled Victoria Victoria Beckham, and even a luxury nail polish collection in collaboration with Nails Inc. The rising sales are thought to be thanks to her recently launched website and her September store opening on Dover Street in Mayfair, London, where hundreds of fans waited in line for the doors to open.

"US researchers claim most acts of violence come from the desire to do the right thing . The reasons behind violence are varied, but a common belief is that criminals act from a breakdown of morals. But now, researchers in California claim most acts of violence come from a very different impulse - the desire to do the right thing. Their study argues that many violent attacks are committed as a form of retribution, with the aggressor feeling as though they must commit the crime. 'When someone does something to hurt themselves or other people, or to kill somebody, they usually do so because they think they have to,' Professor Alan Fiske of the University of California said. 'They think they should do it, that it's the right thing to do, that they ought to do it and that it's morally necessary.' Co-author, professor Tage Rai, of Northwestern University, added: 'Killings and physical attacks are often committed in retribution for wrongs - real or perceived. '[They can be] an effort to teach lessons and instill obedience or, amazingly, an attempt to rectify a relationship that in the perpetrator's mind has gone awry.' 'When we say that violence is morally motivated, we mean that it is so in the mind of the perpetrator. We don't mean that we think violence is good.' After emphasising they don't condone violence, the researchers admit there are exceptions to their theory, typically psychopaths. Professor Fiske said: 'Except for a few psychopaths, hardly anybody harming anybody else is doing something that they intend to be evil. The researchers have written a book, Virtuous Violence, which outlines their controversial beliefs. They say they arrived at their conclusion after analysing a wide array of previous research on violence, including thousands of interviews with violent offenders. Professor Alan Fiske at the University of California said: 'Except for a few psychopaths, hardly anybody harming anybody else is doing something that they intend to be evil' One example in the book is physical child abuse, with quotes from parents  expressing fear of short-changing a child's moral development on occasions when they withheld punishment. In domestic abuse, the researchers claim the aggressor is convinced they are in the right, with many abusers feeling entitled to use violence to redress wrongs that they perceive themselves to have suffered. Professor Fiske said: 'When we started we thought: ""We'll never figure out what really motivates perpetrators of violent acts"", but actually it turned out not to be that hard. 'Social workers and newspaper readers don't think gang members should be killing each other, but within the gang they do.' He added: 'All you have to do is convince the people who are violent that what they're doing is wrong.' German neurologist Dr Gergard Roth claims to have found the 'evil patch' in the brain's central lobe (ringed) that lurks in violent criminals . Last year, a German neurologist claimed to have found the area of the brain where 'evil' lurks in killers, rapists and robbers. Bremen scientist Dr Gerhard Roth said the 'evil patch' lies in the brain's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on X-rays. He discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for German government studies. 'We showed these people short films and measured their brain waves,' he said. 'Whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions. In the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow, nothing happened.' The dark mass at the front of the brain, he says, appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence. His research has led him to believe that some criminals have a 'genetic predisposition' to violence. He added: 'When you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals, there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain. 'There are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area, and after an operation to remove the tumour, that person was completely normal again. 'Or there are physiological deficits, because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively. 'But this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks.'","US researchers claim that most violent crimes are not intended to be evil .

The front seats of the car can be turned around and passengers can spend their time relaxing or working, while screens can show films - or live camera feeds from the outside world (pictured) The main feature of its future car is a ‘variable seating system’ that features four rotating lounge chairs that let people face each other. This means the front passengers can turn and talk directly to the other passengers while on the move, when the car is in autonomous mode. Or they can focus their attention towards the front when driving manually, and an extendable steering wheel gives the driver more options. Mercedes added that the interior becomes a 'digital living space' which is comprehensively networked as an integral part of the intelligent vehicle system .

In September, the German car maker took the covers of its Future Truck 2025 prototype. The truck features a 'Highway Pilot' that scans the road ahead, stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track, as well as reclining chairs and a tablet remote control. The prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a German Autobahn in July, during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck-maker Daimler. On the front of the truck is a series of LEDs, which illuminate the front fascia and headlights when the engine is started. When the lights flash orange, it alerts fellow drivers to the fact the truck is driving itself, and these lights turn blue when a human driver is back in control. Images of the Future Truck 2025 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining driver's seat, tablet computer controls and 'mirrors' and a chill-out space. The driver’s seat can also be turned by 45 degrees, to make it more comfortable on long journeys, and the tablet can be removed and used to watch films, for example, when the truck is in autonomous mode. The truck is also equipped with radar sensors and camera technology that helps the autonomous driving system, called Highway Pilot, plot the road ahead. The technology is similar to how an autopilot on an aircraft works, and in the Future Truck 2025, the stereo camera scans the road 328ft (100 metres) ahead; 45 degrees horizontally and 27 degrees vertically. These cameras can identify single and two-lane roads, obstacles including moving and stationary objects, pedestrians and more. The camera is fitted to the instrument panel behind the windscreen. Future Truck 2025 also makes fuller use of features already found in current production models, by networking on-board sensors with automatic braking, stability control and lane-warning systems. As the vehicle's name suggests, the intention is to launch a roadworthy version by 2025.","Self-driving car will use LG's Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS)

"Men who take part in violent conflicts are more likely to father more children, researchers have found. Researchers at Harvard University studied a small tribal populations in eastern Africa - and found violent conflict does result in more wives and children for certain warriors. They studied the Nyangatom, a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest Ethiopia and South Sudan. Researchers studied the Nyangatom, a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest Ethiopia and South Sudan, who frequently carry out violent raids on neighbouring groups armed with weapons like AK-47 rifles (pictured). They found violent conflict does result in more wives and children for certain warriors. The Nyangatom, are a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest Ethiopia and South Sudan. They number approximately 30,000,and  have intermittent conflict with many of their neighbors, especially the Turkana, Dassanetch, and Suri . They carry out violent raids on neighboring groups. Typically carried out by Nyangatom men between 20 and 40 years old armed with weapons like AK-47 rifles, the raids sometimes result in serious injuries and deaths. The study, authored by Luke Glowacki of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, found that, among members of the East African herding tribe, those who engaged in conflict - in the form of violent raids carried out on neighbouring groups - had more wives, and thus more opportunities to increase their reproductive success through having more children. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provided clear evidence that violence offers a benefit to warriors, the team say. 'The currency of evolution is reproductive success,' Glowacki said. 'By having more wives you can have more children. 'What we found was that, over the course of their lives, those who took part in more raids had more children.' Importantly, though, that benefit - the increased reproductive success enjoyed by raiders - is mediated by powerful cultural forces, Glowacki said. 'What I really like about this paper is the finding isn't just 'biology made me do it,'' he said. 'It's very clear what the pathway to greater reproductive success is - it's access to livestock, which are obtained through raiding and then used for marriage. 'But the cultural mechanism is mediated by the elders who control virtually all aspects of the society. 'After a raid young men give any livestock they capture to the elders and the raider cannot use them at that point even if he wants to get married. 'Later in life, as the raider gets older he can gain access to them, so there's a lag in receiving benefits from participating in a raid.' Examining the connection between violence and reproductive capacity, however, is no easy feat. Glowacki lived with the Nyangatom, a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest Ethiopia and South Sudan, for more than a year, and observing virtually every part of day-to-day village life - from digging water holes to migrations. living with the Nyangatom, a group of nomadic herders living in a region of southwest Ethiopia and South Sudan (pictured), for more than a year . Typically carried out by Nyangatom men between 20 and 40 years old armed with weapons like AK-47 rifles, the raids sometimes result in serious injuries and deaths. Those who take part in the raids, however, must turn over any livestock they obtain to village elders, who use them to obtain wives for themselves. It may not be until years later that elders agree to provide a raider with the cows necessary to obtain their first wife, or subsequent wives. 'In many cultures, particularly in east Africa, in order to get married you have to give livestock to the bride's family - we refer to it as bridewealth,' Glowacki said. 'If you don't have cows, you simply cannot get married - it doesn't matter how handsome you are or how much status you have, if you don't have cows to give the bride's family, you cannot get married.' Though he found clear evidence that violence offers a benefit to warriors, Glowacki's over-riding interest is in a much larger question. 'I conducted interviews about the raids, and collected reproductive histories by asking how many wives raiders have, how many children each has had, how many are alive, how many died and how they died.' Researchers conducted interviews about the raids, and collected reproductive histories by asking how many wives raiders have, how many children each has had, how many are alive, how many died and how they died.' Using that data, Glowacki was able to build conflict histories for the young men that took part in raids and village elders detailing who participated in raids, how often they participated, whether they were married and the number of wives and children they had. In an analysis of 120 men, Glowacki said, the data was clear - those who participate in more raids had more wives and more children over the course of their lives. Using that data, Glowacki was able to build conflict histories for the young men that took part in raids and village elders detailing who participated in raids, how often they participated, whether they were married and the number of wives and children they had. In an analysis of 120 men, Glowacki said, the data was clear - those who participate in more raids had more wives and more children over the course of their lives. But while raiders did benefit from taking part in conflict, the lack of an immediate payoff, Glowacki believes, helps to keep violence in check. 'We don't have quantitative data to that effect, but there are some groups in neighboring Kenya where raiders who capture cows in a raid don't have to give them to the elders or they can sell them at a market for money, and the violence is significantly greater' he said. 'The Nyangatom have a mechanism that mediates the benefits the warriors receive,' he added. 'There is a lot of status and privilege that comes with participating in raids - when you come back to the village, the women are singing and people are parading. 'They're celebrating you, but you still go home alone.'","Researchers  studied a small tribal populations in eastern Africa .

"Almost 50 new Ebola cases have erupted in Liberia, harming the fight against an outbreak which has now infected more than 20,000 people across West Africa. Medics had hoped they were finally beating the disease in Liberia after infection rates began to fall last month amid a global disaster appeal. But today officials said 49 new cases had been identified in one part of one county - and they blamed them partly on the tradition of washing loved ones' bodies before they are buried. Scroll down for new death toll figures . Setback: 49 new Ebola cases have erupted in one area of Liberia, blamed partly on the tradition of washing loved ones' bodies before they are buried. Pictured: Nurses carry out a safe burial in Liberia (file photo) Medics have been battling with locals to halt the tradition, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) previously said caused more than a fifth of fresh Ebola cases. It has continued in some isolated communities where resources or health education are poor. Liberia's Assistant Health Minister, who detailed the new cases today, said the body-washing tradition was to blame alongside other factors such as people crossing the border to and from Sierra Leone. Speaking on state radio, Tolbert Nyenswah said the new cases had been reported between December 1 and Christmas Day in the western part of Grand Cape Mount County. The region on the border with Sierra Leone had previously reported just 18 new Ebola cases in the three weeks leading up to December 24, the date of the WHO's latest full death toll update. Central: Grand Cape Mount County, where the new cases were seen, is on the Liberia-Sierra Leone border. This WHO map shows the state of the disease across the main three affected countries as of December 24 . Mr Nyenswah said: 'In a very small population, an increase in the number of cases raises high level of concerns that we need to take very seriously as people of Liberia and people of Grand Cape Mount in particular. Today the World Health Organisation confirmed more than 20,000 people have been infected since the start of the outbreak, with the death toll now standing at 7,842 worldwide. A new test which it is claimed can diagnose Ebola in just three hours was approved today by U.S. regulators. Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said the Lightmix test would help medics fight the disease by drawing their attention away from false alarms and ensuring quick treatment. Certain laboratories in the U.S. and other countries are now authorised to use the test for a limited period to detect the type of Ebola that has been spreading. It has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for general use. More than a third were laboratory-confirmed cases in Sierra Leone, which is now the worst-hit country. The 49 new cases in Liberia represent a significant increase, however, because there were thought to have been just 121 new infections in the three weeks to December 24. The country where 3,384 people have died of Ebola - more than any other nation - had been seeing a drop in the number of new infections since mid-November. Part of the problem were religious customs in which family members wash a dead relative's body before burial, exactly the point at which Ebola is at its most infectious. Last month the WHO's Dr Pierre Formenty said medics were 'building trust and respect between burial teams, bereaved families and religious groups'. He added: 'Introducing components such as inviting the family to be involved in digging the grave and offering options for dry ablution and shrouding will make a significant difference.' In its Christmas Eve update, however, the WHO admitted there was still more work to be done. Transmission: The markets of Monrovia, Liberia's capital, had become safer places to be in recent weeks . 'While every country has sufficient capacity to isolate patients, the uneven geographical distribution of beds and cases means shortfalls persist in some districts,' a spokesman wrote. 'Each country has sufficient capacity to bury all people known to have died from Ebola, although it is possible that capacity is inadequate in some districts.' Britain has pledged £230million to curb the outbreak in West Africa, including sending British doctors and matching the first £5million of public donations pound-for-pound. Officials have warned a failure to contain it could lead to it becoming an unstoppable outbreak, the way HIV did in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, cases have so far largely been contained within Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Because of Liberia's falling infection rate it has now been eclipsed by Sierra Leone, but Liberia still has the record for the highest number of deaths. The most deadly previous outbreak in 1976, the first ever recorded, infected 318 people and killed 280 in the country now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.

"An Aussie housewife claims to have discovered ‘deception and corruption’ within the food industry, campaigning to uncover the truth about the relationship between Islam and some of Australia's major food companies. Kirralie Smith is concerned that Australians are unknowingly funding Islamic bodies every time they do the grocery shopping. She is seeking full disclosure from food companies so Aussie shoppers are fully informed so they have a choice on whether or not to buy from companies are allegedly giving funds to Islamic organisations. Scroll down for video . Kirralie Smith argues people shouldn't be 'deceived' into paying an Islamic Religious Tax . Kirralie Smith is concerned that Australians are unknowingly funding Islamic bodies every time they do the grocery shopping . Halal means permitted or lawful for Muslim adherents. Halal foods that are allowed to be eaten according to Islamic Sharia law. These foods need to be properly prepared by specific processes, including 'halal slaughter' To be halal certified the animal must be facing Mecca, have its throat cut while still alive and then ritually sacrificed by a Muslim who recites a prayer dedicating the slaughter to Allah. Foods that are haram (forbidden) in Islam include (but are not exclusive to) pork-based products, alcohol, blood and carniverous animals. She is also calling for an investigation of these Australian organisations, alleging that the international counterparts of the Islamic bodies were found using the proceeds to fund terrorism. Ms Smith is the director and founder of ‘Halal Choices' and has made a shopping guide to inform shoppers about which companies are 'Halal Certified' - meaning their foods are appropriate for Muslims to consume. To become Halal-certified, a company must pay an ongoing fee to an Islamic body to gain certification. This certification deems that the product is acceptable to be prepared in accordance with Muslim law. She argues that Australians are being ‘deceived’ by food companies who are not open about funding Islamic bodies through ‘Halal certification’. ‘I believe that as non-Muslims we should have a choice of whether or not we want to practice and fund Islamic religious ritual practices with our everyday grocery purchases,’ said Ms Smith. Dr Muhammad Khan, the CEO of Halal Australia, said the fact that the money from Halal certification went to mosques was not an issue. 'It is absolutely not necessary to talk about this subject matter,' he told The ABC. 'Don't [Kosher certification organisations] fund their own synagogues? Why can't the Islamic certification body give donations to mosque projects?' Ms Smith is seeking full disclosure from food companies so Aussie shoppers are fully informed so they have a choice on whether or not to buy from companies are allegedly giving funds to Islamic organisations . Ms Smith is the director and founder of ‘Halal Choices' and has made a shopping guide to inform shoppers about which companies are 'Halal Certified' The Byron Bay Cookie Company came under fire in early 2014 for being Halal certified, but CEO Keith Byrne said that it was similar to products being labelled gluten-free. 'We as an iconic brand have been targeted but ultimately if people look at any major producer will typically have Halal depending on the countries they supply too.' 'The Halal company that certifies us is based in Sydney, they come and they audit us and then they go away again, they don't bless our foods, they don't bless our site, there's no religious context to it, they check our hygiene and they check that there's no alcohol there,' he told The ABC. Ms Smith insists that she does not encourage any boycott of the products, clarifying that she is ‘all about choices and giving people information so they can make their own informed decisions.' ‘As a wife and a mother of three who does the shopping, I thought I should do something to take responsibility for what we bring into the household.’ The mother-of-three feels that at present Australia’s culture and core values are at risk. ‘I’m passionate about Australia – our values, our culture and especially our freedoms that have been hard fought for. 'In Australia, we generally have freedom of speech, equality, democracy and freedom of religion,' she said during a speech at a forum in March this year. ‘I believe Halal certification is in opposition to these values.’ Ms Smith is concerned that Australians are being given incorrect information about food products when companies conceal the fact their products are ‘Halal-certified’. To become Halal-certified, a company must pay an ongoing fee to an Islamic body to gain certification . The Halal certification deems that the product is acceptable to be prepared in accordance with Muslim law. Halal certification is important as Muslims have strict Islamic laws which determine if a food is acceptable (halal) or forbidden (haram) for their consumption. Foods that are Halal have been killed and prepared in a specific way, as directed by the Muslim sacred text, The Qur’an. On her website, Ms Smith encourages people to lobby the companies and government, suggesting they send the message: . 'I do not wish to support any brand that pays an Islamic religious tax to have their product halal certified. 'Less than 2% of this population is Muslim and I do not want to fund special religious rituals or political campaigns to increase the presence of Sharia Law in Australia. 'Please respect consumers and give them/us the necessary information so we can make our own choices.' Ms Smith is also concerned about the impact of the extra expense of Halal-certified production on the cost of the final product. ‘In chicken processing plants at Steggles, six fulltime, Muslim-only slaughtermen are employed,’ claims Ms Smith. ‘Two of these employees who do not actual slaughter the chickens, but their jobs are to say prayers over them.' 'I do not wish to support any brand that pays an Islamic religious tax to have their product halal certified,' said Ms Smith . Foods that are Halal have been killed and prepared in a specific way, as directed by the Muslim sacred text, The Qur’an . ‘From my point of view, I don’t need people there, paid on a fulltime basis, to pray over the chickens.’ Ms Smith is questioning how much these processes cost considering it is a service that she, as a Christian, does not want nor require. ‘The figures are huge but companies won’t disclose them because they have signed non-disclosure forms.’ Ms Smith argues the companies are failing to disclose what fees are being paid, their involvement with Halal Cerification authorities, where the money is going and even frequently failing to label their product as ‘halal-certified’. ‘I have a problem with funding being imposed upon me. ‘People shouldn’t be paying money towards those causes every time they buy groceries.’ Ms Smith is concerned about how the funds are being used Islamic Certification authorities and is advocating for an investigation. ‘The reality is that overseas it has been proven that the certification fees are going towards funding terrorism,’ said Ms Smith. ‘On a more basic level, nearly all profits from Halal certification go towards building Muslim schools and mosques.’ Although she is not adverse to funding Muslim schools and mosques, she wants transparency and awareness for the public. ‘It should be my choice if I want to fund it or not,’ said Ms Smith. We would like a thorough investigation to determine where the profits of these Halal-certification fees go. Ms Smith says many Australians are unaware about the major companies who are making payments to Halal Certification Authorites. ‘I feel so passionate because big companies, like Nestle and Sanitarium, pay big halal certification fees but don’t make it publically known so consumers can’t make a choice of whether or not they want to pay more. Ms Smith says many Australians are unaware about the major companies who are making payments to Halal Certification Authorites . Ms Smith insists she is not against Muslims but wants Australian consumers to be informed . ‘We give information to the consumer because Australians have every right to buy or not to buy the products. She is deeply concerned, alleging that many companies are paying unnecessary fees for food products that are already Halal. ‘Capilano honey pays certification fees, yet honey is universally considered halal. It is the same with white milk and yet Parmalat pays fees for certification,’ said Ms Smith. Parmalat, the parent company of Pauls and Vaalia confirms on their website that 'The gelatin used in all Pauls products is derived from beef hide and is Halal approved. Gelatin is used to thicken products, eg yogurts and dairy desserts.' Ms Smith eamiled Capilano regarding the halal certification, and received a response which said that while honey was already considered halal under Islamic law, 'it is our customer's requirement to provide halal certification in order for us to conduct business with them,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'This sounds like extortion to me. And why does nearly every fresh loaf of bread you buy in a supermarket or fast food chain have a paid halal certification? I have a list of 23 pages of halal certificates for breads,' said Ms Smith. Ms Smith insists she is not against Muslims but wants Australian consumers to be informed. She has been the victim of a ‘hate campaign’ on Twitter from people who accuse her of being ‘a bigot’ and anti-Islam. ‘We should be able to have a reasonable, rational discussion about this without name calling,’ said Ms Smith. ‘I have had a hate campaign against me on Twitter for the past couple of days and it’s not necessary.’ ‘I want to be able to talk freely without being called a racist and a bigot or disgusting names, just for wanting to have an opinion and a choice.’ ‘I am just a housewife, a mother of three, and somehow I have become the face for what many people are feeling.’ ‘I was disturbed to find there is corruption in the industry and I want conversations. I think people are afraid of discussion but I don’t know why.'","Woman concerned about groceries funding Islamic organisations .

"A woman who was arrested after ramming another driver's car and trying to run her off the road has claimed she was trying to carry out a citizen's arrest. Deidre Orozco, 50, was filmed banging on the window of Vanessa Gladieux's car, smashing into it and following her down the I-80 freeway in California. A terrified Gladieux and her passenger, Delanie Strykul, called 911 and were guided to a waiting officer, who arrested her. Orozco has since been charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon - but claims that it was Gladieux's bad driving which started it. Scroll down for video . Caught on video: Deidre Orozco, 50, is seen pushing two young women in California off the road and then blocking their path with her huge silver truck . In a phonecall from the Placer County Jail, reported by 11Alive News, the suspect said she was trying to make a citizen's arrest on Gladieux, whom she claims to have seen almost hitting other cars while texting at the wheel. According to Orozco, the footage of the terrified passengers shows nothing more than her trying to detain the driver so she could be charged with driving recklessly. Orozco added that she was upset that day because she spent the previous night in jail - and was also in pain because she had forgotten medication. Gladieux denies she was doing anything dangerous. The cellphone footage of the dramatic encounter showed Orozco yelling and honking as she swerved her huge silver truck into the women's tiny Mazda. At one point, the video shows Orozco pulling her car in front of the victims — forcing them to stop — and claiming to be a highway deputy. Orozco got out of her vehicle and tried to convince the victims that she was a highway deputy (left). She was later arrested by the real cops and booked on traffic charges for the second time in five days (right) One of the victims, passenger Delanie Strykul, says the incident started after Orozco cut them off twice, then slowed down to drive alongside their car. 'When she did that, I threw up my hands and flipped her off,' Strykul told CBS Sacramento. That got Orozco enraged, said the women, who 'feared for their lives.' 'She pulls in front of us and then pulls her car horizontal and stops us,' Strykul told CBS. The woman then gets out of her car and repeatedly knocks on Strykul's window, claiming to work in law enforcement. The young women manage to pull away — but Orozco gets back in the truck and begins to follow them, they said. Passenger Delanie Strykul (left) filmed the scary incident with Orozco and was eventually able to find the real cops to assist her (right) 'She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,' Strykul told CBS. Orozco allegedly hit the women's car and tried to push them off the road, but they were able to get away again. 'We were so scared,' Strykul told CBS. 'If she had a gun it would have been way worse.' They eventually called 911 and were told where a California Highway Patrol officer would be waiting for them. Orozco followed them off the road and was arrested, CBS reported. She's charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon. Five days earlier, Orozco had been arrested for an alleged hit-and-run in nearby Roseville. After the accident, police told the Auburn Journal, Orozco 'proceeded to drive to her relatives’ house where she threw rocks through the windows, vandalizing the home and issuing threats of bodily harm.'","Deidre Orozco, 50, was filmed banging on window then smashing into car .

"Ex-partners who post 'revenge porn' online could be treated as domestic abusers under new rules for prosecutors which come into force from today. Campaigners warn thousands of people have fallen victim to having explicit photographs published on the internet by former partners and spouses. New guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service on tackling domestic abuse will include offenders using technology to inflict misery on their victims. Guidelines on tackling domestic abuse have been broadened to cover technology-aided abuse like 'revenge porn' The government has already announced plans to to make revenge porn a specific criminal offence under the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is expected to become law next year. However, the new CPS guidelines are now in force compelling police and prosecutors to consider the use of private photos to exact revenge on exes. The new guidelines, which come into force today, brief prosecutors on the ways perpetrators can control, coerce and psychologically abuse victims within families or intimate relationships, and warn that domestic abuse occurs in all communities. The guidelines have been broadened to touch on technology-aided abuse like 'revenge porn'. 'Some examples of such abuse may include controlling the use of a complainant's phone; harassment through text, mobile, email, social networking sites etc; posting of inappropriate material such as sexually explicit or nude images or defamatory or insulting comments; or, stalking a victim through the use of GPS technology on a victim's mobile device,' the guidelines state. The vast majority of victims of revenge porn are female, such as Hannah Thompson, who was labelled a 'whore' on naked pictures placed on the Tumblr site by an ex-lover. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was hopeful that a rise in cases was a sign that more victims were coming forward . The popstar Tulisa Contostavlos was also a victim when a former boyfriend released a video of her performing a sex act. In 2012-13 there were nearly 71,000 domestic abuse prosecutions across the UK, the CPS says, and this year that figure is expected to swell to almost 90,000. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was hopeful the upswing was a sign that more victims were coming forward. 'Magistrates and prosecutors across the country are telling me that the biggest change they are seeing in the Magistrates' court room is the increase in domestic abuse cases,' she said. 'The predicted increase in caseload should be welcomed as a sign that what used to be a 'hidden shame' is now something that victims choose not suffer in silence, but there are still thousands of silent victims who should not be afraid to speak up about their abuse. 'These new guidelines will help ensure that our specialist prosecutors will handle these cases with the sensitivity, professionalism and expertise they deserve.' The guidelines also include advice on how domestic abuse can occur within gangs, and a section on immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. 'These guidelines put the victims of domestic abuse, whoever they may be, at the centre of our work. They make it clear that there is no such thing as a 'perfect victim' and there are many pre-conceptions that need to be challenged,' Ms Saunders said. 'We know, for example, that domestic abuse occurs in all walks of life and is often under-reported, sometimes due to issues around fear, intimidation, and shame, but I would urge victims to come forward as they will be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. 'I am also clear that we need to consider the implications of our decisions to prosecute, such as working with the police to ensure that victims have the support to leave home on a temporary or permanent basis or that the offender leaves the home, and that they are not prevented from doing so because their abuser controls everything, including finances.'","Crown Prosecution Service issues new guidance on tackling abuse .

"It is a problem parents face every year - how to get the kids to bed early on New Year's Eve. Many have tried changing clocks, throwing fake parties and even tuning in to TV stations on the other side of the world. However, Netflix now has a hi-tech solution- an on demand New Year's Eve show for kids that can be played at any time. Scroll down for video . Revellers wave during the New Year's Eve celebrations in Hong Kong's Times Square: Now parents can celebrate with their kids at any time thanks to an on demand show. Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries . Offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies . User spend 1 billion hours a month on service . Planning 20 original series in 2015 . Founded in 1997 as DVD service . More than a third of U.S. parents (34%) admitted to starting the party early to fool their kids into thinking it’s midnight, citing their kid’s or their own bedtime as the reason, a recent survey from Wakefield Research on behalf of Netflix. 22% would go as far as to stage a countdown of their own, the team found. To make the problem easier, Netflix commissioned a special show starring King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien. The animated lemur will host his very own kid-sized countdown “special” on Netflix that families can use to ring in 2015 whenever they choose to celebrate. The three minutes of high-energy, music-filled fun that lets kids celebrate the New Year no matter the time of day. The countdown will be available in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, UK, Ireland, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France beginning on Dec. 29th at Netflix.com/KingJulien. Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries, and offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series. Earlier this month, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies. The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York. He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’. This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO. Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’ King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien, who will host the special show on Netflix . Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’. The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows. The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices. The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers. And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation. The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix. Microsoft, Amazon, Hulu and Wuaki are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections.","Three minute show hosted by King Julien, a lemur from the hit DreamWorks film Madagasgar who now has a spin off show .

"In a significant blow for Tony Abbott ahead of the new year, female support for an Australian Prime Minister has now dropped to its lowest level in almost two decades. Despite his lack of popularity with women, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes Mr Abbott should remain the Minister for Women.

'We are seeking to do the best for Australia, we're acting in Australia's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings,' the Deputy Liberal Leader said on Monday . Tony Abbott's lack of popularity now mirrors the fall in support for newly elected PM John Howard some 18 years back.

'We are seeking to do the best for Australia, we're acting in Australia's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings,' the Deputy Liberal Leader said. However, she did concede that 'it's been a difficult time for us'. And that is reflected in the dwindling support level for Mr Abbott from men too, which according to the latest Newspoll, which is published in The Australian newspaper, has crashed 10 points since the federal election. It is now at its lowest level since Mr Abbott toppled Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the leadership in 2009. She also leapt to the defence of her embattled leader, who was criticised over his claim that his greatest achievement as Minister for Women was abolishing the carbon tax. 'I think the Prime Minister mentioned a number of things, not only the carbon tax,' she added. 'I think one of the most important things we can do is repair the budget and put Australia on a strong economic footing so that Australian women can realise their potential, can have the opportunity to have a job if they wish.' 'The PM has chosen to take that portfolio and I think it's important to have it in the office of the PM, it reflects the significance we attach to women's issues,' Julie Bishop said in response to questions as to whether Mr Abbott should relinquish the Minister for Women role . The PM - who was the target of Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech - recently drew more fire for suggesting that sexism was behind criticism of his powerful chief of staff. Mr Abbott slapped down members of his own party following reports of growing tension between Peta Credlin, his top adviser, and coalition ministers, particularly Julie Bishop. 'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott stated. 'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.' Recent polls have underscored Julie Bishop's increasing popularity, with her own approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past six months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull. Julie Bishop leapt to the defence of her embattled leader, who was criticised over his claim that his greatest achievement as Minister for Women was abolishing the carbon tax. 'I think the Prime Minister mentioned a number of things, not only the carbon tax,' she added in an interview on Monday . There was also the widely-reported argument between Ms Bishop and the PM, after she read media reports that a male colleague, Andrew Robb, would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, Peru. But the Foreign Minister kept to message on Monday, stating that jobs and opportunity remain the government's focus, as the Coalition's support among female voters came in at 36 per cent for the past three months, down eight points since the federal poll. She was adamant that there was no need for Mr Abbott to relinquish the role of Minister for Women. 'The PM has chosen to take that portfolio and I think it's important to have it in the office of the PM, it reflects the significance we attach to women's issues,' she said. 'The fact that it's held in the highest office in the land I think is a positive.'

Labor also enjoys stronger female support as the year comes to a close .

"North Korea has blamed the US for the third shut down of its internet and 3g network in a week as the cyber war between the two countries over the Sony hack raged on. But the apparent reprisal attacks on the secretive state has prompted the Western world to ask what effect it had on the people and services of North Korea. The answer is simply not much. Very few of its citizens are connected to the internet in a country where the regime fiercely control any outside influence for fear of sparking dissent. But MailOnline has been given a fascinating glimpse into the technology of North Korea captured during five years of visits from 2008 to 2013. They reveal a country wrestling with the need for the knowledge the World Wide Web offers, outright propaganda and the desire to its subjugated citizens in their place. Scroll down for video . Not for your eyes: In this picture, taken in 2010, officials barred anyone from removing the kitsch cover on the computer . Big Brother is watching you: Workers go about their business with their leaders keeping a close eye on them . Solidarity: Some companies uses internet but everybody uses the same email address (pictured left). This North Korean girl (right) asked to use the photograhper's iPad . The mysterious blackouts hit after the US warned of a retaliation against North Korea's capital city's alleged hacking of Sony Pictures. The latest, On Saturday, came after the North Korean government called President Obama 'a monkey living in a tropical forest' in a racist rant against the United States. The FBI has accused the rogue state of launching the crippling cyber-attack on Sony for producing The Interview, a comedy that depicts a fictional plot to assassinate the North's leader Kim Jong-Un. Security experts say North Korea's internet infrastructure is so skeletal that even amateurs - or a simple glitch - could have brought it clattering down. Most ordinary people in North Korea have no access to the internet and it is believed there are only 1,000 IP addresses - the label assigned to each device that uses the Internet - and these are reserved for trusted VIPs, the military, some universities, libraries - and presumably the now notorious Unit 121 of 'cyber warrior' group. This compares to 112 million in South Korea or 1.5 billion in the U.S. 'A large city block in London or New York would have more IP addresses than North Korea,' said Ofer Gayer, a security researcher at  California-based Incapsula Inc. The technology can often be seen in the propaganda material such as this school poster (pictured left). Some 20,000 young koreans (right) sit facing the spectators at the Korean Mass Games and flip coloured cards to form animated images . This man, who has access to a computer, acts as a 'human Google search engine' There are believed to be about a million computers in The North and everyone who owns a computer must register it. They are mainly available at educational and state institutions - but most lack any connection to the world wide web. So USB keys and small hard drives that have made their way across the border have become an huge source of information of the world outside country. And anyone with a working computer becomes a magnet. In 2009, North Koreans would visit a 'study house' in the capital Pyongyang and ask a man with a computer a question. The human Google search engine would then come back with an answer 24 hours later. In the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang, officials reckon there is room for 30 million books to be stored, but only a couple of thousand books are available. North Korean people can access a CD library and hear the recordings on big ghetto blasters, but unsurprisingly the choice of CDs is not massive. You can listen to the radio, or watch TV too but only the national channel because the tuner is also blocked on the local frequency. The country has its own desktop operating system called Red Star, and applications are believed to include OpenOffice, games and an engineering calculator, according to Michael Grothaus, a senior writer at Co.Labs. It is claimed that during the early 2000s the regime swapped its Windows based operating system for one that looked remarkably like the Mac OSX - proving that even dictators fell for the allure of Jobs' Apple.

Coding also means every time North Korea's leader's names are published, they appear 20 per cent larger than the other text on the page. The web is also a good way to promote the north Korean ideology. kcna.kp (Korean Central News Agency) website is the major source of information spread to the world, focusing on the activities of Kim Jong Un.

"Tucked up snugly side by side, these beautiful triplets look a picture of health. But their lives were saved by a risky operation performed while they were still in the womb after they developed a rare condition which threatened to kill them all. Thanks to the skill of surgeons who performed the delicate operation, all three girls survived the surgery and were born tiny but healthy. Scroll down for video . Triplets Eilah, Erin and Elsie underwent a risky operation performed while they were still in the womb after they developed a rare condition which threatened to kill them all - and were born tiny but healthy . Triplets Eilah, Erin and Elsie were delivered safely in October, when they weighed 3lbs 1oz, 2lbs 12oz and 2lbs respectively. Smallest triplet Elsie was so tiny that her parents were warned she might have to stay in hospital for several months but – to their delight – she thrived and was allowed home on Christmas Eve. Mother Laura Slinger, 26, said: ‘We have three healthy daughters and that’s the best Christmas present anyone could ask for.’ Miss Slinger, a beauty salon manager who lives near Burnley, Lancashire, and her partner Martyn Halliwell were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets, conceived naturally without fertility treatment. Baby Elsie (right) was finally discharged on Christmas Eve, meaning the family were able to spend their first Christmas together at home, and now weighs 5lbs although she is still smaller than her 7lb sisters . But 17 weeks into the pregnancy doctors treating Miss Slinger detected a problem with the blood supply between two of the babies. Although all three were growing in the womb together, two of the girls Eilah and Elsie were identical twins and sharing their blood supply from the placenta. They were diagnosed with Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), a rare condition where one twin gets too much of the blood supply, while the other twin is effectively starved of nutrients. Smaller twin Elsie was at risk of not developing properly while her bigger sister Eilah was receiving too great a share of the blood supply, putting a strain on her developing heart. Their parents were told the triplets’ only hope was an operation to divide the twins’ blood supply, although the operation meant all three girls were at risk. Although the independent triplet, Erin, was not affected by the shared blood supply, her life could have been in danger if the condition led to an infection in the womb or premature labour, or if the surgery went wrong. Although all three were in womb together, Eilah and Elsie were identical twins and shared their blood supply . Laura Slinger and partner Martyn Halliwell were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets, conceived naturally without fertility treatment - they were devastated to discover the girls were at risk . Mr Halliwell, 29, a sales manager, said: ‘It was devastating when we knew all their lives were at risk and that they were literally killing each other. ‘We were worried about the operation as we knew that in itself could be fatal for the babies, but we knew we had no option if we wanted to try to save their lives.’ The specialist surgery was carried out by Dr Amar Bhide  at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South London, using a laser to separate the twins’ blood supply. The girls’ parents then faced an anxious two-week wait to learn if the new blood supply was functioning properly. Mr Halliwell said: ‘It was very nerve-racking but the doctors and hospital staff were wonderful and reassuring. ‘We knew the operation was risky but there were also risks afterwards. Six hours later the triplets’ hearts were all still beating which was such a relief. ‘We were so thrilled when we heard that the operation had worked and we hadn’t lost any of the girls.’ The girls were initially due to be born in January but doctors scanned Miss Slinger every week after the operation and delivered the triplets at Liverpool Women’s Hospital in October. Their premature birth meant they were all kept in hospital for weeks and they were transferred to Burnley General Hospital to be closer to their parents’ home. The premature babies were kept in hospital for weeks and they were transferred to Burnley General Hospital . The tricky operation was a success and the triplets are now safe and well at home with their parents . Eilah and Erin were allowed home in early December but smallest triplet Elsie had to stay on oxygen in hospital. She was finally discharged on Christmas Eve, meaning the family were able to spend their first Christmas together at home, and now weighs 5lbs although she is still smaller than her 7lb sisters. Mr Halliwell said: ‘They were so tiny when they were born, but they were all little fighters. ‘They’d had a battle for survival which began in the womb and they have fought all the way through. We are so proud of them. ‘Life is a bit manic now they’re all at home. Erin sleeps a lot but the twins seem to set each other off every time one of them starts to cry, but we are so happy. It’s the best possible Christmas present.’ Consultant obstetrician Dr Bhide, who performed the operation to separate the babies’ blood supply, said he was delighted all three triplets were born safely. He said he had only carried out a handful of such operations, saying: ‘It is a rare operation in twins and even rarer in triplets as each normally have their own placenta. ‘It is a tricky operation with triplets as the extra baby and its placenta can make reaching the other two babies difficult. I’m delighted that the triplets have been born healthy and safe.’","Triplets developed rare condition in womb which threatened to kill them all .

"The Danish royals are about to be given a Hollywood makeover - two films are being made about the Crown Prince Of Denmark and his colourful love life. The first biopic, called Frederik's Young Years, will cover the Crown Prince Frederik's past as a prolific playboy. The second, called Mary: The Making of A Princess, will focus on his fairy tale romance with his now-wife, the Australian 'commoner' Mary Donaldson, who he met in a pub in Sydney 14 years ago. Scroll down for video . Two films are to be made about Crown Prince Of Denmark's colourful love life. The first charts his younger years as a playboy in the 1990s. The second focuses on his fairy tale romance with his now-wife, the Australian 'commoner' Mary Donaldson, who he met in a pub in Sydney 14 years ago. The couple are pictured here with two of their four children, Princess Isabella and Prince Christian . Both projects are expected to air on television by the end of the year, with the first funded partially by the Danish government and the latter produced by Australian company Fremantle Media. The royals have been bracing themselves for Frederik's Young Years for the last couple of months, with movie producers expected to lift the lid on the prince's past as an eligible bachelor. He dated the former Danish MP Malou Aamund and a string of glamorous  models in the 1990s, including Katja Storkholm, to whom he allegedly proposed, before finally settling down with Mary. The Danish actor-director Christian Tafdrup is casting for the biopic and has been given a grant of €27,000 (£21,183) towards the project by the Danish Film Institute. Mary and Fredrik married on May 14, 2004, in a lavish ceremony    in Copenhagen Cathedral . He has spent a year researching and interviewing those close to the royals and is also rumoured to have had several conversations with Katja Storkholm about her relationship with Frederik. But despite the film's subject, Christian has insisted that he is not looking to sensationalise the prince's love life. He is also planning on fictionalising a large part of the film. He told Danish film magazine Ekko: 'It's a fictional film about the royal family built on facts, inspired by the international wave of biopics about living people, it can be a dangerous area, but that is also part of the motivation. 'Royals are good characters in films – they have a god-like status and at the same time they must face the same challenges as everyone else.' Mary Donaldson from Tasmania first met Frederik in the bar of Sydney's Slip Inn during the 2000 Olympics . The film by Fremantle Media called Mary: The Making of A Princess is less likely to contain any clangers that could embarrass the royal family, as it focuses on the romance between Frederik and the now-Crown Princess of Denmark Mary. The script details the hurdles that 'commoner' Mary faced in adapting her normal and carefree life to that of a royal who is known globally for her great sense of style, much like Britain's Duchess Of Cambridge. Mary Donaldson from Tasmania first met Frederik in the bar of Sydney's Slip Inn during the 2000 Olympics. Hobart-born Mary, who is the youngest daughter of a maths professor and a university secretary, was working at an advertising company as a marketing manager at the time, when the royal introduced himself to her as 'Fred'. Prince Frederik proposed to Mary during a holiday to Rome in September 2003, three years after they met . According to Hello magazine, she later said of the incident: 'The first time we met we shook hands. I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, ""Do you know who these people are?""' Prince Frederik returned to his homeland after the games but made several visits back to Australia to visit Mary and the couple went on short trips around the continent together. But it wasn't until April 2003 that Denmark's Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged their relationship. Frederik proposed a few months later during a holiday to Rome and the couple were married on May 14, 2004, in a lavish ceremony attended by royals - and media - from across the globe in Copenhagen Cathedral in the Danish capital. From left to right: The Danish Crown Princess Mary, the Danish Crown Prince Frederik, his father Prince Henrik and mother, Queen Margrethe of Denmark at a party in 2004 at Christiansborg castle in Copenhagen . It was described as the ultimate happy fairy tale ending with the Prince marrying the beautiful commoner; . The guest list included the kings and queens of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands as well as Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. Frederik and Mary's first child Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John was born in October 2005 and the couple have since had another son called Prince Vincent and two daughters, Princess Josephine and Princess Isabella. Actresses Margot Robbie, 34, and Rose Byrne, 35, are both in the running to play Mary, but Fremantle's publicity manager Adrian Motte told The Guardian that no decision has been made on roles yet. He said: 'We haven’t cast yet or shot a frame and we don’t have a director that we can announce at this stage but the project is being overseen by Fremantle Media Australia’s Head of Drama, Jo Porter.'","Two films to be made about Crown Prince Of Denmark's colourful love life .

"An Islamic State propaganda magazine has lavished Sydney cafe gunman Man Haron Monis with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid'. It's also reissued a call for lone wolf attacks in Australia and taunted Western helplessness in the face of the threat.

Gunman: Man Haron Monis was killed during the siege's violent conclusion in the early hours of December 16 . Gunned down: A spray of police bullets killed Man Haron Monis on December 16 . In the foreword to its sixth edition, the IS magazine Dabiq described Monis as a brother and said he was fighting in the path of Allah. He did so 'by acting alone and striking the kuffar (non-believers) where it would hurt them most - in their own lands and on the very streets that they presumptively walk in safety,' the magazine states. 'It didn't take much; he got hold of a gun and stormed a cafe taking everyone inside hostage. 'Yet in doing so, he prompted mass panic, brought terror to the entire nation ... The blessings in his efforts were apparent from the very outset.' At the start of the siege, a black flag with Arabic writing was visible in a window of the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. Dabiq declared this was 'a testament to his sincerity'. Terror on the streets of Sydney: Lindt cafe worker Jieun Bae was the terrified face of the Sydney siege . It said Monis joined other Muslims who answered a jihadist call 'to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be'. In October, Dabiq published calls for lone wolf attacks across western nations, especially US, UK, France, Australia and Germany. It repeated that statement in the latest edition. 'There will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia,' it said. Melbourne teenager Haider was shot dead after stabbing two police officers. 'All that the West will be able to do is to anxiously await the next round of slaughter and then issue the same tired, cliche statements in condemnation of it when it occurs.' A week ago Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned there had been a heightened level of 'terrorist chatter' in the aftermath of the Sydney siege tragedy. However, Australia's terror threat level hasn't been lifted - remaining at high, which means an attack is likely.","The Islamic State's Dabiq propaganda magazine praised Man Haron Monis for 'daring' raid .

"MIT Students have built a working wooden rollercoaster for a rush week celebration. Known as the East Campus Roller Coaster, the stunt has become a tradition among engineering students. Freshmen are invited to ride the coaster strapped into a small buggy - with many braving it backwards. Scroll down to see the coaster in action . Freshmen spent a week building the coaster, and over 400 people were able to ride it over a party weekend. 'After a hiatus of a few years, the roller coaster was brought back and was bigger and better than ever,' the students said. The coaster was designed by three mechanical engineering juniors - Ben Katz, Jaguar Kristeller, and Wesley Lau - and built in the span of a week by the incoming freshmen, who were eventually allowed to ride it. Riders are strapped into a racecar seat mounted on a trolley . The ride was a huge success. 'By the end, the total ride and reset time was under 3 minutes,' said Ben Katz, one of the engineers who built it. 'In total I'd estimate around 400 people were able to ride the roller coaster between Sunday night and Thursday afternoon, when we closed it down.' Katz also admitted he was the test pilot for the coaster. 'Once the plywood track had been laid down, we slowly rolled the cart along the track, so make sure it traveled smoothly, then we did an unmanned test run with an empty cart, followed by a test run with 150 lbs of sand in the cart. 'Then I got to go. This was my first time riding a roller coaster of any kind. It was awesome.' However, the team admit they had to scale back their design - which originally featured a loop. 'Unfortunately, we had to scrap the loop,' they wrote in a blog post explaining the stunt. 'One of the steps to getting the coaster approved by MIT and Cambridge was going through MIT's Environment, Health and Safety department (EHS). 'Basically, EHS said No Upside-Down People. Period.' The initial design for the coaster included a loop - but MIT's health and safety department banned it . T g-forces riders would experience were also mapped out by the team before construction started. 'You'll see that, with the friction estimate used, G-forces actually go just barely negative at the top of the second hill,' the team said. The team also admit the coaster did not last long. 'One big unknown pre-building was how the plywood track would hold up to repeated use, said Ben Katz. 'By the time we stopped doing rides, there were a couple small patches of plywood where the top ply had started falling apart. 'If we did want to run the roller coaster for longer, however, it would have been easy to replace just the top layer of plywood where it was wearing out.' Timber for the project was delivered on a monday, with freshmen beginning construction immediately. By Tuesday, the frame had begun to take shape, and the first ride took place on Friday. The school and city required they submit plans for their design to the Inspectional Services Department with a letter of recommendation from a certified engineering firm. Richard Henige, vice president of the Boston-based firm LeMessurier, said his company reviewed the drawings put together by MIT students building the roller coaster . 'Students themselves developed the sketches and calculations, and at MIT's request we reviewed the sketches and made some comments to them. We then submitted a letter to the city saying that the plans would conform to the Massachusetts State Building Code,' he told Boston magazine. Based on the information forwarded by the engineers, the city deemed it a safe structure for campus use, and gave students the green light to begin building and have some fun.","East Campus rollercoaster is a tradition on the MIT Campus .

"President Barack Obama said Monday that Iran might join Cuba as a second rogue state to enjoy normalized diplomatic relations with the United States under his administration. In a 40-minute interview with National Public Radio conducted on December 18 – but held back for 11 days – the  radio network's senior morning host quizzed Obama in the Oval Office about a wide range of policy positions, including his plans for the Middle East. 'Is there any scenario under which you can envision, in your final two years, opening a U.S. embassy in Tehran?' asked NPR's Steve Inskeep. 'I never say never,' Obama replied, while allowing that 'I think these things have to go in steps.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . ROGUE NATIONS? Obama aired the astonishing possibiity of normalized U.S.-Iran relationsjust a few days after announcing that he would restore formal diplomatic ties with the communist enclave of Cuba . STRATEGY: President Barack Obama sat down in the Oval Office with NPR's Steve Inskeep on December 18, but the public radio network held its interview back for 11 days . The unprecedented olive branch pointed in the direction of Iran's mullahs will stoke controversy among older Americans who recall the 1979 hostage crisis in the last embassy Washington maintained there. Fifty-two Americans, mostly diplomatic personnel, were taken hostage in November of that year and held for 444 days but a group of student revolutionaries. In Iran the event is still celebrated as the 'Conquest of the American Spy Den.' Few observers believe Iran is interested in proving its stated intentions to abandon its nuclear-weapons ambitions by the time Obama leaves office in January 2017. But the president believes there's a chance. 'We have to get this nuclear issue resolved – and there's a chance to do it,' he said, 'and the question's going to be whether or not Iran is willing to seize it.' If the country's anti-America hardliners yield to more moderate voices, he predicted, 'there's incredible talent and resources and sophistication inside of Iran, and it would be a very successful regional power that was also abiding by international norms and international rules, and that would be good for everybody.' 'That would be good for the United States, that would be good for the region, and most of all, it would be good for the Iranian people.' Obama shocked the world – and angered America's Cuban emigres – with a December 17 announcement that he would re-establish formal ties with the Raul Castro regime in Havana. But speaking to NPR eleven days ago, he painted Iran differently – noting that a more recent history of aggression makes U.S.-Iran relations 'different from the history between us and Cuba.' 'And the strategic importance of Tehran is – or Iran – is different from what we face with Cuba.' The Islamic republic, he reminded Inskeep, 'has a track record of state-sponsored terrorism, that we know was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon.' But in the same breath Obama said 'Tehran is a large, sophisticated country.' Tehran is Iran's capital city. NOT THE SAME THING: Obama insisted that 'the strategic importance of ... Iran is different from what we face with Cuba' WINNERS: Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (center) and the Islamic republic's political class will gain global clout from Obama's pronouncement . That lapse aside, Obama emphasized Monday a theme that he has grappled with since the heady days of his first presidential campaign: the prospect of changing the global diplomatic map by bringing unfriendly nations under America's wing. 'I was asked very early in my presidential race back in 2007 – would I meet with these various rogue regimes?' he recalled. 'And what I said then remains true: If I thought it advances American interests, yes. I believe in diplomacy, I believe in dialogue, I believe in engagement.' He also claimed credit for what he characterized as a realignment of global attitudes toward Iran . 'When I came into office, the world was divided and Iran was in the driver's seat,' Obama said. But through economic sanctions, 'now the world's united because of the actions we've taken, and Iran's the one that's isolated.' 'I mean, there's a reason why we've been able to get this far in the negotiations,' he said: 'We mobilized the international community at the start of my presidency – a classic example of American leadership.' But Iran's supreme religious authorities, who run the country despite the fig leaf of a constitutional government, has 'a path to break through that isolation,' Obama declared. 'And they should seize it.' Obama drew criticism in 2008 for subtly changing his positiion on negotiating with antagonistic countries. Speaking to an audience of Jewish advocates in June of that year, he insisted that he had 'no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking.' 'But as president of the United States, I would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate Iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interest of the United States.' But during a debate eight months earlier he was asked whether he would be willing to meet Iran's leaders 'without precondition,' during the first year of his administration. 'I would,' then-Senator Obama replied. 'And the reason is this: the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them – which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [George W.

"TV show Undercover Boss has caused outrage among viewers after it featured a sports bar where the CEO fired a bartender for refusing to wear just her bikini top on camera and gave a waitress a 'work incentive' of free implants. Sunday night's episode focused on Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill, an establishment which prides itself on waitresses and bartenders who dress in bikini tops, jean shorts and cowboy boots and is a trademarked 'breastaurant'. CEO Doug Guller disguised himself to go undercover at one restaurant of his chain which has several locations in Texas, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Guller has said that his restaurant focuses on four things - booze, food, sports and sex - and boasted that makes it 'recession-proof'. Scroll down for video . Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill CEO Doug Guller (left in disguise) appeared on reality show Undercover Bosses on Sunday night where he assessed the work of his waitresses and bartenders who also must wear bikinis and jean shorts on the job (right) Waitress Gracie, 23, won her boss's approval and was offered free breast implants if she keeps up the good work and enthusiastic attitude for six months . On the show, Guller analyzed his employees' skills and hard work - before firing one who refused to wear only a bikini top while being filmed and offering a boob job to another staffer who impressed him. As a 'new employee' , Guller shadowed bartender Jessica and admitted he was 'p*****' to find she has chosen to wear a T-shirt while being filmed instead of her bikini top because she didn't feel comfortable. 'That's not what we do here at Bikinis,' Guller added. 'We wear bikinis, jean shorts, and cowboy boots.' The CEO went undercover at his sports bar dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Jessica also confided that she was looking for a new job but was bar-tending to support herself as she was a logistics expert who lost her job when her old company went bankrupt.

Guller (left) appeared on Undercover Boss disguised in jeans and a T-shirt. He said he was 'p*****' to find bartender Jessica wearing a T-shirt (right) instead of a bikini because she was uncomfortable in a skimpy top while being filmed . Guller ultimately fires Jessica at the end of the episode for not wearing her bikini and lacking in enthusiasm - but not before offering to put a good word in for her with other employers. Next up was waitress Gracie, 23, an employee who was fired four time times in the past three years but whose enthusiasm nevertheless impressed the bar owner. Culler gently chided Gracie for checking her phone at work - before offering her the incentive of a free boob job if she promised not to text at work and keep up the chipper attitude for the next six months. Following his starring reality TV role, Guller tweeted: 'Thank you very much #undercoverboss. Many thanks to Chris George & the Bikinis team, ya'll rock! #BikinisSportsBarAndGrill #eatwithyoureyes.'

"Three fur-sellers tossed bleach and ammonia from a New York City roof onto animal rights activists below, police and online video show. Lawrence Andrews, 35, Luis Justino, 40, and David Haber, 53, are charged with reckless endangerment, harassment and criminal mischief. Prosecutors say the three men went to the top of a six-story Manhattan building and dumped bleach at an anti-fur protest happening on the street. 'You bleached a baby!' one person is heard yelling on a YouTube video of the incident. Sickening: Video shows a dad and his toddler running from a rain of bleach as as fur sellers pour the chemical agent from a New York City rooftop to disperse a group of animal rights activists . A number of other passersby were also struck by the toxic chemicals . A few pedestrians were also struck by the cleaning chemicals. 'It was definitely crazy,' animal rights activist Robert Banks told DNAinfo New York. 'All of a sudden gallons of bleach come crashing down — we saw a baby get hit, and it got on a lot of their furs, too.' The child was not harmed, according to several reports. Police say two of the men were caught inside the building with garbage bags reeking of cleaning fluid. One of the men told police that he was told to 'go onto the roof and throw bleach and ammonia at protesters,' CBS New York reported. The men were arrested Dec. 20. They were released and told to appear on Jan. 26. Video caught by animal rights activists shows as police nab two of the men accused of pouring bleach onto protesters . The men argue with a cop in the aftermath of the bleach-pouring incident . Gregory Gomez, an attorney for Justino, says his client denies any involvement in the incident and the allegations are unproven. Haber suspects a set-up behind the charges. 'Why would we throw bleach on our own merchandise, on our own vendor, and on innocent people in the street?' Haber told CBS New York. Activists say this man was one of the three people behind the bleach pouring that struck a toddler and several passersby . Banks finds the charges ludicrous. 'It's pretty obvious who the troublemakers are,' the activist told CBS New York. 'We were just kind of looking at the cameras hoping that someone got it on camera,' Banks told the station. 'Luckily for us they did, because they could have blamed it on us.' At least one protester was arrested on misdemeanor charges after a fur vendor reported being assaulted, according to CBS New York.","Lawrence Andrews, 35, Luis Justino, 40, and David Haber, 53, are charged with reckless endangerment, harassment and criminal mischief .

"Sydney councils have been accused of going soft on smokers who disobey smoking bans on some of the regions most popular beaches, sparking outrage from environmentalists. Some local councils have informed rangers patrolling the areas to either not inforce the ban or to not issue a fine for the breach, which could set smokers back between $110 and $200. Bondi, Manly and Coogee rangers have allegedly been instructed by council to not fine people who flout the ban, and Randwick and Waverly councils also do not enforce the penalty. Sydney councils have been accused of going soft on smokers who disobey smoking bans . Under the NSW Smoke Free Environment Act, many public areas such as playgrounds, pools, and bus stops are smoke free. However, many Sydney beaches are either smoke 'friendly', or are under the authority of lenient smoke-free laws enforcement. A cigarette butt collection study revealed that Bondi Beach had more than one million discarded cigarette butts left in the sand, reported The Daily Telegraph. 'This noxious material is blowing all over the place and there is legislation to stop it on the beaches,' said Clean Up Australia head Ian Kiernan. Mr Kiernan said local councils needed to be firmer on smoking regulations, but Waverley mayor Sally Betts said that the area used education campaigns and no-smoking signs as deterrents. Bondi, Manly and Coogee rangers have allegedly been instructed by council to ignore the ban entirely, and Randwick and Waverly councils also do not enforce the penalty . 'This noxious material is blowing all over the place and there is legislation to stop it on the beaches,' said Clean Up Australia head Ian Kiernan . A cigarette butt collection study revealed that Bondi Beach had more than one million discarded cigarette butts left in the sand . Ms Betts said that most locals tended to obey the no-smoking ban, but that the main barrier came from tourists who didn't understand the regulations. 'There is a ­language barrier and many are used to being able to smoke anywhere they want in their own countries. Our rangers are continually saying to people ‘this is a non-smoking area, please don’t smoke’ and people usually apologise and say ‘we didn’t know’,' said Ms Betts. Emma Richardson, an English backpacker who had been photographed smoking on the beach, said that she had not seen the no-smoking signs and was not aware of the ruling. Randwick council took a hardline approach to the issue when it recently banned smoking on it's beaches, which councillor Katherine Nielson said followed on the no-smoking ban in other public areas such as playgrounds and bus stops. 'It's not just [about] the passive smoking, which is bad for all of us, but the butts are also very difficult for the cleaning mechanism machines to pick up,' Councillor Nielson said. 'We've already got the signs, it's just a matter of adding a [no-smoking] symbol to the signs,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'We didn’t want to make it a money-making exercise because I think most people, if asked by a lifeguard not to smoke, will ­apologise and put the cigarette out,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

"A woman who spent eight years battling infertility has received an incredible Christmas present after delivering four healthy baby girls. The two sets of identical twins - Indie, Esme, Scarlett and Evangeline - were born on Sunday to Ashley and Tyson Gardner by Cesarean section in the 29th week of pregnancy. The babies were delivered at 5pm and weighed around 2lbs each. Proud father Tyson posted that the new mom and four daughters 'were doing incredible' after the birth which was a one-in-70-million chance. Watch video here .

Ashley Gardner (left), pictured after giving birth by Cesarean section on Sunday, is now mom to four baby girls, Indie, Esme, Scarlett and Evangeline. Her proud husband Tyson with Dr Minton (right) Mr Gardner, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, also thanked the doctors and nurses who delivered the babies. The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair. The Gardners also shared that they will be featured on a TV series on the TLC network about the pregnancy, birth of their 'quad squad' and adventures over the coming months. Mr Gardner wrote: 'We can’t wait to have you all along on this journey!' Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing  contractions early on Sunday. The couple became an internet sensation after they made a video earlier this year showing their startled but ecstatic reaction to the news that they had four babies on the way. Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online. Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies. The couple posted a picture shortly before the birth with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks' Festive: The couple, pictured above at Christmas just days before Ashely's contractions started, kept their huge Facebook following updated with topical pictures . Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. The couple wrote in a Facebook post: 'We were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.' Since then, the couple have posted regular updates on the progress of the pregnancy, including themed snaps of Ashley in costume for Halloween and Christmas. The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant. The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October. All I want for Christmas: The quadruplets' survival has been termed a miracle, after risky surgery nine weeks ago managed to save them . Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems. In October, the Gardners posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ''This has been a good day!'' 'Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!' The couple, who say the babies are doing 'great' and receiving 'fabulous care', have promised more updates when possible.

"More than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure that has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months. The number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years – making up the equivalent of a city the size of Wolverhampton. The figures, which are published today by Oxford University’s respected Migration Observatory, are based on analysis of the official Labour Force Survey. Scroll down for video . More than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure that has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months. Pictured: Romanians catch a bus to Britain . The data also shows that around one in five working-age migrants from Romania and Bulgaria are not in work – a total of 46,000. Arrivals from both countries have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in January. Tory MP Peter Bone, whose Wellingborough constituency is in Northamptonshire, said the figures disproved the claims of those who said numbers would not increase sharply when the controls were abandoned. ‘It’s quite clear that people were wrong,’ he said. ‘The number one issue in my constituency is controlling immigration from the EU. ‘We have to get to grips with it. We have to act now and if that causes a row with the EU then so be it.’ He called for an emergency brake on EU numbers adding: ‘It’s putting pressure on the doctors’ surgeries, the schools, the council services and housing.’ The Migration Observatory’s analysis said migrant numbers from both countries had ‘grown steadily’ since the countries joined the EU in 2007. Arrivals from both Romania and Bulgaria have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in January . The numbers align almost exactly with predictions from the MigrationWatch think-tank which suggested net migration from both countries would average around 50,000 a year. The figures show that in 2006, in the year before Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, the population of nationals from both countries living here stood at just 43,000. It barely changed the following year before steadily increasing, to 98,000 in 2009, 132,000 in 2010 and 160,000 in 2012. The Left had dismissed the idea that relaxing rules on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria would lead to a surge in numbers in Britain. Most notably, Lib Dem Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said the idea of thousands ‘pouring off the planes... was just a scare story’. The BBC also downplayed the situation. In May, when it reported there were fewer workers from the two countries in the UK in March than in January, political editor Nick Robinson scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants.’ In September of 2013, the year before transitional controls were dropped, it stood at 205,000 but by the same point in 2014 it hit 252,000. This means the population from the two countries increased by 47,000 in the 12 months to September and is five times higher than it was eight years ago. The Migration Observatory said the not-in-work total of 46,000 will include a large number of students, spouses, dependants and those wealthy enough not to work. Madeleine Sumption, the observatory’s director, said: ‘Immigration from Romania and Bulgaria has been much more gradual than flows from the EU member states that joined in 2004. ‘In 2004, the UK was one of only three EU member states that did not introduce transitional labour market controls on migrants from new accession states, and saw a sharp increase in migration from these countries. ‘It seems likely that the controls imposed in 2007, together with the weak economy at the end of the decade, may have slowed the pace of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants settling in the UK.’","More than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarians now in Britain .

"Pregnant women are taking the selfie craze to a new level by posting pictures of their 12-week scan  online for friends to predict the sex. A poll by parenting site Netmums found a third of parents had uploaded scans to social media sites like Twitter and Facebook for other users to guess whether their baby will be a boy or a girl. A further fifth put pictures on parenting sites asking for others' opinions. Scroll down for video . Pregnant women have sparked a baby scan selfie craze in which they post images of their 12-week scan online, inviting people to guess their unborn baby's gender . The fastest-growing scan analysis trend is the 'nub theory', which uses the 12-week scan picture to see what angle the nub - a small lump where the genitals will develop - is pointing. The theory, used by one in ten, says if the baby's nub points up by 30 degrees or more it is a boy. If it is less than 30 degrees it's a girl, with seven out of ten claiming the technique accurately predicted their baby's sex. Meanwhile, six per cent said they tried the 'skull theory', with a square skull and jaw said to be a baby boy and a rounder skull a girl. But seven out of ten expectant mums use the more traditional method to guess the sex of their baby by the shape of their bump. If it is wider it is said to predict a girl, but if the bump protrudes more it could be a boy. A third analysed their food cravings and half even tried to predict the gender by how sick they felt. The nub theory is the fastest growing scan analysis trend, according to a poll by parenting site Netmums. Parents use the 12-week scan picture to see what angle the nub - a small lump where the genitals will develop - is pointing. The theory, used by one in ten mothers-to-be, says if the baby's nub points up by 30 degrees or more it's a boy. If it's less than 30 degrees it's a girl, with seven out of ten claiming the technique accurately predicted their baby's sex. More unusual methods included a twelfth who looked at the size and shape of their breasts, and a fifth who used a Chinese Gender Calculator to guess the sex using conception date and the mother's age. Overall, one in eight couples admitted they had tried to 'sway' the gender of their child to get their desired sex. This included more than a third making love in a specific position. Over a fifth had sex at set times of the month, with making love on the day of ovulation believed to be more likely to create a boy. But if couples stop having sex three to four days before ovulation their efforts are more likely to produce a girl. One in 16 couples also timed sex to match phases of the moon. Many tried a 'gender diet', with one in seven mothers eating a diet said to influence the sex, along with a twelfth making their partner follow suit. It is claimed a low calorie diet with lots of leafy green veg and fruit makes it more likely to have a girl, with brooding mothers-to-be skipping breakfast. One in ten mothers to be polled by parenting site Netmums used the 'nub theory' to predict their baby's gender. They claim that if the nub - a small lump which where the genitals will develop - is pointing up by 30 degrees or more it's a boy, if less then it's a girl . But for a boy, they should have a high calorie diet packed with potassium rich foods such as bananas, red meat and salty food. And breakfast is a must. Netmums, which polled a total of 2,227 women, found 11 per cent now get early tests to find out the sex of the baby before the 20 week scan. A further eight per cent booked a high-powered 14-week scan which is the first time the baby's gender is usually clear. Netmums Managing Director Rimi Atwal, said: 'Selfies at 10 weeks gestation may seem strange but young mums use selfies at every step of their lives, so sharing scan pictures is the natural way to involve friends, families and even strangers in their pregnancy. 'The popularity of the Nub Theory has created a huge community online with mums-to-be sharing others joy and supporting them as they go through the special time of pregnancy.'","Poll by Netmums found a third of parents uploaded scans to social media .

"A former beauty queen and nine of her family members narrowly avoided boarding AirAsia flight 8501 after they failed to check an email telling them that their flight time had changed. Miss Indonesia runner-up 2008 Anggi Mahesti was supposed to board the lost plane, from Juanda International Airport, in Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, on Sunday at 7.30am. Fortunately she and her family didn't see an email on 15 December, or answer calls from the airline, telling them their departure time had been brought forward to 5.35am. They arrived at the airport in two separate cars, just as the final boarding call was ringing out.

"A pizza shop robber was snared by police after they found a threatening note he had given to employees indented on toilet paper inside his home. Eric Frey, 29, tried to rob Michael Maria's Pizza in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday by handing an employee a note written on toilet paper that read: 'I have a gun. Give me $300.' Police arrived before Frey could leave because an employee hit a panic button. Eric Frey, 29, from Uniontown, Pennsylvania, was arrested and charged with the attempted robbery of a pizzeria after police found the message 'I have a gun. Give me $300' indented on a newly-opened toilet roll in his home . The suspect told the employee and police that he was made to rob the store by another man who said he was going to shoot him if he didn't return with money. But when police searched his apartment they found a newly-opened toilet paper with the message indented on another sheet. They also found a black pen nearby matching the ink he used. According to the criminal complaint against Frey, a large bearded man standing in a nearby alleyway had coerced him into robbing the store. When police turned up to search his home, he said: 'Let's go. I don't have anything to hide.' Officers then found the toilet paper linking him to the crime. They then entered his kitchen and found a can of pop he had used to smoke marijuana, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune. Frey was charged with attempted robbery and robbery, attempted theft and theft, possession with attempt to deliver marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He has four unrelated drug cases pending and was placed in the Fayette County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bond. Online court records don't list an attorney for Frey. Officers also found a black pen next to the roll with the same ink used to write the threatening note .

"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has executed nearly 2,000 people in Syria alone since claiming territory in the war-torn country, a British-based monitoring group have said. ISIS announced its 'caliphate' in June, and has since killed hundreds of civilians within its self-proclaimed borders, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The militant group also murdered 120 of their own men, most of them foreign fighters trying to return home, in the last two months, the British-based monitoring group said Sunday. Executions: Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has executed 1,878 people in Syria alone since announcing its 'caliphate' on June 28th (stock image) ISIS has taken vast parts of Iraq and Syria and declared an 'Islamic State' in territory under its control in June. Since then it has fought the Syrian and Iraqi governments, other insurgents and Kurdish forces. 'The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the execution by the Islamic State of 1,878 people in Syria between June 28 when it announced its 'caliphate' and December 27,' the group said in a statement. The Observatory, which relies on a network of activist and medical sources on the ground in Syria, said the victims were shot dead, beheaded or stoned to death in the provinces of Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Hama, Homs, Hasakeh and Raqa. Of those killed, 1,175 were civilians who included four children and eight women. The group also said ISIS has killed around 120 of its own members, mostly for trying to flee to their home countries, and 80 members of the rival Al-Nusra Front, the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. This image, released by ISIS, allegedly shows ISIS officials amputating the hand of a thief in Al-Bab, Syria . 'Caliphate cubs': These images emerged last month, showing ISIS-run terrorist training schools in Syria, where child soldiers being trained to kill using assault rifles . The dead included 930 members of the Shaitat tribe which rose up against IS in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor in the summer. On December 17, the Observatory said a mass grave containing the bodies of 230 Shaitat had been found in the province. The jihadists also 'executed' 502 soldiers and pro-regime militiamen, the monitoring group said. Despite giving a breakdown, the Observatory believes the number killed by IS to be far higher, given that many have disappeared and remain unaccounted for. The figures from The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have not been independently verified, but ISIS has previously publicized violent executions from within its 'caliphate'. These are for actions it sees as violating its reading of Islamic law, such as adultery, homosexuality, stealing and blasphemy. The group, an offshoot of al Qaeda, has also released videos of executions of captured enemy fighters, activists and journalists.","The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims ISIS has killed thousands .

"The triple-breasted woman who first hit headlines last September after claiming to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third boob has been spotted walking four half-naked men down a street. Jasmine Tridevil - whose real name is Alisha Hessler - has been filmed walking down a busy road in what has become her trademark three-cup bikini. A passer-by was parked in a petrol station when they noticed the 21-year-old strolling past with four humans wearing gimp masks on dog leads. Scroll down for video . Jasmine Tridevil - a.k.a Alisha Hessler - revealed her third boob in September. The 21-year-old from Florida then laid low after it was revealed the breast was a fake. But she has now been spotted walking four half-naked men down a street on leads . The half-naked men are crawling along the pavement on all-fours, with their identities concealed by black fetish hoods. Alisha has yet to confirm that the video is of her, but she passes more than a striking resemblance to the woman in the clip, which was recently uploaded to YouTube. The man filming says: 'It's a girl, looks like a girl with long hair. She has three t**s!' When he asks the woman if her dogs bite, she replies: 'They're my Shih Tzus.' Alisha has yet to confirm that the video is of her, but she passes more than a striking resemblance to the woman in the clip . She then shouts directions to her 'dogs' on where to crawl that include: 'To the right boys.' Alisha, who comes from Tampa, Florida, first revealed her third breast to the world in September with the aim of becoming a reality television star. She claimed that she was was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure. In the US, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity' under ethical codes outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. But Alisha insisted that she was able to enlist the help of a surgeon surgeon to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret. She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. The massage therapist,then shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom-made bikinis on her Facebook fan page. But just a couple of weeks later, a Florida news station alleged that the third breast was sham after a luggage theft report lodged at Tampa International Airport mentioned a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis'. The name on the missing luggage report was Alisha Hessler - the same name that Jasmine Tridevil's website was registered to. Alisha later called in to a local radio station to deny the allegations of a fake boob and insisted that she had undergone surgery. Alisha has a history of S&M with young men - in September, an 18-year-old called Micheal Squier told The Sun that the massage therapist had kept him as a caged sex slave after meeting her on Facebook. Alisha, who comes from Tampa, Florida, first revealed her third breast to the world in September with the aim of becoming a reality television star . He alleged that he was tied up, tortured, forced to sleep in a dog's cage and made to wear a dog's collar at her home in Tampa. He told the paper: 'She is completely psychotic. She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me. 'I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she did to me. 'On the night we met she tied me up and flogged me against a post.

"A Delta Airlines flight from New York's JFK Airport to Israel was delayed by half an hour when a group of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit next to female passengers. Delta Flight 468, bound for Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, was reportedly held up due to several Haredi passengers refusing to to sit in their assigned seats, which were in between two women. The delay was prolonged when the two female passengers involved reportedly refused to move to accommodate the men's request, claiming discrimination. Delta Airlines Flight 468 was reportedly delayed for half an hour over the seating issue . According to Israel Radio, the stand-off was eventually resolved when an American travelling to Israel offered to change seats. Ultra-Orthodox Jews cannot touch members of the opposite sex unless they are close relatives or a spouse. It is not the first time an international flight has been delayed due to issues about seat arrangements. In September, passengers flying with Israeli airline El Al from New York reported a delay when Haredi passengers refused to sit next to women and reportedly went as far as offering them money to move. An El Al flight was delayed in September due to a similar issue, when ultra-Orthodox passengers refused to sit next to women on the plane . Fellow passengers reported men standing in the aisles and refusing to take their seats on the flight to Israel, which was due to land in time for the Jewish New Year. Amit Ben-Natan, a passenger who was on board the plane, said: 'People stood in the aisles and refused to go forward.' 'Although everyone had tickets with seat numbers that they purchased in advance, they asked us to trade seats with them, and even offered to pay money, since they cannot sit next to a woman. It was obvious that the plane wouldn't take off as long as they keep standing in the aisles.' Passengers claimed that despite the El Al flight crew informing travellers that they did not have to agree to switch, the plane's captain announced the flight would not be going anywhere until everyone was seated. Haredim are known as ultra-Orthodox Jews and cannot touch members of the opposite sex unless they are close relatives or a spouse . Once the flight had departed, one passenger claimed the ultra-Orthodox traveller sat beside her stood in the aisle for the journey rather than return to his assigned seat. After passengers branded the flight 'an 11 hour-long nightmare', El Al promised to look into the issue and take action if passengers were in breach of . The airline stated: 'The company will examine the complaints and if some passengers are found to have acted out of line the company will examine its future steps.' Following the flight, female passenger Sharon Shapiro, from Chicago, launched a petition to stop ultra-Orthodox passengers 'bullying, intimidating and discriminating against women'.

"A 16-year-old schoolgirl who was apparently a victim of bullying posted a Facebook message asking her friends if anyone would cry if she died - just hours before committing suicide, it today emerged. Amber Cornwell posted the chilling words, 'If I die tonight, would anyone cry?', on the social network site while sitting in her bedroom in Henderson County, North Carolina, on December 21. The following morning, the East Henderson High School student was found hanged in her closet by her distraught parents, Kim and Alan Cornwell. Tragically, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Now, Amber's friends and family have claimed bullying was responsible for the death of the teen, who had returned home in a 'happy' mood after a date with her new boyfriend just hours earlier.

'They’d message her on Facebook.' Another friend, Sierra Crochet, added: 'I’ve been crying for days now. They were just calling her names. And called her names and said she had no future and had nothing going for her.' Mrs Cornwell said Amber - an honor roll student, a tennis player and a member of the All County Chorus - had been targeted by bullies since the sixth grade, but she thought it had died down. 'The boys like her and the girls hate her, and that's not fair' she said through tears. 'All the time, it was always something. We thought it had calmed down.

"A pregnant woman who was so overweight she was advised not to have a water birth in case she got stuck has shed 7st in just 12 months. Rachel Reid, 25, from East Kilbride, Scotland, decided to begin her weight loss earlier this year following the birth of her second child. The mother-of-two was tipping the scales at 17st and wearing a size 22 at the beginning of the year with her self-confidence at an all-time low. Scroll down for video . Rachel Reid was told she was too large for a water birth and has since shed over 7st in just 12 months . But just 12 months later Rachel is now a svelte size eight and weighs a healthy 9st 12lb after chronicling her shrinking figure through a year's worth of motivational photos. After safely having her baby daughter Hollie and overindulging at Christmas, Rachel joined Slimming World in January this year after reaching rock bottom. She took a picture of herself each month to encourage her weight loss and keep her on track. For the new mother the inspiration to finally drop the pounds came after her size prevented her from having the water birth she had planned with Hollie. After safely giving birth to her daughter Hollie, Rachel joined a weight loss club and has slimmed  to a size 8 . Always chubby, Rachel's binge eating habits worsened at university where she would live off takeaways . Rachel, with her four-year-old son Dylan, left, shed the weight after having her second child Hollie, two, . 'Things came to an embarrassing head for me when I fell pregnant with my second child,' she said. 'I had my heart set on a water birth but I was mortified when the nurse told me that my BMI was over 40 and meant I was too heavy for one. 'if something went wrong, they wouldn't be able to get me out of the birthing pool. 'I was still wearing my maternity clothes long after I had given birth to my daughter. It was a way of trying to hide my size, plus the loose and stretchy fabrics were comfortable. Rachel, pictured at the start of her diet in January 2014,  tracked her weight loss with pictures over 12 months . Rachel would take a picture every month during her diet to track her progress.

By April, left, Rachel visibly trimmer while in May, right, she was showing off her new shape in fitted dresses . 'I was always the biggest out of my friends and had low self-esteem. But during my pregnancies I used it as an excuse to eat more because I was meant to be big anyway. 'But the birthing pool incident was the final straw for me.' As well as the difficulties caused by her size, Rachel says she was left feeling unattractive and unhappy. Rachel says that by keeping track of her progress through photos she could see how effective her diet was. By June, left, Rachel was considerably slimmer and in July, left, she wore tight tops and slim-cut trousers . Rachel says that as she lost more weight she began to feel more confident in herself. Left, Rachel showed off her figure with a selfie in August and, right, she was even slimmer in a Lady Gaga T-shirt by September .

Left, Rachel wears a tight-fitting dress in November and, right, she shows off her size 8 body in December, 2014 . 'I was miserable with myself and I didn't feel beautiful or pretty at all. 'I was a chubby child and I would binge eat. I could regularly finish a whole pack of biscuits in one go and I would eat snacks in secret.' Rachel says that her natural tendency to overeat worsened when she left home to become a student and was solely responsible for feeding herself. 'I gained weight over the years, and really piled on the pounds when I went to university because I was living off a diet of takeaways and alcohol.' Rachel says that her weight gain ruined her self-esteem and she was always the biggest of all of her friends . The mother-of-two swapped her diet of sugary snacks for home cooked meals and fresh fruit and veg . Rachel switched her huge portions of takeaways and sugary snacks for hearty home cooked meals with lots of vegetables and she managed to lose half a stone in her first two weeks. 'I was amazing and so pleased. Losing the weight in the beginning kept me motivated and for me my goal was to be a size 12. That is what I considered beautiful and I was determined to get there,' she said. Rachel steadily lost more and more weight and as well as her slimming success the stay-at-home mum also received plaudits for her incredible weight loss. 'I won awards with Slimming World each time I hit a weight loss milestone and when I look back over my pictures from the year I cannot believe the person from January is the same one as today. Breakfast: Six slices of toast with butter and coffee with three sugars. Lunch: Pack of biscuits and a shop bought sandwich. Dinner: Big portion of spaghetti bolognaise, with fizzy drinks and Ben and Jerry's ice cream or pizza and oven chips. Breakfast: Fruit including melon, strawberries and apple with coffee with skimmed milk and sweetener. Lunch: Bacon, eggs, beans and wholemeal toast cooked using low-calorie spray. Dinner: Slimming World recipes of chicken curry, spaghetti bolognaise and hearty stews. 'I reached my size 12 goal in September, but kept going with my weight loss. 'I am now in good habits and I have even started running. I am hoping to run my first marathon next year. I have so much energy now.' Rachel, who is mother to four-year-old Dylan and Hollie, two, has been supported on the way by her husband Peter, a lecturer in accountancy. 'Peter has always told me I was beautiful but he could tell I wasn't happy with my weight. 'When he sees me now his jaw drops. He is delighted and makes me feel amazing.

"The US military is hoping to develop hawk-like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air, but also fly through buildings. It hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour (20 metres per second) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces. And, the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators, and without relying on GPS. Scroll down for video . The US military is hoping to develop hawk-like drones that can not only survey dangerous locations from the air, but also fly through buildings. Pictured is an artist's impression of how the future drones could move . The drones are being developed as part of its Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program, which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation. According to Darpa, these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments, as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes. 'Birds of prey and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small UAVs,' said Mark Micire, Darpa program manager. 'Goshawks, for example, can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree. Many insects, too, can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision. 'The goal of the FLA program is to explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small UAVs the capacity to perform in a similar way, including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognise if it had already been in a room before.' If successful, the algorithms developed in the program could improve unmanned system capabilities by reducing the amount of processing power, communications, and human intervention needed. The initial focus is on UAVs, but advances made through the FLA program could potentially be applied to ground, marine and underwater systems, . According to Darpa, these drones could help military teams patrolling dangerous environments..'Birds of prey  exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small UAVs,' said  Darpa. 'Goshawks, can fly very fast through a forest without smacking into a tree, for example.' Stock image of a goshawk is pictured . This could be especially useful in environments where GPS can't be used. 'Urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries, but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems,' said Stefanie Tompkins, director of Darpa's Defense Sciences Office. 'By enabling unmanned systems to learn 'muscle memory' and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles, it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission.' As well as developing the algorithms for these drones, the US Army is already testing designs. They have even built a pair of tiny robo-wings just 0.1-inches (3mm) long. The robo-fly spy: Piezoelectric material in a wing built by Army Research Labs researchers allows a fruit-fly-sized micro-robot wing to flap with no motor (pictured). A dime is pictured to the right, to show scale . It is a battle to send a drone supersonic - and pits China against Britain. Experts have claimed China's drone, called Dark Sword, is under secret development. It was unveiled in 2006 at an airshow, but has since disappeared from public view. however, it has now reappeared in a report on the the website of the country's national broadcaster CCTV. The Dark Sword - known in Chinese as 'Anjian' -made its debut at the Zhuhai Airshow in southern China's Guangdong province. The model was subsequently exhibited at the Paris Air Show - but was then never heard of again. Some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons, while others believe the development of the drone is now being kept secret as it is undergoing further research and testing. Chinese aviation expert Fu Qianshao told CCTV that while he does not know the status of the Dark Sword project, the drone could become the world's first supersonic UAV if it proves a success. Dr Ron Polcawich and his team at the Army Research Laboratory, known as ARL, in Adelphi, Maryland, said their wings can already fly. 'We demonstrated that we can actually create lift,' he said. 'So we know this structure has the potential to fly.' The wings are made of lead zirconium titanate, referred to as PZT. This material creates electric charge under an applied pressure or can create strain - such as motion - under an applied voltage, or electric field. They bend and flap when voltage is applied to the PZT material. The team have also designed sets of tiny robotic legs for a millipede-like robot that simulate crawling when voltage is applied to the PZT material. While the legs and wings are currently functional, Dr Polcawich said it may take another 10 to 15 years of research and development to actually produce fully-functional robotic insects. For instance, algorithms are needed to simulate how a flying insect stabilises itself, he said. Creating this type of artificial intelligence or 'cognitive ability' will take time, explained Dr Polcawich. Dr Joseph Conroy, an electronics engineer at the US Army Research Laboratory, part of the Research, Development and Engineering Command, works with robotic systems that can navigate by using senses inspired by insects. A recently developed prototype, capable of wide-field vision, is something researchers hope to test at the manned and unmanned teaming, or MUM-T exercise at the Maneuver Center of Excellence, Fort Benning, Georgia.

The team have also designed sets of tiny robotic legs for a millipede-like robot that simulate crawling when voltage is applied to the PZT material . This project will give us a chance to implement methods of perception such as 3D mapping and motion estimation on a robotics platform, Dr Conroy said. 'The upcoming tests are a small example of a much larger effort,' added Brett Piekarski, collaborative alliance manager. 'The university researchers across the consortium work with the Army researchers to come up with systems that can provide Soldier/robot teaming and be transitioned to industry.' The prototype is designed to help soldiers have tactical awareness at squad, and personal level, in a variety of environments. 'If our prototype operates in the way it was designed to during these tests, it would be a technical win,' Dr Conroy said. 'But I would say the real goal of this exercise is to put the technology in the hands of soldiers, gather their feedback, and gain understanding about what will make autonomous systems more useful.'","Darpa wants hawk and insect-style drones to be able to fly without GPS .

"Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr hold no grudges against their wedding crasher - President Obama. The military couple planned to get married on the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but learned the day before their ceremony that it would have to be moved because the president was in town and wanted to play the course with his friends. On Tuesday, the couple spoke with the Today show to make it clear that they were not upset with the president for the wedding day surprise. Scroll down for video . No big deal: Army Captains Natalie Heimel (left) and Edward Mallue Jr (right) planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because President Obama wanted to play a round with his friends . Happily married: On Tuesday, the couple spoke with the Today Show and said they were not at all upset at the last minute change of plans . 'We knew that there were two things that could mess up the wedding and one was weather and the other was the president,' Heimel told Today. Couples who plan their ceremony on the course are allegedly warned that the president can cause last minute changes of plans . 'I'm sure that his staffers didn't let him know that there was a wedding.' The president claimed he didn't know his golf game interrupted their wedding when he called the couple just after they said 'I do' on Sunday. Their wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the military base where the golf course is located, and has an even better view of the ocean than their original location. Change of scenery: The couple were instead married on the green lawn of the military base where the golf course is located. They told the president it was a 'blessing in disguise' when he called them to apologize right after they said 'I do' 'Feeling terrible': The President said he would have been willing to forgo one hole's worth of golf had he known . Greetings from vacation: The president and his family are currently vacationing on the island of Oahu for the Christmas holidays, and will returned to Washington on January 4 . 'Congratulations on your wedding. I feel terrible. Nobody told us. I hope the wedding went ok anyway,' the president told the newlyweds. 'It did, thank you very much' Mallue responded. 'It was a blessing in disguise.' The president went on to say that if he had known, he could have just skipped the 16th hole, and ended the day with a better score. He revealed to the couple that he shot an 84, and would have pulled a 79 if he just skipped the tricky 16th hole. On Tuesday, avid-golfer Mallue joked that he could 'probably' beat Obama on the Marine Corps course. When asked by Today if they wanted to 'yell' at Obama after hearing their wedding would be moved, Heimel said 'Not at all'. Heimel and Mallue both attended the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point, and met while stationed in Germany in 2011. They have both served tours of duty in Afghanistan. They are putting off plans for a Honeymoon for now, instead spending some time with their wedding guests on the island of Oahu for the New Year. Elite: Heimel and Mallue are both graduates from the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point and met while stationed in Germany in 2011. Both have served tours in Afghanistan . Family time: The couple chose to put off their honeymoon in order to spend time with their wedding guests for the New Year . The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean. Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg. The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama. President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. On Sunday, he played the Kaneohe Klipper course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb.

"She's got one of the most honed bodies in showbiz - and now the secret workout behind Nicole Scherzinger's toned physique has been revealed. The popstar, who is currently playing Grizabella in Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking musical Cats, has joined an invite-only fitness class. Nicole, 36, has been hanging out at SBC, which stands for the Skinny B**** Collective, and is the go-to gym for fashion's most famous fitness fanatics. Scroll down for video . Nicole Scherzinger, 36, has been working out at The Skinny B**** Collective classes, where primal movements in intense circuits including upside-down burpees and crawling are seen as the hottest way to get healthy . Run by super-trainer Russell Bateman, SBC is an elite and intense 50-minute circuits style class loved by Millie Mackintosh,  Suki Waterhouse and model Zara Martin. Nicole, 36, posted a video of her working out at the class, which has attendees crawling on their hands and knees and doing one-legged burpees (jumping upright from a press-up position). Speaking about working with the star, Russell said: 'I had the opportunity to train Nicole last week and she was incredibly nimble and explosive. 'A dancer's background can really help you acclimatise to the movements much quicker. 'When Nicole posted her SBC video some of the reactions were insane. People couldn't believe what she was capable of. 'But the overwhelming factor was that it had inspired them.' The brains behind the SBC brand, Russell Bateman, said Nicole was 'incredibly nimble and explosive' and that having a dancer's background like hers can really help  acclimatise to the movements much quicker . Looking to get fit like Nicole in 2015? FEMAIL caught up with the brains behind the brand to find out his top fitness and health tips. Sharing his advice for anyone looking to embark on a New Year’s health kick, Russell said: 'Making peace with where you are at right now in your life is the first step to self-acceptance and making lasting changes. 'If you want to lose body fat, feel great, increase your energy level and improve your overall quality of life, then there are a list of lifestyle choices and changes you can make. 'My aim through SBC is to abolish the misconceptions around how women train, eat and live. 'Low fat diets are out, good fat is your friend. 'Be as human as possible when you train. Boredom is the enemy and so is anyone around you who's bringing you down. 'Remember to never underestimate yourself and overestimate others too much. I advocate sleep, squatting, sprinting and lots of sex for a great body and mind.' Too cold to jog outdoors? No excuses, said Russell. 'Make sure you try to move and not end up like a slug. 'Indulging over the Christmas period is the norm but it's not an excuse to do nothing. That's the quickest way to get your body resembling some yoghurt wrapped in cling film.' In terms of being active indoors, Russell believes that body-weight circuits can really help. He suggests doing 10 press-ups, 10 squat jumps and a plank for one minute. 'It's simple but effective. Try it a few times, it will really energise you,' he said. Nicole posted a video of her demonstrating her fitness at the class. Attendees follow trainer Russell Bateman's strict regime which dictates how much they should sleep and exactly what to eat . Russell trains  world-famous models. His class is 'the toughest workout for women in London' Russell explained that the more goals you make, the less likely you are to achieve them - and you should choose your friends wisely. 'Lack of social support can increase stress and anxiety, which weaken your ability to stick to your goals,' he said. 'In order to succeed with your New Year’s resolutions, support from friends and family is key. If your friends draw you toward bad influences your first goal should be to get some new ones.' Walnuts, almonds, pistachios, macadamias . Almond butter . Hardboiled eggs . Canned salmon and tuna . Sardines . Smoked Salmon . Cold Prawns . Berries . Avocado /Guacamole . Olives . Half of a Coconut . Veggies (celery, cucumbers, peppers) Pickles . Sauerkraut . Salsa . Dried seaweed . Dark chocolate/ raw chocolate . In terms of eating, Russell advises his clients to consume a diet full of high protein and healthy fats full of omega-3 fatty acids at least an hour before  training and high protein and fibre after. ' 'This will lead to some great changes in your body composition and mood,' he said. Think salmon, cod, wild meat like venison or buffalo with vegetables such as kale and broccoli. Sweet potato and quinoa are staples on Russell's watch, too. The best news? Snacks are in. 'Many people avoid snacks because they are afraid that they contribute to weight gain,' he said. But in truth, snacks can be included in a plan to lose body fat and improve your functions throughout the day. An SBC snack will consist of protein and healthy fats and fibre.' He also maintains that omega-3 and vitamin D levels are crucial for optimal body function and mood, so can be taken as supplements. Unfortunately for anyone hoping to train alongside Nicole, Russell's classes are very exclusive. Explaining his invite-only policy, Russell said: 'This is the toughest workout for women in London. There is no class like this out there. It's constantly evolving and constantly changing. It's illusive - some say exclusive - and will probably continue to be so. 'Girls know that I train some very high profile people who are healthy and embrace fitness. They see them performing SBC movements and eating with our guidelines and then naturally want to be involved. There is a cult-like following now. It's crazy!'. Russell has been overwhelmed with the response from people and brands wanting to get a slice of the SBC action and he is launching online tutorials for anyone who wants to try Nicole's workout . While you may not be able to try out your upside-down burpees alongside the A-list, Russell is launching the next best thing. In the New Year, the SBC experience will allow fitness fanatics to take part in his workout virtually. 'This will be a complete encyclopedia of SBC movements and advice that you can subscribe to either annually or monthly. 'You'll be able to train our way wherever you are in the world from the palm of your hand,' he said. Thanks to his celebrity fans posting their workouts online, Russell has been overwhelmed with the response from people and brands wanting to get a slice of the SBC action. But he remained mysterious, saying: 'There will also be some really special pop-ups and collaborations, too. All to be revealed soon....' Sleep more . It's the key. Sleep is the one thing I ask girls about before they train with us. It's the primary time that the body recovers from exercise and it's also when you'll be rebuilding torn muscle tissues. Skip sleep or get less than adequate amounts and you’ll increase cortisol again - a hormone that suppresses physical activity and fat burning processes in the body. It will also increase hunger. If you can't sleep check your magnesium levels, as a deficiency could be to blame. So on nights where you’re staying in go to bed at 10pm. Have more sex . It will boost your immunity and relieve stress. A female orgasm can more than double a woman's tolerance for pain because it’s an analgesic not an anaesthetic meaning it suppresses pain. That should have a beneficial effect on your training intensity. Stay in the present moment . That is being 'in the now’ as much as you can. Make sure your breathing is full and deep. It’s the best detox possible. Anything can be a meditation (walking, yoga, cooking, sex, taking out the trash). Mix up your workouts . For your body and your brain. SBC workshops are perfect stimuli for that. Dancing is not a luxury, it’s an imperative. Even if it’s when you’re alone in the morning before you start your day - it’s time for a morning dance. Be in nature as much as possible . Throw away your television and read more. Spend less time on your phone and only answer your emails once a day. Limit social media like Instagram and Twitter. It's procrastinating and you get lost in a strange world based on peer pressure and competitive boasting. Hold eye contact during a conversation. Love yourself unconditionally . Or you can never love anyone else unconditionally. Judgement is so boring. Don’t judge. Take nothing, not even the stuff directed towards you, personally.","Former X Factor judge, 36, exercised at the exclusive class .

"In his angry New York Times piece from Friday in which he vehemently denied sexually abusing his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, more than 20 years-ago, Woody Allen also took the chance to address the parentage of Ronan Farrow. Last fall, Mia Farrow set tongues wagging across Hollywood when she hinted in a Vanity Fair article it was 'possible' Ronan was in fact the son of singer Frank Sinatra and not Allen. In his Times piece, Allen seems willing to accept that Ronan is not his son - and then uses this possibility as a way to attack Mia Farrow's fidelity towards him during their relationship, to accuse her of lying under oath if this is true and of subsequently taking child support from him fraudulently. Scroll down for video . Paternity: Woody Allen has claimed in the New York Times that if Ronan Farrow is not his biological son as Mia Farrow (right) has hinted at then she lied under oath and scammed him out of money he paid in child support . Indeed, Allen, 78, writes that Ronan, 26, who is due to begin hosting his own MSNBC current affairs program imminently, could be Old Blue Eye's boy - but questions what that means for the honesty of his former girlfriend, Mia Farrow. 'Is he my son or, as Mia suggests, Frank Sinatra’s? Granted, he looks a lot like Frank with the blue eyes and facial features, but if so what does this say?' The Oscar winner goes on to claims that Mia Farrow told the 1992 custody hearing for their children and adoptive children that Ronan - then named Satchel - was his biological son. 'Even if he is not Frank’s, the possibility she raises that he could be, indicates she was secretly intimate with him during our years. Not to mention all the money I paid for child support. Was I supporting Frank’s son?' Speculation: Mia Farrow has fueled gossip that Ronan Farrow (left) is the biological son of legendary singer Frank Sinatra (right) MSNBC Host Ronan Farrow, left, speaking with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and host Bill Maher, on ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" in Los Angeles last week . The fact that Ronan might not be a biological relative of the Annie Hall director and star leads him to question Mia Farrow's 'integrity and honesty' for making the claims in the first place. This was just one small part of his near-two thousand word essay in which he defended himself on Friday against the claims of sexual abuse leveled towards Allen. He accused ex-partner Mia Farrow of being spiteful and malevolent and publicly denied being a child abuser. His harsh words for Farrow came in an open letter published online by The New York Times. The 78-year-old filmmaker said Dylan Farrow's open letter published last week included 'creative flourishes that seem to have magically appeared during our 21-year estrangement'. At the time of the breakup of their 12-year relationship more than two decades ago, Mia Farrow accused Allen of molesting Dylan. Allen has consistently denied the abuse allegation. Public spat: Ronan Farrow with his mother Mia Farrow - (left) has become known as a child genius who at the age of only 26 will now host his own MSNBC show on current affairs . The director, who said the letter will be his final word on the matter, added that he still loved his daughter and missed being a part of her life. Allen claimed in his letter that the then seven-year-old Dylan was coached by Mia Farrow. 'I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter’s well-being,' he wrote. Dylan Farrow claimed in her open letter that Allen abused her in 1992 at the family's Connecticut home. She quickly rebutted his claims on Friday, saying: 'His op-ed is the latest rehash of the same legalese, distortions, and outright lies he has leveled at me for the past 20 years.' She accused her adopted father of trying to 'discredit and silence' her, and said she was sticking by the claims she first made when she was seven years old. In her open letter, Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly suffered at his hands. ‘That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls.’ Missed: Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen in New York City on Monday. Allen has said the couple miss Dylan . Dylan candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself. Indeed, it is claimed that Frank Sinatra continued to look out for ex-wife Mia Farrow long after their split and even more than 20 years later he remained concerned about her well-being, claims a new book by lawyer Alan Dershowitz. High-powered attorney Dershowitz represented Farrow in her long custody battle with Woody Allen in the early 1990’s after their ended over his relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi. In his new book, Taking The Stand, Dershowitz reveals that Sinatra personally called him during that time to offer his help in Farrow’s battle. Dershowitz writes of receiving a phone call from Sinatra, reports the New York Post. ‘He immediately got down to business,’ wrote Dershowitz. 'I love Mia. We were married, you know. She’s a great girl. Woody’s trying to bully her. He can’t be allowed to get away with that. What can I do to help?' When Dershowitz told Sinatra that he had the case under control, he claims that Sinatra said: ‘Well, beyond the legal case, what can I do to call Woody off?’ Hit back: Woody Allen has again been forced to deny claims he abused Dylan Farrow . Wary of Sinatra’s tough-guy reputation, Dershowitz wrote: ‘I nervously told him to leave it to the lawyers, and that any approach to Woody Allen would be used against Mia and would likely backfire. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated that her son Ronan – born in 1987 while she and Allen were still together - could ‘possibly’ be the biological son of Sinatra. In the same article she claimed that she and Sinatra, who were married between 1966 and 1968, ‘never really split up.’ News of Sinatra’s keen interest in Farrow’s custody case with Allen over their children, adds further weight to the rumors that he may have fathered Ronan. Now 25, the Yale-educated former Obama administration aide is set to launch his own talk show geared toward millennials on MSNBC in February. Dylan Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . Shaming stars: Dylan lambasted actors like Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin who had starred in her father's film; Keaton was on hand last month to present Allen with a lifetime achievement award . ‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ she wrote. Farrow, who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his Golden Globe. ‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked. Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet. ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote. Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father. ‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter. ‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’","Woody Allen made his first public comments on the speculation that MSNBC host Ronan Farrow is not his son - but Frank Sinatra's .

"Sixteen state firefighters were placed on paid administrative leave for unrelated policy violations that grew out of an investigation into allegations of firefighters having sex on fire trucks, officials said. The investigation began in May after Orville Fleming, fire academy instructor and battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, was charged with murder in the death of a former escort who became his girlfriend. Fleming's estranged wife told Sacramento County sheriff's investigators and reporters then that she had viewed a video showing the victim, Sarah June Douglas, 26, having sex with her husband and other firefighters on fire trucks. 'The investigation has already determined that allegations of a sex tape are unfounded,' CalFire spokeswoman Janet Upton said. There also was no use of prostitutes or other improper sexual activity on state time or equipment, she said. Scroll down for video . Scandal in the fire department: Sixteen firefighters with CalFire have been placed on leave in relation to an inquiry that was launched after a woman claimed to have discovered a sex tape showing her firefighter-husband having sex in a fire truck. Authorities say no sex tape was discovered and that the firefighters on paid leave leave were suspended for other unrealted policy violations. Above, an image of a CalFire fire truck . Sacramento County deputies previously said they never found a video, but CalFire asked the California Highway Patrol to investigate because of the seriousness of the allegations. The formal results of the investigation are expected early next month. Upton said the firefighters were placed on paid leave on suspicion of 'a variety of policy violations unrelated to allegations of a sex tape.' Further details were not disclosed. The majority of the employees are or were full-time instructors at the department's fire academy in Ione, where Fleming worked, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento, she said. Highway Patrol spokeswoman Fran Clader said she would not comment, referring inquiries to CalFire. Mike Lopez, president of the union representing department employees, and union spokesman Terry McHale both said they were given no details on the allegations faced by the suspended firefighters. Brutal murder: The wife of former firefighter instructor Orville Fleming (left) claimed to have seen the sex tape during a murder investigation into the death of his 26-year-old mistress Sarah June Douglas (right) 'If there are employees who broke protocols or procedures with academy or department policies, that's a very sad situation that nobody's proud of,' Lopez said. Without knowing the particulars, it is too soon to know if the union would help employees with any appeals of their pending discipline, he said. Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan Fleming, could not immediately be reached for comment. Orville Fleming was arrested following a two-week manhunt after Douglas' body was discovered in the home they shared. The couple of two years allegedly met through an escort site, and police said at the time of Fleming's arrest that he may have used that same site to meet another woman shortly after Fleming was murdered. Both Douglas' mother and sister knew she was dating Fleming, who filed for divorce from his wife in October 2013. The two were waiting for his divorce to be finalized before tying the knot. Accusations: Fleming has been accused of stabbing to death his fianceé Douglas in May 2014. The two had been dating for two years, after meeting on an escort website. Her body was discovered in the home they shared together . Just before she was found dead, Douglas had expressed fears about Fleming to her sister Stephanie. Just before midnight on May 1 she called her sister and said: 'That [SOB] left the gas on. I think he's trying to kill my birds.' Stephanie then her her sister saying 'Whoa, you scared me' before the man later identified as Fleming was heard starting an argument with her on the other line. Stephanie says she heard her sister scream before the line went dead. Fleming is next scheduled to appear in court in March. He has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. His attorney, Peter Kmeto, said he was aware of Meagan Fleming's comments but he never found a sex tape as part of his investigation, and Monday's developments will have no bearing on the criminal case.

'That's why I do this,’ Robert breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing.' He continues: ‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this. If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow.'

He has also appeared in a British Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls, which screened earlier this year. As the show revealed, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that  dating real women has been something of a disappointment. ‘You see, after all, I'm 70 years old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explained. ‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to.’ Not a phase: For Robert, becoming his female alter-ego 'Sherry' is a dedicated passion.

"Katie Hopkins has been shopped to the police for hate crimes against overweight people. The controversial TV star was reported by a woman belonging to a 'fat activist' group during filming for her new programme on TLC, in which she gains and loses three stone in six months. Katie was accused of the crime when she met up with the group of five women in London who all work independently as plus-size activists or diet bloggers, so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that 'fat people are lazy'. Katie Hopkins has been accused of committing a hate crime against fat people. The TV star was reported to police by plus size campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki (right) during filming for Katie's new documentary. In Katie's new show, she goes from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb (left) and back again (right) in six months . The panel included size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki, burlesque performer Khandie Kisses, blogger 'Big Fat Betty', editor of Slink magazine Rivkie Baum and vlogger Thandi Ejindu, who lost 11 stone in one year. The discussion between Katie and the women quickly heated up and size acceptance campaigner Ms Szrodecki is seen storming out of the room to call the police in the second episode from the series, which is set to air on Saturday. Ms Szrodecki began to get upset after Katie questioned how she could be healthy because of the weight she was carrying. The former Apprentice contestant told her: 'I’m looking at you and I’m making an assessment that it is not healthy to carry that much weight on your knees.' Ms Szrodecki (right) began to get upset after Katie (left) questioned she couldn't be healthy at her weight . Size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki is seen storming out of the room after her clash with Katie . She continued: 'I just don’t believe you’re healthy in that state. 'The cost to the NHS is more than six billion a year, and the Chief Surgeon at Guy’s Hospital said “It’s killing millions, costing billions, and the cure is in our hands”, and as a tax payer that’s why I feel I do have a say, it's because I’m paying for your health.' Katie then turns her attention to another member of the group and asks her: 'Can I ask you something? And you, and you can answer it honestly, or not answer it at all, is why are you big?' The woman replies: 'Because I eat too much.' Ms Szrodecki then interjects and says to Katie: 'Do you not realise where you’re going with this? This is actually to do with a hate crime.' Katie then laughs and replies: 'You’re a victim of hate crime?' Ms Szrodecki says: 'Absolutely. And can we call the police?' Katie then tells her: 'Do call the police, there’s a telephone right there, feel free. 'Would you like it brought to you? Because it’s probably going to be hard to walk there.' Ms Szrodecki walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police about Katie. She says: 'Yes, it became personally offensive. And I believe it is a hate crime and I’d like to report it.’ Ms Szrodecki then walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police. She says: 'Yes, it became personally offensive. And I believe it is a hate crime and I’d like to report it.’ But after the meeting, Katie is unrepentant about upsetting Kathryn. She tells cameras: 'They’re irritated that I have a voice, one of them even threatened to go and call the police, so I told her to go and do that. 'But, no police came, which was disappointing as I quite like a man in a uniform.' The argument is seen in the second episode of Katie's new show, with the first part airing on Friday night. Over six months, Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit. The journey was all captured on camera for the documentary. Katie originally weighed 8st 12lb (right) but ate her way to 11st 13lb (left), then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab . The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story follows Katie Hopkins as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise . Katie caused an uproar last year, when she told an obese woman on This Morning that she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy. But she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project, by gaining and losing 3st to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight. The weight gain hit Katie's emotions harder than she expected, with the mother-of-three was often reduced to tears over her size, especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror. She recently told The Sun that she even refused to have sex with her husband Mark Cross after she had gained the first stone, because she felt so unattractive, . Previously a slim size eight, weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement. With an apparently naturally high metabolism, Katie struggles to bring her weight up over 11st despite her high-calorie intake. The documentary sees her draft in ex-Army personal trainer Christian who devises a military-style program of what he terms 'circuit eating' to help her gain the final pounds. Dividing a table into four, Christian places different foods in each section and makes Katie rotate the table six times, eating the small but high calorie foods at each point. Similar in form to exercise circuits, the idea is to maximise calorie intake, and the circuits have to be repeated every two hours. Katie Hopkins refused to be intimate with husband Mark Cross, pictured, after she gained a stone in weight . After one particular feed, clearly uncomfortable with a distended stomach, Katie rants: 'It is just ridiculous what people do to themselves. Fat people, I mean really I don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror.' The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, follows Katie after she's at her peak weight of 11st 13lb, with a 38in waist and a BMI of 26, and then slims down thanks to a strict diet and exercise regime. In the show, we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments. Make-up free and in a pair of striped pyjamas, Hopkins breaks down over her larger body. After a weight-gain diet that included daily 'snacks' of a litre-and-a-half of Mars milk drink, an entire tub of Pringles, cheese on toast, Dairy Milk and Galaxy chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast, Katie then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500. As well as a low fat diet of porridge, salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato, Hopkins upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour-long runs a week. Following this self-devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months, shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended. The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st 'killed her' and left her in constant floods . Katie kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her  strong views on fat people. One video sees her explaining: 'One of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you don't want to go out so much. You feel like you don't really want to go out because you can't fit into the things you would like to wear. 'I'm not sure if that's something many fat people suffer from because I see a lot of fat people out and about. Whether that's out of choice I don't know but I'm surprised that fat people go out at all.' But despite the hardships that she suffered after gaining weight, Katie maintains that she still wouldn't employ a fat person. She also told a national newspaper earlier this week that she would like to see a radical weight-loss scheme implemented in schools, which would see children weighed on the premises. The fattest 10 per cent of children would then be reported to social services. The controversial former reality star has been as active  on Twitter, defending her views on being overweight . Katie first embarked on the weight-gain and weight-loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size. Speaking on ITV's This Morning in September she said: 'One in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese. 'People have always said to me, ""You're lucky, you're skinny,"" and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more. 'I saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an end to this.' While she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues, Katie is continuing to be outspoken on the topics, using her Twitter account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood. She recently tweeted: 'My local over/under active thyroid self help group meets in KFC.' She also posted: 'I see you all down there with your excuses, but a third of the planet is obese. The first step to slim is NO EXCUSES. Own your problem.'

"An oil magnate worth $19 billion who agreed to pay his ex-wife $1 billion in their divorce, has now changed his mind after seeing his personal fortune fall by half amid a rout in oil prices. Harold Hamm, 69, of Oklahoma City  called the $1 billion payout ruling 'fair and equitable,' publicly thanked the judge and said he was happy to have the . case behind him last month. Now the chief executive of . Continental Resources  has appealed the divorce ruling. Harold Hamm and then wife Sue Ann Arnall pictured attending the TIME 100 Gala celebrating TIME'S 100 Most Infuential People In The World in New York in 2012 . Hamm considers it 'erroneous and inequitable,' according to filings in Oklahoma . County Court. Hamm's appeal hasn't been previously reported. The appeal, . and an earlier one by 58-year-old ex-wife Sue Ann Arnall, will be heard by . the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Arnall, a former Continental . executive, has claimed the ruling wrongly allowed the oilman to . keep more than 90 percent of the wealth the couple built . together. (Arnall resumed using her birth name after the . divorce.) The dueling appeals are the latest twist in one of the . largest divorce cases in U.S. history. The contest pits . America's top owner of oil against an attorney ex-wife who is . intent on showing that the Hamm fortune stemmed from hard work - . both his and hers - during a 26-year marriage. Hamm contends his 68 percent Continental stake, which he . owned before meeting Arnall, surged in value during the marriage . due to 'passive' or market factors, like rising oil prices. Harold Hamm, founder and CEO of Continental Resources, pictured entering the courthouse for divorce proceedings with wife Sue Ann Hamm in Oklahoma City in September . The . distinction is crucial, since Oklahoma law says only marital . wealth stemming from active efforts or skills of either spouse . should be split in a divorce. In essence, the most successful . oilman in America is arguing that he was lucky. 'The vast majority of the enhanced value of the CLR . (Continental) stock was due to market forces and contributions . of third parties,' Hamm said in an appeal filing. The appeals risk dragging Hamm, and his oil company, deeper . into a personal divorce battle that's already in its third year. The fight has featured costs in the tens of millions of dollars . and a 10-week trial that ended last month. The case was . conducted mostly behind closed doors, after the judge ruled that . opening it would harm Continental. November's billion-dollar judgment, while one of the biggest . on record, allowed Hamm to retain his majority stake in . Continental. But he recently told the court he would need to . borrow money to fund the divorce payments, filings show. Continental, the top driller in North Dakota's oil boom, has . publicly claimed its CEO's divorce has had, and will have, no . impact on its business or operations. But according to new court documents reviewed by Reuters, . the firm's minority shareholders have also paid a price. In a filing, Continental complained to the court about 'all . of the expense that Continental's minority shareholders have . been dragged through' as a result of the divorce case. How much time and money Continental has spent so far on its . CEO's divorce case isn't clear, however. A review of Securities and Exchange Commission filings shows . the firm has not disclosed any such costs to shareholders. Continental did not respond to questions for this article. The company hasn't said if Hamm will reimburse it for the costs . incurred. Hamm's lawyer, Craig Box, didn't respond to requests . for comment. Hamm's appeal 'raises the stakes for his ex-wife,' said . Carolyn Thompson, an Oklahoma family law specialist. As Arnall . presses Hamm for billions more, the oilman will try to convince . the state's high court that what he owes her 'should be reduced . or eliminated,' Thompson said. Sue Ann Arnall pictured at the Oklahoma courthouse in November amid the divorce that has dragged on for three years . Arnall was awarded a total of about $1 billion, in cash and . assets, to be paid over a period of years. In his appeal, Hamm . is contesting most of that award, including the court's order . that he split with Arnall $1.4 billion derived from the rise in . his Continental shareholdings. He also lists 26 other . investments or properties he says were wrongly split up as . marital assets. These include the couple's former Oklahoma City . home and a $17 million California ranch, both awarded to Arnall. Hamm's appeal comes after the value of his Continental . shares has fallen by more than half, to $9.3 billion, down from . as much as $19 billion during the trial in August. Continental's market capitalization eroded amid a recent . plunge in oil prices, which now trade near five-year lows of $57 . a barrel. In response, Continental plans to sharply cut spending . next year. Hamm founded Continental in 1967. When he and Arnall wed in . 1988, the company was worth less than $50 million, filings show. A month after the November 10 divorce ruling, Hamm asked the . court to consider new evidence: a chart showing that Continental . shares dropped 22 percent as oil prices fell 16.5 percent . earlier this month. 'The dramatic drop in oil price post-trial and the . corresponding drop in the CLR stock price demonstrate the . overriding impact of the oil price on the value of the stock,' Hamm said in a court filing dated December 16. Hamm's request is unusual, said family law specialist . Thompson. In her view, she said, the courts should only consider . evidence admitted during the trial, which ended in October. Arnall believes she was short-changed when the court . failed to take account of both spouses' contributions to . Continental, according to a person familiar with her case. As an attorney for the company in the 1980s and 1990s, . Arnall was part of Continental's successful lawsuits against a . string of industry competitors. The millions it won were . reinvested in drilling. Between 1996 and 2008, she formed and . often managed Continental's profitable oil and gas marketing . divisions, the person said. Continental hasn't commented on Arnall's previous roles . there. At trial, Arnall told the court that during the marriage, . Hamm had often refused to put property in both spouses' names. That became a point of contention between the couple, according . to people familiar with her version of events, since she worried . Hamm would leave her. The couple had filed twice previously for divorce - Hamm in . 1998 Arnall in 2005. Arnall filed for divorce again, the current case, in 2012. At trial, Hamm admitted to spending $150,000 on an extramarital . pursuit, without offering further details. His relationship with . Arnall had been 'loveless' for years, his court filings said. In their divorce battle, Hamm has sought to tweak the . historical record in his favor. Reuters reported in September . that Continental had altered its corporate timeline on the . company's website, and made changes to language in SEC filings, . in ways that could benefit Hamm's case. The revised timeline was . largely accepted by the court. It included claims that important . milestones, such as Continental's lucrative shift in focus from . natural gas to oil, came years before the marriage began. In August, under questioning from Arnall's attorney, Hamm . testified that several statements on Continental's web site had . been incorrect and that he had only recently discovered the . errors. Hamm has also sought to downplay Arnall's role. Among the . evidence the couple has battled over is a 104-page book . published in late 2012 and commissioned earlier by Hamm, . entitled 'Continental Resources - A Tribute to the Enid Years.' It chronicles the huge success of Continental since it was . founded by Hamm in Enid, Oklahoma. The book, read by Reuters, . was written by longtime Hamm friend and fellow oilman Mickey . Thompson. The saga contains no mention of Sue Ann Arnall. Thompson . said in an interview that he had intended to include material on . Arnall, a person he considered among the 'key players' in . Continental's rise. But after Arnall filed for divorce in May . 2012, Thompson said, Hamm told him that 'Sue Ann was not going . to be in the book.'","Harold Hamm, 69, was worth $19 billion and ordered to pay his ex-wife $1b .

"Blake Kerwin, 17, of Wigan, is believed to be the first transgender Justin Bieber lookalike . Packs of screaming girls and young fans asking for pictures are now an everyday occurrence for Blake Kerwin. The 17-year-old is a Justin Bieber look-a-like and these moments do more than just provide the college student with a taste of what life is like for his idol. For Blake the recognition provides him with hope and a lightness that has been missing from his life - for the teenager was actually born a girl named Rebecca. His decision to switch gender and live his life as a boy has seen him on and off the police protection list for five years due to a campaign of abuse that has seen him beaten unconscious and his house pelted with rocks, snowballs and metal poles. He has even attempted to kill himself in a bid to escape his tormentors. But Blake said yesterday he finds comfort in impersonating Bieber, 20, and that the Canadian pop star’s music has given him the confidence to be himself. It is believed Blake is Britain’s first transgender Bieber look-a-like. A person is transgender if they believe the body they were born with does not match how they feel as an individual. Blake said he has known he was a boy from a very young age and has now decided to undergo surgery and hormone treatment to change his body from that of a girl to that of a boy. He said: ‘I was born a boy but my body reflects differently because I’ve not had the op yet. I knew at quite a young age because I was always copying my brother and doing what he was doing and I just didn’t feel right.’ His mother Sharon, 52, also noticed early on that something didn’t seem right. She said: ‘I knew there was something because I would try and dress him up, not thinking and doing his hair with girly things. He would say I don’t like this and I would tell him it looks good and he would go along with it but he was never really happy. I knew there was something but I could never put my finger on it. Even then he would come home and take the girl clothes off and put on football, Manchester United, stuff.’ After coming across Bieber on YouTube when he was 12, Blake, who lives with Sharon and his older brother Bradley in Wigan, said he felt an immediate connection with the singer and his lyrics. He picked out the song Believe as summing up how Bieber inspires him, highlighting the words ‘It didn’t matter how many times I got knocked on the floor’ because: ‘I’ve had physical abuse and hate but Justin’s words bring me back up again’. Scroll down for video . When Blake cut his hair short into the singer’s style, his mother, Sharon, pointed out the physical resemblance between the pair and he began considering the idea of working as a lookalike. He has since worked hard perfecting the likeness, closely studying music videos and interviews to memorise Bieber’s mannerisms and spending hundreds of pounds on clothing, sometimes spending days trawling the internet to find versions of the singer’s outfits at affordable prices. However, the work has paid off and he is often mistaken for the real Bieber. He said: ‘I’ve had my shades on and my hat backwards and I went into Blackpool and a small girl came up and her mum asked if she could have her picture taken with me because she thought I really was Justin Bieber. And, when I went to Birmingham, these girls on the escalators were going crazy because they thought I was him.’ Blake has spent hours impersonating the star to copy his mannerisms and said he now gets mistaken for him . He was born Rebecca but realised he was transgender and changed his name by deed poll at the age of 16 . However, these highlights are far from the usual reaction and Blake has endured years’ of abuse from people who won’t accept him. Sharon has been forced to ring the police ‘hundreds of times’ because of different incidents. He has been forced to change school twice because of bullying and was once beaten unconscious by a girl who thought Blake was attracted to her. While he was left in need of medical attention she was only suspended for one day. On other occasions his house has been pelted with rocks, snowballs and even a metal pole that cracked the front window while Blake was sitting just inside. And while both Sharon, who is a full time carer to her mother who is recovering from breast cancer, and his brother Bradley, 19, are both accepting of Blake’s identity, other members of his family have been less supportive. Blake is due to start gender re-assignment surgery and is believed to be the first transgender Bieber lookalike . Blake says impersonating Bieber has helped him dealing with the bullying and abuse he has suffered . The teenager, pictured as Rebecca at five months old at his christening (left) and at 10 (right) came out as transgender at 16 and has passed the psychological tests and will start taking testosterone before surgery . He said: ‘It’s been terrible with my dad, he used to call me by my own name and not Blake and he’s not got me anything for my birthday or Christmas. We don’t see each other any more, he’s got a new girlfriend. He’s asked my mum why I don’t dress more girly and told her it’s embarrassing to be seen out with me.’ He has not seen his father for nearly two years. Blake, who came out as transgender at 16 and changed his name by deed poll, said this repeated rejection led to an attempt to take his own life. Already self-harming, four years ago he went further, huddling in the corner clutching a knife saying he did not want to live anymore. Sharon had to call the police as she did not know how to talk him down. Blake has been asked for his autograph and to pose for photos in Birmingham after being mistaken for Bieber . He spends hours copying the child star's moves and trawling the internet to buy similar clothes and shoes . However, he said turning to Bieber has helped him work through some of these issues, to the point where he is now able to give advice to others who are struggling with their own sexuality. He said: ‘Now I help people. There’s a group online where people can post online about when they start their operations or when they start [taking testosterone] or recent pictures before and after and I know quite a few people who are going through it. 'Some people come to me asking how they should come out to someone. It feels good to help others.’ His mother added: ‘They are saying he’s an inspiration. There was a boy whose little sister was sick, she was only three and dying from cancer, and he asked if Blake would take a picture of himself looking like Justin and put her name on and he said “thank you so much, it meant everything.”’ Blake is currently in the process of gender re-assignment and plans to get tattoos to complete the likeness . Currently studying public services at college, Blake hoped to join either the army or the fire service before deciding to try and make a career as a lookalike. These are professions he will go back to if he impersonating Bieber doesn’t go to plan. His current aim is to land jobs either modelling as Bieber or performing at children’s parties. Having passed the psychological evaluation necessary before undergoing gender reassignment surgery, he is now scheduled to begin taking testosterone before eventually having the full procedure. He hopes these next steps will help him look more masculine and therefore more like Bieber and plans to get tattoos and build muscle at the gym to make himself more like the star.","Blake Kerwin, 17, is  a Justin Bieber lookalike but was actually born a girl .

"It has emerged that procedures used by Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow could easily cost around £14,000 a month . Her fresh-faced looks have earned her a multi-million pound fortune. And it appears Gwyneth Paltrow ensures no expense is spared when it comes to maintaining them. It has emerged that the procedures used by the Hollywood actress could easily cost around £14,000 a month. From holistic treatments to weekly facials, not to mention the services of a hair stylist and make-up artist for personal appearances, Miss Paltrow’s regime does not come cheap. The 42-year-old mother of two is said to enjoy Reiki stress reduction massage on a monthly basis, which typically costs £185 for 90 minutes resulting in an annual spend of as much as £2,220. The Oscar-winning actress is also said to be a fan of the intravenous vitamin therapy at the Be Hive of Healing centre in Los Angeles. Costing up to £289 per session, it is estimated Miss Paltrow has at least one a month and could easily hand over as much as £3,500 a year. The lymphatic massage at Be Hive is also a must-have for the star. Costing around £130, the 90-minute procedure allows toxins to be released and the benefits no doubt outweigh the £1,600 she could spend in a year . The Iron Man star, whose net worth is estimated at £40million, is also believed to indulge twice a year in Thermage laser treatment on her face, brows and neck, thought to cost almost £17,000. In between these sessions, Miss Paltrow – who split from Coldplay’s Chris Martin earlier this year – heads to Tracie Martyn for facials when she is in New York. She thinks nothing of paying almost £1,500 a year for microdermabrasion, electronic muscle stimulation and oxygen-mist treatment. When Miss Paltrow is back in Los Angeles, she reportedly visits Sonya Dakar once a week, and is believed to enjoy her apple stem cell facial – at around £300 a session or £12,000 a year. Scroll down for video . Hair salon treatments and trims are estimated to cost Miss Paltrow around £6,000 a year. Before she invested in a chain of blow-dry bars this year, she was also paying for weekly blow drys, which were thought to cost her almost £100 each – or around £5,000 a year. For personal appearances, Miss Paltrow will often have her own hairstylist and make-up artist. The annual bill for both is estimated at £120,000 – although their services will often be paid for by film companies if she is promoting a movie. There is one area, however, where Miss Paltrow saves money – she part-owns the Tracy Anderson gym chain so can do her five two-hour workouts for free every week. Last night a source said: ‘In the past few years Gwyneth Paltrow created a career based on being an inspiration through her GOOP website – she’s not just an actress any more. ‘Part of what’s on her shoulders now is added pressure to look good. After all, who’s going to take advice from her if she doesn’t. Looking good is part of her business plan.’ A spokesman for Miss Paltrow declined to comment.","Procedures used by Gwyneth Paltrow could cost around £14,000 a month .

"For most brides-to-be, finding the perfect wedding dress can be one of the hardest aspects of planning the big day. But for Katie Breland Hughes, a Louisiana fitness instructor who hit the headlines after she was left paralyzed from the waist down following a horrific car accident in 2011, seeking out the ideal gown for her wedding was all the more important - because she was determined to wear it while walking down the aisle. So Katie, 27, turned to the experts on TLC's hit reality series Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta in the hopes of finding a gown which she felt completely comfortable and confident in - and which wouldn't hamper her efforts as she took her first steps towards her husband-to-be, programmer Odie Hughes. Scroll down for video . On a mission: Louisiana fitness instructor Katie Breland Hughes enlisted the help of TLC stars Lori Allen and Monte Durham to help her find the perfect wedding dress . Style selection: Katie, who was left paralyzed after a car accident in October 2011, bought three different wedding dresses before turning to the TLC reality series for help . 'I actually bought three dresses [before going on the show],' Katie told the Today show. 'I didn’t like any of them.' But thanks to the help of TLC stars - and wedding dress experts - Lori Allen and Monte Allen, the fitness fan found the ideal design. 'Everything about it was perfect,' she said of the gown. And it wasn't just Lori and Monte who helped Katie with her search, but also her beloved strength and conditioning coach Mike Barwis, who surprised the bride-to-be by turning up to help her make her final decision. 'Katie's had such a hard time finding a dress, and I know she must be frustrated,' Lori explains in the episode, which is due to air on TLC on January 2. 'But luckily, I've called in a little back-up.' Surprise! The 27-year-old was delighted to receive a surprise visit from her strength and conditioning coach Mike Barwis, who helped her make her final dress decision . Firm friends: Mike helped Katie to train for three years so that she could fulfill her dream of walking down the aisle . 'She's a great kid': Mike was incredibly excited to be a part of such an important moment in Katie's life . After seeing Mike walk into the store, Katie exclaims: 'Mike, I'm so happy to see you! I'm so glad you came.' She later adds: 'Oh my gosh, I was completely shocked.' 'She is too important for me not to be here,' Mike tells Lori and Monte. 'When I met Katie, she really couldn't move anything from her bellybutton down. After a few months, she was able to start moving her legs a little bit. 'Now she's really able to put braces on and walk with her knees locked. 'I came down to show my support and I wouldn't miss it for the world. She's a great kid.' Katie eventually opted for an illusion lace neckline with a full gown, which gave her enough room to walk comfortably down the aisle alongside her father and Mike while wearing a pair of sturdy leg braces, having spent three years training for her special day. The blushing bride: Katie stunned the world when she walked down the aisle at her wedding to programmer Odie Hughes on September 20 . Elation: The groom was overjoyed when he saw his wife making her way towards him . 'I told my sister from the beginning, I will not get married - whoever it be to, or whenever it happens - I will not do it until I can walk down the aisle,' Katie added to the Today show. 'I just won’t be in a wheelchair. So that was always a goal. 'I didn’t know the next year it would actually happen.' Katie's accident occurred in October 2011 when she missed a stop sign that was turned sideways. Her Nissan was hit by a truck and she flew through the windshield and across the road, landing in a ditch, with her car landing on top of her. Lean on me: Katie had the support her father and her strength and conditioning coach Mike (both pictured) throughout the day . Overcoming her fears: The beautiful bride admitted that she was incredibly nervous ahead of the ceremony . The happy couple: Katie and Odie celebrated their marriage alongside their family and friends on September 20 . It took an emergency crew 33 minutes to extract her from beneath the engine. Severe burns covered three-quarters of her body and two vertebrae were shattered. Katie was in the hospital for 100 days and had many surgeries, including skin grafts and a surgery where rods and plates were placed to hold her back together. She and Odie met around three years ago when a mutual friend introduced them shortly before her accident.","Doctors told fitness instructor Katie Breland Hughes that she would never walk again, following a car accident in October 2011 .

"The New Nordic diet, a nutritional plan created by two chefs in Denmark that focuses on whole grains, foraged plants, fresh fish and meat, is being heralded as the next big trend in healthy eating. Vogue writer Kate Christensen, who lost 4lbs in two weeks on the diet, says it is similar to the ‘widely hailed Mediterranean diet, which draws on the traditional cuisines of Greece, Spain, and Italy’, but explains that it is more 'a way of thinking about eating' – after all, the New Nordic diet allows wine with dinner. 'Unlike the Mediterranean diet, which allows white bread, pasta, and polenta, the New Nordic shuns refined grains and processed foods. And instead of olive oil, the Nordics eat cold-pressed rapeseed oil, also known as canola, which has less saturated fat and more heart-healthy omega-3s than its Mediterranean cousin,' she added. Scroll down for video . Wild idea: The New Nordic, which emphasizes fresh fish such as herring (left) and wild meats such as moose (right) is being heralded as the next big trend in healthy eating . Natural selection: Root vegetables are also part of the plan, which calls for vegetarian dinners twice a week . Chefs René Redzepi and Claus Meyer pioneered the New Nordic movement at their Copenhagen restaurant Noma, starting in 2004, incorporating moss, twigs, seaweed and edible bark into their entrees, which also included elk, herring, rye and nettles. Ms Christensen used a cookbook from Noma and another by Danish food writer Trine Hahnemann to follow the plan, which involved consuming foraged plants, wild or pastured meats and aquatic foods, such as fish, shellfish and seaweed. A hunter friend donated several pounds of frozen moose to the cause. According to guidelines adopted by the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2005, an ideal week of dinners includes three meat, two seafood, and two vegetarian dishes, plus unlimited root vegetables, leafy greens, nuts and berries, legumes, orchard fruits, and whole grains such as rye, spelt, oats, and barley. The New Nordic diet is similar to last year's craze, the Paleo diet, which advocates eating like a caveman. However, Paleo bans grains and alcohol and allows for more meat than its Viking counterpart. 'Three weeks into it, this Nordic diet was going swimmingly. It had made me more conscious of health, not just food. Not only was I drinking more water than usual, I had upped my exercise to two Pilates classes a week, frequent five-mile runs, and the occasional hard-core cardio-workout video. I was sleeping better and enjoying a sense of satiety without too many cravings,' she writes. She tried it: Vogue writer Kate Christensen (pictured) lost 4lbs on the New Nordic diet . Origin story: Chefs René Redzepi and Claus Meyer pioneered the New Nordic movement at their Copenhagen restaurant Noma, starting in 2004 . For more videos please go to YouTube . 'I cooked almost every meal at home: steel-cut oats with blueberries and maple syrup for breakfast, potato-leek soup for lunch, roasted root vegetables and steamed kale with currants and hazelnuts for vegetarian dinner. I made Hahnemann’s mussel-and-cod stew with vegetables and white wine on seafood days, and moose stew and roast free-range chicken on meat days.' However, when she realized she wasn't losing weight, she consulted Traci Mann, Ph.D., director of the Health and Eating Lab at the University of Minnesota, who advised her that any effective diet limits portions. When she began to eat more slowly and consume smaller portions of these Nordic feasts, she was able to lose four pounds in two weeks. Earlier this year, Dr Thomas Meinart Larsen led a study at Copenhagen University that asked 181 overweight adults to follow one of two different diets for six months. Of this group, 68 people were assigned to an 'average Danish diet', comprised of the dishes currently most eaten in Denmark, including many imported foods, and 113 were put on the New Nordic Diet, with recipes created by Noma's Mr Meyer that featured ingredients made up of local and seasonal whole foods. All of the participants were encouraged to eat until they were fully satisfied, paying some attention to portion size, but never counting calories. Results showed those in the Nordic diet group lost around 10lbs on average compared with a loss of 3lbs for the Danish diet group.","The New Nordic diet swaps olive oil for canola, and focuses on whole grains and root vegetables .

"The Duchess of Cambridge has carried out only about a third as many public engagements as 93-year-old Prince Philip this year. Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child in April, undertook 76 visits, meetings and receptions in 2014 following the birth of her son, Prince George. But the Queen’s husband shouldered more than 200 engagements, despite suffering regular periods of ill health in recent years, an unofficial survey of annual royal duties by the Daily Mail shows. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge has carried out only about a third as many public engagements as 93-year-old Prince Philip this year . Prince Philip, 93, has conducted around 200 public engagements this year, while the Queen has undertaken around 375. They are pictured with Pope Francis, during their one-day visit to Rome in April . Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child in April, undertook 76 visits, meetings and receptions in 2014 following the birth of her son, Prince George. She is pictured meeting with children at the newly established 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony in east London . Kate’s tally of public duties is also barely a fifth of the number undertaken by the Queen, 88. She has conducted around 375, sometimes packing in six or more a day. In fact, the duchess performed the fewest public duties out of the 15 royals whose activities are listed daily on the Court Circular. Aides have always insisted that Kate wants to focus her efforts on being a wife and mother for the first few years of her royal life. She does undertake a small number of carefully chosen public duties for charities she is intimately involved in such as East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices. The Queen’s husband shouldered more than 200 engagements, despite suffering regular periods of ill health in recent years, an unofficial survey of annual royal duties by the Daily Mail shows . Kate’s tally of public duties is also barely a fifth of the number undertaken by the Queen, 88. She has conducted around 375, sometimes packing in six or more a day . Sources close to Kate insist she has the backing of the Queen, who is happy to afford her grandson and his wife time to enjoy the early years of their married life together before a lifetime of public duty. They say she is also fully supportive of Prince William’s decision to have a full-time job outside the Royal Family. Earlier this year he gave up his role as an RAF rescue pilot and next spring will begin a new job with a civilian air ambulance force. Other courtiers point out that, for the first time in more than 100 years, there are three living generations of heirs to the throne in addition to the Queen’s other children and their families. ‘There are more than enough senior members of the Royal Family to undertake the annual number of public duties required,’ said one. Prince Charles  (pictured during a visit to the Military Family Resource Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia) was still the hardest working royal with more than 450 public duties listed on the Court Circular . Second in line to the throne William almost doubled his number of engagements this year from just over 60 to 111. The tally is still significantly less than other royals because of his full-time military role . William, who is second in line to the throne, almost doubled his number of engagements this year from just over 60 to 111. He has also taken on some of his grandmother’s more taxing duties, notably public investitures. The tally is still significantly less than other royals because of his full-time military role. Despite a drop in duties, Charles was still the hardest working royal with more than 450 public duties listed on the Court Circular. He was closely followed by his sister, Princess Anne, with around 419. Prince Andrew saw a drop in duties to 297 over the year with an increasing number of trips abroad to countries including China. His younger brother, Prince Edward, has also had a productive year with 348 engagements. Prince Charles has undertaken notably fewer public engagements than normal over the last 12 months as he shoulders more of the Queen’s responsibilities. The heir to the throne conducted around 450 public visits in 2014, compared to 500 plus in recent years, according to a Mail survey. The fall is down to the fact that the engagements Charles takes on behalf of his mother – such as foreign visits – tend to be longer, leaving him less time, say senior royal aides. A Clarence House spokesman said: ‘In 2014, in addition to his public engagements in the UK, the Prince undertook seven international visits at the request of Her Majesty’s Government including attending the D-Day commemorations in Normandy. ‘The Prince continues to do all he can to make a difference for the better in the UK and internationally through his charitable work.’","Survey of annual royal duties  reveals who has attended most public events .

"To say it's been a year for experimental fashion would be a bit of an understatement. Rihanna dared to bare all in a completely transparent spangled gown, Amber Rose draped herself in  metal chains and Lady Gaga debuted a full fur balaclava. But for every fashion fail, there has been a style triumph - FEMAIL casts an eye over the looks we've loved and the outfits we've loved to loathe in 2014. Scroll down for video . Rihanna's sheer bravado in wearing such a racy dress manages to compensate for looking essentially naked . Kendall Jenner was sleek in a cream jumpsuit with black detailing on the leg at the British Fashion Awards . Rihanna  turned things up a notch in a see-through dress by Adam Selman at the US's fashion Oscars, the CDFA in June. Although the gown sported 230,000 hand-sewn Swarovski crystals they weren't enough to shield the outrageous singer's modesty - the fur stole carefully positioned around her bikini area did that. But as well as serious style misses, there have been huge hits such as Blake Lively showing off old school movie star style in Gucci at the Met Gala in May. And model of the moment Kendall Jenner opted for a slick white strapless jumpsuit at the British Fashion Awards this month - the perfect outfit to cement her successful transition from reality star to catwalk queen. There was leg flashing, bum baring and more glamour than you could shake a stick at and a new generation of starlets and up-and-comers proved they had red carpet charisma in spades. Lupita Nyong'o became a red carpet darling in a a series of  stunning designer gowns during awards season . Lupita matched her red dress to the red carpet and still looked amazing in Ralph Lauren at the Golden Globes . HIT: COURAGEOUS AND COLOURFUL LUPITA NYONG'O . With her award winning role in 12 Years A Slave Lupita Nyong'o became one of the breakout stars of the year. But it wasn't just her acting skills that got our attention. Lupita quickly became a firm fashion favourite on the red carpet. We swooned as she wore sky blue Prada to the Oscars and cheered as she rocked a bright red Ralph Lauren cape dress to the Golden Globes. And who could forget that gorgeous turquoise Gucci gown she wore to the SAG Awards  in January? In fact Lupita's red carpet looks even landed her a lucrative contract as the face of Miu Miu. Amber Rose was barely dressed at all in an outfit constructed out of a series of chain loops and a silver thong . MISS: AMBER ROSE WAS ALL CHAINED UP . When Amber Rose rocked up to the VMAs in August in this dress constructed entirely out of looped chains she got everyone talking - for all the wrong reasons. The mother-of-one, who recently separated from husband, rapper Wiz Khalifa, topped worst dressed lists around the globe for her barely-there attire. But the 31-year-old, who is well known for her love of risque clothing wasn't put off by her critics. In fact Amber continues to post videos of herself on Instagram in little or no clothing. Suki Waterhouse looks sophisticated in a layered tulle shirt dress and dramatic frothy nude ballgown . HIT: SUKI WATERHOUSE WAS FASHIONABLE IN FRILLS . Not just a pretty face, model, actress and girlfriend of Bradley Cooper, Suki Waterhouse has worn some seriously cute looks this year. In particular we were impressed by her ability to appear chic in sheer layered frills, a look usually only reserved for your grandmother's loo-roll holder. It probably helps that 22-year-old Suki is the face Burberry's Brit clothing line, indeed, when she attended the Met Gala in New York this summer it was in a custom-made dress by the fashion house. The Met Gala theme was White Tie but both Katie Holmes and Kate Upton opted for 'flamenco' instead . MISS: FLAMENCO FAILS AT THE MET GALA . The theme for this year's Costume Institute Ball, the Met Gala, in New York was White Tie, unfortunately it seems that Katie Holmes and Kate Upton did not get the memo. Instead both women seemed to go for more of a flamenco theme. Katie  wore bright yellow Marchesa with echoes of  Gone With The Wind. Kate wore a black vintage Dolce & Gabbana fishtail gown that made her look as she  would shout, 'olé!' at any moment. Fashion-watchers are on tenterhooks waiting to see how guests will interpret next year's theme of Chinese Whispers. Cara Delevingne looked chic and arresting in Ralph Lauren at Prince William's  party at Windsor Castle in May . Cara, here with Pharrell Williams, opted for a vintage kimono-style dress at the Elle Style Awards in February . Cara left nothing to the imagination in  transparent black lace  at the  GQ Men Of The Year Awards in September . HIT: CARA DELEVINGNE IS BACK IN BLACK . Of course, 22-year-old model and actress Cara Delevingne had to make the list at some point. And for all her sartorial experimentation, the model  looks her best when she keeps it simple. She stunned in a sophisticated embroidered black Ralph Lauren gown at an event held by Prince William at Windsor Castle earlier this year. Similarly the face of Burberry, Topshop and Mulberry looked stylish and chic in February at the Elle Style Awards in a vintage kimono. And in September, perhaps inspired by Rihanna's see-through outfit, Cara looked sophisticated in an entirely see-through  lace number over a pair of substantial black knickers for the GQ Men of The Year Awards. The Abominable  Snowman was clearly Lady Gaga's style inspiration on a chilly March night in New York . MISS: LADY GAGA IS COVERED IN FUR . When Lady Gaga arrived at the Roseland Ballroom in March there was only one question on everybody's lips: How on earth can she see where she's going? Gaga, who is known for her outlandish outfits and once wore a dress made entirely of meat, went for a Yeti-style outfit from head to toe, with a piece that covered her face, a white fur dress and thigh-high boots. We can only presume that the upside was that she kept nice and warm. Lara Stone, who has modelled for Calvin Klein, looked breathtaking in a pink sheath dress by the designer . HIT: LARA WEARS CALVIN IN CANNES . Wearing hot pink on the red carpet can be a bit of a gamble given the obvious colour clash. But Dutch model and mother Lara Stone pulled off the look with aplomb when she attended the premiere of The Search in Cannes in May. In a simple but striking Calvin Klein dress (she has previously been chosen as the face of the brand) Lara proved that when it comes to detailing sometimes less is more. Lena Dunham baffled fans with her blancmange-like Gianbattista Vialli layered tulle skirt and matching blouse . MISS: LENA'S EPIC EMMY DISASTER . Is this a shirt? Is it a dress? Well, it's both. Girls creator Lena Dunham left fashion fans confused when she teamed a little pink shirt with a giant pink layered Gianbattista Vialli skirt that looked like a blancmange at the Emmys. But the writer, who released her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl this year, has long been outspoken about not caring what people think of her outfit choices. Blake Lively wore a stunning Gucci dress to the Met Gala, rocking an old school Hollywood glamour look . Blake's husband Ryan Reynolds was delighted to accompany his wife to the high-profile fashion event . HIT: BLAKE DOES OLD SCHOOL HOLLYWOOD . Ever since she starred in the hit TV show Gossip Girl Blake Lively has been famous for her enviable wardrobe. Earlier this year - before announcing that she was pregnant with her first child - she and husband Ryan Reynolds attended the Met Ball, both in head-to-toe Gucci. Blake topped off her classic Hollywood siren look with gently waved hair and a red lipstick. Lily Allen and Sarah Jessica Parker made fashion missteps in big-skirted gowns at red carpet events this year . MISS: BIG SKIRTS AND BIG HAIR . Lily Allen might have looked a vision of pink, salmon and red in Vivienne Westwood at the Baftas in February but the pink spiky hairpiece tucked into her updo took her outfit from beautiful to bizarre. Similarly Sarah Jessica Parker's monochrome gown, designed by the late Oscar de la Renta, and featuring his signature on the voluminous white skirts, swamped her tiny frame. And her voluminous up-do just made the Sex And The City star look top heavy. But with awards season just round the corner, fashion fans will soon see what style hits and misses 2015 has in store.","See-through dresses, layered tulle and glamour were big A-list trends .

"The CIA announced on Monday that they are responsible for at least half of the UFO sightings reported in the 1950's and 60's. '#1 most read on our #Bestof2014 list: Reports of unusual activity in the skies in the '50s? It was us,' the government agency tweeted yesterday. Over the last few days, the CIA has been tweeting out links to its top ten most-read 'Best of 2014' documents. The CIA explained that the UFO sightings of the past were were directly correlated to them testing U-2 spy planes at altitudes of over 60,000 feet, once thought an impossible height to fly. Scroll down for video . Tweet: '#1 most read on our #Bestof2014 list: Reports of unusual activity in the skies in the '50s? It was us,' the government agency tweeted yesterday . UPI reports that the CIA soon realized that UFO sightings lined up with the place and time the U-2 planes were flying but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens but spies. Now U-2 planes are flown by the United States Air Force and 104 have been built in total. In 1960, the Soviet Union shot down a plane at 70,500 feet that was trying to enter the Soviet Union by going into Pakistan's air space then  Norway's air space. 'High-altitude testing of the U-2…led to an unexpected side effect — a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects,'  Venture Beat reports the CIA said in 1998. 'In the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and [many] military aircraft…operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet. Consequently, once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports, ‘the document continues. According to an article from The New York Times written in 1997, the U-2 planes were developed to photograph enemy targets from secret bases in California and Nevada. The planes flew across the country and eventually overseas to bases in countries that included Britain, West Germany and Taiwan. The spy planes  never ventured towards nor did they come from outer space.

"Police in Texas have arrested a teen for posting a photo of a replica gun pointed at a police car along with a caption reading in part: 'Should I do it?' Montrae Toliver, 17, was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a terroristic threat. Fort Worth police say he posted a photo on Twitter of a pellet gun pointed at the front of what appears to be a parked police car in the distance. Montrae Toliver, 17, of Fort Worth, Texas, was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a terroristic threat . A separate tweet from the same account said the gun is an Airsoft replica, which was confirmed by Fort Worth officers investigating the photo, department spokeswoman Tamara Pena said. Someone saw the photo on Twitter, took a screenshot and submitted it to Fort Worth police's Facebook page, she said. 'Either way, it's a threat,' Pena said. 'And so it's going to be looked into.' The message accompanying the photo read, 'Should I do it? They don't care for a black male anyways!' The killings of two unarmed black men by white police officers in Missouri and New York this summer touched off protests and a national debate over police conduct that intensified after grand juries declined to indict the officers. Fort Worth police say Toliver posted this photo on Twitter of a pellet gun pointed at the front of what appears to be a parked police car in the distance. The message accompanying the photo read, 'Should I do it? They don't care for a black male anyways!' Tensions escalated further after two New York City police officers were killed last weekend by a man who suggested in online posts that their slayings were in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. Pena did not know if Toliver had received a bond, and his name was not yet listed in jail records Thursday evening. A phone number for Toliver's family could not be found. The photo in the tweet was taken on the 1100 block of Mustang Ridge Drive. Teens and parents in the neighborhood confirmed Toliver was a student at Northwest High School, where he is involved in athletics.","Montrae Toliver, 17, was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a terroristic threat .

"President Obama's latest 'executive order' saw a military couple booted off a golf course where they planned to get married so he could play a round with his friends. Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr had their wedding moved off an Oahu, Hawaii Marine Corps base golf course on Sunday after the president decided to play the course at the last minute. The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean. Sorry: Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because President Obama wanted to play the course.

Priority: President Obama played the course Sunday with friends, and later called the couple to apologize for the inconvenience. Pictured above playing golf on December 24 at the same course with the Malaysian prime minister . Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg. The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama.

President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. Yesterday he took to the course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb. However, it appears the president didn't know that his golf game interrupted a military wedding, since he reached out to the newlyweds to apologize. In a picture posted to Instagram, the couple were seen at the ceremony answering a call from the commander in chief. 'He apologized and congratulated them,' McCarthy said. 'We were all there, it was perfect,' she added . 'Made their day.' According to Naile Brennan, manager of the catering company which worked on the wedding, anyone planning a wedding at the course are warned that the president can interrupt events when he is in town.

This gives a really flawless high-definition finish, so is ideal for a big night out when you want your skin to look perfect. If you need a bit more coverage around the eye area, simply dab on a touch of cover-up. I used Clarins Instant Light Brush On Perfector, which will instantly disguise any dark circles without drying out the delicate skin in that area. Sparkling Eyes . I love a classic smoky eye but this time I've updated the look using icy silver tones to create a glamorous metallic version. First, to act as a base colour, I took the light grey shade from thebareMinerals Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Afterparty and swept it all over my lids. Next, I chose the shimmery silver from the palette, sweeping it across my lids and focusing on the outer corners of the eyes. I followed this with the black shade, working it into my socket line and along my upper lash line to add depth to my eyes and really make the silver tone shine. I defined both my upper and lower lash lines with Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet, focusing more on the outer corners. Multiple coats of Dior Addict It-Lash Mascara completed my glistening party eyes. Binky has used a bronzer to contour her cheeks to make them appear more chiseled . Shimmer And Shine . A glam party look like this isn’t complete without some serious contouring, and I used bareMinerals Ready Bronzer in The Skinny Dip to sculpt my face and create the illusion of razor-sharp cheekbones. Simply suck your cheeks in and brush the colour under your cheekbones, as well as along your temples and across your jawline for a chiselled effect. Next, I added some shimmer to the look with the Too Faced Candlelight Glow Highlighter. Using a small brush, I swept the champagne shade over the tops of my cheekbones, down my nose and under my brow bones. A shimmering highlighter like this can really transform a party look and make it extra glamorous – perfect for New Year's Eve when you want to go all out with your make up. Binky recommends using a highlighter for a subtle shimmering look . A Perfect Pout . Lastly, the lips. When I’ve created dramatic smokey eyes, I always opt for a nude lip to keep the look balanced. As it’s New Years Eve, I’ve chosen one with a slight shimmer to it to add to the party feel. I applied Daniel Sandler Lipshine in Buff to my lips straight from the bullet. You'll find all the products I've used in this look at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. Well, I'm party-ready and all set to have some serious fun. Enjoy your New Year’s celebrations, and I’ll see you in 2015! Stay gorgeous . Love Binky xxx .","NYE is one of the biggest nights of the year, so calls for ultimate glamour .

"If Sin City's sports books took bets on the weather, snow in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve would normally have terrible odds. It might pay out this year, though, if the white flurries start falling on an Eiffel Tower, a pyramid and a volcano come Wednesday night as forecast by the National Weather Service. Those huddled in New York City to watch the ball drop could expect a mostly sunny Wednesday with a low of 27 degrees by evening. No chance of snow. A city worker uses a machine equipped with a brush to clear snow along a path over Cherry Creek on Tuesday in Denver, Colorado as much of the country faced a mass cold front . Cole Baldock clears a light snow from a walkway on Tuesday in Denver, Colorado. Forecasters predict that the daytime high in communities in Colorado will only reach single digits . Winter Storm Frona may bring snow to Las Vegas for New Year's Eve - the first time the area has seen a notable amount since 2008 . Temperatures continued to drop this week as the arctic blast set in across the country ahead of the New Year . Forecasts in Las Vegas, though, pinned the area's chances on New Year's Eve snow at 70 per cent, along with a 32-degree low. Las Vegas could get 1-3 inches of snow from Tuesday night into Thursday morning, according to accuweather.com. Only 15 snowstorms which brought greater than 1 inch of snow have hit Sin City since records began in 1937. But even with that level of confidence, snowball fights on the Strip remain far from a sure bet. Moisture, snow's key ingredient, remained elusive in predictions as of late on Monday. 'Whether or not we get any snow, it's still going to be very cold for New Year's,' said Chris Stachelski, a meteorologist with the service in Las Vegas. It's part of a cold and 'somewhat moist' storm moving south across California onto the Mojave Desert and Las Vegas bringing snow to parts of Northern Arizona and Utah, according to National Weather Service forecasts. It's going to be cold, that's certain, so cold that the meteorologists at the  National Weather Service warned tourists much like a parent might to, 'bring layers and dress warmly,' and wear shoes with some good traction, not typical if attempting acts of fashion on the social holiday. Workers test the Times Square New Year's Eve ball in New York City on December 30. Revelers should expect a mostly sunny Wednesday with a low of 27 degrees by evening - but no chance of snow . Snow tops a lion sculpture on Tuesday in Denver, Colorado as the area was blasted by winter storm Frona . Some 340,000 people are expected to pack the Strip and Las Vegas' downtown Fremont area for festivities. Organizers of the fireworks show shot from the rooftops of seven casino resorts remained confident Monday that snow wouldn't damper their show. Michael Mack with Las Vegas Events said only wind could shut it down and in the 14 years the company has been producing the show, it hadn't. If it does snow, it'll be 'bring-your-own-de-icer' at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport where it's up to airlines to bring de-icing equipment with them. The airport doesn't have any snow removal gear on hand nor is it required to. The last time any notable amount stuck to the airport's runways was December 17, 2008. Party-goers were urged to wrap up warm as most of the U.S. will see a drop in temperature on New Year's Eve . Winter Storm Frona may be about to deliver its most impressive impacts over the New Year's holiday . Fireworks explode over Las Vegas Strip casinos just after midnight in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 1, 2014 - this year Sin City could ring in the new year with snow . Early forecasts said the southern Nevada area could expect up to three inches in spots 2,000 feet above sea level and up to an inch on the Strip and surrounding Las Vegas valley but by Monday evening, meteorologists had scaled that back to up to 2 inches in higher elevations and 'a light coating to half inch, an inch,' on the Strip, Stachelski said. The main issue may be getting to or leaving Las Vegas. Snow is expected on Tuesday evening through Wednesday in one of the main routes for Southern Californians, the Cajon Pass on Interstate 15. Travelers coming from Utah and Arizona should be fine, until Wednesday night, Thursday and Friday when snow is expected on Interstate 40 through Flagstaff and U.S. Route 93 to Phoenix, Stachelski said. Coated: Snow-prone areas like Colorado, pictured, were getting battered again on Monday- but wintry blasts were set to hit in unusual spots like Las Vegas .","Those watching the ball drop in New York City could expect a mostly sunny Wednesday with a low of 27 degrees by evening and no chance of snow .

"About seven out of every eight Obamacare insurance customers who enrolled between November 15 and mid-December are poor enough to qualify for taxpayer-funded subsidies designed to lower their monthly premiums. The Department of Health and Human Services reported that number Tuesday, saying it's up from 80 per cent a year ago. Americans who participate in government-brokered medical insurance can get subsidies from the federal treasury if their households earn less than four times the government's official 'poverty' level. That situation describes 64 per cent of all U.S. residents, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But far more are qualifying, suggesting that the Obamacare subscriber base is dramatically tilted toward low-income earners. And as poor Americans depend inreasingly on handouts to manage their monthly health insurance bills, the U.S. Supreme Court could be months away from invalidating the entire subsidy system that supports the 34 states that chose not to run their own Obamacare marketplaces. HANDOUTS: About 7 out of every 8 Obamacare enrollees will get a government subsidy to pay for part or all of their new medical insurance . MORE EXPENSIVE: With $65 billion in subsidies at risk, the Affordable Care Act is falling short of fulfilling President Obama's pledge to lower costs . Outgoing California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman estimated two weeks ago that as much as $65 billion in government payments to Americans in those states is at risk. The Supreme Court case, King v. Burwell, hinges on whether the government can legally distribute subsidies in states that use the Healthcare.gov online exchange instead of running their own. The law’s language is plain: Subsidies can only be paid through exchanges created by the states. Democrats in Congress, defending President Barack Obama's signature law, insist a drafting error is to blame. They say they intended for people in all 50 states to be eligible for subsidies. But Jonathan Gruber, the one-time Obamacare 'architect' whose unguarded, videotaped comments about the law drove him to apologize before Congress this month, thought differently in 2012. 'What’s important to remember politically about this,' Gruber told a group of consultants at the management firm Noblis, 'is if you're a state and you don’t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits – but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill.' 'So you’re essentially saying [to] your citizens you’re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country,' he warned. 'I hope that that's a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges.' Insurers are bracing for the possibility that 87 per cent of their new customers in the 34 states without insurance exchanges could suddenly find Obamacare policies financially out of reach – leading to lapsed premiums and a systemwide collapse. Some companies have slipped excape clauses into their policy contracts, The Daily Caller reports, allowing them to cancel the plans if the high court invalidates the subsidies. Tuesday's HHS report included data from only one month; the open enrollment period stretches through February 15. 'About 87 percent of people who selected health insurance plans through HealthCare.gov for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2015 were determined eligible for financial assistance to lower their monthly premiums,' the agency reproted, 'compared to 80 percent of enrollees who selected plans over a similar period last year. Obamacare subsidies can come in the form of tax credits that compensate for varying percentages of premiums. They can also consist of government payments that directly lower enrollees' out-of-pocket costs. Tax credits are available to everyone earning less than 400 per cent of the poverty limit. Those under 250 per cent of that benchmark can get the direct subsidies for 'silver' level insurance policies.. The final cost of insurance is capped at 9.5 per cent of total income for anyone who qualifies. Americans can apply different levels of health insurance subsidies next year, depending on the size of their families and how much they earn; about 87 per cent of enrolees so far this fall qualified for at least some taxpayer-funded payout . At 138 per cent of the poverty level, Americans become eligible for Medicaid and pay nothing for their care. The poverty limit for a family of four in 2014 was $23,850, and will increase in 2015 with inflation. That means a two-parent household with two children can get government help for Obamacare this year unless its earnings top $95,400. Income below $32,913 makes the family eligible for Medicaid coverage. According to a Kaiser Foundation online calculator, the same family could opt for an $8,290 'silver' level insurance policy and pay about $600 for it after subsidies are applied. With a $50,000 family income, they would only be responsible for $3,300 in premium payments for the year.","HHS said Tuesday that about seven out of every eight Obamacare enrollees will get government help paying for their medical insurance policies .
That number was 80 per cent a year ago .
People on Obamacare can get subsidies if their households earn less than four times the federal government's official 'poverty' level .
Sixty-four per cent of Americans have small enough incomes to qualify, meaning that Obamacare customers are disproportionately poor .
Entire $65 billion subsidy system could become illegal next year, depending on how the Supreme Court rules in a landmark case ."
"Luise Rainer, a star of cinema's golden era who became the first ever person to win back-to-back Oscars but then walked away from a glittering Hollywood career, has died aged 104. Rainer, whose roles ranged from the 1930s German stage to television's 'The Love Boat,' died Tuesday at her home in London from pneumonia, said her only daughter, Francesca Knittel-Bowyer. 'She was bigger than life and can charm the birds out of the trees,' Knittel-Bowyer said. 'If you saw her, you'd never forget her.' Scroll down for video . Star: Luise Rainer, pictured in 1999, died from pneumonia at her home in London, at the age of 104 . The big-eyed, apple-cheeked Rainer gained Hollywood immortality by becoming the first person to win an acting Academy Award in consecutive years, taking the best actress prize for 'The Great Ziegfeld' in 1936 in and 'The Good Earth' in 1937. It's a feat since achieved by only four other actors. Those trophies marked the peak of Rainer's career, which declined so rapidly that many considered her an early victim of 'the curse of the Oscars.' She fought with her studio over control of her career, fled Hollywood for New York and suffered through a brief, unhappy marriage to the playwright Clifford Odets. By the early 1940s, her stardom had essentially ended. Rainer herself described the double victory as the worst thing that could have happened to her. 'When I got two Oscars, they thought, 'Oh, they can throw me into anything,'' Rainer told The Associated Press in a 1999 interview. Old school star: Luise Ranier and William Powell in The Great Ziegfeld from 1936 which won her an Oscar . Luise Rainer holding her Best Actress Oscar during the Academy Awards ceremony in 1937, left, and pictured posing in a summer dress in the same year right . Golden girl: Luise Ranier at the 1936 Academy Awards with fellow winners Paul Muni and Frank Capra . Rainer was born on January 12, 1910 in Vienna, Austria, although some sources give her birthplace as Düsseldorf, Germany. She began her acting career as a teenager under innovative Austrian director Max Reinhardt and appeared in several German films. In the mid-1930s she was discovered by a talent scout from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and whisked to Hollywood. Her first U.S. film was the largely forgotten 'Escapade' (1935), but her next roles made her a star. Rainer may well have sobbed herself to her first Oscar, playing actress Anna Held, wife of impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, in 'The Great Ziegfeld.' The film featured a classic telephone scene during which, Anna, tears running down her face, congratulates her now ex-husband on his marriage to another actress. Her next Oscar was for playing a virtuous Chinese peasant in the screen adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's epic novel 'The Good Earth.' Suddenly Rainer now nicknamed the 'Viennese Teardrop' was famous, her beauty and emotional intensity winning many fans. But stardom, she later said, did not bring happiness. Years later, Rainer recalled how she had just had a fight with her husband, American playwright Clifford Odets, when she got word that she had won her second Oscar. In those days, winners were announced hours before the ceremony began. Famous in Germany: Luise Rainer and Berlin's mayor Klaus Wowereit attend a ceremony honouring her with a Star on the Berlin Walk of Fame (Boulevard der Stars) in 2011 . 'I hadn't even dreamed of getting another Academy Award, and there I was unhappy in my private life and miserable,' she told the AP in 1999. 'I remember Odets drove me three times around the Biltmore, where the Oscars were given out, because I was so full of tears.' Rainer made several pictures in 1938, including 'Toy Wife' and 'The Great Waltz,' but she chafed under the studio system and clashed with MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, and soon moved to New York with Odets. 'I had a seven-year contract that I broke and went away,' Rainer said in 1999. 'I was a machine, practically, a tool in a big, big factory, and I could not do anything. I wanted to film 'Madame Curie,' but Mayer forbade me. 'I wanted to do 'For Whom the Bell Tolls,' but (producer David O.) Selznick took Ingrid Bergman and brought her to (Ernest) Hemingway and I didn't know Hemingway. 'And so I left. I just went away. I fled; yes, I fled.' Rainer made one more Hollywood film, 'Hostages' in 1943, but spent most of her later life in England. She made occasional film and television appearances, including an episode of 'The Love Boat' in 1984. One of her last film roles was in 'The Gambler' a 1998 adaptation of a Fyodor Dostoyevsky story, in which she appeared with Michael Gambon and Dominic West. Rainer and Odets — author of 'Waiting for Lefty' and 'Awake and Sing!' — married in 1937 and divorced three tempestuous years later. In 1945, she married publisher Robert Knittel, who died in 1989. She's survived by her daughter with Knittel, and two granddaughters. Rainer lived for many years in an apartment on London's genteel Eaton Square. Her entry in 'Who's Who' listed her recreations as 'formerly mountain climbing, now writing, painting.' Four actors have matched Rainer's Oscar double in consecutive years: Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards and Tom Hanks.","Actress Luise Rainer won back-to-back Oscars in 1936 and 1937 .

"Man of letters: Anthony D'Ambrosio, 29, a resident of Wall, New Jersey, who works for Apple Inc, published a deeply personal essay titled 'To my ex-wife: I wish I would have held you tighter' A 29-year-old aspiring writer from New Jersey has penned an emotional open letter to his ex-wife, which has caused a stir online this week. Anthony D'Ambrosio, a resident of Wall who works for Apple Inc, published a deeply personal essay titled 'To my ex-wife: I wish I would have held you tighter' as part of Asbury Park Press' new relationship series. Last month, he wrote another piece for the Gannett paper about cheating, which was read by more than 5million people. D'Ambrosio's letter, which lays bare the anatomy of his relationship and eventual breakup, has left readers divided, with some praising the young divorcee for his candor while other questioning his motives and accusing him of being self-indulgent. The long-form essay provides an overview of the couple's relationship from the time they met at age 18 until their divorce. ‘I never imagined you and I, out of all the people in this world, would go through something so devastating as we did,’ D’Ambrsio writes in the opening of the letter addressed simply ‘to my ex-wife.’ ‘Throughout the years, we created the most beautiful memories. We climbed all the way to the top together, only to slip and fall as soon as we got there. And though I may have contributed to that fall, I tried so hard to hold on to you.’ The 29-year-old writer is vague on what precipitated the split, only saying that he had done things he is not proud of and that he cannot undo. And although D’Ambrosio writes that losing his wife’s love shattered his heart into a million pieces, he let her go to find her true happiness. Retracing his steps in their failed relationship, D’Ambrosio says in the letter that all he ever wanted in life was to fall in love, get married and settle down in a beautiful home with a little bundle of joy. ‘I guess it goes without saying that you made all of that feel real for me; you helped make most of those dreams come true,’ he writes. ‘I wanted nothing more than to be the best husband, a romantic lover, the most selfless provider, and one day, the world's best dad.’ Scroll down for video . Courting controversy: D'Ambrosio's letter, which lays bare his relationship and eventual breakup, has left readers deeply divided . Comparing their relationship to a trip to ‘Disney World,’ D’Ambrosio said that after a while their magical journey ‘in this theme park we call life’ came to an abrupt end. ‘You were gone,’ he writes. ‘Suddenly, everything that was so familiar about life felt so foreign. I was lost without you. All I had left were my memories and dreams of us that I knew would never come true.’ In the letter, D’Ambrosio says there are things he never had the opportunity to tell his ex-wife during their time together, like how much he loved the way she answered the phone. ‘You would say ""hey"" in this voice that sound so innocent and so loving. And it never changed. It always reminded me of the beginning of our relationship and all of the reasons I fell in love with you,’ he says. ‘Who would have thought something so simple could be so powerful? It's what made you unique.’ He also reminisces on how he used to look at his ex-wife and admire her, no matter how she looked at any given moment, losing himself in her ‘sass’ and smile. ‘Whatever flaws you believed you had, I loved — How you'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach; How you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them, nine times out of ten; how you'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous. Or how about how you hated to be on video? I noticed everything. But I loved it,’ he gushes. In the letter, D’Ambrosio looks back on memorable moments in their long relationship, like a Valendite’s Day in Atlantic City and the day he proposed marriage to her on the beach in Long Island, presenting her with a blue Tiffany box that had been sitting on his desk for three weeks in anticipation for the perfect moment. ‘It was one of the happiest moments of my life,’ he writes of the moment he got down on one knee in the sand and asked the question. ‘When I slipped that ring onto your finger, I was certain it would never come off.’ The couple got married June 10, 2012, after eight years of dating. Waxing nostalgic: D'Ambrosio goes through key moments in their relationship, including the day they met at age 18, a Valentine's Day in Atlantic city, the afternoon on the beach when he proposed and their wedding day . ‘My heart was filled with so many emotions, but I just wanted to hold your hand for the rest of my life,’ D’Ambrosio writes, reflecting on their wedding day. But then something changed, and D’Ambrosio writes that their lives ‘took different paths.’ ‘Our worlds need to fall apart, so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be,’ he says in the letter. ‘There's nothing more important to me than your happiness, and knowing you have that means the world to me.’ The New Jersey man writes that after their divorce, he threw himself into work, found a new passion for writing and has been busy piecing back together his life. While D’Ambrosio is currently single, he has not given up on love. ‘I still dream of having a family. I still dream of holding my own child. Of course, I still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness,’ he says. The 29-year-old recent divorcee makes a vow to never let hatred or anger taint his feelings towards his ex-wife and her family, whose high expectations he had failed to meet. D'Ambrosio, an aspiring writer, published the letter as part of Asbury Park Press' series on relationships . 'My heart shattered into a million pieces. Eventually, I realized I couldn't save us.' 'Our life together — it was like Disney World. We ran carefree in this theme park we call life. Holding each others' hands, we laughed, cried, loved, and we were in awe of everything we experienced. We were children with dreams, and together, we thought about the day when all of ours would come true. 'Eventually, though, those roller coasters stopped. 'The music died down, the lights shut off, and our magical journey came to an abrupt halt.' 'Whatever flaws you believed you had, I loved — How you'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach; How you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them, nine times out of ten; how you'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous. Or how about how you hated to be on video? I noticed everything. But I loved it.' 'Our worlds need to fall apart, so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be.' 'As for me? I'm happy. I've found peace. I am busier than ever with work, I found a new passion with writing, and I've been rebuilding a life that was once in a million pieces. I still dream of having a family. I still dream of holding my own child. Of course, I still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness.' 'I'll never hate you, and I'll never be dishonest about my emotions. God gave me this amazing opportunity to love. It brought me to so many beautiful places, taught me so much about life and gave me memories I'll cherish forever. How can I ever be angry about that?'

He concludes the letter by apologizing for anything he may have done to hurt his former paramour, with whom he had wanted to spend a lifetime. ‘If I knew then what I know now, I would have held you tighter during our first dance and picked a song that never ended,’ he writes touchingly. ‘While on paper I lost my wife, in reality I lost so much more. I lost a piece of me that I will never get back,’ he concludes. ‘Take good care of it.’ D'Ambrosio's deeply personal, emotionally honest love letter to his former spouse has left readers split. ‘As I read this I found myself within your story, feeling your joy, sadness, shattered life, hope and strength,’ Margie Santos wrote in the story's comments. In a column for Gawker, Leah Finnegan excoriated D’Ambrosio for writing the letter, calling it ‘not only a selfish move, but an aggressive one, with no regard for the ex's feelings. ‘Regardless, this column is not about the ex, it is about D'Ambrosio's pathetic narcissism.’ In an interview with USA Today following the publication of the letter, the 29-year-old Wall resident explained that he decided to pen the essay to find closure and clear the air betwee him and his ex after a period of animosity. He also insisted that the first-person account was not his attempt to get back together with his former spouse, who is with someone else now. ‘I found peace knowing that she's found her happiness and that one day I will find mine as well,’ he told the paper.","Anthony D'Ambrosio, 29, a resident of Wall, New Jersey, published essay as part of Asbury Park Press' series on relationships .

"A food distributor that provides produce to countless Asian restaurants throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest has been hit with a long list of disgusting health code violations. The New Yung Wah Trading Co. is a Brooklyn-based company with a warehouse in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, which the Food and Drug Administration paid a visit to in October. A letter sent to the company's owners earlier this month details the horrific scenes discovered at the warehouse including 'a rodent's nest with multiple rodents in a plastic-lined box in a cooler that had thawing rib meat on top of melons' and 'a pallet of pineapples in boxes gnawed on by rodents, an apparent nest they made and rodent feces'. The New Yung Wah Trading Co., which provides produce to Asian restaurants throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest, has been hit with a long list of disgusting health code violations . The letter, posted on the U.S Department of Health and Human Service's website, also detailed the presence of dead rodents, 'birds flying throughout the warehouse,' bags of MSG contaminated with rodent urine and feces, and 'workers smoking while handling food being prepared for distribution.' FDA inspectors also identified issues including 'puddles of standing water' due to a faulty drain and noted how rodent poison had been used in the warehouse without the correct precautions taken to keep it from contaminating food. 'This rodenticide was placed on plastic plates next to stored food products along the exterior walls of the facility,' the FDA said. The entire warehouse was so densely packed with bags of food, the FDA said, that those working there couldn't inspect for rodents. 'Pallets storing food products were stacked approximately two high and six to eight deep, covering an area of approximately 3000 square feet. The pallets were stacked directly against one another, which did not allow adequate spacing to inspect or observe possible rodent activity,' said the FDA. New Yung Wah's website states that it is 'currently under construction' and the company hasn't responded to the FDA's findings. Among the violations reported by the FDA was rodent feces, urine and nests in and around bags of monosodium glutamate (stock image) Among the findings in the inspection of the company's warehouse were: . The company sells meat/poultry, produce, frozen products, canned products, dry products, packaging/disposable products, seafood products, and noodles/skins. The list of restaurants which has recently receiving goods from New Yung Wah isn't know although it is believed to be extensive as the company served both wholesalers, retailers and restaurants throughout the East Coast. The company was founded in 1993 and is based in Brooklyn, New York with facilities located in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. This isn't New Yung Wah has been in trouble over issues of health code violations. Earlier this year, an Ohio-bound delivery truck with 150 pounds of spoiled food headed for Chinese and Japanese restaurants was intercepted by police. The fish, chicken and pork was allegedly at unsafe temperatures, between 58 degrees and 68 degrees, and dripping onto other food causing cross contamination, reports Daily Finance. The FDA's correspondence to the company also notes that while they received a letter from New Yung Wah in November stating that they had 'aggressively addressed' the violations, no proof has yet to be provided.

"A woman whose fiancee called off their wedding, just days before it was due to take place, destroyed her once-pristine dress by covering it in paint, glitter and feathers in celebration of her 'new beginning'. Despite her heartache following the shock split from her fiancee, Shelby Swink, from Memphis, Tennessee, was determined that she wouldn't 'that girl who everyone had to tiptoe round'. '[Six days before the ceremony], my ex-fiancé kind of sat me down and told me he was contemplating calling off the wedding,' the 23-year-old told Fox News. Fighting spirit: Shelby Swink, 23, refused to let heartbreak get the best of her and was determined to celebrate her new beginning in life . Pity party: The college graduate asked her bridesmaids to help her trash her dress using an array of brightly-colored feathers and paint . Happy family: Shelby was worried that her parents, who paid for her dress, would be against the idea of trashing it, but to her delight, they were thrilled . New beginnings: The jilted bride didn't want to be the girl that 'everybody was tiptoeing around' 'The next day came and he sat me down and was like, ""You know, I'm just not in love with you and I don't want to marry you, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with you."" '[But] I didn't want to be that girl that everybody was tiptoeing around.' So when her wedding photographer suggested that they organize a 'trash the dress' shoot - an increasingly popular ritual which sees jilted brides destroy their unused gowns by whatever means available - Shelby decided to embrace the idea head-on. 'First I thought it was crazy because it is an expensive dress and I didn't really want to ruin it,' Shelby said of the shoot - which was booked for November 1, which would have been her wedding day. '[But] I didn't want to just spend my would-be wedding day sitting at home alone eating ice cream and watching Netflix. 'I would rather be doing something fun with friends and family which is what we did.' 'When I got the phone call that the wedding was call off I was stunned of course,' photographer Elizabeth Hoard told Daily Mail Online. 'While it seemed like everything was 'over' I just knew that this couldn't be the end of my journey with Shelby. The Shelby I had gotten to know was a strong, unique woman with lots of spunk. 'I had wanted to offer the idea right then and there for her because I felt like it might be something good for her but thought it best to give her some time to think. Fun and games: The 'trash the dress' shoot took place on what would have been Shelby's wedding day . Like father, like daughter: Mr Swink brought along cigars and Champagne, so that the group could toast their unique celebration . The family that paints together... Both of Shelby's parents embraced the idea of the shoot with great enthusiasm . Paint party: Everyone couldn't wait to get stuck into the task of destroying Shelby's dress . 'Two days before what was supposed to be her wedding day, I was messaging with Shelby and asked her if she had thought about doing a trash the dress session.' And while Shelby didn't take to the idea straight away, Elizabeth was thrilled when she finally received her ultimate response. 'I could see her typing, and erasing, typing, and erasing and I was worried I had offended her or brought it up too soon,' the photographer added. 'But she replied and said something along the lines of: ""Heck yes!"" 'She had told me a couple others had mentioned it to her as well and at first she thought it was crazy but decided that it was the best thing for her to do.' Eager to ensure that the day didn't turn into a 'pity party', Shelby invited her bridesmaids and her parents to join her for the shoot, and even offered them the chance to help her destroy her dress. 'My mom is the one who paid for the dress, so I was nervous as to how she would react when I told her what I wanted to do with it,' Shelby told Buzzfeed. Smile for the camera: Shelby's wedding photographer Elizabeth Hoard was the mastermind behind the shoot . Artistic endeavor: Shelby donated her once-pristine wedding dress to a local bridal shop in Memphis . 'I'm free': The 23-year-old says that she feels no resentment towards her former fiancee . A worthy cause: The Barefoot Bride is donating a portion of the proceeds from each dress bought while it is on display to a local nonprofit organization . 'But both of [my parents] were 100% supportive and wanted to be there for me.' Indeed, far from being a sad occasion, Shelby's family and friends helped her to turn the shoot into a happy and celebratory event as they covered her and her dress in an array of glitter, paint and feathers; her dad even provided Champagne and cigars. 'I can’t even describe how liberating and cathartic the experience was for me,' Shelby explained to Buzzfeed. 'The moment the first bit of paint hit my dress I was free.' Photographer Elizabeth added: 'Shelby really is as amazing as it seems. 'While she trashed her dress she never once trashed talked her ex to me or anyone around me. It really was a celebration of a new life and a new direction.' Shelby's multicolored dress is now on display at a local Memphis bridal store, The Barefoot Bride, which is donating a portion of the proceeds from each dress bought while it is on display to a nonprofit organization called Be Free Revolution.","Shelby Swink, 23, was due to marry her boyfriend of four years in November, but he called off their wedding just days before the ceremony .

"Sales of $1 million homes are booming, even as overall sales have sputtered this year. It's further evidence of how the nearly six-year economic recovery has favored the wealthy. Those with epic stock portfolios, superb credit and cash to spare are snapping up estates, pied-a-terres and beachside cottages.

"A transgender teenager who committed suicide by walking in front of a tractor trailer in Ohio left a heartbreaking letter in which she blamed her religious parents. Leelah Alcorn, 17, died in the early hours of Sunday on highway I-71 in Warren County, Ohio, a few miles from her family home. The high school student left a poignant suicide note accusing her devout Christian parents of refusing to acknowledge her gender and forbidding her from transitioning. Scroll down to read Leelah's letter . Tragedy: Transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn left a poignant suicide note on her tumblr account, blaming her Christian parents' refusal to acknowledge her gender for her death . The suicide note was posted on Leelah's tumblr account through scheduled publishing just a few hours after her death. The note begins: 'If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.' Leelah, from Kings Mill, Ohio, writes that although she was born a boy, she began identifying as a girl at the age of four. 'When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. 'I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.' Leelah, 17, was born a boy called Joshua, but despite telling her parents at an early age that she was trans, they replied that she was 'wrong' and sent her to therapy . The 17-year-old high school student wrote in her suicide note that despite identifying as a girl from the age of four, her devout Christian parents refused to allow her to transition . Leelah goes on to reveal that her parents refused to allow her to transition and instead took her to 'Christian therapists' who told her that she was 'selfish and wrong'. 'I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. 'Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. 'They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.' 'On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.' Leelah then adds: 'I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. Local media and Leelah's former high school in Kings Mill have reported on the tragic news using her birth name Joshua. Leelah's mother Carla Wood Alcorn posted a tribute to her child on her Facebook, but referred to Leelah as her 'son', used her birth name, and made no mention of a suicide. The disregard for Leelah's wishes to be identified as a girl has angered many in the LGBT community, and a Facebook group calling for Justice for Leelah Alcorn has been set up. If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue. Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in. When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me. My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep. I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted. So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week. After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please. Goodbye, .

Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong. Worringly, the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 percent of students have been absent in December battling the illness. Spread: This map reveals the sweep of flu across the United States with almost the entire country reporting widespread flu . Indeed, 17-year-old Shannon Zwanziger, a senior at Owatonna High School died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu. Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week. Tragedy: Shannon Zwanziger passed away in early December after contracting the flu . Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away. Indeed, earlier in December the CDC admitted that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2, seen most commonly so far this year. That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly. 'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a news conferenceat the start of the month. CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. But it probably won't be as good as if the vaccine strain was a match. Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 percent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC. Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season. Ineffective: A man receives a free flu shot from a Walgreens employee during a free flu shot clinic at Allen Temple Baptist Church on December 19, 2014 in Oakland, California . Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter. The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. The three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 — were H3N2 seasons. In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said. But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said. An official with one vaccine manufacturer — GlaxoSmithKline — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain. 'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business.","Mutated strain of H3N2 virus has hospitalized 2,500 people nationwide .

"Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister who is a lesbian with a long-term partner who says she worries about the reality star’s chosen lifestyle. The relationship between Michelle’s sister and her partner has never been mentioned by the Duggars - who are quite open about their intolerance toward homosexuality - in their hit show. In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos, meanwhile oldest son Josh recently led an Arkansas rally protesting against gay marriage. Scroll down for video . Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister, Evelyn Ruark, right, who is a lesbian with a long-term partner . Michelle’s sibling Evelyn Ruark, 63 lives with Sharon Callahan, 52, in Cincinnati, Sharon’s mother Dolores told Radar. Just as the Duggars have issues with homosexuals so too Michelle’s family have concerns over her unusual lifestyle choices and extreme Christian beliefs. Speaking to The National Enquirer in 2010, Sharon described herself as a ‘significant other’ of Evelyn and revealed the couple’s concerns about the Duggar family’s ties to the Quiverfull movement. ‘We are worried about them,’ Sharon said. ‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’ Quiverfull is a movement among some conservative evangelical Protestant couples that promotes procreation, eschews all forms of birth control and sees children as a blessing from God. Evelyn featured in a early episode of the  reality show when the Duggar family had a get together with Michelle's siblings and her father. Sharon Callahan wasn't featured or even mentioned in the episode. Michelle’s sibling Evelyn Ruark, above, lives with her partner Sharon Callahan, 52, in Cincinnati, Ohio . Big love: The Duggar family is a part of an evangelical Christian movement that urges women to have as many children as God gives them . Ruark and her girlfriend aren’t the only members of the Duggar’s extended family whose lifestyle is at odds with their ultra-conservative family values. Susanna Keller, a sister of Josh Duggar’s wife Anna, is reported to have had a child outside of wedlock. Josh, the eldest Duggar son, moved from Arkansas to DC a year and a half ago to work for the conservative lobbying group the Family Research Council, where he is an Executive Director. The Duggars’ conservative Christian values and close-knit family has made 19 Kids and Counting one of TLC’s most successful shows. But accusations of gay ‘fear-mongering’ appeared to threaten the reality show’s future in November, when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by Michelle. In August the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation. Her voice was used in a robocall message sent to Fayetteville, Arkansas, residents that asked them to vote against the ordinance that would protect members of the gay and transgender communities. Fallout: The Duggar matriach and her husband Jim Bob could see their hit reality series axed if petition organizers get their way . Evelyn appeared in one episode of 19 Kids and Counting where Michelle visited her Ruark relatives, but for the most part she hasn’t been featured on the show . She said: 'I don’t believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.' The series had returned for ninth season in September. The political move prompted a petition on Change.org launched by Jim Wissick to axe the show after hearing Duggar's words that he said 'reek of ignorance and fear mongering.' He wrote on the petition page: 'Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist. The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred.' Supports of the Duggars have launched a rival petition to keep the show on TV, which raised over 12,000 votes. 'Many that may or may not agree with their personal beliefs, but this does not mean that they shouldn't be allowed their reality show or that they should be attacked for their personal beliefs,' the organizer wrote. Michelle was born the youngest of Garrett and Ethel Ruark’s seven children and she is pictured above, left, with five of them . Earlier this month Michelle's husband Jim Bob Duggar said he wasn’t worried about by the petition. 'They won't succeed,' the 49-year-old said. 'Our show is the number one show on TLC. It’s a small group creating this fuss. All it has done is give us more exposure.' He told The Pathway, an evangelical Christian publication run by the Missouri Baptist Convention, that they family gained 50,000 Facebook fans following the outcry. Michelle Ruark was born the youngest of Garrett and Ethel Ruark’s seven children; her five sisters and brother were named Pam, Evelyn, Carol, Freda, Kathie, and Garrett Jr. She was quite a bit younger than most of her siblings, and when the family relocated from Arkansas to Ohio in the early 80s, she stayed behind to marry Jim Bob. There have been rumors that the Ruarks, who are not strongly religious, don’t agree with Michelle and Jim Bob’s way of life. Evelyn has appeared in one episode of 19 Kids and Counting where Michelle visited her Ruark relatives, but for the most part she hasn’t been featured on the show .","Michelle Duggar's older sister Evelyn Ruark is a lesbian who is in a long term relationship with her partner Sharon Callahan .

"An AirAsia airliner has overshot the runway at an airport in the Philippines forcing passengers to make an urgent exit on emergency slides, it has been claimed. The incident occured at Kalibo Airport in Aklan province and involved an Airbus A320-216 carrying 153 passengers and crew from the Filipino capital Manila. Local journalist Jet Damazo-Santos was on board the plane and uploaded photographs to Twitter showing chaotic scenes as passengers were forced to disembark the aircraft on emergency slides. 'Engine was shut immediately, we were told to leave bags, deplane asap. Firetruck was waiting,' she said, adding that there appeared to be no injuries despite the plane coming to an 'abrupt stop'. The incident comes just hours after six bodies and wreckage were recovered from the sea off the Indonesian coast of Borneo Island following the disappearance of Air Asia flight 8501 on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Escape: Local journalist Jet Damazo-Santos was on board the plane and uploaded photographs to Twitter showing chaotic scenes as passengers were forced to disembark the aircraft on emergency slides . Care: Elderly patients were pictured having their blood pressure checked in the aftermath of the incident . Describing the terrifying incident, Ms Damazo-Santos said: 'Nobody seems to be hurt. Weather was bad because of #senangph [sic]. Plane came to a very abrupt stop.' Her mention of bad weather refers to tropical storm Seniang, which has been battering the Philippines for several days. She updated her Twitter account with a number of photographs taken in the aftermath of the incident, including images of elderly patients having their blood pressure checked and shoeless members of cabin standing on the runway, having removed their footwear to use the inflatable slide. Ms Damazo-Santos said that her flight had been delayed by two hours  after the poor weather at Kalibo Airport had earlier forced a plane from Cebu Pacific airlines to turn back to Manila. With all passengers said to be safe, Ms Damazo-Santos said they now face a long wait to reclaim their luggage as officials insist the plane is towed to a parking area before it can be unloaded. The journalist later wrote about her experience for the Filipino news website Rappler. In a statement AirAsia said: 'AirAsia Philippines confirms flight Z2 272 from Manila skidded off the Kalibo International Airport runway at 5:43PM upon landing. All 153 passengers and crew were able to disembark safely, no injuries reported.' 'All passengers are now at a hotel assisted by AirAsia staff,' they added.

Firefighters on the scene: The incident occured at Kalibo Airport in Aklan province and involved an Airbus A320-216 carrying 153 passengers and crew from the Filipino capital Manila . The incident comes just hours after six bodies were recovered from the Java Sea following the disappearance of AirAsia flight 8501 on Sunday. 162 people were on board the flight when it disappeared from radars 42 minutes into its flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore. Poor weather has been suggested a likely factor in that crash after it emerged the pilot requested to deviate from its flight plan and climb above bad weather. By the time permission to do so was granted, the plane had already vanished from radars. Officials have confirmed that bodies and debris found in Java Sea off Indonesia are from AirAsia flight 8501, and a naval spokesman said the rescuers remain 'very busy' retrieving the victims. Scores of bodies were discovered alongside luggage, a plane door and an emergency slide floating in the water 100 miles off the coast of Borneo Island earlier today after three days of searching. The recovery of six bodies came as devastated relatives of AirAsia crash victims collapsed in grief and were taken to hospital after an Indonesian television station showed disturbing uncensored footage of the corpses floating in the sea. Images shown on a news channel showed at least one body floating in the water, causing the victims' relatives - who were watching live reports at crisis-centre at Juanda International Airport in Surabaya - to burst into tears, with some fainting and requiring hospital treatment.","AirAsia passenger plane overshot Kalibo Airport in the Philippines .

"The father of the late star of the Fast and Furious franchise, Paul Walker, is reportedly suing the family of the man he died with, over $1.8 million of exotic cars he says his son owned. Walker died along with his friend, Roger Rodas, in November 2013, when a Porsche Carrera GT driven by Rodas skidded off the road at over 100mph and burst into flames. Walker, 40, and Rodas, were co-owners in the Always Evolving car shop in Valencia, and the actor was said to have amassed a collection of over 30 cars.

Walker, left, died in a fiery car crash with his friend and business partner, Roger Rodas, in November 2013 . Paul Walker Sr has reportedly demanded the return of $1.8 million worth of cars, or the cash equivalent, immediately, and that he has filed court papers seeking to resolve the issue, according to TMZ. According to the website Mr Walker Sr claims the estate of Rodas, is in possession of numerous vehicles belonging to his son. And that the cars were all fully or partially owned by him. Rodas' family are said to have already rejected the claim, which will now be resolved by a judge. Following Walker's death it was reported that his extensive car collection was to be sold-off in a sale arranged by Always Evolving and his estate. The sales and Walker's connection to the cars was not well publicised as it was thought the estate didn't want money off the back of the tragedy. Walker's collection was believed to include several late-model BMW's, Audis, Porches and a number of Ford Mustangs.

"Target is under fire from angry consumers over its use of predominantly white models to promote a new clothing line inspired by the recent remake of hit musical Annie, which is led by an African American actress. A Change.org petition issued by motivational speaker L'Sean Rinique Shelton, based in Bear, Delaware, calls for the retail giant to remove the 'disrespectful' in-store displays and apologize to the movie's 11-year-old star, Quvenzhané Wallis. 'In the current stench of racism and division amongst Americans, why would Target singlehandedly disrespect Quvenzhané Wallis and add more pain to injury as it relates to race relations?' poses Ms Shelton, a mother-of-three. Scroll down for video . Race controversy: Target's in-store ads star a white model (left) who is wearing the collection's main piece, the same red dress worn by Annie star Quvenzhané Wallis when the line was launched (right) 'Being African American is not ugly, it is not bad and we are sellable!' Ms Shelton states. The petition, which has gathered over 3,000 signatures in a matter of hours, concedes that Target's online ads do include 'one token black girl in random Annie gear.' The in-store displays, however, cast a Caucasian girl as the star model, who happens to be wearing the collection's main piece; the same $29.99 red dress worn by Quvenzhané at Target's collection launch. 'That special ""Red Dress"" is synonymous to Annie - not a random model that does not look like her!' Ms Shelton insists. Taking issue: The petition concedes that Target's online ads do include 'one token black girl in random Annie gear' (left) but that the in-store posters focus around white models . Flop: Annie, which was produced by Will Smith and Jay Z among others, was released on December 19 to a largely negative critical response . Original: The petition points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of Annie was released - starring the pale, freckled redhead child star Aileen Quinn (pictured) - its marketing centered around Aileen's aesthetic . Backlash: It also mentions the 'major uproar' from those who were against an African American being cast in the movie in the first place. Pictured, a Tweet from March after Quvenzhané landed the role . Negativity: In response to such reactions (pictured) the petition poses, 'Is the reason why Target maliciously hid Quvenzhané Wallis or refused to use an African American girl to depict Annie in their ads? Ms Shelton, herself a former actress raised in Queens, New York, points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of Annie was released - starring the pale, freckled redhead child star Aileen Quinn - 'everything was about Aileen Quinn or a character/person that emulated her.' She argues: 'Why does African American actors have to beg for respect, especially as it relates to advertising? [sic] . 'Despite most beliefs, African Americans are capable of portraying more than drug dealers, pimps, and other bastardized portrayals of our culture. 'Quvenzhané Wallis earned that role and we demand your respect.' Pictured: The petition's author, motivational speaker and former actress L'Sean Rinique Shelton . Lastly, the petition points to the 'major uproar' from those who were against an African American being cast in the movie in the first place. Indeed, after Quvenzhané landed the role and appeared in the trailer for the film last March, hordes of people took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. 'Black Annie...? No... Annie always will be always should be a ginger! #notracist just traditional', wrote one. 'So this #Annie movie is all wrong. I wanna live in a colorless world but I will not stand for a black Annie. #EnoughSaid', lamented another. Ms Shelton poses: 'Is the reason why Target maliciously hid Quvenzhané Wallis or refused to use an African American girl to depict Annie in their ads?'

'The new-look Annie hints at a progressive take on a well-worn story,' Rotten Tomatoes' consensus reads, 'but smothers its likable cast under clichés, cloying cuteness, and a distasteful materialism.' In a statement made to Daily Mail Online, Target representative Jessica Carlson declined to issue an apology, stating instead: 'We had conversations with [Quvenzhane Wallis'] team about being in the campaign, but ultimately it did not come to fruition. 'Fortunately, we had the pleasure of working with Ms. Wallis a number of times, including at a launch event in New York City in November. We had a great experience working with Ms. Wallis and appreciate her efforts in promoting this collection.' Ms Carlson added: 'With regard to the marketing of the collection, girls from a variety of backgrounds were featured within the campaign, reflecting that anyone can embody the spirit and character of Annie.'","Target launched a new kids clothing collection in August to coincide with the release of Annie, a film starring African American actress Quvenzhané Wallis .

"Circle lenses, a type of colored contacts imported from Asia that make the wearer look as though they have enlarged eyes, are set to be one of the New Year’s biggest beauty trends, having first risen to popularity four years ago. However, doctors have warned that the cosmetic lenses, which cover up the whites of the eyes in order to make the irises appear larger, can cause serious infection and even blindness.

"Powerful: At just 5ft 2ins Sarah King can lift objects up to three times her own weight . A petite mother-of-two from Essex has defied the odds to become a weightlifting superstar. Sarah King, 37, from Billericay, took up the sport seven years ago and has already broken records for lifting things three times her own body weight. At just 5ft 2ins and tipping the scales at 9st 10lb Ms King stunned doubters by deadlifting a whopping 29st. The busy mother-of-two juggles training with caring for her children and three jobs  - as a personal trainer, fitness instructor and PE teacher. But powerlifting remains her passion and she has claimed a host of awards, including a gold and bronze against the world's best at the World Powerlifting Championships in Miami. Despite her success, Ms King says people are still surprised when she tells them what she does. 'It proves you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,' she says. 'People often do a double-take when I tell them I'm a powerlifter but when they see the pictures of me on the podiums, then they believe me. 'People do label female powerlifters and assume they are really big and butch but that's not the case by any means.

Scroll down for video . 'At 37, I'm not the youngest woman at these contests. In fact, I'm often one of the oldest. So, combined with the fact I have only been doing this for a short while, I'm happy with the medals I've got so far.

Despite her incredible success, the size eight lifter has only been in training for seven years . At 37, Ms King is one of the oldest women to compete in the sport of powerlifting and can hoist 27 stone . She also eschewed traditional turkey and mince pies during the Christmas break in a bid to maintain her fitness. 'When I've let myself have a break on holiday in the past it's actually turned out to be detrimental because it takes double the amount of time to get back in shape again,' she said. 'But saying that, I do try to make myself have a break now and again. 'I worked out a few nights over Christmas where I allowed myself a couple of glasses of wine.

Treat: Ms King does occasionally treat herself to a glass or two of wine, including at Christmas . 'Because I so rarely drink any more, I've found two glasses of wine are more than enough for me anyway.' Ms King's powerlifting career began seven years ago, after she gave up a high-flying career in banking to become a personal trainer. 'I'd always been into health and fitness,' she said. 'As a youngster, I grew up playing netball, taking part in swimming galas and running marathons. 'As I got older I still carried on with them, so from that I decided to become a fitness instructor and I started spending more time at the gym.

"The former Korean Air executive involved in the infamous 'nut rage' incident earlier this month,  has been arrested in order to prevent her from leaving South Korea. Cho Hyun-Ah, the daughter of the Korean Air's chairman, has faced mounting public anger following the incident, which saw her force a flight to return to its gate in New York over a bag of nuts. Cho, 40, had become outraged  that the macadamia nuts had been  served in a bag and not in a bowl and demanded the removal of a senior flight attendant. Scroll down for video . Going nuts: An arrest warrant has been issued for Cho Hyun-ah, center, former vice president of Korean Air Lines, in order to prevent her from leaving South Korea . Prosecutors have yet to press criminal charges against Cho, but South Korean law allows authorities to arrest a suspect for up to six months over worries the person could flee or destroy evidence. Seoul Western District Court said such concerns were warranted. A separate arrest warrant for a current Korean Air executive, whose surname is Yeo, was also granted. Yeo is suspected of pressuring Korean Air employees to conceal the incident. The court said there were 'systematic attempts to cover up' Cho's actions 'since the beginning of the incident.' The Seoul Western Prosecutors' Office has said Cho would face several charges, including inflight violence and changing a flight route, which is prohibited under aviation law. Cho, 40, resigned earlier this month as vice president at Korean Air and from all her roles at the airline's affiliates. Cho Hyun-ah, center, former vice president of Korean Air Lines, is escorted by court officials as she leaves for Seoul Western District Prosecutors Office in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday . Cho Hyun-ah, 40, forced a Korean Air flight to return to its gate in New York to remove a senior flight attendant who had failed to serve her nuts the way she wanted . A passenger on the flight on December 5 told local media that Cho assaulted and threatened crew members. Park Chang-jin, the senior flight attendant who was kicked off, told the KBS television network that he was insulted and had to kneel before her because he didn't dare to challenge the chairman's daughter. Her behavior touched a nerve with South Koreans who are frustrated with family members who control mighty business groups known as chaebol that dominate Asia's fourth-largest economy. Cho and her two siblings quickly became executives at the airline and its affiliates. The family's direct stake in Korean Air is just ten per cent but cross-shareholdings among Hanjin companies give it effective control. South Korea's transport ministry has also faced criticism because ministry investigators probing the incident were said to be too cozy with company executives who tried to protect Cho. Most of the ministry's investigators formerly worked at the airline, South Korea's largest, raising questions about their fairness. Earlier this week, the ministry said it decided to punish four of its officials for misconduct during the investigation.

"A Washington couple's weekend hike took a terrifying turn when an avalanche nearly came crashing down on them. Colby Dotson and Ashley Bechard managed to outrun the fearsome cascade of snow and ice and take refuge in one of the caves that they had come to visit at Big Four Ice Caves in north central Washington state on Saturday. Mr Dotson filmed part of the harrowing escape on his phone as he watched tons of snow crashing down the mountainside. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Colb Dotson snagged this horrifying picture of an avalanche tumbling down an on ice cave as several other people try to flee . Colby Dotson (right) and Ashley Bechard (left) escaped the avalanche with their lives after they ignored warnings and trekked off the path at the Big Four Ice Caves in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest . 'It was like a huge cloud of dust coming down, and I turn around and Ashley was like 30 feet running already,' Dotson told KING-TV. Miss Bechard said she heard a thunderous noise like a jetliner flying close overhead and knew in an instant that it was an avalanche. 'No question in my mind, I just ran. I was like, ""that's an avalanche,"" and I ran,' she told the TV station. Mr Dotson and Miss Bechard took a weekend trip to the Big Four Ice Caves in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest on Saturday hoping for adventure. They got more than they expected.

No one was injured in the avalanche . They were a few feet from one of the ice caves when the avalanche struck and ran inside for shelter. From the safety of the cave, they watched in horror as a dozen people outside scrambled for their lives, too. 'I see headlamps. There was two or three kind of flickering in there, so I am terrified people are dying right now,' Ms Bechard said. Police later said that no one was injured. They only two people caught in the avalanche were Mr Dotson and Ms Bechard - who were able to dig themselves out when it was over.","Colby Dotson and Ashley Bechard were caught in an avalanche at Big Four Ice Caves in north-central Washington state .

"A New Hampshire man shot his wife dead in hospital early Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself, minutes after posting to Facebook that he was trying to help his sick spouse 'escape' from life on a respirator. The tragic murder-suicide occurred at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover about 6am, with staff finding the two bodies inside a room of the critical care unit. However, right before the shooting, Mark Lavoie, 50, posted a lengthy note online saying what he was doing was 'actually a double suicide', claiming that his wife, Katherine, 49, had long suffered from mental illness and recently ended up on life support, which she 'hated'. 'I am more than happy to sacrifice my life to fix my doing and join her spirit in a happier place,' the Lavoie wrote to his Facebook. 'Out of love': Mark Lavoie (left) posted to Facebook Tuesday morning that what he was about to do was a 'double suicide', because his wife Katherine (right) did not want to be confined to a respirator. He then walked into Wentworth-Douglass Hospital and shot his spouse, before killing himself . Tragic: This is the message Lavoie put up on his Facebook moments before killing his wife and then himself. He said he wanted people to understand his actions, and his sister said he acted 'out of love' Happier times: Lavoie's Facebook is full of photos of himself and wife Katherine . 'I just wanted (to) let people know my thoughts as to why I am doing this, weather (sic) you can understand it or not.' The names of the couple hadn't been confirmed by autorites Lavoie's sister, Dorcas Lavoie, told The Associated Press what her brother did was 'out of love'. The case has been turned over to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. 'We will look into everything. We do look at social media, and that is an aspect of any investigation,' assistant attorney general Jay McCormack told The Boston Globe. 'The investigation will be thorough and we will look at all possible avenues,' 'While the investigation is still in the early stages and ongoing, the two deaths appear to be the result of a murder-suicide.' Scene: The double shooting occurred at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover about 6am Tuesday . Life support: It is not know how Katherine wound up on a respirator, but her husband blamed himself, he said . Investigators have refused to comment on the Facebook post or say whether it is link to the murder-suicide. It remains unclear how 'Kathy' came to be on life support, but Lavoie said in his social media post that she has battled 'bi-polar demons that have been swirling around her brain since childhood'. The man said it was his fault that his spouse was on a respirator because he called 911, but did not elaborate. The Facebook post goes on to detail funeral arrangements and how to split his assets. 'Though a difficult subject I hope my family whom I love dearly can make some sense of what I'm doing though unless you have dealt directly with mental illness (it) will be difficult,' Lavoie wrote. 'Please don't mourn for me, my spirit will be in a much better place with my soul mate; you may even catch a glimpse of us from time to time.' As the status went up, worried friends begged Lavoie: 'Mark, please don't do this!' 'Soul mates': Lavoie asked friends not to mourn for him because he will be in a 'happier place' with his wife. The couple are seen here in an old Facebook photo . However it seems it was already too late, with the post going up moments before walked into the hospital. As the day went on other friends posted commiserations. One close friend, Charlene Wood, wrote to Facebook: I think Mark's choice was to not remain here without Kathy and face what would be criminal charges and he made sure he honored her wishes which was to not be in a vegetative state!!! Until our country can honor right to die laws, people will have to make very difficult choices to end their pain and suffering!!! He had such courage to carry out her wishes and put her life before his own....such honor and respect for his wife!!!!!!! Another friend, Kelly Lee Judson-Bacon, wrote: 'Mark- I have never understood suicide but I truly believe you are a courageous and honorable man. Kathy was such a sweet, charming woman. I hope you are both together and at peace. My thoughts and heart go out to your families. I will cherish the memories we had during our school years, the class reunions, etc. RIP, my friends.' Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, which has 178 beds, remained open following the shooting. The intake and treatment of patients was not interrupted by the incident, officials said. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will be conducting autopsies.

"She may have model looks but Sierra Blair-Coyle would rather than scale a sheer rock face than pose on the cover of a magazine. The 20-year-old daredevil from Scottsdale, Arizona, has beaten a debilitating back problem to become the two-time U.S. National Champion climber with a scholarship to study at Arizona State University. At one point Sierra wasn't sure if she'd be able to walk without pain but now she tackles boulders, caves and climbing walls in her quest to be the most successful climber on the planet.

Sierra, who has been climbing since the age of eight, has also practised deep water soloing - lone climbs over sea cliffs at high tide - on rock faces 55 feet above the ocean surrounding the Hawaiian island of Maui. 'I love being a young woman in climbing,' said Sierra. 'Hard work has been the biggest help to my climbing career. 'I train hard and dedicate my all to climbing. 'Women in climbing are awesome. We are confident, strong, beautiful, graceful and we can accomplish anything with hard work. 'Everyone is supportive, and the men in the sport are more like big brothers than anything.

"A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, the city's mayor sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides. Mayor Bill de Blasio was joined by Police Commissioner William Bratton on Tuesday afternoon at the Police Academy in Queens for the private meeting with union heads. De Blasio had requested the meeting with the heads of all five police unions following several displays of disrespect against him by officers in the wake of the shooting deaths of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. Scroll down for video . A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, Mayor de Blasio sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides . A rift between de Blasio and much of the NYPD's rank and file has widened recently following the two murders on December 20 and City Hall's response to protests over police conduct. Union leaders have blamed the mayor for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere and said it contributed to the officers' deaths. Present was one of the mayor's harshest critics Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association chief Pat Lynch whose son, Kevin, graduated from the academy on Monday. He has accused de Blasio of having 'blood on his hands' over the two deaths at the hands of Ismaaiyl Brinsley. The Democratic mayor was elected last year on promises of keeping crime low while reforming the NYPD. Meanwhile, police unions have been seeking new contracts. Another union leader, Captains Endowment Association President Roy Richter, has informed officers not to turn their backs on the mayor at the upcoming funeral of Officer Liu. Among the NYPD union leaders that de Blasio met with on Tuesday was Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association chief Pat Lynch, left, and Captains Endowment Association President Roy Richter, right . 'In this forum the appropriate protest is not a sign or turning away from mourners, or people the family has asked to speak, but rather cold, steely silence,' he wrote in a memo to his membership on Tuesday. Three days ago, dozens of police officers showed their disdain for de Blasio byturning their backs to a video monitor as the Mayor spoke at the funeral of Liu's partner, Rafael Ramos. Richter says there can be no repeat of this at Liu's wake and funeral this weekend, reports the New York Daily News. 'In the coming days and weeks you will be looked upon by many for guidance, leadership and advice at a time when many of our peers and officers under our care are deeply angry,' he wrote. 'Unfortunately, but understandably, this anger provided visual displays of back-turning at the funeral of Police Officer Ramos that caused pain for his loved ones.' NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department . De Blasio angered police by expressing sympathy for protesters demonstrating against a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to prosecute a white cop for killing Eric Garner with a chokehold. NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department. An unnamed supervisor told the New York Post on Monday that his officers are writing significantly fewer summonses and 'probably only making arrests when they have to - like when a store catches a shoplifter.' 'I'm not writing any summonses. Do you think I'm going to stand there so someone can shoot me or hit me in the head with an ax?' one cop told the Post. 'I'm concerned about my safety. I want to go to home to my wife and kids.' A union mandate requiring that two patrol cars respond to all police calls – introduced following the shootings of Officers Ramos and Liu – has also contributed to slower response times to non-emergencies. The PBA's directive is creating a manpower shortage that is delaying response times to crimes such as burglaries and car crashes to as much as four hours, according to the paper. Mayor de Blasio was booed on Monday by the newest members of the NYPD as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony. Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops. Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York . At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!' Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers. On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold. At least one of the new NYPD academy graduate shouted 'traitor!' as the mayor took the podium in front of 884 newly minted cops . Tense: The Mayor (left) and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton (second from left) stood on stage with police union president Patrick Lunch (second from right) - who has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' Thousands of friends and family members filled Madison Square Garden - along with the nearly 900 recruits . In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD. Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.' City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.","The mayor sat down with union heads on Tuesday in a bid to clear the air between the two sides .

Shortly after his second Masters win, Watson spoke to USA TODAY Sports about the process of adoption, adding that he was trying 'every day... to get better as a father and husband'.

"Along with selfie and twerking, contouring was one of 2014's buzzwords - and it's all thanks to Kim Kardashian. The selfie-loving beauty buff well and truly put contouring - a laborious method of applying your make-up to enhance your features - on the map. But is it possible to get Kim's flawless look without a professional make-up artist and hours of brush strokes? FEMAIL was keen to find out. Scroll down for video . Get the look: Kim Kardashian achieves that flawless look with a little help of contouring - a laborious method of applying your make-up to enhance your features. As Rodial launch the first-ever make-up range designed specifically for contouring, FEMAIL attempted to emulate their favourite stars . Rodial - the beauty brand fronted by Daisy Lowe - this year launched the first-ever contouring range of make-up. From the £52 illuminating powder to the £34 eye sculpt, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face. The brand's team of experts are also on hand at the UK's debut sculpting bar in Harvey Nichols, London, to help you create a flawless A-list look. Ahead of party season, three FEMAIL writers attempted to emulate their favourite contoured celebrities using the innovative new products. So how did they get on? Before and after: Caroline McGuire, 30, was a little unnerved at the amount of make-up on her face but she did get quite a few compliments about her appearance from friends who saw her look in party pictures . Caroline McGuire, 30, has never been an avid make-up user; she had never even used a brow pencil before. She loved brand ambassador Daisy Lowe's sculpted look though, so decided to test it out for herself with the help of the sculpting team. Speaking ahead of her makeover, Caroline said: 'I don't tend to wear a lot of make-up. Daily I use touche eclat, mascara, eye pencil and blusher, then for a party look I just add some bright red lipstick. 'But I was willing to put up with multiple layers of slap if it magically transformed me into Daisy Lowe.' Also keen to give the product range a run for its money was Luisa Metcalfe, 37. She said: 'I'm fascinated by the way celebrities like Millie Mackintosh and Kim Kardashian create the illusion of more prominent cheekbones, a straighter nose and bigger eyes through make-up techniques alone. 'I wear make-up regularly but only  Giorgio Armani BB cream, Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge on my cheeks, L'Oreal mascara and some tinted lip balm. 'With a Christmas party to go to, I was more than willing to give contouring a try - especially if there was a chance it would give me Millie Mackintosh's bone structure for the night.' Bianca London, 25, already wears a fair amount of make-up so wasn't expecting staggering results. She was, however, keen to learn how to contour and apply her make-up more naturally, without the dreaded orange face, white neck scenario that her brother so kindly always points out. The team used their arsenal of products to transform the writers. So how does the range, which comes with big claims, work? Watch out, Millie Mackintosh! Luisa Metcalfe said she wanted to see if Rodial's contouring make-up could give her the illusion of cheekbones and a bronzed glow, like Millie Mackintosh who favours the brand . The powders are opalescent, which is apparently designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam, and the universal Champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin. The powders have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently give the skin a silky texture and ensures even application. The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can help enhance features as well as be built up to create a more contoured look. There's also a £24 tinted cream that is filled with hyaluronic acid, which promises to plump skin. Caroline McGuire was impressed, if a little scared of her final look. She said: 'I got a bit of a shock when I looked in the mirror, there was such an extreme amount of make-up on my face and I did actually rub off some of the shading on my cheekbones. 'It was way too much for me to feel comfortable and I was very aware of it throughout the evening, but saying that, about five of my friends got in contact to say how good I looked in Facebook pictures the next day. 'So it did work - but mainly if you're the kind of person who cares more about what you look like in pictures than in real life. 'It clearly did something though, because looking at my ""after"" photo, I am posing like a total diva.' Luisa was equally impressed. 'I could feel the make-up artist applying a serious amount of product to my face and eyes but I was still surprised to see how bronzed and smoky-eyed I looked in the mirror. 'In the atmospheric lighting at my bash, I received a lot of compliments but under the harsh lights of the ladies' loo, my orange cheeks gave me flashbacks to the ""you've been tangoed"" ads from the Nineties. 'However, I loved my eyes and would never have dared to take my make-up so far on my own. Plus in photographs my usually pasty face appeared to have more  colour and definition. No wonder celebrities swear by the stuff on the red carpet.' Bianca didn't notice a huge difference from her normal daytime look but was impressed by the long-lasting formulations and liked the colour it gave her face. Get the look: The powders, as tested by Bianca London, have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently gives the skin a silky texture and ensures even application . Prep skin with a device such as the Silk’n Reju, which promises to instantly revitalise the skin by boosting the collagen levels, creating a fresh plumped base, for expert contouring. Gently massage  primer into the skin, this cooling gel will relax and reduce redness, plump the skin and diffuse fine lines, leaving a radiant finish on the skin. This will help protect your skin and hold your make-up. To even skin tone and add luminosity apply your Rodial Instaglam tint. Buff into the skin using your foundation brush for even, natural and polished coverage. Take your retouch pen and use to brighten and lift shadow from around the eyes and diffuse fine lines, use the brush to dot straight from the pen into crows' feet, deep frown lines, the folds around the mouth and blend gently with your finger to lift shadow. Use a highlighter to create instant definition and accentuate features, dot, and blend along the cheekbones to define, the inner corner of the eye to wake up and open the eyes, the brow bone to give an instant brow lift effect and the bridge of the nose and cupids bow to highlight and define. To create natural structure and sculpt your face shape, simply take your contour brush and Rodial deluxe contour powder, and sweep under the cheekbone to create a natural shadow and strengthen your natural structure, to find exactly where to place this, suck in your cheeks to discover where the natural shadow forms. Contour down the sides of the nose to slim and under the tip to shorten. Accentuate cheekbones and add radiance with your an illuminating powder, sweep across the collar bone with your powder brush to define and add a candlelit sheen. Add a natural sun-kissed warmth to the skin by applying bronzing powder with your powder brush to the forehead, temples, cheekbones, tip of the nose and chest for and even, enhanced glow, add that perfect healthy pinched cheek by gently blending the hyaluronic cheek sculpt gently into the apples of your cheeks. Define your eyes and brows using the eye sculpt with the eye smudge brush. Sweep it onto the lid and blend with your little finger into your socket line (you can find this by simply opening your eyes and finding the natural crease above the eyeball).

"A woman who weighed 300lbs has managed to drop more than half her weight, despite suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a severe blood-clotting condition. Sasha George, a 42-year-old artist and mother of two in Orange County, California, was diagnosed with the debilitating condition in 2002 while pregnant with her second child. 'I kept getting the clots and having surgery to annihilate them, only to have them come back,' she recalls in a blog post on The Huffington Post, adding that she weighed 300lbs by the time her son was born.

Half her size: Sasha George, a 42-year-old artist and mother of two in Orange County, California, dropped 153lbs despite suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a severe blood-clotting condition . Weighty matter: Though once skinny, she weighed 300lbs by the time her son was born . 'My legs were so swollen, which kept me from doing any activities. I'd watch as my husband took the children to all their school events and outings,' she said. 'It only took five minutes if I stood before my damaged leg reminded me I was chained to the problem. I knew then I couldn't get a job; I'd be a liability.' Ms George had always been skinny in her youth, but began to struggle with her weight in 1992 when a full-fusion spinal surgery for scoliosis left her bed-ridden for nearly a year, and when she gave birth to her first child in 1993. Slimmed-down selfie: Despite being confined to her chair for long periods of time, she began using leg weights to lift her feet off the floor and lifting books to give her arms a workout . Prior to her DVT diagnosis she weighed 170lbs and still considered herself in good shape. But as her health problems worsened, and she began to have trouble breathing, she became determined to find a way to get fit. 'The reality that I could be taken from this world awakened my survival instinct,' she wrote. 'The doctors told me I had to make the decision to live or let my condition win.' Despite being confined to her chair for long periods of time, she began using leg weights to lift her feet off the floor and lifting books to give her arms a workout. She squeezed her ab muscles in for ten seconds at a time, and within a few months was taking short walks down her driveway and back. Healthy eating: She also modified her diet, avoiding dairy and focusing on fruits and vegetables . Breakthrough: 'The reality that I could be taken from this world awakened my survival instinct,' she wrote. 'The doctors told me I had to make the decision to live or let my condition win' She modified her diet, avoiding dairy and focusing on fruits and vegetables. She was also forced to reduce her intake of vitamin K, which makes blood thicken. Ms George is now able to run for an entire hour, having shed a whopping 153lbs. 'I do anything to at least keep my body feeling it is challenged,' she wrote. 'My goal is 130lbs, and I'm going to do everything in my power to keep the weight off.' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000-600,000 people are diagnosed with DVT each year in the United States, and 60,000-100,000 die from the condition.

"The daughter of the Deep Throat film distributor has revealed what it was like growing up with the man who introduced Linda Lovelace to the world .

But in interviews to promote her book, The Pornographer's Daughter, she says her childhood was not really affected by her father's career. Scroll down for video . Kristin Battista-Frazee is the daughter of Anthony Battista, who distributed the 1972 hardcore porn film Deep Throat (both pictured) A scene from the film that made the name of Linda Lovelace famous around the world - Deep Throat . 'My parents were like any other parents, they lived a pretty ... I say normally dysfunctional life, because eventually my parents did get divorced as so many parents did in the 1980s,' she told the Orlando Sentinel. 'But my parents had the same concerns as any other parents. I felt like when I was living in my home, I didn't grow up any faster.' 'People have this idea that I grew up watching adult films and hung out with strippers and stuff like that, but that's so wrong.' Battista-Frazee, a marketing consultant in Washington, D.C, says her father simply saw the film as a way to make money for his family. Kristin Battista-Frazee with her father. 'People have this idea that I grew up watching adult films and hung out with strippers and stuff like that, but that's so wrong,' she says . The family together at the beach. 'My mom was open-minded and never had a problem with pornography,' she told the Sun Sentinel' But in an interview to promote her book The Pornographer's Daughter (right) Kristin Battista-Frazee(left) says her life was not really affected by her father's career . He was a W.E. Hutton stockbroker in Philadelphia, but began distributing the film as a side job. Completed in less than a week, with all interior shots filmed in the same cheap Florida hotel room, the 61-minute Deep Throat cost $30,000 to make but earned an estimated $600 million - making it the most lucrative film ever made. Opening in a single New York fleapit cinema, a few enthusiastic reviews and talk of ‘porno chic’ soon led to the film being a popular topic of conversation at the city’s more fashionable dinner parties. An attempted official clampdown only fuelled the frenzy to see it. Celebrities including Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Truman Capote joined the queue, and Frank Sinatra held private screenings in his home for guests who reportedly included Sammy Davis Jr and Vice President Spiro Agnew. An estimated ten million Americans saw the film as the Mafia distributed it around the country, burning down cinemas when owners refused to hand over half their takings. Amanda Seyfried stars as Linda Lovelace, left, and James Franco as Hugh Hefner in the film 'Lovelace' Appalled, the Nixon administration prosecuted the film’s makers for obscenity - including Battista - which the 44-year-old mother does admit affected her family life. 'My mom was open-minded and never had a problem with pornography,' she told the Sun Sentinel. 'But it was a rough road when the ""Deep Throat"" trials started. She feared my father would go to jail and wondered, ""How am I going to survive this?"" Her mother attempted suicide and her mental health declined. Her father went on to open a string of sex shops. Battista-Frazee told the newspaper that she only just watched the film this year, saying: 'I actually didn't see it until this year, in September. I thought, ""Well, I need to sit down and finally watch this."" My first thought was that it didn't seem like such a big deal. It's not the best-made movie, but you have to give it credit for a catchy plot.' Linda Lovelace - real name Linda Boreman - later told an official inquiry into the sex industry in 1986: ‘When you see the movie Deep Throat, you are watching me being raped,’ she baldly told an official inquiry into the sex industry in 1986. ‘It is a crime that movie is still showing. There was a gun to my head the entire time.’ But in an interview with Vice, Battista-Frazee said: 'I have talked to my father, and he didn’t believe she was forced. 'The gun to her head—I had heard from Eric Danville, author of The Complete Linda Lovelace—was figurative. It didn’t actually happen—that whole story got blown up into a myth. 'She was in an abusive relationship, though—that is true—and her husband, Chuck, was an awful person.'","Kristin Battista-Frazee is the daughter of Anthony Battista, who distributed the 1972 hardcore porn film .

"The so-called Islamic State's all-female police unit tortured a breastfeeding mother by clamping her chest with a barbaric spiked clamp, it is claimed. The al-Khansa brigade, the female religious police in Raqqa, the insurgency's de facto capital in Syria, is said to use the bear trap-like device to punish women who defy their strict laws. Opposition media group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently claim that in one case it was used on a 24-year-old woman who was arrested while breastfeeding her baby in the city centre. Scroll down for video . Police force: Dozens of Britons are understood to have joined the Al-Khansa Brigade in ISIS' Syrian de facto capital Raqqa, helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes . The woman, given the name Batol to conceal her true identity, was quoted as saying: 'I was in the market buying a few items when Khansa battalion came and arrested me on the grounds that the niqab [Islamic face covering] which I was wearing does not meet Sharia requirement because it was transparent[.] . '[T]hey took me to the ""Hesba"" headquarters in the city, and escorted me to the torture chamber, then they asked me to choose between a whip or a ""biter""[.] . 'I did not know what a ""biter"" was and I thought it is a reduced sentence, I was afraid of whipping, so I choose the ""biter"", then they brought a sharp object that has a a lot of teeth and held me, placing it on my chest and pressing it strongly, I screamed from pain and I was badly injured. They later took me to the hospital. 'I felt then that my femininity has been destroyed completely, we no longer afford to live this way, I was not the only one that was tortured with this instrument, there were a lot of women in the headquarters and their situation was tragic.' Raqqa's al-Khansa brigade has achieved notoriety in recent months after dozens of British women who have travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings, punishment lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of Yazidi sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. Britons including privately-educated Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood, 20, and Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, are understood to have joined, helping to patrol Raqqa with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes. The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. Armed and dangerous: Members of the Al-Khansa Brigade are reportedly paid a monthly salary of £100 and, thanks to them wearing full niqabs covering every inch of skin, operate quite literally under cover . Iraqi security forces and pro-government militias recaptured large parts of the Islamic State-controlled town of Dhuluiya north of Baghdad on Monday, police and army sources said. The assault, which began on Sunday and ran into the next day, enabled militia fighters and Iraqi army and federal police to break the militants' siege of the town 45 miles north of Baghdad. Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back Islamic State since it swept through mainly Sunni Muslim provinces of northern Iraq in June, meeting virtually no resistance. 'Iraqi security forces backed by volunteers (militias) are controlling central parts of Dhuluiya where the government offices are located,' said Khalaf Hammad, a police captain from Dhuluiya. 'Now Islamic State fighters are trapped in small areas in the town's north-west.' While Batol's story could not be verified, it does fit with other stories of the behaviour of al-Khansa extremists, who are among the Islamic State's most feared members in the areas the insurgency controls. In September Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi, a member of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, told VICE News: 'The most difficult thing for us, is the al-Khansa Brigade... 'I don't know who's from al-Khansa and who isn't. So when I get out my cell phone and I am taking photos of the city I don't know if any of them are looking at me or not.' 'If you are taking photos and one of the women from al-Khansa is looking at you, they will catch you immediately, and you'll be executed immediately. This is a big problem for us,' he added. Mr Raqqawi described how the majority of women in al-Khansa are foreigners 'from the UK, from the U.S, Dutch, Chechen.' He added that even though many of them can only speak a few words of Arabic, their reputation is such that men and women alike fear their presence. Guns and children: In September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa . A man also told activists that he was flogged and thrown in a cell for nothing more than smoking a cigarette, another vice now banned under the Islamic State's hardline regime. Sami, 25, was quoted as saying: 'ISIS's Hesba bureau arrested me on charges of smoking and they took me to their headquarters and then put me to the torture chamber[.] . '[T]he room floor was full of blood, and then they flogged me 40 times and threw me in a cell, there were a lot of detainees, when I looked at them I saw death in their eyes and their situation was pitiful[.] . '[D]uring the three nights I spent at the headquarters, I heard the screams of women and men who ISIS was torturing. '[T]o hear the screams of the people of my city when they are being tortured at the hands of strangers is a torture of another type, which has destroyed my dignity.

Walmart responded to the tragic shooting in a statement issued yesterday afternoon by spokesman Aaron Mullins. It read: 'A very sad incident occurred at our store today involving the death of a female customer. 'We are fully cooperating with the Kootenai County Sheriff's deputies as they investigate this matter.' Idaho National Laboratory senior chemical engineer, Vince Maio worked with Ms Rutledge on a research paper about using glass ceramic to store nuclear waste, according to the Spokesman-Review.

"From being diagnosed with Crohn's disease  to her break-up with Joey Essex, 2014 hasn't been the best year for Sam Faiers. The former TOWIE star's professional life is, however, booming. As well as launching her Very clothing line, an eyelash range and a debut fragrance, the reality TV personality is getting set to venture into the fitness world. Sam, 23, has launched an exclusive website, Celebrity Training with Sam Faiers, packed full of tutorials, advice and tips she says will help you maximise your workout and achieve a healthy, strong and feminine dream body. Scroll down for video . Sam Faiers, 23, has launched health and fitness website Celebrity Training with Sam Faiers . Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest venture, the businesswoman said: 'I have wanted to step into the world of health and fitness for a while now, as it’s a big passion of mine. 'When I lost a lot of weight from my Crohn’s disease, I wanted to make a change and make sure that I was healthy, fit and feminine. 'My motivation is to show that you can keep your body in a healthy and strong place. This is far more important than what size you are. It’s about how you feel.' Sam isn't the first star of The Only Way Is Essex to launch a fitness project - her friend Lucy Mecklenburgh also has her own online fitness channel. 'Celebrity Training is innovative and different because you can do it at home, work or travelling so can you use it on your smartphone or tablet,' said Sam. 'It's also completely bespoke to you; it has target graphs and you can upload pictures of your improvement. 'I’ve been working with personal trainer Nicole Attrill to make regular workouts for the website so the content is always fresh.' TOWIE star Sam said that she always wanted to step into the world of fitness and when she lost  weight from the Crohn's disease diagnosed earlier this year, her priority was remaining healthy, fit and feminine . Sam and personal trainer Nicole Attrill demonstrate the exercise tutorials which are then posted online . Sam is so convinced by the power of her programme that she uses it three times a week on her phone or iPad when she's travelling for work. She starts  with the warm up, Get Started,  and finishes with Cool Down. Then she alternates between the weights-based Get Strong routine and Get Focused, which includes targeted body exercises. Diet-wise, she starts the day with an acai berry smoothie, has a sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch and a superfood kale and mushroom frittata for dinner. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 115,000 Britons. Its symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue. 'I also eat a lot of chicken for lunch and dinner and porridge as well for breakfast,' she added. 'With my Crohn’s I have to be careful with what I eat and Celebrity Training has a great healthy eating expert, Sophie Bradshaw, who recommends the best in healthy home cooking.' Although she is following a healthy and sensible diet and exercise regime, Sam admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother. 'I think it’s because there were cameras everywhere  so there was nowhere to hide when it comes to your body,' she said candidly. She continued: 'I would say my Crohn’s was a wake-up call, I want to look healthy and not a bag of bones. I couldn’t help it as I was unwell but I wanted to look healthy, fit and feminine and thanks to Celebrity Training I’m so confident with my body now. 'I would say that you should feel confident at any weight or size as beauty is skin deep. I’ve struggled in the past to feel confident - I’ve either been bigger than I wanted to be or too thin. 'Nowadays I don’t stress about being skinny, I just want to be in a healthy and happy place.' Sam, pictured, left, earlier this year and, right, in 2011, admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother because of all of the cameras in the house . Sam's plight didn't come without criticism and she came under attack on social media from people who said she was only skinny because she has Crohn's. In response to those messages, Sam said: 'It's well-known that I found out I have Crohn's earlier this year. Before I got into exercising it was important for me to healthily put some of the weight back on that I'd lost. 'When I felt ready and was at that point I began moderately training to build and tone my body. It's unfair for people to say I'm skinny because of Crohn's, you don't get abs and definition through Crohn's, it's through working out, healthy eating and my programme I have devised.' The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'. And it seems Sam is aiming for the same level of success as the stars. 'I have a new collection coming out from my range with Very and I will be doing a launch for my lash range, Lashes by Samantha.'

"The number of law enforcement officers killed by firearms jumped by 56 percent this year and included 15 ambush deaths. But gun-related police deaths still remain far below historic highs and lower than the average annual figures in the past decade, according to a report released Tuesday. The annual report by the nonprofit National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found that 50 officers were killed by guns this year. That's far higher than the 32 such deaths last year but the same as 2012 figures. In 2011, 73 officers were killed in gunfire, the most in any year in the past decade. The average since 2004 is 55 police deaths annually. Scroll down for video . Memorial: A rose is placed at the wall with the names of fallen police officers at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington during the National Police Week (May 2013 file photo) In all, the report found that 126 federal, local, tribal and territorial officers were killed in the line of duty in 2014. That's a 24 percent jump from last year's 102 on-duty deaths, though below the average annual figures since 2004 and the all-time high of 156 in 1973, said Steve Groeninger, a spokesman for the memorial fund. Of the 126 officer deaths this year, shootings were the leading cause, followed by traffic-related fatalities, at 49. The report said that 'Handguns were the leading type of firearm used in fatal shootings of law enforcement officers in 2014. Of the 50 firearms-related fatalities, 68 percent, or 34 officers, were shot and killed with a handgun.' This year's increase in gun-related deaths among officers followed a dramatic dip in 2013, when the figure fell to levels not seen since the 19th century. This year's uptick comes amid increased tension between police and the public following the high-profile deaths of unarmed black men by white police officers, including that of Eric Garner in New York and Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The states that saw the most officer deaths were California, at 14, Texas, at 11, and New York, at nine. Florida followed with six deaths, and Georgia had five, according to the report. The 15 ambush assaults on police officers this year compares to just five in 2013, but matched 2012 for the highest total since 1995, the report said. The report also revealed that for the shooting deaths 'Nine officers were killed during disturbance calls. Eight officers were shot and killed during a traffic stop or pursuit and seven officers were killed while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances in 2014.' Incidents: Of the 126 officer deaths this year, shootings were the leading cause, followed by traffic-related fatalities, at 49 (file photo) 'With the increasing number of ambush-style attacks against our officers, I am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in America is influencing weak-minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws,' said Craig Floyd, chairman and CEO of the memorial fund. He added in his statement: 'We need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness.' Among the ambush assaults were the fatal attacks on two police officers in New York City on Dec. 20. Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were gunned down in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley after Brinsley had made threatening posts online and references to the Garner and Brown cases. After shooting the officers, Brinsley ran into a subway station and killed himself. Police said he was troubled and had shot and wounded an ex-girlfriend in Baltimore earlier that day. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund report also said of the officers' personal information that 'Three of the fallen officers were female. The average age of a fallen officer was 41, with an average of 12 years of service. Each officer left behind two children on average.'","The number of law enforcement officers killed by firearms jumped by 56 percent this year and included 15 ambush deaths, according to a new report .

The pair married in her hometown of Barranquilla, Colombia, in 1991 when she was just 18 and MailOnline has unearthed exclusive photographs of the nuptials. The brunette beauty wore a dramatic long-sleeve cream gown that featured elaborate pearl beading, gloves, a matching head piece and long veil. Scroll down for video . Here comes the bride! Sofia Vergara walking down the aisle with her father Julio at her first wedding in Barranquilla, Colombia, in 1991 at just 18 years of age . Young love: The star married her childhood sweetheart Joe Gonzalez . Her hair was pulled back and she wore heavy make-up including lashings of red lipstick. Sofia was a fledgling model at the time, having been scouted by an agency while on a Colombian beach at 17. She is seen walking down the aisle with her proud father Julio Enrique Vergara Robayo, who worked in the meat industry. (Her mother Margarita was a homemaker.) She shared romantic kisses with her new husband in the snaps and toasted their marriage with a glass of champagne at the reception. Forever young: The actress pictured with her son Manolo, who is now 22, doesn't seem to have aged a day since her teen wedding 24 years ago . Cheers to us: The couple welcomed a son Manolo a year after getting married . The bride wore white... and lots of sparkles: Sofia's gown was quite elaborate and dramatic . Beauty: Sofia's good looks were first spotted by a modeling scout on a Colombian beach a year before this wedding . The couple welcomed a son, Manolo, a year after saying 'I do' but split in 1993 shortly after his birth. Sofia was briefly linked to Tom Cruise in 2005 after finding success in the US. She was engaged to her on-again off-again beau Nick Loeb for several years but the pair never married. The relationship was called off for good in May 2014 and she started dating Joe just two months later. The Magic Mike actor proposed to the Modern Family actress in Kauai over Christmas. Celebration: The happy couple beamed with joy at their reception . Short lived: The couple split in 1993 just two years after saying 'I do' He was 'genuinely nervous', according to source, and didn't want to pop the question in a public setting at the St. Regis Hotel in Princeville just in case she said no. An insider told People: 'He said he wanted to keep it private just in case she didn't say yes. It actually didn't seem like he was joking about that. He did seem genuinely nervous that maybe this wasn't going to go well. He said this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with a one-in-a-million woman.' The 38-year-old heartthrob spent weeks planning how he would ask the 42-year-old beauty to be his wife and got down on bended knee at sunset in the palatial suite at the five-star hotel in Hawaii. Yes! Sofia flashing her new engagement ring while on holiday with Joe Manganiello in Hawaii this week . The insider added: 'This wasn't spontaneous. Joe definitely planned ahead and contacted the hotel weeks in advance to discuss certain things he wanted to do. 'He didn't want to propose in a public setting, even though there are so many beautiful spots on the hotel grounds that have spectacular views and are well-known as places where people pop the question. But Joe said he didn't want to risk anyone walking by and witnessing it, and he didn't want to tip off Sofia by having security there shooing people away.' The couple immediately toasted their engagement with champagne and 'desserts were sent later on.'","Teen bride married Joe Gonzalez in Barranquilla, Colombia in 1991 .

"When it comes to child tantrums, this is a serious flip out. A 10-year-old boy has been filmed going completely berserk in a Florida Dollar General, leaving behind a trail of destruction in each aisle as shocked onlookers stand back and watch. A video of the December 9 incident - uploaded to YouTube Monday - comes to a head when the kid threatens to hit a customer, screaming: 'I'm not afraid to do it!' At that moment a man - believed to be a store employee - sweeps up the problem child and carries him out front by the collar of his shirt. Destruction: A video has emerged of a 10-year-old going completely berserk in a Dollar General store in Tallahassee, Florida, on December 9, which was uploaded to YouTube on Monday . Out-of-control: The child is alone in the shop and moves aisle-to-aisle emptying shelves . Dangerous: At one point the troublesome kid threatens to hit a customer that steps in (right) So bad was the child's fury that the store called 911, according to The Smoking Gun. It is not known whether the 'black male juvenile' was arrested. The store would not comment on the incident when contacted by The Mail Online. However the video quickly spawned a wave of shocked complaints. It quickly became one of the top-voted posts on Reddit. 'That kid’s behavior is a call for help,' one Reddit user commented. 'If I worked there, or if I was a cop, i’d pick him up, and have him sit in on my lap in a kind of friendly forced hug and I’d say “i won’t let you go until you promise to tell me what’s wrong. I know something is up, but I need you to tell me.” (If you are a cop, then you probably don’t need to hold him, talk is enough.) Another added: 'This shows how spoilt children are today. Think about it. Can you honestly say this would've happened in the 80's? No, because kids actually had respect in those days.' Other users also agreed that the boy's parents have alot to answer for. He appeared to be alone in the store. 'Yeah, I’m imagining incredible abuse at home. This isn’t a kid who has parents who tuck him in and read to him every night,' one person wrote. It was not immediately clear where the incident was filmed. About time: Finally a man - believed to be a store employee - steps in and drags the kid out . The man recording the video repeatedly refers to the boy as 'jit', which is prison slang for someone younger than you. Other viewers were just as shocked that the man taking the video didn't step in and let the tantrum go on as long as it did. 'I think the fact that no one stopped him is a large part of why kids get this way in the first place; general societal and parental lenience where children.. the dear, dear, special children are concerned,' one viewer wrote on Gawker. 'It's equally disturbing that an observer would rather tape and post this, than inform the management that mayhem has ensued. Good decisions all around! ( Of course ""management"" is getting eight bucks an hour and was probably secretly glad for the entertainment and the vicarious release of hostility.) 'Remember ""Look, but don't touch ""? My parents taught me that very early. 'I guess ""You break it, you bought it."" doesn't carry much sting at the Dollar Store.'

"A crazed gunman killed six people - two of whom were children - then committed suicide in a Canadian town, police believe. The man, thought to be 53-year-old Phu Lam, was found dead after an alleged rampage in which he attacked his victims in two different parts of Edmonton, Canada, before fleeing and taking his own life. Police said that one of the victims was a young boy, and another was a young girl. They also found bodies belonging to four women and two men who were murdered. One of the victims was named late Sunday as 37-year-old Cyndi Duong, who was killed at a separate home to the other seven. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Police remove one of the eight victims from a home in Edmonton, Alberta, this morning . Eight victims: Police in Edmonton, Alberta, investigate a home where seven bodies, two of them children, were found this morning after reports of a suicidal man . Inside: Detectives scour the inside of a building in nearby Fort Saskatchewan, where officers found the alleged killer dead Tuesday morning . Officers also say they found a body matching descriptions they received of a suicidal man in a commuter town not from from Edmonton. The Toronto Sun reported that Lam is thought to be the man in question, and was known to police before. Edmonton police chief Rob Knecht called the attacks a 'senseless mass murder', which he said was a result of domestic violence. He later described the killings, carried out with a 9mm handgun which was stolen eight years ago, as 'planned and deliberate' and said they were the city's worst mass killings since 1956. He added the man was well-known to police and had a criminal record dating back to September 1987. Police were called to an address in the south of the town, three hours north of Calgary in the Alberta province, following a weapons complaint. There they found the body of a woman, thought to be in her 30s, who had been shot dead after somebody broke into the house Monday evening, according to state broadcaster CBC. Murder after murder: The above map shows the sites where dead bodies were found by police in and around Edmonton . Murdered: The victim above is one of seven found in the same home, to which police were called in the evening before the killings happened . They then received calls about a suicidal man from a home elsewhere in the city - but by the time they arrived he had left. The officers checked the home and knocked on the door, but got no response. Police rejected any response they did not do enough. When officers returned after midnight, they found the next seven victims: three women, two men and the two children. All had been shot dead. Duong shared the home where she was found dead with David Luu, 41, according to property records viewed by the Edmonton Journal. Further records reportedly showed the home where seven more bodies were found is owned by Phu Lam and a 35-year-old woman named as Thuy-Tien Truong. According to the Journal, Truong was sued by the Royal Bank in 2013 and Lam filed a bankruptcy proposal in the same year. Neighbours told the Journal a couple with two children - an eight-year-old named locally as Elvis and a toddler - lived in the house alongside an elderly woman. Police tracked the suicidal man to a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, a town outside Edmonton, to which Lam has been linked. Officers located a black Mercedes SUV Lam is thought to have been driving. 'Senseless mass murder': Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht spoke at a conference about the spree of murders . Explanation: Chief Knecht said the killings seem to be the result of domestic violence . Tragedy: The police chief said it was the city's worst mass killing since another in 1956 . Police found the vehicle at around 2.30am, but waited until morning to raid the restaurant, where the man was found. Witnesses then described officer blowing down the door, and sending police dogs and robot . When they entered around 8.45am today, the man was dead - apparently after killing himself. Police say there is no further danger to the public. Chief Knecht said: 'This series of events are not believed to be random acts. These events do not appear to be gang-related, but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.' 'Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides,'  he said. Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths. Monday, December 29 . 6.52pm: Officers respond to a 'weapons complaint' at a house in southern Edmonton and discover the body of 37-year-old Cyndi Duong. 8.28pm: An emergency call raises concerns for the welfare of a man - suspected to be Phu Lam, 53 - at a house in north Edmonton. He is seen 'depressed and overly emotional' and a family is concerned he may be suicidal. Neither he nor his vehicle is found, but they do not force their way into the house. Tuesday, December 30 . 12.23am: Officers return to the same house after 'further investigation and significant disclosure by a second individual'. This time they do force their way inside and find seven bodies - three women, two men, and a boy and a girl both aged under ten - after apparent 'planned and deliberate' murders. 2.20am: Officers find black SUV that matched description of vehicle connected to first murder outside a Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, where the suspect has a 'business interest'. 8.45am: Officers establish man found dead in restaurant killed himself and was the man they had been looking for since the previous night.","Police found eight bodies, including a girl and a boy, in Edmonton, Canada .

"Click here to read more from Sportsmail's Nick Harris about Premier League wages, attendances and star quality . Which is the best football league in the world? Best not just for the fans but for the players, and the clubs, and the national game in each country? That is a question that The Mail on Sunday have tried to answer using objective measurements of a wide range of factors as part of the most in-depth study of global football ever conducted. We have considered 34 leagues around the world, from England to Australia and back via Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. We have looked at each league’s income and wages paid out, goals, ticket prices and attendance, ‘stardust’ and talent production, managers, trophies, competitive balance and contribution to the national game. Manchester City are the Premier League champions, but is the English league the best in the world? Points were assigned to every league for every category — and added up to see who comes out on top. The Premier League emerges top by the tiniest margin over the Bundesliga, a debate-provoking result if ever there was one. TROPHIES . While fans of the Bundesliga wax lyrical about the brilliance of Bayern and the wonders of cheap tickets and beer on the terraces, Germany's top division hasn't pulled up many trees in the past decade in Europe, winning the Champions League once and the Uefa Cup / Europa League not at all. Two major leagues have dominated Europe over the past decade when it comes to sticking major continental silverware in the trophy room: Spain and the Premier League. La Liga teams have won the Champions League four times, had a further runners-up slot, won the Uefa Cup five times and been runners-up in that twice. Premier League teams have won three Champions League finals over the past 10 years - one apiece for Liverpool, Man United and Chelsea - and had another five as runners-up: Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man Utd twice. Chelsea have also won the Europa League while Premier League middle-rankers (at that time) Middlesbrough and Fulham have been runners-up. Taking into account continental trophy wins over a decade around the world, Spain and England's top divisions are well ahead of any other leagues, with Bundesliga in third place just ahead of Italy's Serie A in second, then Brazil's top division (dominant in Copa Lib.), then Mexico, Portugal, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine and Japan. See table for details. MANAGERS . Only one football league in the world in 2014 could boast a club manager who has won both the World Cup and the Champions League among his career honours - and it's not the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A or Ligue 1. The league in question is the Chinese Super League (CSL), the manager is Marcello Lippi, and the CSL's collection of leading bosses does not stop with the Italian. Lippi has just retired as the boss at Guangzhou Evergrande, the CSL champions and 2013 Asian club champions. Sven Goran Eriksson, former Serie A winner and European Cup-Winners’ Cup winner (as well as former England manager) is also working in the CSL, at Guangzhou, and there is former winning manager of the South America’s Champions League equivalent, the Copa Libertadores in the CSL - that’s Cuca of Brazil. The former Argentina manager Sergio Batista is also there. The CSL is therefore one of four leagues in the world who in 2014 have collectively employed most of the world’s best managers between them - the other three being the Premier League, the Bundesliga and La Liga. ‘Best' in this case is not just a subjective tag. As part of MailSport’s wide-ranging study of the world’s best leagues, we have scrutinised the trophy records of managers across 34 leagues around the world, awarding points for every trophy of genuinely major significance. These are the World Cup, the Champions League and equivalent, major continental season-long trophies such as the Europa League, and league titles in England, Spain, Germany and Italy. Each trophy win has been assigned a points value, from 10 points for a World Cup win or Champions League win to three points for winning one of those four league titles to 1.5 points for winning the continental club titles in Africa or Asia. Former Guangzhou Evergrande boss Marcello Lippi, seen here in 2009, is the only manager in club football who has won both the World Cup and the Champions League . The points totals for each manager have been added up, and the points totals for the managers in each league combined have been added up. The accompanying table shows the 12 leagues with at least one 'world class' manager. By this measure, the Premier League has the best trophy haul among its managers, Jose Mourinho leading the way with a supporting cast headed by Louis Van Gaal. The Bundesliga is next, with Pep Guardiola the star man, then La Liga (Ancelloti) and the CSL (Lippi) with Brazil’s top division next (Big Phil Scolari) and Serie A (Rafa Benitez). This table considers big-time winners in major competitions. If you've 'only' got a runners-up medal in a major tournament, or 'just' a national cup to your name - forget it. The Premier League's has the best trophy haul among managers, Jose Mourinho (right) leading the way . COMPETITIVE BALANCE . The Premier League title has been the preserve of a handful of clubs over its entire 23-year existence and the past decade has become more exclusive still, with just three different winners in the past 10 years and just five different teams even featuring anywhere in the top three at the end of the season. Those five - Manchester United, Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool - represent 25 per cent of the Premier League, and that figure (just 25% of teams in the top three in a decade) is the lowest proportion in any league in the whole of world football. Some leagues are less competitive in terms of different winners in a decade: Olympiacos have won the Greek title in nine of the past 10 years; the same is true for Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. Shakhtar Donetsk have won the Ukraine title eight times in 10, and Porto have won in Portugal seven times in 10, and Basel seven times in 10 in Switzerland. These leagues are virtually one-horse races most seasons. In fact only two teams have won in each of those leagues in the past decade, as is the case in Scotland. That makes this group, along with the Premier League, Spains’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A (also just three winners each over decade) the least competitively balanced nine leagues in MailSport’s 34-league study. And even these other leagues have more teams getting inside the top three than in England (see table). While the Bundesliga has been and remains dominated by Bayern Munich (six wins in 10 years), it has at least had four different winners in a decade and eight teams in the top three. The honours in France have been spread further still with six winners of Ligue 1 in a decade and nine teams finishing in the top three. The most competitively balanced of the ‘big’ leagues (18 teams or more) are the Championship (eight winners in 10 years, or 33% of teams, no team more than twice, and a staggering 22 different teams in the top three), Mexico’s Liga MX (seven winners in 10 years), the J-League in Japan (ditto) and MLS (ditto). In the ‘small’ leagues of 16 or fewer teams, Sweden’s top division has been most competitive with eight winners in 10 years, followed by the top divisions in Australia, Norway and China, with six winners in 10 years. Bayern Munich have dominated the Bundesliga, wining the league six times in the last 10 years .","Premier League tops Bundesliga in Sportsmail's in-depth study .

"The deadly Ebola virus could be mutating to become even more contagious, a leading U.S scientist has warned. The disease has killed nearly 4,000 people, infecting in excess of 8,000 - the majority in the West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Communities lie in ruins, thousands of children have been orphaned, millions face starvation but the virus continues its unprecedented pace, invading and destroying vast swathes of these countries. Scroll down for video . A Liberian Red Cross burial team out on suits as they go to collect a suspected Ebola victim in Monrovia. A scientists has now warned that the virus could be getting even more contagious . The team make their way through the streets of Monrovia. The majority of Ebola victims have been in West Africa in countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea . A health worker escorts a mother and her baby from a holding centre in Monrovia into an ambulance for transport to a treatment centre . Meanwhile three nurses, two in the U.S. and one in Spain have caught the infection while treating Ebola patients, despite wearing protective suits. Now U.S. scientist Peter Jahrling of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease believes the current Ebola outbreak may be caused by an infection that spreads more easily than it did before. Dr Jahrling explained that his team, who are working in the epicentre of the crisis in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, are seeing that the viral loads in Ebola patients are much higher than they are used to seeing. He told Vox.com: 'We are using tests now that weren't using in the past, but there seems to be a belief that the virus load is higher in these patients [today] than what we have seen before. If true, that's a very different bug. 'I have a field team in Monrovia. They are running [tests]. They are telling me that viral loads are coming up very quickly and really high, higher than they are used to seeing. 'It may be that the virus burns hotter and quicker.' Two-month-old baby Benson, who is feared to be suffering from Ebola. Dr Peter Jahrling believes the virus load in Ebola patients is much higher than they are used to seeing . Jessica Sompon, 17, has her temperature checked after she complained of suffering from a fever. Dr Jahrling believes that the bug causing the current outbreak may burn hotter and faster . Dr Jahrling's warning comes amid calls for the international community to step up their efforts to tackle the Ebola epidemic. Yesterday the World Health Organisation admitted it blundered in its efforts to halt the outbreak of the virus in Africa, blaming incompetent staff and a lack of information for the failure. Now British Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the EU to stump up £800millon (1billion euros) to pay for 2,000 health workers to fly out to the affected West African countries, to help stem the spread of the disease. He has insisted that the UK is 'leading the way' in providing assistance to West Africa as he backed a call by United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon for other countries to deliver more in the way of funding and resources. Prime Minister David Cameron at the Asia-Europe meeting yesterday urged the EU to put £800million towards trying to stem the spread of Ebola in west Africa . Ebola screening has already begun at Heathrow Airport for passengers coming from West Africa. It has been revealed that checks are also being extended to Manchester and Birmingham airports as well as Gatwick and Eurostar terminals . Mr Cameron, who was in Milan for a meeting of European and Asian nations, said: 'This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. It is very likely to affect a number of the countries here today. 'Britain, in my view, has been leading the way. The action we are taking in Sierra Leone where we are committing well over £100 million, 750 troops, training 800 members of health staff, providing 700 beds - we are doing a huge amount. 'I think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America is doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea.' Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) said screening for travellers arriving in Britain from the affected areas in West Africa is to be introduced at Manchester and Birmingham airports. Duncan Selbie of PHE said that once the existing measures covering Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras had 'settled', they would be rolled out to other ports of entry. Passengers were pictured wearing face masks at JFK International airport in New York. Ebola screening is also underway at the airport but American health experts say banning passengers from West Africa would be a bad idea . 'Next week the focus will be on Gatwick and St Pancras and, once settled there, we will then move to include Manchester and Birmingham,' he said. 'I appreciate very much that we are taking people away from their normal work, and please be assured that we are thinking hard and listening carefully to those on the ground to see how we can make this more sustainable. 'What I am certain of is that we have the people who know how to keep the country safe and that is exactly what we will do.' Meanwhile health experts in America have said it would be a bad idea to impose a travel ban on passengers entering the U.S. from West Africa. The experts' key objection is that a ban could prevent needed medical supplies, food and health care workers from reaching Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the nations where the epidemic is at its worst. Without that aid, the deadly virus might spread to wider areas of Africa, making it even more of a threat to the U.S. and the world, experts say. The also argue preventing people from the affected countries from traveling to the U.S. could be difficult to enforce and might generate counterproductive results, such as people lying about their travel history or attempting to evade screening.","Fears that the deadly virus could mutate and become even more contagious .

"With just a carefully placed stick or trophy to hide their modesty, this team of hockey players have bared almost all, in the name of charity. The Hampstead and Westminster Hockey Club men's first team came up with the idea to raise money for a cancer charity in honour of a teammate who is being treated for the disease. Martin Scanlon was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma two years ago. His brother Ian still plays for the club having been the first team goalkeeper. Sixteen of the first team, which includes one Olympian, took part in the shoot. Scroll down for video .

Sixteen of the first team, which includes three OIympians, took part in the charity shoot. The front cover features Matt Botha (South African international), pictured . Mr October, first team captain Toby Roche, 26, told MailOnline when tasked with raising £1,500 for their club, the team wanted to do something 'fun, a bit different'. The hockey club is trying to raise £150,000 to get one of their pitches re-laid. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph nodes and tissues of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that runs throughout the body carrying the fluid containing white blood cells. Lymph nodes respond to infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood stream to fight it off. When someone has lymphoma, lots of abnormal cells are produced within a particular lymph node or tissue. The most common sign of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is swelling of the glands, or lymph nodes in the neck, chest, groin or armpit. The swelling often causes a lump that is generally painless but persistent, lasting for up to six weeks. Some non-Hodgkin lymphomas develop in other tissues around the body, that the lymphatic system extends to, including the kidney, lungs and gut. Other symptoms include: . Source: Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research . As such each team has been given the task of trying to raise £1,500 a year to help fund the project. Sponsored pub crawls and raffles have been held. But when the men's first team came to brainstorming their fundraising ideas, they wanted to do something a bit different. 'We wanted to do something funny,' said Mr Roche. 'Our old goalkeeper, Ian, who still plays for the club, inspired the idea. 'His brother was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma about two years ago, he used to play for the club as well. 'We wanted to do something to raise money for a charity as well as the club.' He explained half the proceeds will be donated to Mr Scanlon's charity of choice, the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Foundation. Mr Roche, a solicitor, said having resigned themselves to shooting the calendar on their iPhones the team were saved by one of the women's first team players. Helen Cathcart, a professional photographer , stepped in to organise the team. 'We were very fortunate that Helen, rather bravely, agreed to shoot it for us,' Mr Roche told MailOnline. 'And the end result is all the better for it, it has far exceeded our expectations. 'Normally she shoots cook books, so it was a bit of a change for her. We're really grateful.' So far the team have managed to sell 200 of the 350 they had printed by Geoff Neal Litho, who offered to print the calendar at a discounted price to help raise maximum funds for the charity.

"Paul Napoli, 46, is a partner at Napoli Bern . The wife of a top New York lawyer has been accused of waging a campaign of abuse against her husband's mistress - including allegedly kidnapping her cat. Paul Napoli, 46, is a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero. Napoli, who is currently off work with cancer, had an affair with Vanessa Dennis, one of the young lawyers at the firm, court papers allege, and when his wife, Marie, discovered it, she stalked and harassed the woman, reports the New York Post. In April 2013, Mrs Napoli, 47, hired a private investigator to spy on her husband and Dennis during a Chicago business trip. The suit claims she then emailed the young associate, saying, 'I have evidence that is going to be forwarded to your husband if you do not stay away from my husband.' Mr Napoli demanded Dennis erase correspondence between the pair and admitted he had authorized access for his wife to see both his and Dennis' e-mail accounts, state legal papers. Court papers say Mrs Napoli messaged Dennis' brother to tell him of the affair and then found Dennis' husband, Richard Buonauito, in Dennis' personnel file as an emergency contact and contacted him. The 33-year-old was fired from Napoli Bern on May 2, 2013, with a $150,000 severance. But Mrs Napoli allegedly did not stop the harassment and e-mailed Dennis writing: 'Happy Mothers Day! Oh yea I should say happy motherless day. Tick tock.'

Mr Napoli is a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero . Dennis had previously told Mr Napoli that she might not be able to have conceive. The Napolis have three young children - including a baby. In June 2013 an email included in court papers shows an angry Dennis wrote to Mr Napoli: 'What's more believable Paul — that a 32-year-old junior attorney who weighs 100 pounds soaking wet seduced and physically attacked her 40 something year old boss (who happens to be a managing partner and a millionaire) and twice her size or the other way around. She emailed him again to remind him of intimate details he had shared about his view of his wife's body since she became a mother. Dennis, who has since split with her husband, moved to Texas, but she claims Mrs Napoli sent  cards to the wives of Dennis' new bosses, warning them about her and even describing Dennis' private body piercing. The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island . A Facebook photo shows Mrs Napoli kissing her husband in Mexico's Cancun this year . She also sent messages to everyone on LinkedIn associated with Dennis' new firm. Dennis claims that in one day she came out the bathroom of her Houston apartment to find her back door open and her cat, Padme, missing - she says she received a series of texts written as if from Padme, with one saying, 'How do u think I got out . . .' Three months later Dennis filed a defamation suit in state Supreme Court against the Napolis, Marc Bern and Napoli Bern with preliminary paperwork indicates she is seeking at least $9 million. She declined to comment when contacted by the Post and Mr Napoli said he saw nothing wrong 'with confronting a person that there was an affair with.' 'Everything my wife said in any e-mail whether it sounds terrible or not was all true and was all factually correct.' He denied reports he had previous affairs at the firm and denied that his wife had killed Dennis' cat. The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island. A Facebook photo shows Mrs Napoli kissing her husband in Mexico's Cancun this year - the couple are outlined in a heart. Last week Mrs Napoli filed her own legal action, claiming Dennis enticed her husband into having sex on the Chicago business trip in violation of the 'Illinois Alienation of Affections Act.' On his firm's website Mr Napoli's bio reads: ' Paul J. Napoli, a Senior Partner in the firm, has achieved more than 100 verdicts and settlements over one million dollars. 'He is nationally known as a tenacious and unrelenting advocate for his clients’ rights in courts around the country, where he consistently achieves results in the multiple millions of dollars for injured plaintiffs. Mr Napoli has been named in New York Super Lawyers® each year since 2007, and in 2010, was named as one of the top 100 lawyers in the New York Metropolitan area.'

"Police in Indianapolis are searching for the mother who dumped the body of her newborn daughter wrapped in a college sweatshirt in a wooded area of a city park. Officers were called to Eagle Creek Park on the outskirts of Indianapolis by a person who found the baby while hiking Sunday afternoon. Investigators say the baby was perhaps a day old and her umbilical cord still attached. The horrific discovery was made under a branch about 30 yards from a parking area of the park on the city's northwest side. Swaddled and left for dead: A deceased newborn baby girl was found in an Indianapolis park wrapped in this blue sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo of Aviation Maintenance Vincennes University-Indianapolis . Horrifying find: A hiker came upon the baby with her umbilical cord still attached lying under a branch in Eagle Creek Park . Emergency workers pronounced the girl dead at the scene on the 3,900-acre park's northern edge at around 4.30pm. According to police, the newborn was found swaddled in a blue sweatshirt with a logo saying ‘Aviation Maintenance Vincennes University-Indianapolis.’ Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Christopher Wilburn said forensics investigators are using the clothing item to try and locate the mother. ‘We want to do what we can. It's very tragic. There may be some DNA on that sweatshirt,’ Wilburn told The Indy Channel. The coroner said it is unknown whether the baby was born dead or alive at birth, and her gestational age has not yet been determined. Additional tests will be performed to determine the cause and manner of death. Location: The child was discovered about 30 yards from a parking area of the park on the city's northwest side . Officials say the mother had other options rather than to abandon her baby in the brush. The State of Indiana has had a law on the books since 2000 called the Safe Haven Infant Protection Act allowing a person to give up an unwanted child anonymously without fear of arrest or prosecution, reported WISH-TV. A parent, family member, friend, minister or priest, social worker or any responsible adult may give up custody of a baby less than 30 days old to a hospital emergency room, fire station or police station in Indiana, so long as the child shows no signs of abuse. Anyone who recognizes the blue college sweatshirt or knows the whereabouts of the mother is being asked to call (317) 327-3475. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 262-TIPS (8477).","Hiker came upon baby's body in Eagle Creek Park in Indianapolis Sunday .

Painter James Grupinski claims he was made to work 12-hour days in confined spaces with inadequate ventilation where he was exposed to noxious vapors form fiberglass products provided to him by his employers. According to court documents obtained by Courthouse News, Grupinski says at one point his employer gave him a highly toxic paint stripper to use, one which had been yanked from store shelved a decade before. Dangerous conditions?

He's suing those employers and Larry Page for the illnesses he says he continues to suffer . Displeasure boat: Grupinski was hired to repaint thew 193-foot super yacht owned by Google founder Larry Page . Grupinski claims he used the product in unventilated conditions under threat of termination and soon passed out below deck, where he was found  bleeding from the eyes, ears and anus. When asked to take him to the hospital, his boss, ID'd as Heidi from HF Interior--a company also named in the suit along with one called Modern Mud--then told him to 'drink some milk' and 'stop being a baby' according to the suit. Per court documents, Grupinski has suffered ever since from seizures, COPD, neurological problems and even early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Grupinski's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The yacht has plenty of room for entertaining with a big dining room table and ten bedroom suites . Grupinski is seeking unspecified damages in the personal injury suit. The massive pleasure boat, for which Page paid $5 million in 2011, first set sail in 1999. 'Senses Georgetown', as it's been dubbed, features a helipad, gym, multi-level sun decks, ten luxurious suites, a crew of 14 and interior design by famed French designer Philippe Starck. Page, who is worth an estimated $30 billion, bought the boat from New Zealand brewing heir Sir Douglas Meyer. Page's toy is actually dwarfed by those owned by other high-tech moguls, such as Paul Allen and Larry Ellison. Allen's 'Octopus' comes in at 415-ft in length, while Ellison's 'Rising Sun' is 454-ft long, with both costing more than $200m.

"Earlier today it was reported that Britain could be heading for a winter strewn with power cuts as an extreme cold snap heads the country’s way. But one company has a solution to at least let you see clearly during an outage with a light bulb that uses a battery to keep itself on. In the event of a power cut it will automatically switch to battery power to keep shining for up to three hours, during which time one would hope the power had returned. Scroll down for video . A lightbulb made by Litonics Ltd in Wales could let people see in blackouts. Called iViTi On (shown) it has an in-built battery that lasts for up to three hours. It charges when power is up and the light is on as normal. But when the power goes it automatically switches to battery mode . The product is called iViTi ON and uses technology invented by Litonics Ltd in Knighton, Powys, Wales. ‘iViTi ON automatic switching has the single aim of ensuring that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail,’ the company writes on their website. Today experts warned that Britain must brace itself for power shortages if the country is hit by a severe winter. After a rush to close coal-fired power stations to meet green targets, a deep freeze means mothballed oil and gas power stations could have to be restarted and factories paid to shut down to preserve power. Business leaders warned that for too long, the UK has failed to plan properly to keep the lights on, as the National Grid revealed the average gap between supply and demand will be just 4.1 per cent - the narrowest in eight years. The National Grid report said the country will be eating into its most basic reserve power if there is extreme weather. The appliance operates similarly to existing light bulbs until it detects the power is gone, when it automatically switches to battery operation. This enables it to stay on independently for up to three hours until the power returns. And it can also distinguish between a power cut and someone just flicking the light switch, so people will easily be able to turn it off if needed. The 600mAh battery charges automatically when the power is up and the builb is on as normal. And no additional wiring is required - the bulb can be screwed straight into an existing fitting like a regular bulb. It’s also energy friendly, consuming just eight watts of power, but it shines with the brightness of a regular 60-watt bulb - measured as 850 lumens to 800 lumens for the latter. The company expects to begin selling the light bulb at the end of the year, but there’s no word yet on how much it will cost. 'This innovative new product is set to take its place among other ""standard"" safety products within the home such as smoke detectors, CO detectors and intruder alarms,' the company adds. ‘iViTi ON automatic switching has the single aim of ensuring that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail,’ the company writes on their website. Pictured are residents of New York during a power cut caused by Hurricane Sandy on 31 October 2012 . The lightbulb can discern between a power cut and someone flicking the switch.

"He's known for his love of skin tight denim. But Russell Brand was spotted hanging loose in a very baggy get-up as he stepped out with a lady friend. In what could only be described as a white pair of harem pants teamed with leg warmers, Russell paraded his eccentric sartorial style while out for a coffee in West Hollywood. Perhaps the comedian and actor was taking preventative action against revelations that skinny jeans could be bad for your health if you're a man. Hanging loose: Russell Brand stepped out for a coffee with a lady friend wearing what looked like harem pants teamed with leg warmers . Baggy trousers: Perhaps the comedian was taking preventative action against revelations that skinny jeans are bad for men's health . Experts revealed today that the number of men suffering painful testicular problems is on the rise because of tight jeans. Doctors, including top TV doctor Hilary Jones, have reported an increase in injuries being caused by the jeans, which are favoured by celebrities like Russell Brand, Jude Law and Joey Essex. The trendy denims are causing twisted testicles, bladder weakness and even urinary tract infections. Trousers too tight to mention: Skinny jeans made fashionable by celebrities like Russell . Brand (left) cause twisted testicles, bladder weakness and urinary . tract infections, TV doctor Hilary Jones (right) says . Low sperm count and fungal infections are also being put down to the tight-fitting jeans. Dr Jones, who is working with TENA on a project to highlight the dangers, said: ‘I have seen several cases of men who have twisted their testicles due to wearing jeans that are far too tight. ‘My advice would be to make sure you leave plenty of room around the groin area and that your pants and trousers feel comfortable so you’re not being restricted in any way. Tricky trends: Jude Law likes to stay trendy with tight jeans but he might also need to run to the toilet more often as tight-fitting jeans can put additional pressure on the bladder . ‘Men who wear tight or ill-fitting . trousers or underwear which is restrictive around the groin area could . be damaging their health. ‘Wearing tight-fitting clothing over a . prolonged period of time can lead to urinary tract infections leading . to over-activity of the bladder - a type of bladder weakness as well as a . low sperm count and fungal infections. ‘Please don’t put style before health.’ Twisted . testicles occur when tight trousers prevent the spermatic cord from . moving freely, meaning it twists and leads to testicular torsion which . cuts off the blood supply requiring immediate surgery to prevent a . gangrenous testicle. Tight-fitting jeans around the groin area can put additional pressure on the bladder but can also lead to bacteria breeding and re-entering the body causing urinary tract infections. This increases the need to urinate more frequently and can cause severe pain. In study of 2,000 British men: . Dr Hilary’s warning comes as a study of . 2,000 British men conducted by TENA Men revealed one in 10 men have . experienced an unpleasant side-effect as a result of wearing skinny . jeans. Of those men . suffering from wearing skinny jeans, half had experienced groin . discomfort, over a quarter had bladder troubles while one in five . suffered a twisted testicle. Worryingly, . one in four regularly squeeze into jeans- with the biggest reasons . given for enduring tightness being ‘to show I can still fit in them’ and . ‘because they look good.’ In . fact, three in 10 has suffered discomfort from tight jeans and forty . per cent of men admit they sometimes sacrifice comfort over style. One . in seven British men regularly wear skinny jeans, but more than a third . confess they don’t actually know their correct jean size. And when it comes to picking jeans, just seven per cent described softness and comfort as an important factor. Zoe Brimfield, TENA Men Brand Manager said: ‘With this survey we were keen to highlight that while men may like the look of tight-fitting jeans, it’s important that they are not compromising their health. ‘Wearing skinny or ill-fitting jeans can lead to bladder weakness as a longer-term consequence. Male bladder weakness is more common than people think, with 1 in 9 men in the UK currently experiencing some form of the condition.’ * For further help and advice on male bladder weakness visit tenamen.co.uk or seek medical advice. Sales executive James Coleman, 27, of Ealing, west London has suffered bladder issues from wearing tight jeans. He said: ‘I bought my pair of skinny jeans because they were fashionable, I’d recently moved to London where every street feels like a catwalk so I wanted to look good. ‘My friends used to joke I looked like something out of the Wanted or One Direction but I didn’t take notice. ‘At first I didn’t really have a problem and felt good wearing them but a couple of colleagues did comment on the fact they were skin tight and made my legs look ridiculously long. Sales executive James Coleman bought . skinny jeans to 'look good' but found not only getting dressed was . uncomfortable but that the jeans put pressure on his bladder, making him . go to the toilet more frequently . ‘I then noticed they felt uncomfortable to wear, especially when sat down and put pressure against my bladder and stomach. ‘I found myself going to the toilet more frequently than normal, which just became annoying. ‘I didn’t bother going to the doctors or anything because it’s not something you want to admit - and it never occurred to me that it may have been caused by my skinny jeans. ‘Since moving to London I cycle more and I decided to finally ditch the jeans after I split a seam on the tube after bending down to pick up my Oyster card. ‘And since reverting back to smarter, looser fitting jeans and trousers I’ve found the problem has gone away.’","Tight jeans are causing more testicular problems in men, says Dr Hilary Jones .

"A tech wizard who set up a website to help people exploit a booking loophole to get cheap flights has raised $30,000 in donations for his legal battle with United Airlines. The carrier is suing Aktarer Zaman, 22, for showing thousands of fliers how to employ the 'hidden city' ticketing technique to make substantial savings on their fares. His website, Skiplagged.com, lets fliers get cheap fares by telling airlines that their final destination is only a stop-over. Aktarer Zaman, 22, from New York City founded Skiplagged.com last year which used the technique described as 'hidden city' ticketing . This way, some fliers can book a cheap, multi-leg ticket instead of a more expensive direct one - and simply leave the airport part during the stop. But lawyers for United and travel site Orbitz have said the strategy creates 'unfair competition' and demanded $75,000 from the coder - prompting a flood of online donations from supporters. A crowdfunding page on the GoFundMe website has so far attracted $27,000 to pay for the legal battle, with donations from 1,360 people. On the page, Zaman wrote that he is certain his strategy is legal, and that he has attracted United's wrath because they are doing 'too good of a job' saving people money. He said: 'Skiplagged's sole purpose has always been to help you become savvy travelers. The site has a method which means customers could get lower fares by booking your final destination as a stop-over . 'We have been doing that by exposing pricing inefficiencies for air travel, among other things. 'Unfortunately, we have been doing too good of a job so United Airlines and Orbitz recently teamed up with a lawsuit to get in the way. 'Everything Skiplagged has done and continues to do is legal, but the only way to effectively prove this is with lawyers. Please show your support for Skiplagged by donating towards this campaign to help fund our legal team.' On the page, well-wishers wrote of their support alongside the donations. One, James Heyman, wrote: 'The airlines have no right to complain, it's a system they created.' Another, Mark Rayson, said: 'This is absurd, with a little investigation online any search engine you can do this yourself. This small company just makes it easier.' The 'hidden city' technique has existed for years, though Zaman's tool allows consumers to take advantage of it with less work on their part. The website promises reductions of as much as 45 per cent on some routes. United Airlines and Orbitz Travel claim the strategy creates 'unfair competition', and are asking for $75,000 in damages (file picture) However, the practice is not effective on all routes, and airlines have been known to retaliate by billing customers the difference if they discover the ploy, or removing points from frequent flier accounts. It often only works for one-way journeys, as some carriers cancel the remaining parts of a booking journey as soon as a passenger misses one step. Passengers also can't combine the strategy with taking bags in the hold, as they won't be able to get them back during the stopover. Zaman, who was born in Bangladesh but grew up in Brooklyn, New York, told CNN that he was expecting the lawsuit. He insists there is nothing illegal about his website and says he is just exposing an 'inefficiency' in the pricing system. He told the site: '[Hidden city ticketing] has been around for a while, it just hasn't been very accessible to consumers.' Zaman is currently working at a tech start-up and says Skiplagged is simply a 'side project'. Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Company, an airline consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y,  told the station travellers will still use similar techniques even if the site is shut down. Michael Boyd, President of Boyd Group International, said he worked for American Airlines as a ticket agent 30 years ago and was trained to look out for 'hidden city' ticket sales.","Aktarer Zaman, 22, from New York City founded Skiplagged.com last year .

"The grieving husband of deceased right-to-die advocate Brittany Maynard has spoken out about the difficult Christmas he's had less than two months after his cancer-stricken wife took her own life. 'The holidays have been tough,' Dan Diaz, 43, told the New York Daily News. 'The last two holidays we hosted my family for Christmas Eve. We didn't do that this year.' In spite of their terrible grief, Diaz and Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler both recently wrote touching odes to Brittany's strength that affirmed her decision to end her suffering with a lethal dose of prescription drugs November 1. Scroll down for video . 'The holidays have been tough': Dan Diaz has spoken out about the pain of going through Christmas less than two months after his right-to-die advocate wife Brittany Maynard took her own life after suffering through terminal brain cancer . Brave daughter: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) has also described how her daughter chose to forgo potentially life-extending treatment in order to remain more like 'herself' in her final months . Diaz wrote in his exclusive letter to the Daily News that Christmas conjured bittersweet memories of his vivacious wife. 'It was Brittany who decorated inside,' he recalled, 'With lots of holly and wreaths. 'Sometimes my emotions drift from sadness to anger. I can't help asking, ''How did this come apart?'' But there's a saying: you can smile that it happened or choose to be sad that it's over.' Debbie Zeigler reflected in her letter on the determination her daughter showed when she chose to extend her ability to speak and interact like her regular self as long as possible by forgoing potentially life-extending treatments that could compromise those abilities. Zeigler writes: . 'She chose to live as fully as she could in her remaining months, planning trips to Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon and Olympic National Park in Washington. 'She organized her trips and expeditions around relocating to Oregon where she would be free to utilize the law providing end of life options.' 'This ability to decide to live, to decide to notice beauty, to decide to be the most that she could be and then go before everything that made her who she was – was diminished, is what made Brittany the bravest and most intelligent woman I've ever known. I miss her terribly.' 'It was Brittany who decorated inside,' Diaz recalled as he face Christmas without his beloved wife, 'With lots of holly and wreaths' Maynard ended her suffering November 1, leaving her loving husband to grieve despite his full support of her decision to take her own life . Maynard revived a national debate about physician-assisted suicide when she ended her life November 1 by swallowing lethal drugs made available under an Oregon law allowing terminally ill people to choose when to die . Maynard revived a national debate about physician-assisted suicide when she ended her life November 1 by swallowing lethal drugs made available under an Oregon law allowing terminally ill people to choose when to die. She would have been 30 on Nov. 19. Maynard had been in the spotlight since publicizing that she and  Diaz moved to Portland from Northern California so that she could take advantage of the Oregon law. She told journalists she planned to die Nov. 1, shortly after her husband's birthday, but reserved the right to move the date forward or push it back. 'She died as she intended — peacefully in her bedroom, in the arms of her loved ones,' said Sean Crowley, a spokesman for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices. Crowley said Maynard 'suffered increasingly frequent and longer seizures, severe head and neck pain, and stroke-like symptoms. As symptoms grew more severe, she chose to abbreviate the dying process by taking the aid-in-dying medication she had received months ago.' The issue of physician-assisted suicide is not new, but Maynard's youth and vitality before she became ill brought the discussion to a younger generation. Working with Compassion & Choices, Maynard used her story to speak out for the right of terminally ill people like herself to end their lives on their own terms.

"A mother who suffered an incomprehensible tragedy just two years ago showed the incredible power of forgiveness this holiday season. Amanda Humphrey of Kansas City, Missouri watched in horror on September 16, 2012 as her daughter Autumn was struck and killed by a car driven by 88-year-old Lewis Grace, just weeks before her first birthday. And this holiday season at the First Baptist Church of North Kansas City, Amanda recounted the tragedy and spoke of forgiveness before walking back to her seat and shocking many by embracing the man who killed her daughter - Lewis Grace. Amanda and Richard Humphrey (right) greet Lewis and Louise Grace (left) at a church service this holiday season . Lewis Grace was driving the car that ran over Amanda and Richard's daughter Autumn in September of 2012 . The incident happened at the First Baptist Church where Lewis accidentally accelerated while the car was in reverse . The Kansas City Star reports that it was a Sunday after church when the accident occurred, with Lewis hitting Autumn's grandfather and aunt when he accidentally hit his accelerator and backed into the group. 'We relive the accident every day in our minds — for those of us that were there, that is our cross we bear,' explained Amanda. 'Then the car ride over to the hospital, the whole time thinking this has to be a dream! Then walking into the ER, the walk to her ER room seemed to be the longest walk in the world. All we wanted was to be with Autumn and comfort her.' A short time later Autumn was pronounced dead, and Amanda and her husband Richard were left to rebuild their lives. Lewis and Louise with Amanda and Richard's son Tommy, who is 16 months old . Autumn was just a few weeks shy of her first birthday when she died . A week later however, things took a remarkable turn when at her daughter's funeral Amanda asked to see Lewis. Amanda hugged the distraught man, still suffering from what had happened, and asked if he and his wife Louise would sit with them as they remembered Autumn. 'They go to this church; they had been members of this church longer than we had,' said Amanda. 'I wanted him to understand that we really did forgive him and that we wanted him to be a part of this with us and grieve with us and know that it’s OK.' After that Amanda says it was the power of prayer that helped the couple as they tried to cope with their loss. The couple also received a blessing on August 12, 2013 with the birth of their son Tommy. 'We love being parents,' said Amanda.

And as she delivered her church speech this holiday season and told her story, she later brought her son over to Lewis, and the man held the young boy in his lap. 'Sometimes as adults we find ourselves in situations that we could only imagine what we would do,' said Amanda as she spoke to the congregation. 'Whether you would forgive a person for wrecking your car, or stealing your bike. You could come up with ideas in your head about what you would do or say to those people.' She ended by saying; 'But sometimes, when those things actually do happen to you, God steps in just when you least expect it.

"A 'Zombie Nativity' scene in a southwest Ohio suburb has remained undead past the deadline to remove it - meaning the resident who created the display will face hefty fines. Sycamore Township officials said last week they had received complaints about debris at the home and concluded that the display violated zoning rules on size and placement of yard structures. They sent resident Jasen Dixon two zoning violation notices and gave him until the day after Christmas to take it down. Facing a fine and legal action, Dixon kept the display up. A Facebook page devoted to the scene urges support for 'freedom of expression.' Scroll down for video . Display: A 'Zombie Nativity' scene stands on the front yard of Jasen Dixon's home in Sycamore Township, Ohio, near Cincinnati on Tuesday . Holiday spirits: The scene has eerie figures including a demonic-looking creature sitting up in the manger where the baby Jesus would be in traditional Christmas nativities . Resident: Jasen Dixon, pictured, has started an online crowdfunding effort to build an even better display next year - and to help cover township citations . The township administrator, Greg Bickford, said Tuesday the owner will face fines of up to $250 a day. Officials say they're not anti-zombie, but pro-zoning rules. 'The property owner will be cited for failure to remove the structure,' Bickford said via email. 'Not the zombies, but the structure.' Dixon indicated he planned to take the display down, but not for forever. He has started an online crowdfunding effort to build an even better display next year - and to help cover township citations. According to his crowdfunding page, Dixon has so far raised $758 out of a $5,000 goal. The scene has eerie figures including a demonic-looking creature sitting up in the manger where the baby Jesus would be in traditional Christmas nativities. There's a detached head with it in the manger, while another ghoulish figure holds a replica heart in its hand as a somber 'Silent Night' plays in the background. Christmas cheer? Jasen Dixon manages a haunted house attraction and used figures from a Halloween display to create what he calls a holiday decoration . Penalty: The township administrator, Greg Bickford, said Tuesday that  Dixon will face fines of up to $250 a day. Officials say they're not anti-zombie, but pro-zoning rules . 'We do live in a free country, don't we?' asked Judy Giese, who lives down the block from Dixon on Vorhees Lane (not related to 'Friday the 13th' movie slasher Jason Voorhees). Auto paint and body shops line the other side of the road in the township nearly 15 miles northeast of Cincinnati. Dixon manages a haunted house attraction and used figures from a Halloween display to create what he calls a holiday decoration. Earlier this month he told Fox Carolina 'I wanted a nativity scene and I worked with what I had.' 'The neighbors don't like it,' he also said at the time. 'My father hates it and anything bad that happens he blames it on that. On the average we probably get 30 or 40 cars stop and taking pictures, getting out with their camera. People that follow zombie movies and stuff like that love it.' Giese said she and her husband took down their own small nativity scene and lights after Christmas, although they left up some little snowman figures for the winter. She doesn't mind if Dixon expands his display, as long as it's not into her yard. 'It's different,' she said, adding that it was quite a hit with guests at their Christmas party. 'It's like being next to an amusement park.'","A 'Zombie Nativity' scene in a southwest Ohio suburb has remained undead past the deadline to remove it .

"Halo Foods has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for suggesting honey is good for children . The Honey Monster has been slapped down by advertising watchdogs for suggesting honey is good for children. The cereal that the character promotes, Sugar Puffs, has been banned from claiming it contains 'honey goodness' – as honey is just as bad for the body as sugar. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the boast amounts to a bogus health claim. Sales of honey are soaring, apparently because of the belief that as a natural product it is better for you. But health experts point out that once honey is consumed it behaves the same way in the body as sugar. The advert on the cereal's website carried the claims: 'Yummy Honey Goodness For A Monsterfied Breakfast... 20% More Honey'. This idea that the cereal – which contains 8.6 grams of sugar per 30g serving – was full of goodness was backed up by claims that it was low in fat and salt and a good source of fibre, vitamins and iron. The ruling came after a complaint by the Children's Food Campaign, which said there was no specific authorised health claim to back up the honey goodness line. Halo Foods, which owns the Honey Monster brand, said it had increased the amount of honey in the cereal while reducing the amount of sugar as part of a re-launch. It said the website and the cereal's packaging provided detailed information about the ingredients and the company was 'transparent' about the sugar content of the product. Halo Foods said it did not intend to make any specific health claims in association with honey and had therefore amended its website to remove any reference to the word goodness. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) concluded that the ad breached regulations because it was not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim and ruled that it must not appear again in its current form. CFC co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said: 'We're pleased that the ASA has stopped the Honey Monster from trying to pull his yellow fur over consumers' eyes and pretend the cereal is healthier than its sugary reality. The Advertising Standards Authority has been banned from claiming the cereal contains 'honey goodness' 'It still contains 8.6g of sugar per bowl - a monsterfied breakfast indeed from a dental health perspective.' He said: 'The Children's Food Campaign should not have to step in so often to hold companies to account and ensure that even the most basic rules are being upheld. Sales of honey have soared recently because of the belief that because it's natural it is better for you . 'Overall, the ASA has yet to show that it is willing to provide proper protection to children from misleading junk food advertising. 'With just over four months until the General Election, we also remain unconvinced that any of the political parties are going to be offering the bold policies needed to effectively tackle junk food marketing to children or the wider obesogenic environment. 'That is the political challenge ahead.' Halo Foods insists the website was simply trying to convey that they had increased the amount of honey and reduced the use of sugar. However, it has since removed use of the word 'goodness'.","Honey behaves the same way in the body as sugar once it's consumed .

"Future astronauts on Mars will need to have green fingers if they're going to survive. A British-led group is planning to grow lettuce on the red planet in the hope  it will help feed a future colony. If its plans are accepted, lettuce could be sent to hostile planet as soon as 2018, as part of the Mars One mission to establish a human settlement there in 2025. Astronauts on Mars will need to have green fingers if they're going to survive. A British-led group is planning to grow lettuce on the red planet in the hopes it will help feed a future colony (artist's impression pictured) On Mars, temperatures drop to -90°C at night, huge dust storms cover the entire planet for weeks, and wind speeds can reach 60mph (30 metres per second). It sounds like a tough environment for any human to survive in, let alone other living creatures such as plants. But the project, being run at the University of Southampton, aims to nurture the salad vegetable in a greenhouse, which would protect it from these harsh conditions. Project leader Suzanna Lucarotti said: 'To live on other planets we need to grow food there. No-one has ever actually done this and we intend to be the first. To boldy grow: The project, being run by students (pictured) at the University of Southampton, aims to nurture the salad vegetable in a greenhouse which will use the atmosphere and sunlight to help it grow . Most of the time, Mars is clear, dry, cold, and clear. Clouds are very small, wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice. It never rains on Mars because the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield, the the one that cover Earth. Temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20°C. But at night, temperatures drop to -90°C. This dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks. The maximum wind speeds on Mars recorded by the Viking Landers in the 1970's were about 30 meters per second (60 mph) with an average of 10 m/s (20 mph). 'This plan is both technically feasible and incredibly ambitious in its scope, for we will be bringing the first complex life to another planet.' For the project, called #LettuceOnMars, the greenhouse would be launched from Earth with lettuce seeds, water, nutrients, and systems for atmospheric processing and electronic monitoring. On the way to Mars, it would be powered down and inactive, during which time the lettuce seeds will be frozen. Following a safe landing, the Mars One lander will start to supply power and heating elements to maintain a temperature between 21°C to 24°C. Carbon dioxide, which is essential for plant life, would be extracted from the Martian atmosphere and processed before entering the growth chamber. The lettuce would then be grown without soil, and would be regularly sprayed with water and nutrients. Once the environment had reached suitable conditions, the plant would start growing. Food for thought: The lettuce could be sent to hostile planet as soon as 2018, as part of the Mars One mission to establish a human settlement there in 2025. Pictured is an artist's concept of a potential colony on Mars . The aim is then for photos of the lettuce to be transmitted to Earth, so the public and scientists would be able to watch the lettuce mature from seed to full plant. Once the mission is completed, the heaters would switch to full power, exterminating all life in the payload. The plan is one of 10 short-listed university projects, and the only one from the UK, to be selected for potential inclusion in the payload for the Mars One landing in 2018. Other entries include Cyano Knight, a German project aiming to change a small amount of the 95 per cent carbon dioxide Mars atmosphere into oxygen using cyanobacteria. A contraption designed to generate the first breathable air on Mars has also reached the finals of a global competition to land experiments on the red planet. German researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system, which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser. They hope a similar greenhouse could one day be used in space to grow vegetables . Students in Southampton aren't the only ones focusing on getting lettuce to Mars. German researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system, which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser. They hope to build a complete greenhouse in Antarctica to test the first space garden in 2016. The system is being developed at the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, and is called Eden (Evolution and Design of Environmentally-closed Nutrition sources). Funded by the Esa, the greenhouses will contain combined life-support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser, helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and Mars environment. Scientist from Virginia are also hoping to use meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes. If the study proves successful, it could help humans grow their own food in space, helping in the quest to colonise other planets.","Plan has been proposed by group of students at Southampton University .

"Since returning to his childhood home this month on vacation, President Barack Obama has spent a good part of most days cloistered with three people whose company puts him at ease. They're not his wife and daughters, who came with him, but a trio of pals whose friendship dates back to Obama's high school days in Hawaii. The three men - Mike Ramos, Bobby Titcomb and Greg Orme - are among the few people still in Obama's life who knew him long before he was famous. Scroll down for video . They go way back: The President is seen above golfing with high school buddies Greg Orme, left, and Mike Ramos, right, in Kailua, Hawaii . Close quarters: The commander in chief leans over to share a thought with old pal Bobby Titcomb as they watch a college sport game in Honolulu . Barack and the boys: The President is seen above with Greg Orme on a 2008 golfing trip . There for you: Obama gives Mike Ramos a hug before getting on Air Force One in 2009 . Although their paths have long since diverged, they've made it a point to gather for frequent reunions, in one of Obama's most visible links to the days when his life was much simpler and his problems more mundane. On this visit alone, Obama has spent more than 22 hours with the group on the lush golf courses that dot the island of Oahu. When it rained, Obama and his pals went bowling, instead. And on Tuesday, in what's become a yearly tradition, the men and their families gathered for a luau hosted by Titcomb. With rain drizzling over Oahu, Obama's motorcade whisked Obama across the island to Titcomb's beachside home in Waialua, about an hour outside of Honolulu on the North Shore. Increasingly, the reunions have become the focal point of Obama's family vacation in his second term as his teenage daughters spend less and less time at their father's side. Once content to join their parents for outings to the aquarium or to get shave ice, Sasha and Malia are now more independent. Since arriving more than a week ago, Obama has been out in public with one of his daughters only once, briefly, during a hike. What Obama and his companions talk about during their many hours alone is anyone's guess. But the foursome rarely goes more than a few months without reconvening in one arrangement or another. Harking back: The foursome gather often, whether in DC or at other Presidential retreats . Firm friends: Obama, shown above when he was a senator in 2008, is seen walking away from a memorial ceremony for his mother alongside Bobby Titcomb, second from left, Orme right . In August, Obama kicked off his 53rd birthday weekend golfing with the three friends in suburban Maryland before heading to Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains. All four were classmates at Punahou School in Honolulu, which Obama has described as 'a prestigious prep school, an incubator for island elites.' In his memoir, 'Dreams From My Father,' Obama recalled a high school career that was, for the most part, ordinary — 'marginal report cards and calls to the principal's office; part-time jobs at the burger chain; acne and driving tests and turbulent desire.' 'I'd made my share of friends at school, gone on the occasional awkward date,' Obama wrote . On vacation: Obama is pictured above hiking with daughter Malia - but his children spend less and less time with him on vacation now . 'And if I sometimes puzzled over the mysterious realignments of status that took place among my classmates, as some rose and others fell depending on the whims of their bodies or the make of their cars, I took comfort in the knowledge that my own position had steadily improved.' Far less is known about Obama's buddies, of course, than about the president himself. All three live mostly private lives when they're not being photographed with the commander in chief. Ramos, who graduated from Punahou in 1978, bonded with Obama over their mutual affinity for jazz. He's lived in Colorado, but was listed as a North Carolina resident when in 2012 he attended a state dinner at the White House that Obama held for British Prime Minister David Cameron. Titcomb, who golfed another two days with Obama this month before the others got into town, was a year behind Obama at Punahou. Titcomb has worked as a commercial fisherman and an airline employee, according to the school's alumni magazine. In 2011, he pleaded no contest to soliciting a prostitute, but Obama has stayed fiercely loyal to his childhood friend. Connection? Analysts have suggested that Obama's new life - full of security, demands and motorcades (above) - has led him to especially value to companionship of his old friends . Obama played basketball at Punahou with Orme, who the alumni magazine says is now a building contractor. Aging photos show Obama and Orme decked out in 1970s fashion with their dates before attending a high school prom. Among U.S. presidents, Obama is not alone in carving out time regularly to reconnect with his roots. Franklin D. Roosevelt made frequent trips back to Hyde Park, N.Y., throwing picnics or barbecues for former neighbors and friends, and George H.W. Bush remained pals with men he served with in World War II. In the second term, presidents have often sought refuge from the pressure by disappearing into nature to fish or hunt, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. But such solitude has become less and less attainable for presidents in modern times. 'Many people call Obama aloof, and he hasn't made a lot of friends in Washington,' Brinkley said. 'When you're president, everybody wants something from you and only these types of friends are able to simply want your well-being. They have a different level of affection for you than friends you meet later in life.'","President has spent much of his Christmas vacation with three men .

"Charges: Jin Ackerman is accused of the murder of Antonino Isnit at a Las Vegas Walmart the morning after Christmas Day . A hold-up in a Las Vegas Walgreens ended in tragedy the morning after Christmas Day when the armed robber shot dead the store clerk when he realized he used to work with him. Jin Ackerman, 25, fired on Antonino Isnit, 58, saying, 'Sorry Tony, but you know me' before he opened fire according to the police report. Ackerman was apprehended and arrested by a SWAT team at his home on Friday and officers revealed that he knew Isnit from his time at the same store in 2011. According to the police report, Ackerman entered the Walgreens at around 4am on Friday morning dressed in gray clothes, a black pea coat and a surgical mask. He asked a female employee to help him find another surgical mask and then asked her to let him use the bathroom. Suddenly, Ackerman forcibly shoved the woman into the bathroom with him when she opened it and emptied her pockets and handcuffed her. The woman also told police that the 25-year-old suspect fixed a silencer to a pistol he produced. However, the woman was paged by Isnit to the front desk when he wondered where she had got to and Ackerman realized she had to return. He commanded her to 'act normal' according to the Las Vegas Review Journal and crytically told her not to cry and that the silencer was 'for Tony'. Scroll Down for Video . Mother and son: Antonino Isnit is pictured here with his 91-year-old mother last year - he is her primary carer . Police say the alleged robber, Jin Ackerman, 25, worked with the victim, Antonino Isnit, 58, three years ago at the Walgreens on 8500 W. Cheyenne Ave., near Rampart Boulevard in Las Vegas . Police claim that Ackerman told the woman he had done this before and the two walked to the front of the store and were met by Isnit. The unidentified woman managed to convince Isnit to go on a break and then emptied the safe for Ackerman who took between $5,000 and $7,000. However, Isnit returned and asked Ackerman 'why he was still here'. It was then that Ackerman told Isnit he was going to kill him because he knew and according to the police 11 shell casing were found near to the 58-year-old's body. Shrine: Members of the public have set up a make-shift memorial to the popular store clerk shot dead on December 26 . Tragedy: It was Antonino's misfortune to be in the store at the same time as the robbery took place at 4am . Police in Las Vegas have said that Ackerman and Isnit worjked together at the Walgreens on 8500 W. Cheyenne Ave in October 2011 before the younger man left to work in another chain of the pharmacy. He was fired from the Walgreens at the Venetian hotel in July 2013 for 'improper use of the computer regarding employee files.' Police have also linked Ackerman to another armed robbery of a Walgreens on Christmas Eve and the suspect was allegedly wearing a surgical mask. It took SWAT teams seven hours to locate Ackerman at his home and he is now facing one count of murder, four counts of kidnapping, two for robbery and two for burglarly with a gun.","Jin Ackerman, 25, shot dead Antonino Isnit, 58, at Las Vegas Walmart .

"Two adult film actors have contracted HIV, with one most likely infecting the other during unprotected sex at a film shoot in Nevada where testing was less stringent than industry standards, officials said. One of the actors had previously tested negative for the virus that causes AIDS before a pair of film shoots, but then began showing symptoms during the second shoot and was later found to be HIV-positive, the California Department of Public Health said Monday in a statement. 'In this case, the actor and production company thought he was HIV-negative during filming,' the statement said. 'Shortly after his negative test, HIV levels in his body rose rapidly to where he could infect other actors through unprotected sex.' One of the actors previously tested negative for the virus that causes AIDS before a pair of film shoots but then began showing symptoms during the second shoot and was later found to be HIV-positive, the California Department of Public Health said (file photo) The infections came amid a major decline in porn filming in Los Angeles County, once the center of porn production in the country, where a 2012 law requires actors to use condoms. The number of porn filmmakers applying for filming permits in the county declined from 485 in 2012 to 40 in 2013. The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group for the adult film industry, said the pair of film shoots linked to the latest infections occurred in September on a Nevada set using tests that do not detect HIV as early as tests done on sets that fully comply with industry standards. 'Not only did this leave those who participated at risk, it made it much harder to track scene partners once the possible infection was discovered,' the coalition group said in a statement. The group said it joined the California Department of Public Health in declaring a production moratorium when the infections were first discovered. It said performers on sets that complied with the more stringent protocols were tested and the moratorium was lifted. Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said infections have happened before during porn productions and will likely happen again. 'The big lie the industry has been saying all these years, there are no on-set transmissions, has been proven to be untrue,' he said. The states of Nevada and California do not require porn actors to be tested for HIV, said Weinstein, who has pushed for testing laws in both states and helped pass the condom law in Los Angeles County. Testing is required under industry rules. The Free Speech Coalition said regulations such as the condom law drive filmmakers to locations where they don't undergo as much scrutiny by the industry. 'Non-compliant shoots are one of the chief dangers of pushing the adult industry' out of California, the group's statement said. California health officials would not give further details about the latest cases, citing privacy restrictions. A message left with public health officials in Nevada was not immediately returned. The industry has declared several production moratoriums in recent years, but most were for infections believed to have occurred in the private lives of actors rather than during film shoots. The last confirmed on-set HIV infection was in 2004. After that, the porn industry adopted monthly testing for a range of sexually transmitted diseases. Last year, the industry increased testing to every 14 days after a woman contracted HIV. The last confirmed on-set HIV infection was in 2004.

"The internet is awash with dogs, cats and even rats all vying to capture our hearts and become stars. But one pampered Pomeranian has turned pro, and is raking in £6,000-a-year after becoming a social media sensation, with thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers. Glamorous pooch Harvey Moon was rescued from kennels as a puppy by Stephanie Mariam, who has since spent £15,000 on turning her pet into a well-groomed superstar. Pomeranian Harvey Moon has £800 a month spent on him. His outfits cost £140 a month and his 'Pawdicures' cost £60. He receives gifts from fans worth hundreds of pounds . Harvey, who was rescued as a puppy, now has thousands of followers on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter . The mental health nurse and dance teacher ploughs £800 a month - more than half her earnings - into keeping him pristine for his profile pictures. He has his own wardrobe, enjoys £40 hair extensions every month and regularly changes his colour thanks to £200 fur dyes imported from America. Harvey now has a dedicated following of 8,000 Facebook fans and 500 Instagram and Twitter followers who lavish the pooch with gifts. And Stephanie's investment has definitely paid off as Harvey now makes £6,000-a-year in personal appearance and sponsorship fees. Four-year-old Harvey even has his own bank account, agent, stylist and personal assistant.  appearances. Stephanie, 21, said: 'Making Harvey famous might have cost a lot of money, but it doesn't seem that much from week to week. 'It's worth it - he loves the attention.' Mental health nurse Stephanie Mariam has  lspent £15,000 on turning her pet into a well-groomed superstar . She continued: 'Social media means that Harvey can achieve his dream of being a worldwide icon. He's definitely a diva, and Facebook is the perfect place for him to show off.' Stephanie rescued Harvey in 2011 when he was just six months old - he had been badly neglected by previous owners. After taking him home in Bournemouth, Stephanie started buying  bespoke dog jackets to keep him cosy. She said: 'Harvey loved the attention. He began to trot over to the wardrobe and pull out his favourite outfits for me to dress him up.' Loving how cute the Pomeranian looked in photos, Stephanie created a Facebook page in Harvey's name in April 2012. As Harvey racked up followers, Stephanie created an Instagram and Twitter account to boost his celebrity status further. She started to splash more cash to make his profile stand out from other cute pets. Harvey has rocked a range of styles and colours in his fur, from bright green to neon pink . In April 2013, Stephanie began spending £200 a month importing vegetable-based doggie dyes from America to keep Harvey's look fresh. He has since rocked a range of styles and colours, from bright green to neon pink. And flat fur won't do for this high-maintenance hound either - Stephanie channels £40 a month into luxury feather fur extensions to keep Harvey's coat voluminous and make his pictures stand out. In 2013, Stephanie received a call from an agent who had seen Harvey's profile and loved his glamorous look. The agent got Harvey a gig as an extra in the music video for urban grime act Roll Deep's 'All or Nothing' - netting an impressive £700 for his bank account. Stephanie said: 'After he appeared in the music video, Harvey's fan base grew even more. 'Facebook followers would comment on my posts and pictures of Harvey all the time and they even started to send him presents.' Harvey started to receive gifts posted from fans from as far away as Amsterdam, Egypt and Asia. Among the most lavish bestowed upon the pooch was a Louis Vuitton top worth £200 and a Swarovski-encrusted collar worth £300. Sensing the power of Facebook publicity, Stephanie began using the social media site to promote the pooch's public appearances. She said: 'People wanted to see Harvey so much that if I posted that we were going to be somewhere, fans turn up wanting to be photographed with him and upload the pics on their own social media.' As Harvey's public popularity grew, so did the amount of money Stephanie channelled into pampering the high-maintenance pup. She said: 'I want him to become an international icon, so I knew I had to put the time and money into making it happen.' To keep Harvey's fur in A-list condition for his profile pictures, she began ploughing £75 a week into Harvey's grooming regime. This includes a wash and blow dry to keep his coat glossy from nose to tail, 'pawdicures' and treatments to buffer the pads of his feet and facials. Stephanie channels £40 a month into luxury feather fur extensions to keep Harvey's coat voluminous and make his pictures stand out . Four-year-old Harvey has his own bank account, agent, PA and an expensive designer wardrobe . Stephanie also started to spend £140 a month on new outfits for Harvey so he can boast the latest in doggie designer gear in his Facebook snaps. She said: 'I have two wardrobes in my room and three-quarters of the space is taken up with Harvey's outfits. 'He wears every outfit at least once. He will parade around in it and I'll snap a picture to upload it to Facebook so his fans know he appreciates the pressies.' His unique profile - which features pictures of the Pomeranian perched on a throne, wearing crystal-encrusted outfits and sporting neon-coloured fur - captured the attention of dog modelling agency Diva Dogs. Food: £120 (Harvey only eats prepared meals from Lily's Kitchen - freshly sourced meals with all-natural ingredients, and antioxidants to help him age gracefully) Outfits: £140 . Facials: £60 . Feather extensions: £40 . Pawdicures: £60 . Leads:  £50 . Fur dye: £200 . Cologne:  £25 . Travel expenses: £150 . Total: £845 . The agency approached Stephanie and offered to represent him last September. Later that month, Harvey became the animated face of Dennis Holmes Energy Saving company. With his army of Facebook fans tipping the 8,000 mark, Stephanie invested even more in boosting her pup's profile. And if the celebrity pressure becomes too much for Harvey Moon, he can sleep it off comfortably - in one of the three mini-four poster beds Stephanie has bought for him, at a cost of £700. Stephanie says: 'Harvey's Facebook fame is going to his head. Now, he sits on the ground and refuses to go outside if it's raining. He thinks it will mess up his fur. 'I've also had to buy special coats that are designed with cooling pads to stop him getting flustered in the summer - they're £60 each.'","Stephanie Mariam from Bournemouth spends £800 a month on pet Harvey .

"A father-of-six who received a disability pension for 16 years has been ordered to repay $73,000 after it was revealed that he lied about his lucrative portfolio and impressive income. Victorian man Peter Kooyoufas claimed a disability pension whilst owning ‘multiple’ properties, a collection of extravagant vehicles, collected ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ in rent and secretly ran a poultry business. In April 2012, Centrelink ordered that Kooyoufas repay a portion of his pension after it was discovered he had purchased a poultry farm for $530,000 in Cranbourne South, 45 kilometres south east of Melbourne's CBD. Kooyoufas made an appeal against the order to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but was unsuccessful after investigations uncovered many years of deceit. Whilst receiving his disability pension, Peter Kooyoufas concealed his lucrative collection of cars,  including a 1971 Rolls-Royce . The man, who also goes by the name ‘Pangioti Kooyoufas’, has been fined three and a half year's worth of payments to the sum of $78,813.71 . It was discovered that the man had operated 28 different bank accounts whilst he was on the pension from March 1996 until April 2012. The man, who also goes by the name ‘Pangioti Kooyoufas’, has been fined three and a half year's worth of payments to the sum of $78,813.71. This figure only accounts for the payments he received from Centrelink from November 2008 until his pension was cancelled. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found that Kooyoufas continually rorted the department from the time of his initial pension application in 1995. ""I have no hesitation on the evidence before me in finding that Mr Kooyoufas deliberately failed to disclose the ownership of (Mount Waverley) to Centrelink at the time of his applications in 1995 and 1996 for the DSP,"" AAT senior member Egon Fice found. Kooyoufas' deceit  was first uncovered when the department were made aware that he had purchased a Victorian poultry farm for $530,000 and running it as a business . Kooyoufas’ claimed was that he was not the owner of many of the properties, nor was he running businesses.

"It could mean the end for lightbulbs - and turn any object in your home into a light. Researchers have revealed lightpaper, a way to print sheets of 'paper' infused with tiny LEDs. They say it can be applied to walls, and even printed onto other objects - turning anything into a light. Scroll down for video . Idaho researchers have revealed lightpaper, a way to print sheets of 'paper' infused with tiny LEDs - and it can even be used to print wallpaper that doubles as a light. Lightpaper is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny LEDs together and printing them out on a conductive layer. It can even be used as wallpaper . Lightpaper is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny LEDs together and printing them out on a conductive layer. That object is then sandwiched between two other layers and sealed. The tiny diodes are about the size of a red blood cell, and randomly dispersed on the material. When current runs through the diodes, they light up. The breakthrough has been likened to the emergence of 3D printing, and the firm behind it admits even it isn't sure how it will be used. The world's thinnest light, it is printed and flexible, Rohini, the firm behind it says. 'Today's lighting methods require soldering LED to circuit boards - now you can just print light on what you want'. The firm has shown off wallpaper , car logos and even snowboards with display using the paper built in. 'With Lightpaper it's more of a platform of light that we don't even know how it's going to be used,' Rohinni CMO Nick Smoot told Fastco. 'All we know is that we're trying to unlock the ability to create light.' 'The magical thing about this solution is it's brighter, it's thinner, it's flexible, it's addressable, and programmable.

"Tony Blair has issued his most withering assessment of Ed Miliband to date, suggesting he has turned Labour into a ‘traditional Left-wing party’ and predicting he will lose the general election. The former prime minister indicated he thought Mr Miliband had deserted the political centre ground, leaving the Tories likely to win. In a thinly veiled swipe at the Labour leader’s approach to business, Mr Blair said winning elections was about ‘not alienating large parts’ of the business community. Scroll down for video . Former prime minister Tony Blair (pictured right) has indicated he thought Mr Miliband (left) had deserted the political centre ground, leaving the Tories likely to win in next year's general election . His comments are a particularly severe blow to Mr Miliband because they come less than five months before May’s election. They are the latest in a series of attacks by the former premier on the way he is leading the party. Mr Blair, who led Labour to three election victories, was speaking in an interview with the respected Economist magazine. It described his comments as surprisingly ‘outspoken’. In the interview, Mr Blair rejected the analysis made by senior Labour figures that the financial crisis means British voters want a more Left-wing government. Mr Miliband has attacked predatory capitalism and spooked companies with his pledge to freeze energy bills. Mr Blair said May’s poll could be an election ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. Asked if he meant a Tory win, he said: ‘Yes, that’s what happens.’ He denied the political centre ground has shifted as a result of the financial crisis. ‘I see no evidence for that,’ he said. ‘You could argue that it has moved to the Right, not Left.’ Mr Blair, who had three election victories, levelled a thinly veiled swipe at the Labour leader’s approach to business and said winning elections was about ‘not alienating large parts’ of business community . Mr Blair said the 2010 poll was a ‘classic tax-and-spend election’ which the Tories won. He added: ‘I am still very much New Labour and Ed would not describe himself in that way, so there is obviously a difference there.’ He added: ‘I’m convinced the Labour Party succeeds best when it is in the centre ground.’ Asked what lessons he took from winning elections, Mr Blair highlighted ‘not alienating large parts of business, for one thing’. Earlier this month, he criticised MPs who, like Mr Miliband, have never had a proper job outside politics. He told the New York Times the ‘gene pool’ of political leaders had suffered because too few candidates have ‘real life experience’. He suggested too many graduates went straight from university to a job as a political researcher, before becoming an MP. Mr Miliband was elected to the Commons nine years ago, having done little after his philosophy, politics and economics degree at Oxford apart from working in the Treasury as a special adviser. A week earlier Mr Blair cast doubt on whether Mr Miliband could win the election, saying Labour needed a ‘strong’ leader. And two months before that, he was forced to deny claims he had privately told allies that Mr Miliband cannot beat David Cameron, due to his failure to connect with voters. Labour declined to respond to the comments, but sources said Mr Blair had said ‘exactly the same thing’ in October. They pointed to comments from the former premier in which he said he wants and expects Labour to win under Mr Miliband. Labour’s lead in the polls has evaporated this year. It is now neck-and-neck with the Tories. In November, Mr Miliband saw off an attempt by backbenchers to oust him in what became known as the ‘bonfire night plot’. It followed a devastating attack on his leadership by the New Statesman magazine – the traditional journal of the Left – which described him as an ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’.","Former prime minster has predicted Ed Miliband will lose general election .

"This is the nerve-racking moment a shirtless drugged-up man leaps more than 20 feet from a bridge and miraculously gets up unscathed. Jorge Jr. Fosado Lopez filmed the terrifying scene take place on a highway in Tijuana, Mexico, last month but the footage was only recently uploaded  by police to highlight the dangers of intoxication. The clip shows 35-year-old Hilario Guajardo leaping from an overhead pass at night and falling flat on his back before springing back to two feet. He was apparently on the run from authorities and decided to plunge off the bridge in a bid to escape. Once he's landed, Guajardo claps his hands and does a twirl in celebration that he survived the fall. Lopez appears to be shocked as he exchanges worried words with a female passenger in Spanish. Guajardo is seen confidently walking towards the couple down the middle of the road with his arms swinging by his side. He seems to be in a slight daze as he twists his head to look at the surroundings. Luckily there were no vehicles in his pathway when he performed the potentially deadly-feat. The stunt took place on November 20. Police say Guajardo had taken a 'cocktail of drugs' before they arrived at the scene. Nerve-racking: This is the moment a shirtless drugged-up man leaps more than 20 feet from a bridge .

Recalling the chain of events, Lopez said: 'I saw him crash to the ground and was expecting him to stay lying on the ground but he just got up and walked off with no visible sign of injury. 'Everyone was pretty stunned but it took a while for the police to realize that unless they acted they were going to lose him.' Officers managed to catch Guajardo and later posted the video to the Tijuana's Secretary of Public Safety Facebook page to warn about the dangers officers face daily. 'This incident highlights the sort of danger officers face on a daily basis when dealing with people who have taken a cocktail of drugs,' they wrote. 'It makes them do things that they would never normally dream of, they put their own lives and the lives of others in danger, and also in some cases seem to have almost superhuman abilities to ignore pain.'","Jorge Jr. Fosado Lopez filmed the terrifying scene take place on a highway in Tijuana, Mexico, last month .

"Taxi from hell: Former Uber driver Maxime Fohounhedo (pictured) is due in Chicago court on Tuesday to face charges of sexual assault after allegedly raping a 22-year-old passenger last month . A former Uber driver is due in court today after allegedly raping a 22-year-old passenger last month. The unidentified woman says driver Maxime Fohounhedo picked her up on November 16 and that she later woke up to him on top of her in an unfamiliar apartment. The 30-year-old driver faces charges of  sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse. Fohounhedo is the latest in a string of sex assault claims against Uber drivers that have been plaguing the taxi app company recently. The victim was finishing a night of partying with her co-workers when she ordered an Uber X driver around 3am to take her home a bar in Chicago's North River neighborhood, according to a police report obtained byDNAinfo. About 20 minutes into the ride, Fohounhedo allegedly asked her to come sit in the front seat since he was unfamiliar with the area. When they reached the area of Western and Lawrence Avenues, the victim says the driver started to assault her and that she blacked out. Later, she recalls waking up in a residence on the 2600 block of West Lawrence Avenue with Fohounhedo on top of her. After he was done raping her, she says he took her home in the same black car and that she texted a friend about the incident back at home before falling asleep. 'I was just sexually assaulted by my Uber driver and I'm supberb (sic) drunk, but I need someone to remind me to follow through to make sure this never happens again,' she wrote to the friend, according to the report. The victim was later treated at Swedish Covenant Hospital. Safe? The ride sharing app has been criticized by regular taxi unions who claim they don't perform thorough background checks on drivers . Though Uber keeps a record of their drivers' routes, it took more than a month to arrest Fohounhedo for the crime. He was fired from the company in December, in the wake of the allegations. In a statement issued on December 9, an Uber spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the victim and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the incident, and are cooperating with the Chicago Police Department.' Fohounhedo is just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the U.S. in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped. Taxi cab union have been critiquing ride-sharing service like Uber and competitor Lyft for their background checks, claiming they aren't as thorough as typical cab services.","Maxime Fohounhedo, 30, faces charges of sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse .

"Wine sold for upwards of $15,000 a bottle was stolen from the French Laundry in Napa Valley, a restaurant that has twice been named the best in the world. The theft occurred on Christmas Day at Chef Thomas Keller's famed restaurant that is known for twice daily serving nine-course tasting menus, none of which uses the same ingredient more than once.

Grubstreet notes that 63 of the 76 bottles stolen bore the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti label including vintages that auction on the private market for several thousand dollars each--up to $15,000 or more. Certain vintages of another beloved label sold at French Laundry, California's Screaming Eagle, retails for over $7,000 a pop. Sadly, the theft occurred just a day after the beloved restaurant served its final meal for the indefinite future.

In 2003 and 2004 the French Laundry was named best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine. Police are investigating. In his posts, Chef Thomas' remained confident that, given the rarity of the wines, the culprit will be brought to justice. 'We have complete trust in the authorities leading the investigation, and we welcome any information our community may have regarding the event,' he said.

"Horrified shoppers saw a man fall 50ft from an escalator in one of London’s most famous department stores yesterday. Witnesses described screaming and shouting as he plunged five storeys to the ground floor of Peter Jones. The store in Sloane Square, Chelsea, was bustling with post-Christmas bargain hunters. Police erected a blue tent over the spot where he landed. The unnamed man, believed to be in his early twenties, was said to have thrown himself backwards from the escalator. He was fighting for his life in hospital with multiple injuries last night. A police tent was put up after a man fell in Peter Jones department store in central London today . Shoppers were asked to leave the store just after 1pm. One, Lydia Mensah, said: ‘I was on the first floor. I saw the immediate aftermath. ‘There was a commotion, screaming and shouting, and I saw the man lying on the floor. There was blood, but staff were crowding round the man and telling us to stand back. ‘Staff said he fell from the fifth floor to the ground floor. They were all very upset. One woman who witnessed it was taken away – she was shaking.’ Sara Halub, assistant manager at a shop opposite Peter Jones, said: ‘Lots of people came into the shop and were talking about what had happened. ‘I spoke to one lady who said he was going down the escalator and threw himself backwards off it and landed on his back. ‘She said he had made a hole in the ground and someone was by his side the whole time until the ambulance arrived.’ An assistant at another nearby shop added: ‘Two ambulances pulled up outside around 1pm, then the shop closed. A shopper in the store after the incident said there was a 'sombre atmosphere'  among staff and customers . It is thought the man fell from an escalator  around 1pm this lunchtime. He has been taken to hospital . ‘A shopper came in and said she saw blood all over the floor. It’s so awful.’ An Italian man who had been shopping with his wife said: ‘I was told a young man threw himself from the fifth floor, down the side of the escalators. ‘It’s quite a narrow gap, so there’s no way it could happen by accident. It’s so sad.’ One shopper who was in the store said: ‘There was a very sombre atmosphere and staff were standing next to railings asking people not to look over. ‘There was an ambulance and police cars outside when I arrived and when I went inside I saw that all of the escalators had been switched off.’ The man was taken by ambulance to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, with head and chest injuries. Emergency services rushed to the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square after the incident . The store, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, is in a 1930s grade II listed building that was refurbished in 2004. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that officers were called to the incident at 1.05pm. A spokesman said: ‘Officers, paramedics and London’s Air Ambulance attended and the man, believed to be in his 20s, was taken to hospital suffering multiple injuries that are thought to be life threatening at this stage. ‘Officers are at the scene as inquiries continue.’ A John Lewis spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that police were called to our Peter Jones shop at 1.05pm following a serious customer incident. ‘Police and London ambulance service attended the scene and John Lewis continues to work with the relevant authorities.’ The store is expected to reopen today.","Man reportedly fell from fifth floor escalator after 1pm this afternoon .

"A senior member of the al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab militant group has been killed by a U.S. air strike in Somalia, the Pentagon has confirmed. The Pentagon announced today that a U.S. airstrike on Monday killed the intelligence chief of the al-Shabab extremist group in Somalia, Tahlil Abdishakur. Abdishakur was the head of Amniyat, a unit believed responsible for suicide attacks in Mogadishu, Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency said in a statement. The Pentagon said U.S. drone aircraft fired several Hellfire missiles to hit a vehicle carrying the al-Shabab intelligence chief. The U.S. military launched an air strike in Somalia on Monday targeting a senior leader of the al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab militant group, but are yet to comment on whether their mission was a success . The Somali government announced the death on Tuesday but the Pentagon did not immediately confirm. The Pentagon has now said his death will ‘significantly impact’ the group's ability to conduct attacks against the Somali government and its people, as well as U.S. allies in the region. Al-Shabab is an ultra-conservative Islamic militant group that is linked to the al-Qaeda terrorist network and wants to run Somalia by its strict interpretation of Shariah law. In a statement released by the Somali government, a spokesman said: 'In a joint operation last night by the Somali national security and the United States, al-Shabaab intelligence chief Abdishakur, also known as Tahlil, who replaced the recently arrested former chief, was eliminated,'  adding that the strike took place near the town of Saacow, some 200 miles west of the capital Mogadishu. A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday that Abdishakur was killed in the attack along with another Shabaab militant who was not identified. The air strike came two days after top al-Shabaab militant, Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi turned himself in; above, an armed member of the militant group al-Shabab attends a rally in support of the merger of the Somali militant group al-Shabab with al-Qaida, on the outskirts of Mogadishu, in September . The strike was the latest in a recent campaign against al Shabaab. In September, a U.S. drone strike killed the group's main leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane. Mark Wright, U.S. defense department spokesman, said earlier the air strike took place near Saakow, but the success of the operation was not yet known. He said:  'We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available.' Wright said there  no civilians or bystanders had been injured . Despite militants suffering huge losses in recent years, including the killing of their leader in a US air strike earlier this year, al-Shabaab remains a threat. The U.S. has supported the African Union force that has driven al-Shabab out of the capital Mogadishu and other towns since 2011. Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was killed by a U.S. air strike in September. The air strike came two days after top al-Shabaab militant, Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi, reportedly gave himself up. He was part of a $3 million U.S. State Department 'Rewards for Justice' programme. Reports have said Hersi turned himself in to Somali government and African Union troops on Saturday.","Pentagon has today confirmed senior member of the al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab militant group was killed by a U.S. air strike in Somalia on Monday .

"Government officers protecting Australian airports will soon be allowed to carry weapons as part of the move to establish the Australian Border Force. The move to issue Customs and Border Protection Service officers with personal defensive equipment, including guns, is part of changes to the structure of the agency guarding Australia's entry points. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said equipping officers with weapons would add an extra layer of deterrence at Australia's borders. Customs and Border Protection Service officers will be given weapons as part of tougher security measures being brought in across Australian airports in 2015 . Passengers at Australian airports will notice increased security measures in the new year as the Federal Government implements tougher measures at entry points . Federal Police have had an increased presence across major airports since August . 'People smugglers, transnational crime gangs and narcotic traffickers should be under no illusion,' he said. 'This government is serious about border protection. 'This measure will not only increase the capability of our future Border Force officers, it will also add another layer of deterrence at our borders, and will ensure that the travelling public is as safe as possible,"" Mr Dutton said. New Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has signalled his intention to get tough with criminals stating 'coming to Australia is a privilege and if you're coming here harming Australians, ripping off our welfare system, committing serious crimes, then you're at the top of my list for deporting' The new Immigration Minister has vowed to come down hard on criminal syndicates, giving Customs officials access to weapons and threatening to deport anyone convicted of serious crime or welfare fraud . The AFP is one of several agencies charged with securing Australian airports. Customs and Border Protection will be transformed into the Australian Border Force from July 2015 . The new Immigration Minister, who took over the portfolio during the recent Cabinet reshuffle, said officers would be better trained to deal with the 'complex' challenges they face. Customs and Border Protection will be transformed into the Australian Border Force from July 2015. Mr Dutton took to social media to outline his hard-line approach. 'If you're an illegal bikie, if you're part of an outlaw motorcycle gang involved in organised criminal activity, you've just made it to the top of my list, Mr Dutton stated. 'Coming to Australia is a privilege and if you're coming here harming Australians, ripping off our welfare system, committing serious crimes, then you're at the top of my list for deporting.' His predecessor, Scott Morrison, recently announced beefed up security measures at major Australian airports. 'This is a critical step in the creation of the border force. It ensures better monitoring of our borders 24/7 in real time from the (Strategic Border Command) headquarters in Canberra,' he said. The link, which includes live operational pictures beamed back to the HQ in the nation's capital, will enable resources be 'deployed as they are needed'.","Customs officers will be armed with handguns in 2015 .

"Hillary Clinton jolted her supporters this morning with an 'Announcement' email, only it wasn't the type of announcement they were likely expecting. Instead of declaring her candidacy for president, the former secretary of state told benefactors of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation that her family would personally match donations to the nonprofit before the end of the year. The timing of the email coincides with Clinton's self-imposed deadline to fully embrace a presidential run or make way for serious Democratic contenders. The 2008 presidential candidate has said she would make public her decision early in the New Year. It's not what you're thinking: Hillary Clinton's 'Announcement' this morning was that her family would match donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation . And while her email today was nothing more than a bait and switch tactic, she could take to take to the internet to make a formal declaration. On Jan. 20, 2007 Clinton launched a campaign website with clear message: 'I'm in. And I'm in to win.' She followed the statement with a video reintroducing herself to voters. Traditionally presidential candidates have officially launched their campaigns at staged rallies packed with early adopters. Standing on the steps of the building where Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln began his political career, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama told a crowd of supporters on Feb. 10, 2007 that he would seek higher office. And on June 2, 2011, Mitt Romney chose a 250-year-old farmhouse in the First-In-The-Nation state, New Hampshire, to make his challenge to then-President Obama official. The days of televised in-person announcements may now be a thing of the past, however, as the internet and social media take on a more prominent role in political campaigns. Jeb Bush, the first major 2016 candidate to confirm that he would 'actively explore' a campaign, made his intentions known in a Facebook post. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whose known for his robust Twitter presence, has also teased a presidential announcement on social media channels, tweeting a photo of a fake 'Rand Paul 2016' turtleneck last week. Not missing a beat, a spokesperson for the likely Republican candidate told DailyMail.com that the shirt referred to his 2016 Senate campaign. Clinton's email this morning revealed little about her hotly anticipated campaign announcement. The email, sent on behalf of her family's non-profit organization, was strictly apolitical. 'This is a season to give thanks for our many blessings and to remember our responsibilities to each other – that we're all in this together,' she wrote, according to The Weekly Standard. 'In my family, we're celebrating our first holidays with a beautiful new granddaughter. We're also celebrating the generosity and commitment of our incredible Clinton Foundation family – and that means you.' Any Day Now: The former first lady and and president are pictured here attending a showing of The Last Ship in New York City on December 20. Hillary Clinton is expected to announce a second bid for the presidency in the new few weeks . Continuing, she told the foundation's donors 'there's so much more to do together' in the New Year, 'but we can't do it without you. 'That's why Bill, Chelsea, and I will triple every $1 donated to the Clinton Foundation before the end of the year, up to an additional $100,000. 'Support the life-changing work of the Clinton Foundation with a tax-deductible gift now, and we will personally match your donation $2 to $1, up to $200,000,' she said. The email said gifts would go to 'empowering women and girls around the world,' helping 'parents and businesses take meaningful actions to improve the health and well-being of children' and 'bringing employers, educators, and young people together to help our kids get the skills and support they need to find good and fulfilling jobs,' among other initiatives supported by the Clinton Foundation. 'We have plenty of work ahead of us in 2015. I am so excited to move these initiatives forward,' she said. 'I know that there are no limits to what we can achieve together.'","She told benefactors of the Clinton Foundation that her family would personally match donations to the nonprofit through year's end .

"Zoran Pokusevski, pictured, only received five replies from British people when he advertised for workers for his new deli . Opening a delicatessen in a jobless blackspot might have been expected to generate a flood of applications from locals eager to snap up the ten posts on offer. But Zoran Pokusevski was shocked by the response when he advertised for staff for his venture near the BBC’s gleaming northern complex in Salford. The jobless rate is nearly one-and-a-half times the national average – but only five out of the 70 hopefuls with the right skills were British. The remainder were immigrants from Eastern Europe or Spain. Out of the British candidates, only two turned up for an interview to be rewarded with jobs where they will be paid £8-an-hour plus tips. The extraordinary statistic will add to fears that unemployed Britons who are used to life on benefits cannot match the work ethic of new arrivals. Mr Pokusevski is expanding from his original well-received branch in the relatively prosperous Stockport suburb of Heaton Moor. Although he has a PhD in chemical engineering, the 42-year-old Serbian set up a deli in 2003 after coming to Britain in the 1990s following the Balkans conflict. Yesterday Mr Pokusevski told of his surprise that so few locals had applied for his jobs. His experience showed why many employers felt they could not manage without foreign labour, he added . ‘I feel if you put a stop to immigration, you might struggle because it simply didn’t happen,’ he said on a BBC Radio 5 Live discussion on immigration. ‘English people didn’t want to work. In my view it’s just supply and demand.’ Last month, the Daily Mail asked: ‘Is there no-one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?’ This followed the revelation that Greencore Group, which supplies major supermarkets, was looking in Hungary to fill 300 posts at its new Northampton factory as too few Britons would do the job. Mr Pokusevski told the Mail that he would have preferred to have more local staff at his new deli. ‘For front of house, it’s actually an advantage to me if people are British because they’re better at communicating with customers. ‘But the people who applied were predominantly Polish, with quite a few Spanish and other nationalities like Slovakian, and hardly any English,’ he said. Mr Pokusevski said he only invited those with relevant experience for interview although the positions included low-skill posts such as three kitchen porters. ‘It tends to be mainly foreign nationals who apply for jobs across the catering industry – I suppose they have no choice – but I’m paying well above minimum wage with tips on top,’ he added. ‘I’m very pleased with the staff I’ve recruited. They’ve got a good work ethic, they’re never late and they’re very hard-working. We’re a happy European family!’ Mr Pokusevski's new venture is only a short distance from the BBC's media city in Salford, pictured . All the staff at his first delicatessen are local British workers although the area has much lower unemployment. For his Salford venture, Mr Pokusevski advertised on recruitment websites, mainly attracting foreign nationals living in the area. In future, he plans to use local job creation initiatives in the hope of attracting a broader range of applicants. His latest project is perfectly placed to attract custom from the high-rise MediaCity complex, now the base of BBC Breakfast and Radio 5 Live as well as Granada TV and Coronation Street. According to the most recent figures, 11,900 people were unemployed in Salford in the year to last June, a rate of 10.1 per cent compared to 6.8 per cent nationally. Across North-West England, only Liverpool, Rochdale and Burnley had a higher unemployment rate. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system discouraged Britons from working.","Only five Britons applied for  a post in Zoran Pokusevski's new Salford deli .

"The prosecutor in the case involving the death of Eric Garner says he is 'very seriously considering' submitting his name for consideration to replace resigning New York City congressman Michael Grimm. Grimm, a Republican, said on Monday that he would vacate his Staten Island congressional seat on Jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo must now call a special election to be held within 70 to 80 days of his announcement. Daniel Donovan, Staten Island's district attorney, indicated today that he is interested in representing the Republican Party in the contest to fill the state's 11th congressional district. Scroll down for video . Daniel Donovan, Staten Island's district attorney, indicated today that he is interested in representing the Republican Party in the contest to fill Michael Grimm's congressional district . Other potential GOP contenders are New York Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, right, and State Senator Andrew Lanza, left, one of Grimm's competitors in the 2010 Republican primary . 'Last night and this morning, with the announcement that a vacancy will exist, my phone has been ringing off the hook,' Donovan said in a statement, according to the New York Observer. 'I am deeply flattered by the enthusiastic expressions of support I have received over the last 12 hours, and I am very seriously considering the race. I will make an announcement after the due deliberation such an important decision deserves.' Donovan's previous experience in politics extends back to 2010 when he ran for state attorney general and lost to Democrat Eric Schneiderman. He is best known, however, for prosecuting a police officer who put Staten Island resident Eric Garner in a choke hold, contributing to his death. A grand jury's decision not to bring charges against the law enforcement officer earlier this month incited national protests and the 'I Can't Breathe' movement - Garner's now famous last words. Donovan's failure to convince the jury to allow the district attorney's office to move forward with its case has angered the city's African-American population. However, blacks made up just under 10 percent of the borough's population as of the last census. Previously a part of the 13th congressional district, Staten Island became part of New York's 11th district after changes to the House map in 2012 as a result of the decennial census. Still remaining in the 11th is the southern portion of Brooklyn. The majority Staten Island seat is the only New York City congressional district that is represented by a Republican. Grimm has served as the Republican leaning area's liaison to the House of Representatives since 2011. Despite a federal investigation into business practices he engaged in before he was elected to Congress that led to 20 separate charges for federal crimes, Grimm won reelection in November, beating his Democratic opponent by seven points. The Republican lawmaker insisted on his innocence throughout the fall but admitted last Tuesday that he helped hide $1 million worth of wages and receipts from a Manhattan health foods restaurant he partially owns by preparing a fraudulent tax return. Prosecutors are asking that he receive 24 to 30 months in prison while his lawyer has argued that 12 to 18 months would be more appropriate. Last week Grimm said he would remain in Congress. By Monday he had been convinced to step down, allegedly by House Speaker John Boehner, as he awaits a judge's verdict that will determine his legal fate. New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, said on Monday that he would vacate his Staten Island congressional seat on Jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo must now call a special election to be held within 70 to 80 days of his announcement . Among the interested Democrats are Staten Island Assemblyman Michael Cusick, left, and Grimm’s predecessor, former congressman Michael McMahon, right . Even before Grimm came clean about about his dirty business dealings, party leaders were considering possible replacements, should it come to that. The day after Grimm was reelected, State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox suggested that Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis could carry the GOP torch in a special election. 'She could be a wonderful candidate going forward, if Mike has problems going forward,' Cox said, per the Observer. It is now up to Staten Island's Republican Party to choose a possible successor to Grimm, as state law only calls for a general election under the circumstances and no primary. Outside candidates could still compete in the contest but they would need to obtain 3,500 signatures in a relatively short amount of time in order to have their names printed on the ballot. Potential GOP contenders for the party's nomination include Malliotakis, who told a Staten Island news publication on Monday evening that she was 'taking a serious look at the seat,' and State Senator Andrew Lanza, one of Grimm's competitors in the 2010 Republican primary. Among the interested Democrats is Staten Island Assemblyman Michael Cusick. He said Monday, 'It's something I won't rule out and will give strong consideration to.' Grimm’s predecessor, former congressman Michael McMahon, may also seek to reclaim his old seat. McMahon lost to Grimm four years ago by three points while in his first term in Congress. After Grimm's admission of guilt last week he told Roll Call he was neither 'ruling out or ruling in' a political comeback. 'It will get serious consideration,' he said. Should McMahon represent his party in the special election, his vote for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will likely be the subject of political attacks from his Republican opponent.","Grimm said Monday he would vacate his Staten Island congressional seat on Jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion .

"Stationery companies are using a quirky new ingredient in a bid to help save the rainforest. Rather than chop down trees to make paper, some brands like The Eden Project, which makes notebooks at the Maximus Elephant Conservation Trust in Sri Lanka, are using animal poo instead. The process of making elephant dung paper is a little different to crafting regular handmade paper as the elephant's digestive system breaks down vegetable fibres so the dung is full of ready-to-use paper pulp. Rather than chop down trees to make paper, some brands are using elephant poo as a material instead . The elephant dung is collected and vigorously boiled with margosa leaves, which have natural disinfectant properties. This is  then mixed with  recycled paper. The coarseness and shade of the paper is entirely dependent on the elephants’ diet, making each sheet as unique as the elephant that produced it. One company is taking it even further by utilising a variety of animals' excrement. PooPooPaper uses dung from a host of different fibre-eating herbivorous animals such as elephants, cows, horses, moose, pandas and donkeys in northern Thailand. These animals have highly fibrous diets of bamboo, sugar cane, grasses, banana trees, leaves, twigs and fruits.

Animals like donkeys, elephants and cows have highly fibrous diets of bamboo, sugar cane, grasses, banana trees, leaves, twigs and fruits so their dung is an ideal paper material, say the makers of this quirky stationery . Due to their specific digestive systems, they can't fully break down these fibres, making the dung perfect for paper making. After collection, the dung is boiled for up to six hours, which softens the faeces and removes bacteria. This  is then mixed with other non-wood fibres such as pineapple husks, hay and banana tree trunks. The final product can be coloured using  non-toxic food colouring and laid out to dry in the sun before being crafted into a variety of different consumer and industrial products. As gifts and souvenirs, products include journals, notepads, albums, frames, bags, stationery, greeting cards, calendars, diaries, key chains, magnets and jewellery. The company says its products are fun, eco-friendly, inspirational and a creative and novel alternative to wood-pulp based paper products, which rely on the continual cutting of trees and harvesting of forests.

"A shocking video shows the horrifying moment a Russian driver repeatedly runs over her elderly neighbor in a rage after the older woman scratched her brand-new Nissan. Marina Skhurina, 37, is seen struggling to reverse her new car out of a yard after a heavy snowfall when her neighbor comes out her house with a bowl of food for her chickens. The footage shows Skhurina becoming increasingly frustrated as her car moves backwards and forwards in the snowdrift at the end of the road in the  town of Aldan in Russian region of Yakutia. Reusing to wait for her neighbor to pass, the driver shoots forward down the narrow lane, forcing the older woman to step to one side. She is seen dropping the bowl as the car pushes past her. The neighbor struggles to recover the corn husks from the snow-covered ground, and then topples over when the furious driver steps out of the car and starts shouting at her. Skhurina then continues reversing backwards and forwards down the lane, running the older woman over repeatedly in the process. Unable to move, the woman jerks in shock each time the wheels pass over her. The ordeal only ends when the driver reverses so far back that she spots her neighbor.

Police were suspicious as the truck was parked illegally and the park was closed. The teen immediately said he could not lie and revealed the details of their relationship. After the arrest it was discovered that Iris and the teen had been communicating through a chatroom and Twitter, and that she had been sending partially nude photos to the boy from her phone.

"A North Texas woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison after earlier testifying that she helped her husband gun down a district attorney, his wife and a top assistant in a revenge plot. Kim Williams appeared in court two weeks after her husband, Eric Williams, was sentenced to death for one of the three killings. She testified during Eric Williams' sentencing hearing that she was a 'willing participant,' driving the getaway car after the January 2013 shooting of prosecutor Mark Hasse and helping hide weapons after the March 2013 shootings of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Kim Williams pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison after earlier testifying that she helped her husband gun down a district attorney, his wife and a top assistant in a revenge plot (file photo) Investigators have said the couple sought to avenge Eric Williams' 2012 prosecution for stealing county-owned equipment. He was a justice of the peace at the time and the conviction cost him his job and law license. At her brief court appearance Tuesday, Kim Williams was sentenced immediately after pleading guilty to first-degree murder. She also gave up her right to appeal. She pleaded guilty in the death of Hasse. Her husband, from whom she's now estranged, was convicted Dec. 4 of killing Cynthia McLelland. Nathan Foreman, Cynthia McLelland's son, thanked Kim Williams in court for testifying and providing prosecutors with information. 'I'm not sure closure is the right word, but it was riveting listening to your testimony,' he told her. 'These murders have torn apart my family and Mark Hasse's family,' he said. 'And I'm sure that it's been equally tough on your family.' Victims: Prosecutor Mark Hasse (left) was shot in January 2013. Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia (seen together on the right) were shot in March 2013 . Convicted: Eric WIlliams (seen here in a file photo) was convicted on December 4 for killing Cynthia McLelland, the wife of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland, and sentenced to death . J.R. McLelland, the son of Mike McLelland, later told her, 'You had too many opportunities to stop it and you didn't do that.' During the trial of Eric Williams, prosecutors presented evidence that he paid a friend to rent a storage unit where he kept more than 30 guns, police tactical gear and the getaway car. A 'masked assassin,' whom prosecutors identified as Williams, approached Hasse as he walked to work and the two shoved each other. They said Hasse pleaded and yelled 'I'm sorry' before he was repeatedly shot. Two months later Williams stormed into the McLellands' rural home east of Dallas and shot each more than a dozen times, according to evidence at his trial. During the punishment phase, Kim Williams testified for more than two hours about her role in the plot. 'His anger was my anger,' she said.","Kim Williams pleaded guilty Tuesday to murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison .

"The Mail can today reveal the millions paid to rail bosses who run Britain’s costly and overcrowded train services. While passengers struggle with ever-rising fares, senior rail executives enjoyed generous salaries, bonuses and perks such as car allowances and private healthcare. The highest paid boss even earned £2.2million despite operating the country’s most crowded commuter service, a Daily Mail investigation reveals. Hard-pressed commuters faced rail chaos in London after planned engineering works over-ran . Thousands of travellers were left stranded as hundreds of services were cancelled on Boxing Day . The most successful train operator parent company made pre-tax profits of nearly £700million while the companies that run the transport network take billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies. The stark contrast between ‘cattle class’ commuters and the ‘Fat Controllers’ follows the Christmas chaos in which thousands of passengers suffered horrendous journeys caused by over-running engineering works by Network Rail. Yet hard-pressed commuters returning to work in the New Year will see the overall cost of their train fares rise by 2.2 per cent from Friday – and up 2.5 per cent for season tickets. Many will see the price of an annual ticket top £5,000 for the first time, including passengers who travel from Ashford in Kent to London. Commuters on the Brighton to London will pay £4,408 a year – a rise of £745, or 20 per cent, in four years. Meanwhile, rail firms benefited from a total of £4.02billion in government subsidies in 2012-13, according to figures from the Office of Rail Regulation watchdog. At the same time the firms paid £204million in dividends to their parent companies, many of which are owned by foreign governments. The top-paid rail manager last year was Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths, 48, who received £2.23million, including £22,000 in lieu of a company car. His company runs East Midland Trains and South West Trains, which operates Britain’s most crowded commuter service – the 7.32am Woking to Waterloo, on which travellers must now pay £3,052 for an annual season ticket. Britain's rail bosses are paid between £197,800 and £2.23 million a year according to a Mail investigation . First Group’s American chief executive Tim O’Toole, 59, received £1.99million last year even though a third of shareholders voting against his bumper pay packet – which included a £12,000 car allowance and £16,447 for US private medical insurance for himself and his wife. A company spokesman said his bonus last year was the first he had taken since becoming chief executive in 2010 and reflected ‘operational improvements’. David Brown, 54, was paid £1.96million last year to run Go-Ahead and lives with his family in a five-bedroom house worth £1.8million in Ealing, west London. With French partner Keolis the firm runs train operator Govia. Operators under his command include Thameslink – whose manager Charles Horton sparked fury in October when he said he hoped to make it ‘more comfortable to stand’ for rush-hour passengers. A Go-Ahead spokesman said executive pay is decided by board members and was a ‘unanimous view’ of the remuneration committee.’ National Express Group chief executive Dean Finch, 48, received a package of more than £1.5million, including £20,000 for a car, plus health insurance. He and his wife live in a beauty spot in rural Aberdeenshire, where they have a £1.6million listed home. National Express, which runs C2C, said it did not receive a subsidy – and said Mr Finch’s pay was down on the previous year. Last night it also emerged that passengers have seen their pay massively outstripped by season ticket price rises. Average salaries have risen by 6.9 per cent since January 2010, but many fares have increased by 22 per cent or more over this period, the Campaign for Better Transport said. Labour’s shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said the franchising system is ‘not fit for purpose’ and called for an approach that ‘puts the public interest first’. Manuel Cortes, of the TSSA rail union, added: ‘Passengers get all the pain while the bosses get all the gain.’ The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators and Network Rail, said the overall increase in fares of 2.2 per cent is the lowest in five years. The Department for Transport admitted there were ‘concerns’ by passengers over the cost of rail travel. But it said increases to regulated fares – set by the government – were once again frozen by George Osborne at 2.5 per cent. This week’s annual fare rise will mean some season ticket holders will have endured increases of more than 20% in the life of this Parliament, according to figures from the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT). The latest rise, which takes effect on Friday, will see regulated fares, which include season tickets, increasing by up to 2.5 per cent and fares overall going up by an average of 2.2 per cent. Those commuting to London from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, for example, will have to contend with a 2.43 per cent rise, with their 2015 ticket going up to £4,888. According to CBT, the cost of a Milton Keynes season ticket has risen 23.5 per cent, or £930, since January 2010 and is one of a number of fares that have increased around four times more than average wages over this five-year period. The CBT also highlighted the cost of a Newcastle to Middlesbrough season ticket, which will be £2,324 from Friday and has risen 26.3 per cent since January 2010. Other examples of large increases on season tickets since January 2010 given by CBT are Ashford International to London (up 22.0 per cent), Oxford-London (up 22.0 per cent), St Albans-London (up 22.0 per cent), Leeds-Sheffield (up 23.5 per cent), Leicester-Derby (up 22.5 per cent) and Bristol-Bath (up 22.4 per cent). CBT said average wages had risen by just 6.9 per cent since January 2010. CBT’s public transport campaigner Martin Abrams said: 'Yet again, the Government is hiking up commuter rail fares. Ticket prices are rising much faster than wages, which means getting to work takes up an increasing share of incomes, hitting both household budgets and the economy. 'The Government urgently needs to adopt a fairer approach to ticketing, bringing fares down and introducing more flexible tickets to help groups like the millions who work part-time.' Rail union the RMT has also bemoaned the fare rise, which comes at a time when commuters have had to contend with constant late autumn and early winter disruptions to rush-hour services. Last weekend overrunning Christmas engineering work led to chaotic scenes at King’s Cross and Finsbury Park stations in north London and threw the spotlight on Network Rail’s top bosses’ salary levels and bonus structure. The RMT published figures which it said showed that Government subsidies to train companies came to just over £4 billion in 2012/13. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'As the travelling public gear up for the new year fares hike, we are blowing away the myth that the extra cash is invested back into services when in fact it combines with taxpayer subsidies to fuel a £4 billion privatised rail rip-off that is a one-way ticket to the bank for the train companies.' He went on: 'The scandal of the British people paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out and overcrowded trains will be compounded by the new year average rise - an increase which dwarfs average pay increases and which will hit the poorest the hardest.' Mr Cash said the RMT would step up the fight for the renationalisation of the railways. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said today: 'We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation since the Victorian era and fares have a crucial role to play in funding these improvements. This is because building better infrastructure helps create jobs, building a stronger economy for us all. 'We recognise passengers’ concerns about the cost of rail fares. This is why we have frozen them for the second year in a row. We are protecting passengers even further by stopping operating companies from increasing individual fares by up to 2 per cent more.” Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, said: 'Chancellor George Osborne has yet again frozen fuel duty for motorists and with oil prices falling dramatically, motoring is becoming cheaper in real terms and rail travel becoming more expensive. 'So don’t be surprised if road congestion gets even worse along with pollution, accidents and global warming.' He went on: 'Fares need to reflect reality in terms of inflation, and with the most recent figures for CPI inflation just 1 per cent and falling, this represents yet another unfair squeezing of rail passengers’ wallets. 'There’s a real danger that further fare increases will deter passengers from travelling and reduce the rail industry’s income, increasing the support required from government.' A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators and Network Rail, said: 'At 2.2 per cent, the average increase in fares in 2015 is the lowest for five years. 'We know that no one likes to pay more to go to work, but for every £1 spent on fares, 97p goes on track, train, staff and other costs while 3p goes in profits earned by train companies for running services on Europe’s fastest-growing railway. 'While we know and are very sorry that many passengers did not get the service they deserved at the weekend, Network Rail is spending £38 billion over five years on a better railway alongside commitments made by train companies to improve services.'","Britain's rail bosses earn between £197,800 and £2.23 million a year .

"If you have ever fought over the TV remote with your partner, you are in good company – the whole nation is, apparently, having a similar battle. In fact, it seems men and women disagree over almost everything on the box, according to the first detailed analysis breaking down viewing habits by gender. It showed that men – perhaps unsurprisingly – spent much of the year glued to sports. Scroll down for video . The most popular shows for men and women broken down into categories: Call The Midwife and Sherlock . Apart from a single episode of Sherlock on New Year’s Day, the ten biggest male TV audiences were for World Cup football matches, with England’s clash against Italy in June top of the list with 8.2million watching. Women, meanwhile, preferred shows about cookery and childbirth. The Great British Bake Off final in October got the biggest female audience of the year, with 7.8million tuning in, compared with 4.8million men. Bake Off and the BBC drama Call The Midwife accounted for nine of the top ten female audiences of the year, with Strictly Come Dancing also among their favourites. Apart  Sherlock on New Year’s Day, the ten biggest male TV audiences were for World Cup football matches . Even within genres, men and women are at odds. The figures, compiled by the research company Attentional, show women’s favourite soap was Coronation Street on ITV, while men narrowly preferred the BBC’s grittier EastEnders. The top TV dramas for men were those featuring crime and intrigue, such as Sherlock and Doctor Who, or swashbuckling action, such as BBC1’s The Musketeers. With 300,000 more male than female fans, Doctor Who was the only mainstream drama to score more highly overall with men than women, who generally watch more TV. For drama, women preferred the gentler historical charms of Call The Midwife and Downton Abbey. One of the few things men and women agreed on was that Graham Norton was the best chat show host. For men, the best Saturday night entertainment show of the year was Britain’s Got Talent on ITV, while among women it was the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing.

"Anti-Semitic vandals have scrawled Swastikas on cars and buildings across a Jewish community in north London. Police stepped in to investigate after vehicles and homes were targeted in the Stoke Newington area leaving residents ‘shocked and fearful’. Swastikas were daubed on up to 27 cars in and around Osbaldeston Road – in an area that is home to some 20,000 Haredi Jews. Anti-Semitic vandals have scrawled Swastikas on cars and buildings across a Jewish community in north London . Residents were left feeling 'shocked and fearful' after vehicles and homes were targeted in the Stoke Newington area . The night of vandalism, on Sunday, prompted extra patrols by police officers while the volunteer Shomrim group, which backs policing in the area, also increased its efforts to find those responsible. One of the volunteers, Meir Taub, told MailOnline: ‘There is a large Jewish community that lives here with Holocaust survivors and children of Holocaust survivors and to see Swastikas is not a pleasant thing for them. People were shocked, scared and fearful. ‘A lot of damage was caused to a lot of vehicles and there was a lot of concern.’ Mr Taub said there had been early incidents in which Swastikas had been daubed on the walls of a local primary school. The group’s coordinator Barry Bard said: ‘Shomrim are committed to bring a stop to these senseless and mindless acts of vandalism, and are working closely with the Police investigation to assist in every possible way. Swastikas were daubed on up to 27 cars in and around Osbaldeston Road – in an area that is home to some 20,000 Haredi Jews .

Police Inspector Jeoff Bull (NE Neighbourhoods, Hackney) said: ‘We will not tolerate anti-semitism or racism of any kind. ‘We are doing our utmost to trace and bring to justice the suspects involved in this racist graffiti as well as reassure all of our communities.’ This afternoon it was confirmed that a 32-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the vandalism. Hackney police tweeted: ‘With the help of @ShomrimOfficial a 32 year old man has been arrested & is in custody for the anti Semitic criminal damage series in N16.’ The vandalism comes amid warnings that anti-semitism is on the rise across Europe, fuelled by violence in the Middle East.

"Robert McGinlay, 20, posted intimate photographs on Facebook of him and his ex-partner having sex . A spurned boyfriend posted so-called 'revenge porn' photographs on Facebook showing him and his ex-partner having sex. Robert McGinlay, 20, took the intimate images of him and the woman during their relationship. But, when their affair ended, he posted the image on the social media site, where it was seen by hundreds of friends. His horrified victim, who was alerted to the image by her  friends, reported the incident to police, who arrested the jilted boyfriend. McGinlay, of Moodiesburn, Lanarkshire, later told officers that he put up the picture out of spite following the break-down of their relationship in December last year. He also confirmed to officers that he had been in a relationship with the girl and that he had already deleted the image since posting it. At Airdrie Sheriff Court, the warehouse worker admitted acting in a threatening or abusive manner and causing fear or alarm towards his victim by posting a sexually graphic image of her on a social media website. Depute fiscal Gordon Crawford said: 'While he was in a relationship with the complainer he had taken a photo of himself and the complainer engaged in a sexual act . 'When they fell out any sense of leave or balance went out the window and in what is known as ""Revenge Porn"", he posted the picture of the sexual act on Facebook thereby showing it to the world to get back at the complainer. 'When notified the complainer got onto Mr McGinlay and contacted the police. Before he knew she was going to the police he deleted the photo, regretting what he had done.' Sheriff Petra Collins deferred sentence until January and called for reports. She added: 'I will be calling for a victim impact statement from the complainer before I can pass sentence.' McGinlay pleaded not guilty pleas to a charge of posting a sex video of him and the woman on Facebook and intentionally causing her to look at the footage. Prosecutors also accepted his not guilty plea that he had sent sexual written communications to his victim. Revenge porn is the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress. The Scottish government is planning to introduce a new law to tackle revenge pornography. At Airdrie Sheriff Court (pictured), the warehouse worker admitted acting in a threatening or abusive manner and causing fear or alarm towards his victim by posting a sexually graphic image of her on a social media website . It intends to make it a specific criminal offence to publish explicit images of someone without their consent. The Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, has suggested a specific offence may help deal with what he has described as a 'growing problem'. New legislation has already been drawn up for England and Wales. Last month, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to clamp down on revenge porn. He announced it would become a criminal offence, with a maximum jail term of two years. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.","Robert McGinlay, of Moodiesburn, Lanarkshire, posted image out of spite .

"There was no time for horsing around at a stable in Florida last Friday after a sinkhole nearly swallowed up one of the equines. Nate, a 30-year-old nag living at TMMA Farms in the rural community of Oxford, was found with his head poking out of a grassy pasture while the rest of his body lay trapped below ground. It took a team of around ten people - including fire personnel - more than two hours to haul the large animal to safety. Video footage of the rescue shows how workers dug earth out around Nate's body in a bid to free him. Scroll down for video . Bizarre scene: Owner Maryann Marsh tries to comfort Nate the horse after he was found in a sinkhole in his pasture in Oxford, Florida . They then put harnesses around his torso to lift him to ground level. After lots of pulling and pushing, Nate finally gets one hoof up and is able to crane his other legs out of the pit. He appears to be stunned by the ordeal, standing still with his nostrils flared. Firefighters apparently placed an oxygen mask on Nate's face to help him breathe until he was able to walk on his own. Maryann Marsh, co-owner of TMMA Farms, said she had never seen anything like it before. She told ABC News that Nate was in a 'retirement pasture' and it's thought that the 'ground just collapsed underneath him' during the afternoon.

"Charmaine King's bruised and bloodied face after she was set upon outside a bar in Poole, Dorset, on Boxing Day . This is the bruised and bloodied face of a young mother after she was the victim of a late night attack. Charmaine King's injuries were so horrific that her own two-year-old daughter was left scared to go near her. The 22-year-old now fears she has been left scarred for life after she was punched in the face with a set of car keys. Miss King had just got out of a taxi near Yate's Wine Bar in Poole, Dorset, when she became embroiled in an argument with a woman. During the row she was punched in the face by a man who was holding a set of car keys. The mother-of-one was left with a deep two-inch long gash above her right eyebrow and doctors think that her eye socket may have been fractured. She was taken to hospital where doctors had to cut off her fur headband and give her seven stitches. Medics told her the cut would leave a permanent scar above her right eye. Miss King's two-year-old daughter Lacey was initially too scared to go near her mother after seeing the horrific injuries. Miss King said that the attack happened outside Yates Wine Bar in Poole, Dorset (pictured), after she had just stepped out of a taxi . Miss King, a qualified beauty therapist, said: 'I very rarely go out, I work a lot to support my daughter and this was the first time I had been out in ages. 'I had only just got out of the taxi to go into the bar when it happened. I just fell to the floor and my friend had to pick me up. 'I was in shock and pain and having a bit of a panic attack but I didn't realise how bad it was until I got to the hospital and they had to cut my headband off. 'They think he had his keys in his hand because it's such a clean cut. It's very deep and they told me it will leave a scar. 'My daughter wouldn't go anywhere near me at first because my injury looked so awful. 'She wouldn't give me a cuddle and now she's scared she'll hurt me if she touches my face. 'It completely ruined our Christmas and made me too scared to leave the house.'

"Iraqi  forces have recaptured the northern town of Dhuluiya with sources claiming almost 300 ISIS fighters were killed in the battle. Government security forces fighting alongside Shia militias began their assault of the town on the Tigris River 45 miles north of Baghdad on Sunday with raids by Iraqi helicopter and fighter jets. By Monday afternoon they had taken control of most areas with ISIS fighters confined to small zones to the north-west where they were surrounded.

Iraqi security forces and pro-government militias took control of the Tigris River town of Dhuluiya north of Baghdad on Tuesday . Iraqi forces have recaptured the northern town of Dhuluiya with sources claiming almost 300 ISIS fighters were killed in the battle . By midday Tuesday, following reports of fierce clashes overnight, security sources were claiming that the whole  town was back in government's hands. Isis fighters are said to have suffered very heavy losses during the final assault. The extremist group had seized the northern half of Dhuluiya in June as they swept through Northern Iraq almost unchecked. Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back since it took over key areas of the mainly Sunni Muslim provinces.

Government security forces fighting alongside Shia militias began their assault of the town on the Tigris River  on Sunday with raids by Iraqi helicopter and fighter jets . Islamic State fighters had occupied the Dhuluiya's northern half since June and surrounded the southern half of Dhuluiya where members of the Sunni al-Jubouri tribe had refused to swear allegiance to the militants. The Sunni militants had used neighbouring villages to isolate not only the Jubouri tribesmen fighting Islamic State but also to attack the nearby Shi'ite town of Balad. The new offensive, launched on Sunday, was meant to break Islamic State's grip around both Balad and Dhuluiya.

"Nasa is preparing to test its next-generation space telescope in a giant thermal vacuum chamber, with stunning photos revealing engineers hard at work ahead of testing of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The historic chamber was once used to test manned spacecraft, but has now been refurbished for this larger and more sensitive piece of equipment. Various components of the telescope are now being tested ahead of the planned launch in 2018, when it will be used to study distant stars, galaxies and even exoplanets. Nasa is preparing to cryogenically test its new telescope in a vacuum chamber (shown) in Houston, Texas. The huge Chamber A at the Johnson Space Center is being refurbished to accommodate the telescope . The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter (21ft) primary mirror. The project is working to a 2018 launch date. The JWST will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in the history of our universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own solar system. The huge vacuum chamber in which part of the telescope is to be tested is called Chamber A and is located at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. ‘This is what space science is all about,’ said Nasa photographer Chris Gunn, who captured a photo from outside the enormous mouth of the chamber. ‘There is nothing else like this that anyone will see in their day-to-day lives.’ Engineers and technicians, dressed in sterile suits and secured by harnesses to stands for safety, are seen inside Chamber A preparing a lift system that will be used to hold the telescope during testing. Once fully assembled and launched into space, the telescope will allow scientists to explore ever further into the cosmos, seeing things that even the mighty Hubble Space Telescope can’t. Before the telescope is launched one million miles (1.6 million km) into space to its destination, it must undergo a series of detailed tests to ensure it's ready for the harsh environment of space. This spring, a model of the telescope called Pathfinder will begin cryogenic optical testing inside this chamber. ‘Maintaining the schedule with a very large number of optical and ground support equipment integration efforts, while securing the telescope to a suspension system inside the chamber and conducting a cryo-strength test is an incredible integration and test challenge,’ said Mark Voyton, manager for the Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science Instrument Module (Otis). This coming spring a test model called Pathfinder will undergo cryogenic optical testing inside the chamber (engineers seen at the mouth bottom left). A suspension system (right) inside the chamber will hold the telescope in place as it is cryogenically tested . The JWST is the scientific successor to Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope. It will be the most powerful space telescope ever built, and is an international project led by Nasa with its partners, Esa and the Canadian Space Agency. Earllier in December the JWST's Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) structure endured a 'gravity sag test' as it was rotated upside-down in what looked like a giant cube in a Nasa clean room at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The purpose of 'cubing' the ISIM was to test it for gravity sag, which is to see how much the structure changes under its own weight due to gravity. The James Webb Space Telescope's Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) structure recently endured a 'gravity sag test' as it was rotated in what looked like giant cube in a Nasa clean room (pictured) Inside Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center's giant clean room in Greenbelt, Maryland, JWST Optical Engineer Larkin Carey examines two test mirror segments recently placed on a black composite structure. This black composite structure is called the James Webb Space Telescope's 'Pathfinder' and acts as a spine supporting the telescope's primary mirror segments. The Pathfinder is a non-flight prototype . The ISIM is one of three major elements that comprise the Webb Observatory flight system. The others are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and the Spacecraft Element (Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield). Engineers need to see how gravity affects the alignment of the instruments within the module when the ISIM is in different orientations on the ground. They use measurements from this sag test to verify what the instrument alignments will really be in space, when there is no preferred direction from gravity, and take account of sag during assembly with the telescope. The cube with the ISIM inside it was rotated using a massive machine called an Aronson table; the rotation was just the dramatic start to the test. The cube and ISIM were then lifted off of the rotation table while inverted and kept upside down for several days while lasers made precise position measurements. The Secondary Mirror of the JWST Pathfinder (test) Telescope is shown here being stowed in the large cleanroom at Goddard Space Flight Center. Instrumentation will be added to the telescope arms to monitor temperatures during cryogenic testing in the Chamber A thermal vacuum facility at Johnson Space Center in 2015 .","Nasa is preparing to cryogenically test its new telescope in a vacuum chamber in Houston, Texas .

"President Barack Obama has named Democratic political operative and loyal party donor Ron Klain as his 'Ebola czar' an administration source confirmed on Friday. Klain, a lawyer and former Supreme Court clerk, was part of the team that helped the president prepare for his debates during the 2008 election cycle. He served as chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden until 2011 and served the same role for Vice President Al Gore during the 1990s. In 2000 Klain helmed Gore's legal operation overseeing the contentious and lengthy ballot recounts in the all-important Florida presidential contest. He also ran then-Senator John Kerry's debate preparation team in the 2004 presidential election. Federal Election Commission records collected by the Center for Responsive Politics show that Klain has donated $17,890 to Democratic candidates and campaign committees. He gave $1,000 to Barack Obama in 2006 when the president was a U.S. senator who hadn't yet waded into the White House race. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Out of time: CDC chief Dr. Thomas Frieden (right) has been Obama's most visible Ebola-fighter but his agency's stumbles drove many in Congress to demand a new whole-government coordinator . Up, up and away: Klain (standing, right) was chief of staff to VP Joe Biden (left) until 2011, and will become intimately familiar with the new dangers of flying . The political fixer's other contributions include a $250 check to Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy this year and three donations totaling $5,700 to Massachusetts Democratic Senator Joe Markey in 2013. Kevin Spacey portrayed him in the HBO movie 'Recount'; in the later film 'Outbreak,' his character dies of Ebola. California Republican Rep. Ed Royce, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee,issued a scathing statement on Friday. 'I have to ask why the president didn’t pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background?' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican whose state has been ground zero for Ebola in the U.S., said Americans 'don't need another so-called ""czar""; we need presidential leadership.' Klain's published biographies indicate nothing in his professional history related to medicine or public health. In 2009 the Obama White House tapped him to supervise the allocation of money tied to the president's ill-fated economic stimulus package. This year when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney retired, Klain boasted on Twitter that he was 'the person who hired' him. The president's choice of Ebola quarterback indicates the White House's need for a strong manager, not necessarily another epidemiologist to cross swords with Dr. Thomas Frieden, the embattled director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following an Ebola meeting at the White House on Thursday, Obama conceded that 'it may make sense for us to have one person' to coordinate the administration's Ebola response efforts. That way, he added, 'after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward.' White House Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco had been acting as Obama's Ebola coordinator, but the president said she and National Security Adviser Susan Rice were stretched too thin to devote time and attention to Ebola. Loyal Democrat: Portions of Klain's Twitter feed are a tribute to political initiatives on the left . Mocking: Reactions online ranged from congratulatory (from Democratic operatives) to desultory (from scientists) CNN first broke the news that Klain would be named to the point-person job dealing with the United States' new exposure to the Ebola virus. The decision suggests that the White House is more interested in putting out political fires and protecting the president than in coordinating the government's public health infrastructure in a time of crisis. Klain wrote a widely circulated memo in 2012 aimed at helping Democratic operatives prepare their candidates for pre-election debates. 'Punches are good, counterpunches are better,' he wrote then. It may be too late for Obama to take advantage of another Klain nostrum: 'While you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.' When Klain left the Obama administration, he landed the top job as president of Case Holdings, the investment holding company of Steve Case, the former chairman of AOL. New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer praised the White House for its decision. 'I've known Ron Klain for over twenty years,; Schumer said Friday. 'He is smart, aggressive, and levelheaded; exactly the qualities we need in a czar to steer our response to Ebola. He is an excellent choice. Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King disagreed. 'President Obama will name political operative Ron Klain as #EbolaCzar,' he tweeted. 'Too much Obama Administration competition to name him #EbolaSpinCzar.'","Ron Klain will coordinate the Obama administration's Ebola response efforts .

"A team of zookeepers spent Tuesday morning doing something most people wouldn't dare to – raiding the nests of full-grown female alligators, which were adamant to protect their young. The annual raids at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby on the New South Wales central coast, could see up to 500 eggs collected this season from the nests of 30 odd resident female American alligators, which can grow to be up to three metres long. Obviously an incredibly dangerous procedure, the raids require three keepers to restrain a female by wrestling her and tying her up with ropes, while a fourth removes up to 60 eggs from each nest. Scroll down for video . A team of Australian Reptile Park zookeepers raided the nests of a number of their resident female American alligators on Tuesday . A protective mother guards her nest: The annual raids could see up to 500 eggs collected this season from around 30 nests . 'It is very dangerous obviously, because they're a large crocodilian, and females defending their nest will literally defend their nests with their lives,' Reptile supervisor Billy Collett told the ABC. 'The last week or so we've been practicing. It sounds stupid, but we literally put a blow-up alligator or crocodile on the ground and we practiced our jumps, our roping.' As if the job wasn't hard enough, keepers were surprised to find an unusual sight during this year's raids, with one nest housing the eggs of two female alligators – making for double the wrestling. 'There's also the added problem of Brutus… a young male rogue that we've had problems with in the past. He's been charging keepers and is quite hostile,' a spokesperson for the park said. The eggs require incubation for up to 70 days  as temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally in the Australian climate . Success: Incubation also protects the eggs from hungry lizards and other alligators who are cannibalistic by nature . The raids require three keepers to restrain a female by wrestling and tying her up, while a fourth removes the eggs from her nest . 'American alligators have one of the strongest jaw pressures of any animal and one bite can be limb or even life-threatening.' Normally American alligators guard their young until they hatch, at which point they gently take them in their mouths to the water where they teach them survival skills as they grow, but in Australia they require a helping-hand due to the hot climate. The eggs require incubation for up to 70 days from between 29 to 32 degrees, as hot Australian temperatures often prevent them from hatching naturally. It also further protects the eggs by guarding them from hungry lizards and ensuring that, once born, the young don't escape the alligator enclosure. However, the biggest threats to the baby alligators are actually their own kind due to the species being cannibalistic. The Australian Reptile Park is the only zoo in Australia that breeds American alligators. It supplies zoos both nationally and internationally. As if the job wasn't hard enough, keepers were surprised to find one nest housing the eggs of two female alligators this year .

"Danuta Cross, 64, from South Cave, East Yorkshire (pictured outside court), has been warned she faces jail if she continues to harass her neighbours . With their neatly trimmed hedges and well-kept gardens, on the surface these adjoining bungalows in a Yorkshire village are tranquil havens for a peaceful retirement. But for five years a bitter feud has raged between retired teaching assistant Danuta Cross, 64, and the former civil servants next door whom she accused of being jealous of her award-winning garden. Cross made the lives of David Myhill, 59, and Alexandra Smith, 65, a misery by making disturbing threats against them, a court heard. It took a criminal conviction and the threat of jail to stop the harassment and bring an uneasy truce to this bizarre dispute. Magistrates heard that Cross, a once ‘respected member of the community’ in South Cave, East Yorkshire, claimed she was being ‘stalked’ and ‘watched all the time’ by the couple because they envied her gardening skills. Police investigated and found no evidence to back up her allegations. Instead, they took action against Cross for tormenting her neighbours after she threatened to ‘hang’ Mr Myhill from his tree last summer, Beverley Magistrates’ Court heard. Cross, who had previously won the village gardening competition, was prosecuted after Mr Myhill and Miss Smith logged 11 threats of violence in just one month. She admitted harassment over a six-month period, and was ordered to pay a fine of £900 plus £130 costs and victim surcharge at a court hearing on October 29. Cross also had a restraining order imposed on her to prevent future harassment. Passing sentence, District Judge Frederick Rutherford told her: ‘It’s a sad situation indeed that a woman your age is before the court. If you continue to offend you will place yourself in prison.’ The home of Danuta Cross, who admitted to yelling abuse at her neighbours in South Cave, East Yorkshire . Neighbour Dave Myhill, 59 (left), said he and his partner endured a five-year reign of terror from Cross (right) Cross has previously won the South Cave Gardening Competition for her well-kept garden (pictured) Mr Myhill, from Little Wold Cottage (above), said there had been no further incidents since the court hearing . Prosecutor Andrew Vaughan told the court the harassment included ‘abuse and threatening language’ aimed at the couple, whom Cross branded ‘poisoned dwarves’. She allegedly told Mr Myhill: ‘I’ll let you hang from that f****** tree and leave you to f****** dangle.’ She then added: ‘I know you’re watching me, I can see you when I’m in my underwear.’ Cross continued the abusive rants across the hedge dividing the two gardens, despite receiving a conditional discharge for similar offences in December last year. Her solicitor, Michael Copeman, said: ‘She perceived herself to be the victim and still does, although she accepts that her actions have been absolutely appalling.’ After the hearing, Mr Myhill said: ‘Danuta Cross has been harassing us for over five years. Threats have included hanging us in the tree and having a good laugh, maiming us with an iron rod and spraying our eyes to blind us. ‘She has alleged I’m a paedophile, a spy and that I leer into her house watching her in her underwear.’ Speaking yesterday, he said: ‘There have been no further incidents since the court case. We just hope that the police action has brought matters to an end.’ Miss Smith added: ‘Now that this is done we just want to move on and enjoy our lives.’ Last night Cross said she was ‘more than pleased’ that the dispute was over, but refused to comment further.","Danuta Cross warned she faces jail if she continues harassing neighbours .

"House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday the Rep. Steve Scalise will remain a Republican leader after apologizing for a 2002 speech before a white supremacist group – a moment in his career he called 'a mistake I regret.' Scalise, who confirmed this week that he spoke at a meeting of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), will remain as third-in-command among the GOP leadership of the House of Representatives. 'More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate,' Boehner said Tuesday in a statement to DailyMail.com. 'Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character. He has my full confidence as our Whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans.' Moments earlier, Scalise released a statement distancing himself from the white power group, which was run at the time of his speech by Louisiana Ku Klux Klan founder and former grand wizard David Duke – a powerful Pelican State politician. Duke had threatened to release a list of all his political allies, both Republicans and Democrats, if the GOP threw Scalise under the bus. STAYING: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise spoke at an international convention of white supremacists in 2002 while serving as a member of his state's legislature, but House Speaker is letting him stay in leadership . MY MAN: House Speaker John Boehner (right) held a press conference in June to announce the election of Scalise (left) as the House Majority Whip – and he is standing by him as the racially steeped controversy boils . Scalise said Tuesday that 'twelve years ago, I spoke to many different Louisiana groups as a state representative, trying to build support for legislation that focused on cutting wasteful state spending, eliminating government corruption, and stopping tax hikes.' 'One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn. It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.' 'I am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,' he said. Scalise insisted that his Roman Catholic faith has led him to recognize that EURO holds 'views that are vehemently opposed to my own personal faith, and I reject that kind of hateful bigotry.' Rumors had swirled Tuesday around Capitol Hill, speculating about Scalise's future. After Boehner backed the Louisiana lawmaker, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in Congress, also threw his support behind his colleague. 'Congressman Scalise acknowledged he made a mistake and has condemned the views that organization espouses,' McCarthy said in a forgiving statement. Scalise did not address a $1,000 campaign contribution he received from top Duke aide Kenny Knight in 2008 – six years after his now-infamous EURO speech. But Knight himself suggested Tuesday to The Daily Beast that Scalise's hands are clean. 'Poor Steve Scalise is getting a bad rap,' Knight said. 'I don’t think Steve Scalise would come anywhere near a white hate group.' Knight recalled that Scalise spoke for 15 minutes during the 2002 EURO meeting. 'Scalise appeared in between a representative of the American Red Cross, who spoke about CPR, and a representative of the local sheriff’s department, who spoke about setting up a local Crime Watch group,' the Daily Beast reported. Duke, among America's most notorious white supremacists, was a political kingpin in Louisiana who ran unsuccessfully for governor after holding a statewide legislative seat in a district near where Scalise would later serve before he was elected to Congress. Duke told the Fusion television network on Tuesday that he was bewildered by the media feeding frenzy over Scalise's speech to his organization 12 years ago. 'Why is Scalise being singled out? I don’t know,' Duke said. 'He was just going there, obviously, to tell voters about some of his initiatives on some tax matters. That’s what it’s all about. And I think it’s insane, this whole process.' The former Klansman also issued a stark warning to lawmakers who may try to throw Scalise to the wolves. According to Fusion, Duke 'said he has hosted both Democratic and Republican legislators at everything from conferences to his children’s birthday parties. He said he has met with Democratic legislators at least 50 times in his political life.' He then threatened to release the names of all the politicians on both sides of the aisle that he's hobnobbed with in the past. 'If Scalise is going to be crucified – if Republicans want to throw Steve Scalise to the woods, then a lot of them better be looking over their shoulders,' Duke said. RACIAL ALLIANCE? David Duke (left), then grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, participated in a cross-burning in May 1977 near New Orleans; an organization he later ran invited then-state legislator Steve Scalise to speak at a meeting, and Scalise accepted . Liberal blogger Lamar White Jr. first reported on Sunday that commenters on the white-power website Stormfront.org recalled seeing Scalise speak at their event in 2002. Scalise talked to the group about tax policy. He has since said he didn't vet organizations that asked him to speak when he was a state representative scrambling for re-election votes. Scalise is also taking heat for his 2004 vote against the law that created a mandatory Louisiana state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr, . He was one of only six legislators in the state House of Representatives, all Republicans, who opposed the measure. At the time, GOP spoekspersons said the party wanted MLK Day to replace another existing holiday in order to save, but Democrats refused, leading a small group including Scalise to mount a protest vote. Democrats smelled blood on Tuesday. 'Steve Scalise chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow House Republican Leaders can’t even speak up and say he was wrong,' said Josh Schwerin, a chief spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.' Democratic National Committee spokesperson Mo Elleithee wrote in a statement Tuesday that Scalise's denials that he knew about EURO's racist mission don't pass the 'smell test.' 'These questions are just the tip of the iceberg – Rep. Scalise and all of Republican leadership need to start giving some real answers soon,' Elleithee said. But Rep. Cedric Richmond, the black Democratic congressman who represents New Orleans, says: Scalise is being unfairly tarred and feathered. 'I don't think Steve has a racist bone in his body,' he told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. 'I'm not going to let them use Steve to score political points when I know him and his family.' Meanwhile, the Huffington Post reported Monday that Scalise strongly condemned Duke in February 2004. 'David Duke is an embarrassment to our district and his message of hate only serves to divide us,' he told the New Orleans City Business Journal then. HOLOCAUST DENIER: In 2006 Duke attended the international conference of 'Review of the Holocaust' in Iran, claiming there was doubt about whether Nazi Germany used gas chambers to exterminate 6 million Jews; a top Duke aide donated $1,000 to Scalise's political campaign in 2008 . He said at the time that if he were elected to Congress he would push for a law that would forbid felons from running for office. Duke was serving a prison term for mail and tax fraud at the time. 'I didn't know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group,' he told NOLA.com. 'For anyone to suggest that I was involved with a group like that is insulting and ludicrous.' Scalise added that 'if I knew today what they were about, I wouldn't go.' But he fumed that 'it's insulting and offensive for anybody to insinuate that I would affiliate with a group like that.' Louisiana state GOP chairman Roger Villere said late Monday that he supports the suddenly embattled lawmaker, calling the controversy a 'manufactured blogger story.' 'For the 25 years that I've known Congressman Scalise, he has been an aggressive advocate for conservative reform,' Villere said. 'He has been willing to bring this message to anyone who would listen and has spoken to thousands of groups during his career in public service.' 'I've also known Steve to be a man of great integrity who embodies his Christian faith in his daily life.' But prominent conservative blogger Eric Erickson is convinced something is amiss. 'By 2002, everybody knew that Duke was still the man he claimed not to be. EVERYBODY,' he wrote Monday on his RedState.com website. 'How the hell does somebody show up at a David Duke organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance?'","Speaker John Boehner says Rep. Steve Scalie 'has my full confidence'
