"By . Corey Charlton . Derek Giles, 56, admitted his role in the drug offending and was sentenced to seven years in jail . A gang of drug smugglers has been jailed for a total of 44 years after trying to import more than £1million worth of cocaine into the UK hidden in tins of a popular Jamaican vegetable dish. One of the men, Derek Giles, 56, was a baggage handler at Gatwick Airport and was vital in helping slip the cocaine, which was secured in the tins of Jamaican Pride Callaloo, through security checks. The five men and two women were sentenced after either admitting their role or being found guilty in the sophisticated drug . smuggling operation at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey on Friday. It began in April last year when Craig Accra, 33, from Liverpool, travelled to Montego Bay, Jamaica with his partner. A month later, he met Londoners Glenroy Williams, 51, and Lawrence French, 54, in Birmingham before later meeting an unnamed associate to discuss taking up to 12 kilograms of cocaine from Jamaica to Britain for a fee of £100,000. The plan was for the drugs to travel from Antigua to London, then from London to Holland, in an attempt to attract less attention than a direct flight from the Caribbean. On June 12 Lee Edward Kent, 36, from Liverpool, and another person arranged to meet others in the gang in Amsterdam. However, their attempt failed when Eileen Adams, 55, also of Liverpool, panicked when she couldn't see the bag the airport luggage carousel. Instead, she grabbed another bag from the carousel and was arrested for theft. Unaware his operation was being watched by police and the National Crime Agency, Williams attempted to smuggle again. This time Sharon Dixon, 51, London, travelled from Gatwick Airport to Jamaica in September. On her September 19 return to Gatwick, she did not leave the airport as she was booked onto a transfer flight to Porto in Portugal. As a result her baggage was 'in transfer' and therefore collected by the transfer baggage handlers. Later that day, police raided Gatwick baggage handler Giles’ home and found a small rucksack with four sealed tins of the popular Jamaican chopped leaf vegetable labelled Jamaican Pride Callaloo in the kitchen. The tins contained cocaine with a street value of £400,000. Callaloo is a spinach-like vegetable dish seasoned and steamed in Jamaica, often eaten for breakfast. These are the tins in which the cocaine was found after Dixon returned to Britain from Jamaica . Inside the sealed tins of Jamaican Pride Callaloo was cocaine worth about £400,000 . Derek Giles, who was sentenced to seven years jail, was a baggage handler at Gatwick Airport (pictured). A . succession of arrests followed which included the wider members of the group. All . the defendants pleaded guilty apart from Dixon, who denied the offence . throughout but was found guilty at trial at Kingston Crown Court on . March 26. Dixon . had previously been sentenced to a 10 year prison sentence in 1996 for . the importation of 3kgs of cocaine in her luggage via Stanstead Airport. Detective . Inspector Jerry Troon from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Specialist . Economic and Organised Crime Command said: 'These sentences are a . satisfying culmination of months of painstaking police work by officers . from the MPS and North West Regional Organised Crime Unit. Those involved have had a direct link with the supply to mid-level dealers within London and Merseyside and I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues whose fine work led to their incarceration. 'This investigation shows that we will seek anyone actively involved in the drugs trade and use all the powers available to us to combat it. 'The message is clear - if you deal in drugs we will find you, we will arrest you and you will be put in front of the courts to face the consequences of your actions.'

Jamaica to Britain . Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan - the North West Regional organised crime unit, said: “This was a sophisticated gang with influences in several major UK cities as well as criminal contacts abroad. 'The ringleaders devised a ploy whereby they used couriers to make several flights during the importing of the drugs to ensure their bags remained ‘in transfer’. 'They thought this would avoid detection but clearly they were wrong and law enforcement agencies became wise to their intentions at an early stage. 'Once we knew about all the people involved they were systematically arrested and incriminating evidence was found. The fact that all but one pleaded guilty showed the overwhelming evidence against them. 'Titan and the Metropolitan Police worked extremely closely to dismantle this conspiracy and seize more than a million pounds of drugs destined for the streets of cities across the UK. 'The jailing of this gang shows that there is no criminal out there that is beyond Titan’s reach.'","Gang jailed for 44 years for attempts to smuggle £1m of cocaine into Britain .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Andy Murray dramatically bowed out of the championship at Wimbledon today, and the agony of watching it was etched deep on the Duchess of Cambridge's face. Sitting in the royal box at Centre Court, 32-year-old Kate grimaced with every point the 27-year-old reigning champion conceded in his quarter final clash against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, 23. Earlier the Cambridges took their seats alongside Princess Beatrice and her long-term boyfriend, Dave Clark, comedian Michael McIntyre, and England rugby union coach, Stuart Lancaster. Murray's match, which began with him losing the first two sets to the Bulgian 11th seed, came after Romania's Simona Halep defeated Germany's Sabine Lisicki n the ladies' quarter final match. In the players' box, Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, 26, was there to cheer him on, though there was no sign of Dimitrov's girlfriend, tennis player Maria Sharapova, 27, who suffered a shock defeat by Angelique Kerber yesterday.

The pressure's on: Murray, right, arrived on Centre Court to defend his title against quarter final opponent Dimitrov, 23 . The curls are back: Kate, 32, still wore her dark hair in the ringlets she sported yesterday for a trip to a primary school in Islington, north London . The Duchess of Cambridge's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, went to SW19 to watch the tennis today, elegantly dressed despite the heat . Having fun: The Duchess, who appeared in good spirits, paid homage to the Wimbledon players' dress code in her cream dress by Australian designer Zimmermann . Kate paid homage to the All England Club's strict dress code for players by wearing a white dress by Australian fashion brand Zimmermann.  She also wore the elegant knee-length outfit in Sydney during the Royal Tour in April. Murray and Dimitrov know each other well and, on the eve of Wimbledon, Murray's fitness trainer Jez Green took part in a charity 200-metre race against Dimitrov's coach Roger Rasheed. Their friendship even led to Murray grabbing a hair dryer and brush to assist with Dimitrov's hair cut during a tournament in Rome in May. The 23-year-old Bulgarian was clearly pleased with the job, declaring it was 'beautiful', but the pair were both in a more serious frame of mind when their match began at 1.30pm. However the friendly smiles quickly turned to angry grimaces, on Murray's part at least, as he dropped first one set, then another, and then another, losing to the Bulgarian in straight sets. The home audience howled in despair as he dropped point after point and it became increasingly clear that the reigning champion was not going to hang on to his title. Australian . teenager Nick Kyrgios was also back on court today after beating world . number one Rafael Nadal in a match even his own mother thought he would . lose. The . 19-year-old produced one of the greatest shocks in the tournament's . history by defeating the Spaniard in four sets last night. Wild-card entrant Kyrgios arrived at Wimbledon ranked 144th in the world, and will leave having reached at least number 65.

Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend appeared relaxed as they settled down to watch the ladies' quarter final match this afternoon . Meet and greet: Kate, who had trouble with her long, flyaway hair, wore a dress she also wore during her Royal Tour of Sydney in April . The forecast for SW19 was dry and bright but Kate carried a bright red pashmina in case temperatures dropped later . He seemed surprised with how the match went, posting a message on Twitter which simply read: 'Erm, ok then...........' Kyrgios wrote last week that he wanted 25,000 Twitter followers by the end of Wimbledon and he cracked the milestone mid-way through the match. He now has more than 59,000. Meanwhile three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe was so impressed by Kyrgios's performance that he believes he could emulate Boris Becker by winning the title in his teens. Come on Muzza!  But these Andy Murray fans were no help to him when he lost the first two sets of his match to Dimitrov . McEnroe, commentating at the tournament for the BBC, reckoned Kyrgios had the look of a champion about him as he demolished Nadal's title hopes. 'I could see it from the commentators' box, that he absolutely believed he was going to win this match, and he's acting to me like he can win this tournament,' McEnroe said. 'The last guy I saw like this is ... Boris Becker, that young teenager, no fear whatsoever - ‘no matter what comes my way I'm going to be better than them'.'Becker won Wimbledon in 1985 at the age of 17.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left Prince George at home to enjoy an afternoon of tennis at the All England Club .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, from Chafford Hundred, Essex, persuaded jewellery designers to hand over gems worth £367,949 using a forged letter from Harper's Bazaar China . A celebrity stylist who stole more than £30,000 worth of gems from Mick Jagger's jewellery designer daughter is today facing jail. Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, pocketed the bespoke jewellery from Jade Jagger after claiming it would be used for a bogus fashion shoot in women's magazine, Harpers Bazaar China. Adesanya used the same ruse to dupe aristocratic designer Celia Weinstock into handing over more than £143,000 of jewels, using a forged letter from a previous genuine commission from the fashion magazine to secure the handmade gems. Adesanya, whose clients include boy band JLS and Golden Globe winning actress Jessica Chastain, swindled jewellery worth a total of £367,949 - including £129,700 from Frost of London; £55,835 from EC1 Jewellers, and £8,555 from designer Kristjan Eyjolfsson. He then pawned the items for a fraction of their value in a bid to clear mounting debts, Southwark Crown Court heard . He appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today smartly dressed in a black suit and tie and spoke only to confirm his identity and plead guilty to five counts of fraud and four further counts of theft. The scam took place between August 6 2013 and May 7 2013. A further fraud count in relation to procurement of a £3,000 suit from top designer Alexander McQueen, using the same method, is likely to be left on the court file. Adesanya, from Chafford Hundred, Grays, Essex, had initially denied the charges and had been due to stand trial in May. Adjourning sentencing for reports, Judge Alistair McCreath released Adesanya on bail but warned him that all options were open when he returned for sentencing on 28 July. 'You need to fully understand that I'm not deciding on the right sentence today,' he said.  'No decision that I have made today has any bearing on what sentence you are going to get... 'These are serious offences and the court will be thinking seriously about the right sentence.' On his website, Adesanya boasts of being a 'cutting edge stylist' who jet-sets between New York, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Adesanya stole gems worth £30,000 from Jade Jagger, right, the jewellery designer daughter of Mick Jagger . Also listed among his clients are Petra Ecclestone, Camilla Alves, the model wife of actor Matthew McConaughey; DJ Nick Grimshaw and Grey's Anatomy star, Jesse Williams. Adesanya has also styled musicians including The Voice star Vince Kidd and singer/songwriter Patrick Wolf. Prosecutor Nina Ellin told the court: 'The defendant was working as a stylist in the fashion industry. 'The letter relates to jewellery being borrowed for a particular photoshoot for a particular commission of the magazine. 'There was no photoshoot that was legislation in the context of this indictment. 'He had cash flow difficulties and decided to pawn some of the goods.  He accepts that in doing so he was acting dishonestly.' Adesanya eventually returned some of the jewellery six months later - but only after being urged to by a judge, Ms Ellin said.  Ms Weinstock has since received £82,000 worth of the missing gems. Defending, Charles Royle said: 'He found himself in difficulties and made poor choices. 'He perhaps hasn't had the most sensible reaction, he has rather hidden away from his problems.'","Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, styled stars including JLS and Jessica Chastain .

"By . Corey Charlton . A staggering 58 languages are spoken by children at just one junior school in a small English town. Some 471 pupils aged from 3 - 11 speak almost five dozen different languages at Hillside Community Primary School in Ipswich, Suffolk. An astonishing cocktail of 130 languages are spoken at schools in largely-rural Suffolk, a Freedom of Information request shows. Hillside Community Primary School headteacher Lee Abbott said there was a 'misconception' the children had no knowledge of English and lots of time and money spent on them . Lee Abbott, headteacher of Hillside Community Primary School, said: 'One of the challenges is the misconception that these children have no English and there is a great deal of time and money spent on these families and that simply isn’t the case.' The most common minority languages spoken . at the mixed school are Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian, with . each representing between 3 - 4 per cent of the total. Mr Abbott defiantly insisted that students whose native tongue was not English are often not far behind their classmates. 'Our English-speaking children come with very poor communication skills anyway, when they first come in,' he argued. 'At that point at reception age, whether they have got English as an additional language or as a first language, the language development is a priority, the process is the same, and language acquisition is about the same rate.' However Mr Abbott did admit that it was not always easy communicating with immigrant parents. 'There are parents we would need to write but we can’t because they don’t have literacy skills,' he said. Languages spoken at Hillside Community Primary School in Suffolk includes Lithuanian and Portuguese . He also denied that non-English speaking pupils diverted attention from English kids. 'We track the progress of all of the . children to make sure the resources are targeted at children who aren’t . progressing at the right rate.' Children who arrive without a good grasp of English do not sit in regular English classes but receive up to eight weeks of intensive instruction in ‘English as an Additional Language’ from a qualified teacher. For other classes youngsters are taught the vocabulary that they will need the week before it comes up in lessons. Hillside also employs teachers who speak a range of languages, including Polish, French, Swedish and Punjabi. Mr Abbott said immigrant families are 'generally aspirational, they want their children to do well'. Graham White, secretary of the National Union of Teachers in Suffolk, admitted teachers often had 'difficulty' communicating with pupils who didn’t speak English. Mr White said: 'In my own school we had some Polish children come and we had someone who came in as an interpreter for a while.' He also said pupils who didn’t speak English could receive too much attention from teachers. 'That’s always going to be a potential danger but teachers are going to make sure they devote attention to all the pupils,' said Mr White. 'But say you have got 30 pupils and 10 don’t speak English obviously you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those children because it takes longer to explain things to them.' Graham White, secretary of the National Union of Teachers in Suffolk, admitted teachers had difficulty communicating with some pupils and said a disproportionate amount of time could be spent helping them . A Suffolk County Council spokesman said: 'If children have been educated in another education system with different curriculum content, it will obviously take a bit of time to learn the new language and have the same level of subject knowledge for some curriculum areas as their English-speaking peers.' He added: 'A challenge for schools is often that of communicating with parents if the parents’ English is limited.' Altogether 6,325 pupils out of a total of 97,000 do not have English as a first language throughout Suffolk. Some 2,965 of those are in Ipswich, the most diverse borough in the East Anglian county. The figures show that lower year groups have higher numbers of pupils for whom English is not a first language. In Year 1 there are 679 pupils who speak English as an additional language in Suffolk, that’s compared to just five in Year 14. Macedonian, Kurdish, and Igbo - a . Nigerian tongue - are among kids’ mother languages at primary and . secondary schools across the county, while the most common languages other than English are Polish, Portuguese and Lithuanian.

"By . Corey Charlton . Four homes have been destroyed by lightning and razed by fire as thunderstorms bulldozed their way across the country this weekend. The homes were either damaged directly by bolts of lightning or set on fire by lightning strikes on Saturday and Sunday. Remarkably, all the homes were empty when the fires and lightning struck. Two families away on holiday had a miraculous escape when their Gloucestershire homes were destroyed in separate lightning strikes. Emergency services dealing with the fallout from the thunderstorms arrived to find both homes had been hit on the roof. One of the houses, in Hardwicke, was struck in the early hours of Saturday morning, with the lightning bolt destroying the roof and falling debris crushing a nearby Honda Jazz. Debris from the damaged roof in Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, crushed a Honda Jazz parked below it . Craig Smith, a neighbour, said: 'I saw an almighty flash and mortar flying up in the air. They are a lovely family and they'll be gutted when they get home. 'I'm just glad they weren't home when it all happened. It happened so close to our house that I just can't fathom it.' Another neighbour said she felt the earth shake and heard the car alarm go off and the owner of the car shout 'oh my god' when the bolt struck. Twenty miles away, in Ampney Crucis, near Cirencester, a house was struck on Saturday afternoon as the huge storm swept across the Cotswold. The bolt, as well as destroying the roof, started a major fire in the upper levels of the house, which destroyed the loft and gutted the upper floors. The second home in Gloucestershire to suffer serious damage was in Ampney Crucis, when a bolt of lightning destroyed the roof and then a fire gutted the upper floors . Meanwhile, a bungalow in Solihull, West Midlands, was completed gutted by a fire sparked by a bolt of lightning and fueled by a burst radiator in the early hours of Saturday morning. Taking to their Twitter account, Solihull Fire said the intense heat caused a radiator to explode forcing crews to withdraw for safety. 'This is the danger crews faced when entering in breathing apparatus to fight the fire & search the property. Intense heat caused explosion forcing crews to withdraw for safety, later found to be this radiator on the 1st floor.' A neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said one of the firefighters said they believed it was caused by a lightning strike. 'We don't see what else it could be because the property is empty so nobody would have been there.' Before and after: The bungalow in Solihull caught ablaze in the early hours of Sunday morning. Fuelled by a burst radiator, fire crews had to withdraw due to intense heat. The house was completely gutted in the fire. In South Yorkshire, forks of lightning rained down on a family home, engulfing it in fire early Saturday evening. A neighbour . said: 'I saw it all happen. It took about fifteen minutes from when the . lightning hit for the house to catch on fire. 'I've . never witnessed anything like it. I got in and I thought ""wow that was . close"". There was an almighty blue ball of flash and we started rushing . around the house turning everything off. 'What . people didn't see was the terror on people's faces. There was just a . huge bang and the blue flash was unbelievable. I've not seen anything . like it in my life and I've done a lot of travelling in my time. 'The . emergency services actually went in and rescued the goldfish. The whole . fire crew were absolutey fantastic and everyone in the street worked . together.' Homeowner Richard Lowe said the family were still coming to terms with the damage. 'I'm still in shock,"" he said.'But no one has been hurt and things can be replaced. Family will be putting us up.' The fire at this South Yorkshire home was started by bolts of lightning. Although it was unoccupied at the time, firefighters managed to go inside and rescue the family goldfish . The upper parts of the house were left badly damaged once the fire was extinguished . The stormy weather caused travel disruption at London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday as airlines were forced to cancel 20 per cent of flights for a two-hour period, while up to 1.2in (30mm) an hour fell in some places - more than the average monthly rainfall for the whole of July. It comes after a heatwave struck the country late last week, causing tropical-like thunderstorms that brought the heavy rainfall and flooding.","Four homes destroyed by fire and lightning as thunderstorm hit the country .

"By . Corey Charlton . This is the terrifying moment a burning car careered towards a hot dog stall in a firefighting display gone wrong. The scrap car was set alight as part of a demonstration at Somerset Steam and Country Show, with a team of firefighters on hand to extinguish it. But as the flames mounted the car began rolling through a cordoned-off area of field towards a food truck. This is the moment desperate officials realised the burning car was on course to hit the food stalls . Officials and firefighters attempted to hold the moving fireball back from the hot dog stand . Fortunately, the blue Ford Escort fire was extinguished without the food stall catching fire . Firefighters and show officials tried in vain to hold back the blue Ford Escort car as the 50-strong crowd watched on in horror. The burning motor finally came to a stop on the tow hitch of the catering unit, which had been evacuated moments before. Had the car not been stopped by the food truck it would have kept rolling into the funfair behind where dozens of families were enjoying the rides. It is thought the car's engine was running when it was set on fire and onlookers reported seeing the car's front wheels still moving after it had hit the food truck. The blaze was eventually extinguished and the vehicle was towed back into the centre of the show ring where it remained for the rest of the day. No-one was hurt in the incident yesterday and neither organisers of the show, held at Low Ham near Langport, Somerset, nor Light Aviation Fire and Rescue Service could be reached for a comment. The car was set on fire as part of a firefighting demonstration at the Somerset Steam and Country Show . But about 50 onlookers were shocked when they realised the demonstration had gone badly wrong . A shocked onlooker said: 'The car fire display was one of the highlights of the demonstrations scheduled to take part in the main ring at the show. 'There were about 50 people watching as a car was set well alight. A fire engine entered the ring and was doing laps of the burning car. 'All of a sudden the car started moving forward. We all thought it was part of the demonstration so no-one really thought anything of it. 'The fire engine stopped parading and the firefighters then started to try to put the fire out, but then the car started moving again. 'It became clear that something had gone very wrong. There were gasps as the crowd began to realise what was happening. 'Firefighters and stewards then jumped in front of the car to try to stop it hitting a hot dog stand but they couldn't.' Smoke from the burning wreckage billows up into the sky as firefighters work to contain the blaze . Fortunatley, no-one was injured in the accident and the burnt out car was dragged back into the main ring . The onlooker added: 'It kept going until it hit the food truck's tow bar. The front wheels were still spinning so if it hadn't hit the towbar it would have just kept going until it hit something else. 'Behind the food truck was the funfair full of families - it doesn't bear thinking about what could have happened. 'The commentator went silent and then started filling, trying to distract everyone's attention from what had just happened. 'Once the fire had been put out it was then dragged back into the middle of the ring and all the other displays went on around it.' 'When everyone realised what was going on there was a real sense of panic. 'It was pretty frightening seeing a ball of flames rolling towards a food truck that presumably has gas bottles inside. 'It could have been an absolute disaster. 'The firefighters looked pretty sheepish afterwards. It must have been something of an embarrassment for them - it certainly didn't paint them in the best light.' The car fire display took place at . 12.45pm yesterday in front of a crowd of around 50 people. There were . approximately 1,000 people inside the showground when the incident took . place. The car fire demonstration scheduled to take place at the same time today was cancelled.","Car rolled through cordon after it was set on fire as part of display .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A California pastor who allegedly used a pair of pliers on a 13-year-old boy's nipple at a group home has pleaded guilty to beating and assault charges. Lonny Remmers, 56, of Corona pleaded guilty to charges: inflicting bodily injury on a child as well as assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Los Angeles Times. Pastor: Lonny Remmers allegedly used pliers on a 13-year-old boy's nipple . Darryl Jeter Jr., 30,  and Nicholas Craig, 24, two members of Remmers' Heart of Worship Community Church, reportedly took the victim to the desert in March 2012 and made him dig his own grave, according to affidavits obtained by the Times. Jeter and Craig allegedly ordered the boy to get into the grave, threw dirt on him, and beat him with belts, the victim's account in the affidavit said. The boy was naked with visible wounds when Jeter and Craig brought him back to the group home, according to witness Steven Larkey's account in the affidavit. Larkey told police he heard screaming in the shower, and found out someone rubbed salt into the boy's wounds.

"By . Corey Charlton . A woman who was helped to walk again thanks to her dog has now returned the favour after her pet lost the use of its back legs. Gemma McKee, 26, has Cesar, a two-year-old Great Dane, to thank for helping her to walk after breaking both ankles in a diving accident. But she was left heartbroken after her 'rock' suffered a back injury, leaving him without the use of his rear legs. Cesar suffered from fibro-cartilaginous embolism - a blocked blood vessel in the spinal cord - in January . Gemma McKeey said her pet Great Dane Cesar was her 'rock' when she broke her ankles in a diving accident . After her pet's help as she recovered from her injury, she said she was more than happy to return the favour when they discovered in January Cesar had lost the use of his back legs . Cesar suffered from fibro-cartilaginous embolism - a blocked blood vessel in the spinal cord - in January. Determined to fight on for her beloved dog, Gemma went looking for a specially built cart which has allowed him to run again. Miss McKee, from Paisley, Scotland, said: 'My heart broke when the vets told me Cesar wouldn't be able to walk unaided again. He's been such an active dog. 'It sounds strange but I understood what he was going through - less than a year before Cesar's illness, doctors told me I'd never walk again.' The news came when Cesar woke wimpering and limping just as she was getting back on her feet herself. He was referred to a spinal specialist who broke the bad news, saying he would never walk again. She was desperately keen to get Cesar walking again as it was him who gave her the . strength to walk again following a horrific accident in 2012. Gemma McKee (left) pictured with her fellow dancers before she badly broke her ankles in a diving accident . Miss McKee has since made a full recovery after she was told by doctors she might never walk again and may even need to have her feet amputated - while her pet Cesar can also now run again using his new 'wheels' Having . danced since she was three, she broke both her ankles when performing . a synchronised dive with the 1940s routine Doll House in Germany. At the time, doctors said it was unlikely . she would ever walk again, and even had her sign a form allowing them to . amputate her feet should the operation go wrong. It . took her a year and support of her dog to begin walking again, saying Cesar helped her throughout, acting as her rock. 'As long as he wasn't in any pain, I was determined to help my devoted pet get mobile again - I couldn't bear to see him looking so sad.' Finding a cart for the ten stone Great Dane proved tricky though, with wheels of that size unavailable in the country. Thankfully, Dogs on Wheels in London copied a US design for £500 instead of £2,000, meaning the dog could walk again. Since getting the wheels in May, his health has improved and he is back running again. McKee, pictured bottom left, with friends and the members of One Direction before her accident . Cesar pictured before he suffered a blocked blood vessel in his spine which disabled the use of his hind legs . 'Like me, he just needs help to get him out and about,' Miss McKee said. 'To see him whizzing round the park on his ""wheels"" you know he still enjoys his walks and life in general. 'We make a right pair. We're both walking miracles and together we've saved each other. I'm so lucky to have him.'","Gemma McKee said her pet dog was her 'rock' when she broke her ankles .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Associated Press . At least 89 people have been killed in one of Afghanistan's deadliest suicide attacks since British and U.S. troops invaded in 2001. A bomber detonated a car packed with explosives this morning, destroying more than 20 shops and dozens of cars, hitting a mosque and leaving victims buried in heaps of rubble. An official said the blast, in a small undefended town 150 miles south of Kabul near the border with Pakistan, also wounded at least 42 people - all civilians. Scroll down for video . Horror: A suicide bomb attack has killed at least 89 people near a busy market in eastern Afghanistan . Rubble: The suicide bomber detonated the device near a police checkpoint in Paktika province . Injured: A wounded man is stretchered into hospital for treatment after the devastating blast . The official, Mohammad Reza Kharoti, said: 'It was a very brutal suicide attack against poor civilians. There was no military base nearby.' The death toll was originally put at lower than 40, but so many victims were buried in rubble that it more than doubled within a few hours. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban sent a statement to media denying their insurgent group was involved in the Paktika bombing and saying they 'strongly condemn attacks on local people.' Defence Ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi said the bomber detonated his vehicle as he drove by the remote town's crowded market. The military was providing helicopters and ambulances to transport the victims to the provincial capital, Sharan. At least 42 wounded have been moved to hospitals there, said General Azimi, adding that the explosion destroyed more than 20 shops and dozens of vehicles. Carnage: Cars, trucks and tractors were left mangled by the blast, for which the Taliban denied responsibility . Destruction: Locals were left to pick over the rubble with diggers in the small town, which had no Army base . Stretcher: One man wounded in the attack is moved to hospital. The worst-injured were taken by helicopter . The bombing happened just three days after deal was struck between Afghanistan's two presidential contenders in a bid to avert a dangerous rift in Afghanistan's democracy. Saturday's deal was brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and involved former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah. The pair were agreeing on an audit of last month's contested presidential run-off vote. Unofficial and disputed results showed Ghani-Ahmadzai well in the lead, but supporters of Abdullah say that's only because of widespread fraud. Since fraud was alleged on both sides, the deal provides that every one of the 8million ballots will be audited under national and international supervision over the next three or four weeks. Neither the election nor the weekend deal have had any visible impact on the security situation in the country, which sees near-daily attacks. Aftermath: The death toll was originally put at lower than 40, but many victims were buried in rubble . Hospital: Doctors tend to the wounded in a crowded hospital near the site of the blast this morning . Injuries: Lying on a blood-stained hospital bed, a wounded man has a dressing applied to his leg . An official said the blast, in the small Urgun district near the border with Pakistan, also wounded at least 42 . This morning's blast took place hours . after a roadside bomb ripped through a minivan carrying employees of the . presidential palace in eastern Kabul, killing two passengers. Seven government employees were on board, all of them from the palace's media office, said Kabul police chief Gul Agha Hashimi. The explosion also wounded five other people inside the minivan, including the driver. Mr Hashimi, speaking to reporters at the site of the blast, added: 'One passenger survived unharmed.' Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said the minivan bomb was a remotely detonated device planted along a main road.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for that attack in a statement sent to reporters. Roadside bombings are a major threat to both Afghan security forces and civilians across the country. Such attacks have escalated as the Taliban intensify their campaign ahead of the withdrawal of foreign troops. Western . forces, most of them from the U.S., are due to leave the country by the . end of this year - prompting fears the nation will descend into a . crisis similar to that in Iraq.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Dozens of victims left buried in rubble .

"By . James Gordon . After more than six months at sea, a 67-year-old Polish adventurer paddled his kayak into New Smyrna Beach on Saturday to mark the end of a 6,000-mile trans-Atlantic journey, looking like a castaway. Aleksander 'Olek' Doba kissed the ground after he landed. He was greeted by hundreds of cheering supporters. A flotilla of fellow kayakers joined him as he paddled into the marina. His skin was bronzed and weathered, his beard long and tangled, but his mood was triumphant after completing a journey across one of the world's roughest oceans. Triumphant: To the cheers of hundreds of supporters on the water in kayaks and on land holding signs, Polish adventurer Aleksander Doba paddled into New Smyrna Beach Marina on Saturday after a more than 6,000-mile journey across the vast Atlantic Ocean alone in a kayak . What a trip! Doba left Lisbon, Portugal on October 5, with the goal of making the more than 6,500 mile crossing, however he was forced to stop in Bermuda for repairs to his 21-foot kayak from February 13 to March 23 after harsh weather damaged his rudder . The Polish explorer should arrived at New Smyrna at the weekend. He told the crowd that completing the trans-Atlantic voyage was his dream. 'The feeling I had when I (arrived) here in New Smyrna Beach was fantastic, so many people, so friendly,' he said. Doba left Lisbon, Portugal on October 5, with the goal of making the more than 6,500 mile crossing, however he was forced to stop in Bermuda for repairs to his 21-foot kayak from February 13 to March 23 after harsh weather damaged his rudder. He also experienced equipment issues and was unable to send messages for 47 days. But he reached Bermuda, where he spent a month while repairs were made. Castaway: Sporting a beard he said that he had barely slept on the six-month long crossing . Heroic journey: He said the most-difficult part of his trip was navigating through the choppy waters of the Gulf Stream just days before he reached the Florida coast . Home for six months! Aleksander Doba sailed 6,000 miles across the Atlantic in this tiny kayak . While in Bermuda he still managed to live off the rations that he packed in Portugal — before setting out again to complete the journey. His paddle from Portugal to Bermuda is believed to be the longest open-water kayak crossing in history. He said the most-difficult part of his trip was navigating through the choppy waters of the Gulf Stream just days before he reached the Florida coast. In December, he refused a rescue attempt by members of a commercial tanker after issuing an SOS signal, about midway across the Atlantic. He told the crew that his satellite navigation equipment wasn’t working properly, but that he was proceeding anyway. According to Canoe & Kayak magazine, even the last few days of fighting the Gulf Stream proved extremely challenging. Back on dry land: The 67-year-old Polish adventurer paddled his kayak into the record books as he landed at New Smyrna Beach on Saturday to mark the end of a 6,000-mile, trans-Atlantic journey . On dry land: He told the crowd that completing the trans-Atlantic voyage was his dream . 'For five months we worried about crossing the Gulf Stream,' Piotr Chmielinski, who has helped manage Doba’s expedition and served as translator, told Canoe & Kayak. 'If he got northerly winds, the current and winds fight each other and you get choppy, breaking son-of-a-gun waves' Among those who greeted Doba on Saturday was Marianne McCormick of Port Orange. McCormick said she has followed Doba's adventure since November. 'I wouldn't miss this for the world. My husband wanted to play golf. I said, 'I'm coming here,' ' said McCormick, who took pictures of the celebration with her iPad. Mary ""Snookie"" DeMarce, of Edgewater, brought a sign that read ""Olek, you're my hero.' 'Yes, he's an inspiration because I'm 65,' she said. New Smyrna Beach Mayor Adam Barringer shook Doba's hand, calling him 'Aleksander the Great.' Barringer read a proclamation in Doba's honor and presented him with a bottle of champagne on behalf of the city. He was also presented with honorary membership into the Smyrna Yacht Club. Doba started paddling at the age of 40 and, according to his son, lived by this motto: “It’s better to live one day as a lion than a thousand years as a lamb.” He completed his first trans-Atlantic expedition in February 2011 when he kayaked 3,900 miles from Senegal, Africa, to Brazil — a 99-day journey.","Aleksander Doba set off in October from Lisbon, Portugal .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Animals come in all shapes and sizes and now scientists have demonstrated how their form affects their perception of moving objects. By studying a variety of animals, researchers have discovered that a creature’s body mass and metabolic rate dictates how it perceives the speed of a moving object - or person. They found that a dog and housefly see movements more slowly than a human, while a rat and a cat see movement more quickly. Scroll down for video . By studying a variety of animals (pictured) researchers have discovered that a creature's body mass and metabolic rate dictates how it perceives the speed of a moving object - or person . To examine how animals experience the passing of time, the scientists examined how fast they could see a light flash in a second (Hz). The higher the number, the slower time seems to move for the animals. The scientists, from the School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, said that speed perception depends on how fast an animal’s nervous system processes information in order to react to its environment. To investigate, they showed 34 types of vertebrates, including fish, birds, lizards and mammals, a flashing light. If the light flashes fast enough, both humans and animals see it as a constant beam, Scientific American reported. By measuring an animal’s brain activity, they examined the highest frequency that it saw the light flashing. To animals that can see the light flashing at higher speeds, it is as if movements and situations unfold more slowly, according to the study, published in the journal Animal Behaviour. The team think that this is advantageous to animals that need to avoid obstacles or predators quickly. For example, chipmunks and pigeons can see a light flash 100 times a second, while cats see it flash 55 times a second. By studying an array of different animals, a team of researchers discovered that a creature’s body mass and metabolic rate dictates how they experience the passing of time. This means that a mouse (pictured left) experiences the world and time very different than an elephant, (left) for example . 102679 . 81874 . 14908 . 42307 . 59211 . 117076 . 56657 . 49691 . 84428 . 34993 . 89960 . 63507 . 35968 . 22338 . 30001 . 35527 . 41518 . 97849 . 84939 . 171000 . Animals that could see the light flash at high speeds were found to have faster metabolisms, confirming the scientists’ hypothesis that the species that can see objects move at a higher frequency of flashes tend to be smaller. A dog can take in visual information – . and see a light flashing – 25 per cent faster than a human, and while . this makes it seem that time moves more slowly for canines, it is not . enough to mean that one dog year equates to seven human years, they added . The study demonstrates that a mouse sees the world and experiences time in a very different way to an elephant, for example. The connection between the perception of time and a creature’s body size and metabolism suggests that different nervous systems have evolved based upon a species’ environment and how they survive in the wild.","Scientists from Trinity College, Dublin, studied animals including dogs to find that their size and metabolic rate dictates how they experience time .

"By . Associated Press . U.S. stocks declined for a second day Friday, adding to the massive sell-off the day before and giving the market its worst week in two years. Investors found little reason to move money into stocks, faced with the growing geopolitical concerns in Israel and Ukraine, as well as banking problems in Europe. For the last two years investors have generally wanted to step in to buy any major fall in the stock market, traders said, causing any sell-off to be met the following day with modest buying. Traders said that the selling Friday, on top of what happened the day before, is not a good sign. Plummet: The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,493.37 - that's on top of the 317-point drop the index had on Thursday . Sinking: On Friday the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,925.15. The index fell 2.7 percent this week, its worst weekly performance since June 2012 . Crisis: Trader Benedict Willis, left, calls out as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday . 'The follow-through from yesterday's (market drop) is very telling,' said Jonathan Corpina, a trader on the New York Stock Exchange with Meridian Equity Partners. 'The end of this week could not come at a better time as the weekend might provide some stability.' On Friday the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,925.15. The index fell 2.7 percent this week, its worst weekly performance since June 2012. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,493.37. That's on top of the 317-point drop the index had on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite fell 17.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,352.64. Energy and financial stocks were among the biggest decliners. Chevron, the nation's second-largest oil and gas company behind Exxon Mobil, fell $1.34, or 1 percent, to $127.90. While Chevron's earnings were better than analysts had predicted, the company's oil and gas production fell in the quarter. Exxon also reported lower production when it released its own results Thursday. Banking stocks also fell. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs all fell roughly 2 percent each. On Friday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ruled that Argentina had officially defaulted on its bonds for the second time in 13 years, in what the ISDA calls a 'credit event.' In a 'credit event,' investors who own credit-default swaps, a type of insurance that protects against a bond issuer defaulting, are activated and the companies which wrote the policies must pay the investors who own them. In Portugal, the struggling bank Banco Espirito Santo plunged 40 percent. Espirito Santo reported Wednesday a 3.5 billion euro net loss for the second quarter, and there were concerns the bank is insolvent. The concerns over the Argentinian default and as well as with European banks were the biggest driver of Friday's market decline, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Keeping an eye on things :Specialist Anthony Rinaldi is reflected in one of the screens at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday . Break: Trader Daniel Leporin rests his head on a specialist's shoulder as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . 'The market doesn't like anything that could potentially disrupt the credit markets,' Golub said, noting that indicators of market volatility jumped on Friday. Adding to the uncertainty, investors had the violence in Israel and Gaza as well as Ukraine to worry about. A 72-hour ceasefire between Israel and Gaza collapsed early Friday. In Ukraine, violence between government and pro-Russian separatists escalated. Ukraine's unrest as well as the concerns over Espirito Santo weighed heavily on European markets. Germany's DAX fell 2.1 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 1 percent, and the FTSE 100 index fell 0.8 percent. As global stock prices declined, traders moved money into investments traditionally seen as having lower risk Friday, such as U.S. government bonds, gold and utility stocks. Investors did get some good news about the U.S. economy. The Labor Department said that U.S. employers created 209,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent. July was the sixth-straight month that U.S. employers created more than 200,000 jobs, a sign that the U.S. economy continues to recover. Economists also pointed out that the rise in the unemployment rate was likely due to more out-of-work people actively looking for jobs. 'In a nutshell, it's a good report,' said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at brokerage firm BTIG in New York. 'Not too hot, not too cold.' The good news on the economy also means the Federal Reserve isn't going to be there to hold investors' hands for much longer. The central bank said Wednesday it would cut back its bond-buying program again, and investors now believe the Fed is looking to raise interest rates starting next year. The Fed's stimulus efforts, combined with the growing U.S. economy, have helped pushed the stock market higher. The last time U.S. stocks had a correction, meaning a decline of 10 percent or more in a benchmark index like the S&P 500, is nearly three years ago. They typically happen every 18 months. Proctor & Gamble was among the day's winners. The stock rose $2.33, or 3 percent, to $79.65. The consumer products giant said it earned an adjusted profit of 95 cents a share, four cents better what analysts had expected. P&G helped lift other consumer staples companies, making the industry the best performing industry in the S&P 500. In other trading, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.49 percent and the price of gold rose $12.30 to $1,293.60 an ounce. Silver fell four cents to $20.37 an ounce. The price of oil fell to the lowest level since Feb. 6. Benchmark U.S. crude oil dropped 29 cents to $97.88 a barrel, and ended the week with a loss of $4.21 a barrel, or 4 percent.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Children who recognise the logos of fast food chains such as McDonald's (pictured) are more likely to be fat, a new study claims . The glowing neon signs of McDonald's, KFC and other fast food chains can be seen in almost every city across the globe. And now researchers have found that children as young as three who recognise the logos of the restaurants, are more likely to be fat. A new study revealed that children who could also recall the brand names of soft drinks and unhealthy snack brands are more likely to be overweight or obese. Previous research has shown that children who are overweight tend to maintain an unhealthy weight throughout their lives. A team from Michigan State University in the U.S. tested children on their knowledge of various brands - including their ability to identify brand logos such as the McDonald’s golden arches. They found that those who could identify them most easily tended to have higher body mass indexes, or BMIs. ‘We found the relationship between brand knowledge and BMI to be quite robust. 'Kids who know most about these brands have higher BMIs,’ said study co-author Anna McAlister, a professor of advertising and public relations. Children between the ages of three and five were given pictures of unhealthy food-related logos. They were then handed images of food items, packaging and cartoon characters and asked to match the items with their corresponding brand logos, according to the study which was published in the journal Appetite. Professor McAlister said: ‘The results varied, which is a good thing. 'Some kids knew very little about the brands while others knew them exceptionally well.’ The team found that among one group, . exercise tended to offset the negative effects of too much familiarity . with unhealthy food. But that finding could not be duplicated in the . second group. Professor . McAlister explained: ‘The inconsistency across studies tells us that . physical activity should not be seen as a cure-all in fixing childhood . obesity. ‘Of course we want kids to be active, but the results from these studies suggest that physical activity is not the only answer. The researchers wanted to find out whether a sedentary lifestyle and watching too much TV (illustrated with a stock image) makes children fat, or if it is the unhealthy food messages that children see on it. They think it is not just the TV time itself but what is learned through the brands . Parents spend on average £26 a month feeding their children fast food, pizza and burgers – and most lie to their friends for fear of being judged. A survey released last month found more than a third of children under 10 are eating junk food every day. This is despite parents saying they try to monitor their calorie intake and worrying their children’s consumption of crisps and chocolate is 'out of control'. A fifth of parents admitted they regularly lie to others about how much pizza, chocolate and crisps their children are eating and 25 per cent said they lied because they felt guilty about the amount of junk food their children are eating. Almost half of parents confessed their children were overweight and 35 per cent said they think their child’s junk food consumption is out of control. 'The . consistent relationship between brand knowledge and BMI suggests that . limiting advertising exposure might be a step in the right direction . too.’ She . said that because children get most of their food messages from . television, the question is what causes more harm - the sedentary . lifestyle brought on by too much time in front of the TV, or the . unhealthy food messages that children see on it. ‘From our . results it would suggest that it’s not the TV time itself, but rather . what is learned about these brands. It’s probably the developing food . knowledge, not the sedentary lifestyle,’ she said. ‘What . we’re trying to show here is just how young kids are when they develop . their theory of food. 'As early as the age of three, kids are developing a . sense of what food means to them.’ Co-author . Professor Bettina Cornwell said the findings provide more insight into . children’s relationship with food, which she describes as their ‘first . language of food.’ She . said the study proves it does not take long for children to work out . what they do and don’t like and those choices often remain with them for . life.","Researchers from Michigan State University also found that children who know the brand names of soft drinks are more likely to be overweight .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You use them to wash your knives, forks and plates, but experts have warned that dishcloths are dirtier than toilet handles. The cloths collect six times as much bacteria as the handles and harbour potentially life-threatening germs such as E.coli, according to a new study. Research has revealed that Britain’s dishcloths are the dirtiest in the world and health specialists have warned they could be responsible for spreading infections in the home. Experts have warned that dishcloths harbour six times as much bacteria as toilet flush handles and and six out of 10 have germs such as E.coli, according to a new study . Dishcloths from homes in the UK, U.S. South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and India were swabbed and analysed in an international laboratory to identify the type and levels of bacteria present. The Dettol hygiene home truths study, which was commissioned by the UK-based Global Hygiene Council, found that nine out of 10 dishcloths were ‘heavily contaminated’ with bacteria, while 10 per cent were ‘unsatisfactory'. A total of seven per cent of dishcloths had more than one billion bacteria per square metre and 60 per cent were contaminated with E.coli, which causes stomach upsets and can be fatal. A quarter of the cloths contained one . billion Pseudomonas spp. per square metre, which is an organism linked . to damp and dirty conditions. The bacteria can cause minor skin and eye infections and potentially life‐threatening illness. All . the British cloths swabbed failed the overall microbiological hygiene . tests and the U.S. also failed 100 per cent of the laboratory tests. The study suggests that Britain’s . dishcloths are dirtier than people’s toilet flushes with 20 per cent of handles having ‘unsatisfactory or worse’ levels of . bacteria, compared to 100 per cent of dishcloths.

Just five per cent of the cloths collected in India, 10 per cent in the UAE and 25 per cent of cloths collected in South Africa were found to have ‘satisfactory’ levels of bacteria. Health experts warn that unhygienic dishcloths could be responsible for spreading germs around the home. ‘Dishcloths are a hidden health hazard in people’s homes as they harbour harmful bacteria and can spread them around the kitchen - over worktops, chopping boards, on surfaces families eat at and potentially throughout the home', said Professor John Oxford, Professor of Virology St Barts and the Royal London Queen Mary College. ‘By using a contaminated cloth, people are likely to be transferring bacteria around the home and putting themselves and their families at risk of infection. 'A dirty dishcloth can also contaminate hands, which in turn can cause direct contamination of other surfaces and cause indirect infection.’ While 40 per cent of people recognise that dishcloths can harbour high levels of bacteria, just 15 per cent regularly machine wash them at high enough temperatures to kill the germs.","Dishcloths have six times as much bacteria as toilet handles in the UK, according to a study commissioned by the Global Hygiene Council .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Residents and visitors to Israel will soon be able to take in the bustling city’s sights, from the comfort of a hovering sky car. A 1,640ft (500 metre) monorail is being built on the campus of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) next year, with a commercial network set to follow that will extend across Tel Aviv. While monorails may seem like a retro creation, this futuristic version will use cutting edge technology to see two-person pods suspended from magnetic tracks, so they appear to hover. The future? Residents and visitors to Tel Aviv, Israel, will soon be able to take in the bustling city's sights, from the comfort of a hovering sky car. An artist's impression of the system is pictured . A 1,640ft (500 metre) monorail is being built on the campus of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) next year. If it is successful, a larger skyTran system could be rolled out across Tel Aviv, Israel. The new system will see two-person pods suspended from magnetic tracks so they appear to hover. The network of computer-controlled ‘jet-like’ vehicles will use Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology to provide what the firm says is fast, safe, free and economical travel. The computer-controlled pods will travel at up to 43mph (70km/h). If the technology is rolled out commercially, the pods could travel at up to 150 mph (240 km/h). It is estimated that tickets could cost around $5 (£2.90) per rider, but discounts and subscriptions are also planned. The company behind the grand plan – California-based skyTran – claims its system is a clever alternative to congested roads, and that tracks could even travel through buildings as soon as 2016. The network of computer-controlled ‘jet-like’ vehicles will use Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology to provide what the firm says is fast, safe, free and economical travel. ‘skyTran intends to revolutionise public transportation and, with it, urban and suburban commuting,’ the company, based at Nasa's Space Act company headquartered at the Ames Research Centre, said. Like other magev trains, the system uses powerful electromagnets that let carriages float over – or in this case under – a track. The system uses the basic principle that opposite magnetic poles attract and repel each other. Flying high: The network of computer-controlled 'jet-like' vehicles (illustrated) will use Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology to provide what the firm says is fast, safe, free and economical travel . Jet-like: The transport system will use cutting edge technology to see two-person pods (illustrated) suspended from magnetic tracks, so they appear to hover . Instead of an engine, the pods will use a magnetic field created by electrified coils in the track to allow them to hover and propel them along. As well as looking cool, using magnetic levitation instead of wheels mean there is no physical contact between the vehicle and the ‘guideway’ or rail, so there is no wear and tear. Because the vehicles are levitated a short distance away from the guideway, and both lift and thrust are produced by electromagnets, their speed can be easily controlled and the company said they could achieve reliable high speeds of up to 150 mph (240 km/h). Luxurious: Unlike monorails at theme parks, the pods will be plush and private, similar to a a car (illustrated). They will also travel much faster at 43mph (70km/h) - although these speeds could rise if the system is rolled out across greater distances . Maglev technology is already used in high-speed railways, such as Shanghai's Maglev Train (pictured), which has a top operational speed of 268mph (431km/h). But the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system . Maglev uses magnetic levitation instead of wheels. The idea is that because the system makes no physical contact between the vehicle and the guideway, there is nothing to wear out or fail. The technology promises a smooth and quiet journey that is high speed and energy efficient. It is already used in high-speed railways, but the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system. Railways like Shanghai's Maglev Train use large superconducting electromagnets in a special configuration to produce intense magnetic fields over long distances. Opening in 2004, it was the first commercially operated high-speed magnetic levitation line in the world. Trains have a top speed of 268mph (431km/h) and connect Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of Pudong with the Shanghai Metro. This technology will ‘provide a platform for skyTran vehicles to travel at high speeds, with full payloads while levitating,’ the company said. The electrified system could even be powered by solar or wind power. The aim in building the test track is to convince town planners that the technology works so that in the near future, people could order a vehicle on their smartphone to collect them from a specified station, and then take them to their chosen destination. Unlike monorails at theme parks, the pods will be plush and private. They will also travel much faster, at 43mph (70km/h) although these speeds could rise substantially if the system is rolled out across greater distances. It is . estimated that construction of the first commercial system will take two . years at a cost of around $80 million (£47,000) and will extend to . cover the whole ‘Gush Dan’ urban and suburban area. Individual . tickets are predicted to cost around $5 (£2.90 or 17 new Israel . shekels) per rider, but discounts and subscriptions are also planned.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A cyclist who lost six of her front teeth in a near-fatal bike accident is today smiling again after a dentist fitted implants when the NHS refused to fund the operation. Alex Kerr was hit by a car as she cycled home from work last November. The 20 year-old advertising assistant was in a coma for a week and woke to find that six of her front teeth had been knocked out. She also suffered a broken pelvis, broken jaw, two dislocated knees and a broken wrist. Advertising assistant Alex Kerr, 20, lost six of her front teeth after a serious bike accident (pictured left). She was refused an operation on the NHS but is smiling again (pictured right) after a local dentist fitted implants free of charge . While Ms Kerr made a full recovery, she left hospital looking dramatically different. Despite missing her teeth the NHS told Ms Kerr a new set of teeth was not regarded as ‘acute care’. She was told that she would be put on a waiting list unless she paid £12,000 for a private procedure. But Ms Kerr said her broken teeth left her too self-conscious to leave her home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. After reading about her plight dentist Dr Wynand de Jeger of the Brooklands Dental Practice in nearby Broughton, stepped in, offering to fit her new implants free of charge. ‘I was just so self-conscious all the time and sometimes didn't want to leave the house. I can't even imagine what it would be like if I couldn't have these implants done,’ Ms Kerr said. ‘Me and my boyfriend had just moved into a new flat when I had my accident and now I can finally begin to enjoy it. ‘My family just can't believe how confident I am again. My smile is nothing like it was after the accident. I'm really happy. ‘I . am so grateful to everyone at Brooklands especially my dentist. He was . the one who contacted me and he has been there all the way through my . recovery.’ Ms Kerr . left hospital looking dramatically different with her teeth still . missing (pictured above), after the NHS told her that a new set of teeth was not regarded . as ‘acute care’. She says she was told that she would be put on a waiting list unless she paid £12,000 for a private procedure and was too self-conscious to leave her house . During the operation in May, Dr de Jeger fixed three screws through Ms Kerr’s gums and into her jaw. Three implants were then screwed into place before a further three teeth were inserted using a bridge. It will be another month before permanent porcelain implants are screwed in place. Brooklands Dental Practice performed the operation for free and the company that manufacture the teeth waived the cost of the materials needed. Ms Kerr said: 'My family just can't believe how confident I am again. My smile is nothing like it was after the accident' ‘It was really painful after the operation but a week later it was just normal, as if nothing had ever happened,’ Ms Kerr said. ‘It is just so nice to know that there are people out there with such a kind heart.’ Ms Kerr said that she had been led to believe that her treatment would be carried out for free when she was transferred to hospital two weeks after her accident. But when she went for a follow-up appointment with a maxillofacial expert she was told she would have to foot the bill for any future treatment herself. Permanent implants cost around £2,000-per-tooth and Ms Kerr was worried and angry that she could not afford to fix her appearance. ‘I read in magazines all the time about people who have boob jobs, nose jobs and other cosmetic surgery on the NHS because their confidence needing boosting,’ she said. ‘I didn't mean this to happen and I didn't just go to the doctor and say I had a lack of self-confidence and so needed some teeth. 'I had been in an accident and you would think it would be a priority for them to help me.’ Dr de Jeger, a dental surgeon who has worked on TV show Celebrity Extreme Makeover, said he was compelled to help Ms Kerr after hearing about her story. He said: ‘Brooklands is very pleased with the results of Alex's treatment so far. ‘We are currently managing the recovery of the soft tissue to ensure the final restoration will be aesthetically pleasing.’","Alex Kerr, 20 was hit by a car as she cycled home from work last November .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Tracy Rainieri suffered crippling stomach pain at the Bon Jovi concert three months before her wedding day. She is pictured with her father . A bride-to-be nearly died after suffering crippling stomach pain at a Bon Jovi concert when an ulcer in her abdomen burst. With three months to go until her big day, Tracy Rainieri, 42, went to the concert at Cardiff City Stadium with her fiancé, when she suffered crippling the excruciating pain later diagnosed as a perforated ulcer. The mother-of-one was put into an induced coma as doctors battled to save her life. But after recovering from her life-threatening ordeal Mrs Rainieri walked down the aisle as planned last October. Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I thanked my lucky stars as I walked weakly towards my groom. 'To me, the day couldn’t have been more perfect. 'I can’t believe I almost died before my wedding day.’ Her now husband, Massimo Rainieri, 38, proposed on Christmas Day, 2012. Before she fell ill, Mrs Rainieri, from Pontypridd in South Wales, had been planning her nuptials in Cardiff. By June 2013, she had already booked the venue, picked a dress, chosen flowers and booked a photographer. The mother-of-one, who runs an online personal assistant business, started to experience sharp pains in her stomach several days before she and her now husband joined friends at a Bon Jovi concert on June 12. ‘I was at the concert with Massimo and two friends and I could feel a sharp pain in my tummy,’ she said. ‘I popped a painkiller and tried to ignore it - I had been having the pains for the last two days but I wanted to enjoy the concert. ‘Then later . that night I woke up in absolute agony. My stomach felt like it was on . fire and I begged Massimo to take me to hospital.’ Doctors at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, told Mrs Rainieri that she had a perforated duodenal ulcer. Mrs Rainieri was put into an induced coma as doctors tried to save her life, but after recovering, she walked down the aisle as planned last October. The bride is pictured with her extended family at the wedding . Mrs Rainieri's condition is rare and affects around one in 350 people with a stomach ulcer. The lining of the stomach splits open, which is serious because it enables the bacteria living in the stomach to escape and infect the lining of the abdomen. The most common symptom of this peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. In peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated.Source: NHS Choices . A perforated ulcer is a potentially life-threatening condition where an untreated ulcer can burn through the wall of the stomach allowing digestive juices and food to escape into the abdominal cavity. She said: ‘Poison was rapidly swimming through my body and they had to operate fast.’ When medics anesthetised Mrs Rainieri she had a severe allergic reaction and went into anaphylactic shock, causing parts of her body to swell up and her heart to stop. Surgeons were forced to put her into an induced coma, while they worked on repairing her stomach lining. Two days . later Mrs Rainieri came around and a fortnight later she underwent a . second operation to restore her perforated stomach lining. But it was not until a month after being first admitted that doctors said she was well enough to go home. At the Bon Jovi concert (pictured) Mrs Rainieri took a painkiller and tried to ignore the pain in her stomach, but was afterwards in agony and was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant by her fiancé . Doctors told Mrs Rainieri that she had a perforated duodenal ulcer, which had burst through her stomach lining. She needed an operation but suffered a severe allergic reaction to the anaesthetic. Despite being put into an induced coma at the time, she was healthy enough to enjoy her honeymoon three months later (pictured) Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I returned home in July, weak as a kitten and weighing just seven stone. ‘I . thought my wedding dreams were shattered and that I couldn’t get . married in the state I was in. I could hardly walk and I still had the . feeding tube in my stomach. ‘I . hadn’t even had time to send the wedding invitations out, and I thought . about calling it off, but I would have to have been back in hospital . before I seriously considered cancelling.’ Determined that the wedding day should not be postponed, Mrs Rainieri’s mother and future husband took over the planning of the big day. ‘My mum took up the organising and Massimo told me to focus on walking down the aisle,’ she said. On October 6, 2013, the couple were married in front of 70 guests. She said: ‘It was a relief to me and everyone else that I made it to the wedding. ‘In every photo I have this stupid grin on my face, I was in pain and I was really weak but I could not stop smiling. It was one of the best days of my life.’ Mr and Mrs Rainieri’s first dance was to the Bon Jovi power ballad Always. Mrs Rainieri said: ‘I still wanted to have my first dance to Bon Jovi, even though I nearly died the day I saw them in concert.’ The mother-of-one is recovering well and enjoying married life.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The Juice People says that its Hay Fever Aid (pictured) combines anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory ingredients . For the millions of hayfever sufferers hiding indoors seeking shelter from high pollen counts, a new juice could be the key to banishing the seasonal sniffles. One company claims they have found a healthy and tasty way to relieve the incessant sneezing,  runny nose and streaming eyes that blights sufferers' summers. And the good news is you can blend the remedy yourself. The Juice People, based in Covent Garden, London, says its Hayfever Aid combines anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory ingredients, offering an alternative remedy to dreaded condition. They claim the tasty juice helps relieve symptoms, ‘without any of those drowsy drugs leaving you skipping through the summer'. The concoction, which includes pineapple, lemon, apple and ginger, is full of vitamin C ‘to enhance its pollen-leveling effects and minimise the immune system’s response’. According to the NHS, hayfever affects one in five people at some point in their lives and this year, the pollen count is said to be twice as high as usual. The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double to reach 30 million in the next two decades as rising pollution levels trapping pollen in the atmosphere, experts have warned and 15million Britons are already battling the symptoms. Adrianna Stoyanova, in-house nutritionist at The Juice People, advises sufferers should drink the juice every morning throughout the hayfever season, which runs from late March to September, and reach for another throughout the day if they need it. ‘The juice works as a fabulous alternative to conventional Hayfever remedies,' she told MailOnline. 'The ingredients have natural anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory properties that help to supress and relieve the symptoms of hay fever as well as aiding your body in the fight against the pollen. ‘The pineapple, apple and lemon produce a serious kick of vitamin C a powerful antioxidant that you should be taking more of throughout the summer if you suffer from hayfever. The concoction, which includes pineapple, lemon, apple and ginger, is full of vitamin C 'to enhance its pollen-leveling effects and minimise the immune system's response,' the firm says. According to the NHS, hayfever (illustrated) affects one in five people at some point in their lives and this year . ‘The . nutrients in the juice work to enhance the anti-histamine and . anti-inflammatory effects making it the perfect daily remedy to your . fight against hayfever. ‘Ideally . the juice should be consumed every morning throughout hay fever season . and a few weeks in advance if possible, then supplemented in the day if . symptoms are particularly bad. ‘As an all-natural remedy this fights with your body rather than against it and also helps to boost energy and aid nutrition.’ Blend… . Juice all the ingredients and pour over ice. The juice shops, which create different blends of healthy juices, such as the Green Super Power, use industrial centrifugal juicers and blenders to slowly extract the juice from fruit, while retaining its nutrients, but the recipe can be easily made at home. Traditionally people have turned to various different natural remedies to ease their hayfever symptoms. They include a spoonful of honey in the morning, thought to desensitise sufferers to pollen. The theory goes that because the pollen bees collect is the heavy-grained variety, it doesn't cause problems.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A migraine sufferer has banished the crippling headaches which once left her sick and incapacitated for days, using a high-tech headband which emits electrical pulses to the brain. The silver headband may look and sound like a prop form a sci-fi film. But Cefaly exists and the medical device is now available in the UK, having relieved the painful symptoms of migraine sufferers across Europe and the U.S. The non-invasive device claims to be free of any side-effects and works by applying neurostimulation to the nerves affected by migraine attacks. Fay Sharples, 26, from Morecambe in Lancashire, told MailOnline the device has changed her life, easing her debilitating headaches in one day, after five weeks of treatment. Scroll down for video . Cefaly, a silver headband that emits electrical pulses to the supraorbital nerve in the brain, can ease the effects and length of migraines. Fay Sharpes (pictured) wears the device for 20 minutes before going to bed and says that now her migraines clear in one day instead of three, and the intensity of the pain has reduced . Migraine sufferers are advised to wear the device for 20 . minutes every day as a preventative measure or at . the start of an attack to help to relieve the symptoms. In a recent study carried out on 67 patients across five centres in Belgium, 38 per cent of people who used Cefaly reported getting migraines half as often. They could also take 37 per cent less medication each month. The Migraine Trust estimates that around eight million people in the UK suffer from the condition, which can include severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, flashing lights and exhaustion. Many sufferers struggle to hold down jobs or look after their families. Currently there is no cure, with treatment usually limited to over the counter or prescription drugs, many of which have unpleasant side effects. It is a scenario Ms Sharples, 26, an auditor, recognises only too well. ‘One . of the worse things about having migraines is that, once you have tried . all the drugs, done all the alternative therapies and kept a food . diary, you are pretty much left to cope by yourself,’ she said. Most headaches and migraines involve the trigeminal nerve. Its superior branch ends at the exit of the eye socket, underneath the skin of the forehead. An adhesive electrode is positioned on the forehead and Cefaly connects to this. Cefaly (pictured) is a silver headband that emits electrical pulses to the supraorbital nerve in the brain, to banish headaches. It has been used by migraine sufferers in the U.S. and Europe and is now available in the UK . Through the electrode, Cefaly generates precise micro-impulses in order to stimulate the nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve. Neurostimulation of the trigeminal nerve produces a relaxing effect. Regular repetition of this effect helps reduce the number of headaches and migraines, according to the company. ‘I had my first mild migraine when I was 12 and by my early 20s I was having three to four attacks a month, which included agonising headaches and being sick. Sometimes the attacks merged into each other, lasting for days at a time. ‘I was put on to some quite serious drugs including Topiramate, which makes me feel exhausted and Naproxinal which caused stomach upset. I also took Imigran but none of the drugs really helped. ‘Migraines made my life a misery. I lost endless working days and my friends got used to me cancelling social engagements. 'Holidays can be a nightmare. One particular attack in America was especially bad. Luckily I have an understanding boyfriend - but all I wanted was a life without migraines. The Migraine Trust estimates that around eight million people in the UK suffer from the condition, which can include severe headaches (illustrated) nausea and vomiting . ‘So when I heard about Cefaly I thought I had nothing to lose. ‘I started about five weeks ago and kept a record of my symptoms. I put it on for 20 minutes just before bedtime and it was very relaxing. ‘By week two the migraines were clearing in one day instead of dragging on for a few. The pain and intensity was also reducing. ‘By week four I had only had two migraines. I hadn’t taken time off sick and my “waking up headaches” had gone. 'I also felt more alert, able to concentrate and brave enough to stop taking Imigram. 'In the last week I have not had any migraines at all. If someone had told me six months ago this would happen I wouldn’t have believed them.’ Wendy Thomas of The Migraine Trust, said: ‘Neurostimulation is proving to be an exciting development in the treatment of migraines and the research on the efficacy of Cefaly is so far positive. ‘We welcome any treatment which can add to the range of options available for the many numbers of people whose lives are blighted by migraine’ Cefaly costs £295 and does not work for everyone, but there is a partial refund policy. Users also have to pay £19.99 for disposable electrode pads which last around a month. Neurologist Jean Schoenen, a professor at the Headache Research Unit University of Liege, Belgium, said: ‘Our research concluded that Cefaly helped around 40 per cent of patients. ‘This compares with a pharmaceutical success rate of 50 to 60 per cent - but Cefaly is almost entirely side effect free. ‘Cefaly is a useful first line treatment which may help around 40 per cent of patients to at least lessen their symptoms and the amount of drugs they have to take. If Cefaly doesn’t work for them, then the patient should be managed with other treatments.’ Ms Sharples said: ‘I know that Cefaly isn’t a cure for my migraines and that they may return. But for the first time in years I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.’","Fay Sharples, from Morecambe, has suffered migraines from the age of 12 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It is said that there are plenty more fish in the sea, but the popular maxim no longer holds true as fish are said to be on the road to extinction. Reports in 2010 found that over-fishing and pollution is depleting the world's fish stocks, and now a team of scientists claims to have discovered how. They state that 90 per cent of fish larvae are biologically doomed to die just days . after hatching, because of the viscosity, or 'stickiness' of the water in which they are born. On the verge of extinction? A team of scientists have found that 90 per cent of fish larvae (pictured) are biologically doomed to die just days after hatching because pollution makes the water they're born into viscous, and this slows them down when looking for food . Around 90 per cent of fish larvae are biologically doomed to die just days after hatching. The study found that ‘hydrodynamic starvation,’ or the physical inability to feed due to environmental incompatibility, is the reason so many fish larvae perish. The ‘stickiness’ or the viscosity of ocean water hampers the larvae’s attempts to feed. ‘All that determines the larvae's feeding ability is viscosity - not age, not development – only their interaction with the surrounding water, Dr Holzman explained. ‘Because the water molecules around you have weak electrical bonds, only a thin layer sticks to your skin - a mere millimetre thick. If you're a large organism, you hardly feel it. ‘But if you're a three-millimetre-sized larva, dragging a millimetre of water across your body will prevent you from propelling forward to feed. ‘So really, it’s all about larval size and its ability to grow fast and escape the size where it feels the water as viscous fluid.’ The researchers found that in less viscous water, the larvae improved their feeding ability and in theory, this water would increase their survival rate. And this stickiness is increased by pollution. A scarcity of fish spells disaster for . over a billion people around the world who are dependent on fish for . their main source of protein. The study, by Roi Holzman and Victor China of the Department of Zoology at Tel Aviv University, follows the 2010 report by the United Nations Environment Program. The research, which was conducted at the Inter-University Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, and published in PNAS, suggests that ‘hydrodynamic starvation,’ or the physical inability to feed due to environmental incompatibility, is the reason so many fish larvae perish. Nearly all fish species reproduce externally – releasing and abandoning their sperm and eggs into the water. The fertilised eggs hatch within a couple of days and the larvae must feed themselves. They had previously fed on a yolk sac – a membrane joined to an embryo to provide early nourishment in the form of yolk – but once hatched, the vast majority die. ‘We . thought, something is going on during this period, in which the . proportional number of larvae dying is greatest,’ Dr Holzman said. ‘Our goal was to pinpoint the mechanism causing them to die. Disaster looming: A scarcity of fish spells disaster for over a billion people around the world who are dependent on fish for their main source of protein. A major report in 2010 blamed pollution levels and overfishing for the state of affairs. A fisherman casting his net in a lake in southern India is pictured . 'We saw that even under the best controlled conditions, 70 per cent of fish larvae were dying within the two weeks known as the 'critical period,' when the larvae detach from the yolk sac and open their mouths to feed,’ said Dr. Holzman. Dr Holzman said that using their understanding of the mechanism that kills off fish larvae, could help 'find a solution to the looming fish crisis in the world'. A school of larval fish is pictured . Over two years, the researchers observed fish larvae at three significant points in their development - at eight, 13 and 23-days-old, or the beginning, middle, and end of that ‘critical period’. They found that the ‘stickiness’ or the viscosity of the surrounding ocean water was hampering the larvae’s attempts to feed. Polluted seawater is typically more viscous than clean water, and cooler water is slightly gloopier than warmer bodies of water. ‘All that determines the larvae's feeding ability is viscosity - not age, not development – only their interaction with the surrounding water, Dr Holzman explained. ‘Because the water molecules around you have weak electrical bonds, only a thin layer sticks to your skin - a mere millimetre thick. If you're a large organism, you hardly feel it. ‘But if you're a three-millimetre-sized larva, dragging a millimetre of water across your body will prevent you from propelling forward to feed. ‘So really, it’s all about larval size and its ability to grow fast and escape the size where it feels the water as viscous fluid.’ The researchers found that in less viscous water, the larvae improved their feeding ability and in theory, this water would increase their survival rate. ‘We conclude that hydrodynamic starvation is the reason for their dying,’ Dr. Holzman said. ‘Imagine eating soup with a fork – that's what it's like for these larvae. They're not developed enough at the critical point to adopt the constrained feeding strategy of adult-sized, better-developed fish.’ Dr Holzman said that by using their . understanding of the mechanism that kills off the majority of the . world’s fish larvae, it could help ‘find a solution to the looming fish . crisis in the world.’ Armed with . this knowledge of the larvae's biological flaw, the researchers are . currently patenting a solution to maintain higher survival rates among . fish larvae populations.","Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel have discovered why 90 per cent of fish larvae are dying - causing a fishing crisis .

"By . Stephen Johns . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . As Deputy Prime Minister, he is used to facing rowdy backbenchers in  the Commons. But Nick Clegg may not have been expecting this scathing verdict on his speech – from a rather bored looking schoolboy. The pupil made what appeared to be an obscene gesture with his middle finger yesterday as he sat through Mr Clegg’s talk at his school. At other points in the speech, the ginger-haired boy seemed to have virtually nodded off. He was pictured with his eyes closed, resting his head in his hands. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was setting out his plans for helping school leavers but the audience seemed unimpressed . This pupil at Southfields Academy in South West London appeared to be sending a not-so-subtle message to the Deputy PM . Dressed . in a navy blazer and striped tie, he appeared to try to hide his . middle-finger gesture by holding his hand against his face. It did . not impress the girl sat next to him, however, who was seen giving him a . dismissive look. Mr Clegg apparently did not notice. The Lib Dem leader was making a speech to around 500 young people at Southfields Academy in South London. He announced that youngsters will be able to gain help at jobcentres from the age of 16, but that jobless teenagers will be forced to improve their maths and English skills or lose their benefits . The . Deputy Prime Minister said 18-21-year-olds who left school without a . grade C at GCSE will be put on compulsory training courses as soon as . they sign on to the dole. The . crackdown is part of a package of measures aimed at preparing young . people for the world of work, including better careers advice, more work . experience and Jobcentres helping under-18s for the first time. One in seven young people in the UK are not in school, work, or training, according to new figures released today. Schools will be made to offer better careers advice while Jobcentres will be able to help 16 and 17-year-olds, Mr Clegg said . The Deputy Prime Minister's speech struggled to inspire many students, but he ploughed on . In . total, 844,000 16 to 24-year-olds are considered 'Neet' - not in . education, employment or training - although the numbers are falling, . government data shows. The Business Department said that the proportion of Neets in this age group is the lowest it has been since 2008. Almost four in 10 16-24 year-olds do not have good qualifications in maths and English. Under new plans to prepare school leavers for work, 18-21 year olds signing on at Jobcentres will have to prove their skills. If they do not who do not have at least a C grade in English and Maths will be put on training courses immediately. Those . who refuse will lose their benefits. The scheme will be piloted in . Kent, Mercia, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall from this autumn, using both . face-to-face training and online support. Mr . Clegg said: ‘From day one of signing up for unemployment benefit, these . young people will need to show they have those Maths and English . qualifications that every job demands. ‘If . they don’t, their adviser will get them on that training immediately to . ensure that if you’re not earning, you’re still learning. ‘We’re . looking at using the latest online learning technologies, so you can . fit this training around the other responsibilities in your life. ‘If you don’t do this training, you won’t get your Jobseekers Allowance.’ If . the young people then get a job, the training will continue to ensure . they have the kills to progress in the workplace, Mr Clegg added. ‘If . these pilots are successful, I want to see them rolled out across the . country: putting earn or learn at the heart of the support we give you.’ For the first time Jobcentres will also be told to help 16 and 17-year-olds looking for work. Mr Clegg said rules banning advisers from working with under-18s ‘just seems wrong’. ‘Surely we should be getting in there early and supplying you with the support you need right now to get into training or work. ‘Government . will now be testing a new approach in selected Jobcentres across . Britain. This, for the first time, will give 16 and 17 year olds access . to personalised jobs advice and support through Jobcentre Plus. ‘You’ll, . finally, have someone there you can talk to about your options and who . can give you information about different schemes like Apprenticeships . and Traineeships and help you apply for jobs or training places.’ Around . 3,000 16 and 17-year-olds will take part in pilots. For the first time Jobcentres will be able to help 16 and 17-year-olds looking for work, while schools will be told to improve careers advice to pupils (file picture) Schools will also face tougher requirements to provide decent careers guidance to pupils. Careers advice for many teenagers is a ‘tick box exercise squeezed into a lunchtime break’, Mr Clegg says. In a speech to around 500 young people at Southfields Academy, south London, Mr Clegg is unveiling measures which he says will help stop young people becoming 'NEET' (not in education, employment or training). He cites a recent Ofsted study which found that just one in five schools were giving all of their pupils detailed career support. Mr Clegg said: ‘For a lot of the young people I meet, careers guidance currently feels like a tick box exercise squeezed into lunchtime break with a busy teacher, who no doubt already has a lot on their plate. ‘So, we are issuing new guidance for schools, in the next few weeks, that will set out just what good careers advice should look like. 'And not take-it-or-leave-it guidance. To make sure it's being followed, Ofsted will be looking more closely at the quality of careers advice and support available when they inspect schools.’ In . 2010, Mr Clegg angered students when he abandoned his general election . pledge to vote against any increase in university tuition fees.","Bored-looking schoolboy made what appeared to be obscene gesture .

"By . Snehal Shah . The teenage college student cut off by her parents when they found out she was gay has revealed that they thought ‘she had a mental disease’. Kate Koenig, 19, said her 'homophobic' parents refused to pay for her classes at the University of Pittsburgh after her father opened her mail last year and learned about her sexuality. She resorted to asking for $15 000 in donations to pay for college via a GoFundMe page. Plea: Kate Koenig, 19, has launched a fundraising campaign online to help her fund her degree at the University of Pittsburgh after her 'homophobic' parents found out she was gay when they opened her mail . Ms Koenig spoke exclusively to MailOnline about how her parents treated her because of her sexuality and the backlash she suffered from the public after news broke of her fundraising campaign. 'They said I had a mental disease,' she said. 'They said my sexuality was a mental disease and I needed medication for it. They said I’m a sick person for being gay. 'My parents said I was just looking for attention, I’m obviously a very sick person who needs help and medication can solve that for me.' Her parents’ discovery, and the family blowout that followed, happened in September 2013, just before Koenig started college at the University of Pittsburgh. She said: 'My mom sat me down and asked me how I became gay. She asked if it was because she started working full time again and wasn’t home as much, or if it was because someone hurt me.' Koenig’s parents also discovered her boyfriend was transgender and had been born female. She said: 'My mother asked, ""Do you want a penis now? If you’re dating this transsexual, transgender man, do you want to be a man too?"" 'Then they wrote me a letter to tell me I was cut off and to shame me for my personality and my sexuality. 'In the letter, they also said they’d found a few psychologists for me and asked me to get therapy and take medication, to cure myself, before they would let me back into the house. They wanted me to switch off my sexuality. 'They said the fact that I used social media and took selfies was indicative of a very narcissistic person. They said social media fuels the gay agenda. It ruins our society and promotes homosexuality and they asked me to delete my social media accounts. 'And my dad said he felt sorry for people in the LGBT+ community. ""They are living a morally corrupt life, they are making this society crumble. They are going to hell.""' Loved: Koenig is pictured with her transgender boyfriend Will, who was born biologically as a woman . Together: She dismissed claims that dating Will meant she was straight, saying: 'I am still gay. Being in a ""straight"" relationship does not take away my sexuality'. The couple have been together over a year . Koenig identifies as pansexual, but also describes herself as ‘gay’, saying: 'To me, gay is the umbrella for the entire LGBT+ community.' Koenig’s parents had already paid for the first semester and co-signed a loan with her for the second semester, but they refused to co-sign any more loans. She asked for $15,000 for her second year’s tuition on her GoFundMe page, which she set up last week. She has already raised almost $12,000, but also received an enormous negative backlash after news of her campaign broke last week. 'People are commenting really disgusting things like ‘die homo b****’, ""why don’t you just go to stripper school or do porn?"", ""suck my d*** and I’ll send you money"". I’m afraid I’ll start getting death threats.' Struggle: Recently, she shared a document showing she had been fired from Costco because the company had overhired. She lamented that it was her main source of income to supplement her loans . Support: Koenig is pictured with Will and his family who have given their support to Kate and her campaign . Koenig says the comments are 'because I’m gay, I’m young, and I’m a woman.' 'I’m being attacked for needing a handout and being lazy. But there are so many people who do this. People have GoFundMes for home improvement or sending their kids on vacation. Some guy got thousands of dollars on Kickstarter for making a potato salad. 'I just feel really harassed right now,' she added. But Koenig is adamant that it’s not about being gay. She continued: 'I’m not asking for money because I’m gay. I happen to be gay, but that’s not my full story. My sexuality is only relevant because that’s the reason I got kicked out. 'I’m just trying to go to school. Pittsburgh is the first time in my life I’ve felt truly safe and accepted for who I am.'

"By . Daniel Mills . Australians will be paying back more student debt and working less from 2016 as the Federal Government forecasts a dire future for the nation's graduates. Up to 65,000 students, or 30 per cent of graduates, will be jobless four months after finishing their studies, and those who find employment will be earning substantially less. The Treasury Department  has also revealed 17,000 more graduates than predicted last year will be unemployed in the four month period. And while the rate of unemployed graduates will soar, the salaries for those starting a new job will drop. According to Treasury, the average graduate income will fall from 78 per cent this year to 74 per cent in 2016-17. More Australian graduates will be unemployed in the first four months of leaving university in 2016 . The dire analysis reflects other independent research into graduate job numbers. A Graduate Destination survey showed the rate of graduates in full-time employment fell from 76 per cent in 2012 to 71 per cent last year. The figures also reflect the announcements made in the May budget, and the impact of the Federal Government's education policies that sparked rioting and fiery public protests in capital cities. Many were angry over the Federal Government's decision to deregulate university fees estimated to save it $1.1 billion over the next three years. Experts predict the changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $120,000, and as a result, deter people from furthering their studies at university. Christopher Pyne said Australians who graduate will still be earning more than those without a degree . But more deregulation means more borrowing, Tim Higgins from the the Australian National University said. He believes deregulation raises concerns about future budget blowouts as students load up on debt. 'There are no incentives for universities to manage the risk of loan non-payment because the government pays the shortfall,'' Dr Higgins said. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that loan payments are expected to increase from $6.6 billion this year to $12 billion in 2018, meaning debt will increase by $3 billion a year between 2016-2018. Greens higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon said it's hard to believe the government would introduce such radical changes, knowing the dire outcomes it will have on graduates. She said: 'It beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department's figures show fewer graduates will be employed.' But Education Minister Christopher Pyne has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree. He said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $1 million more over their lifetimes.","Treasury figures forecast 65,000 Australians out of work in 2016-17 .

"Misty Mink is being held on $75,000 bail after being arrested for theft. She collected thousands of dollars to pay for chemotherapy, but doesn't have cancer . Misty Mink collected thousands of dollars from well-wishers to help pay for her chemotherapy bills - the only problem was she didn't have cancer. Mink, 41, has been jailed in Texas for theft after telling people she had knee cancer and needed help paying bills that her insurance wouldn't cover. One of the well-wishers, Michelle Wasicek spent months helping to raise money for Mink after the women met through mutual friends. 'I feel betrayed and hurt and used,' Wasicek told a local television station. 'I figured this girl is young and she has a fighting chance, and I would want somebody to help me.' Wasicek, who herself is battling thyroid disease, attended and hosted benefit fundraiser concerts to help Mink collect $4,000 for her phony bills. Wasicek would also driver her to treatments. Her mother grew suspicious after Mink cut a rug at the most recent sham fundraiser, despite that pesky knee cancer. 'Somebody that's is supposed to be in so much pain and have cancer in her knee, and you're out there dancing? I'm like get for real,' Wasicek's mom Brenda Seal said. Acting on her mom's suspicions, Wasicek phone Mink's insurance, who insisted they do pay for any cancer treatment. She then dialed a number for Mink's supposed treatment hospital and no one had ever heard of the conwoman. Michelle Wasicek, pictured left, met Misty through mutual friends and hosted benefits to raise money. Michelle's mother Brenda grew suspicious after seeing Misty dance, despite her supposed knee cancer . Michelle then started digging. She called Misty's insurance company and then the hospital, and the sham was exposed. She and her mom showed off the paperwork that led to Mink's arrested to a local reporter . Wasicek, who was picking up Mink from MD Anderson, a top cancer hospital, got her and called her bluff. 'I was fuming... We got back to my apartment and that's when everything hit the fan,' Wasicek said. 'She's a criminal, a career criminal. Her record shows it what kind of person she is.' Indeed, criminal records obtained by Click 2 Houston show previous arrests between 2000 and 2006 for five separate crimes, including three arrests for theft by check and one for forgery. Michelle posted information about Misty's most recent court appearance this week on her Facebook page, encouraging people who wanted to see her jailed to show up and make their voices heard.

Using the . momentum that I've created in my hips when I bring my left foot forward, . I get an extra whip and just try to throw straight at the catcher with . the ball coming from my right foot. 'Most times it gets there. It's similar to the same way people throw with their arms, but I do it with my legs and feet.'

"By . Hannah Roberts . The teenage star of hit mafia TV series Gomorrah has been arrested for his alleged part in a brutal stabbing as vicious as any in the show. Vincenzo Esposito, was plucked from a criminal family in Naples' most notorious ghetto, Scampia, to play mafioso wannabe Danielino, in the prime TV series on Italian television. The ultra-violent show, based on Roberto Saviano’s bestselling expose Gomorrah, has broken all viewing records in Italy and is set to hit UK and US screens in the next few months. In the mindless attack, a group of boys between 15 and 18 set on a young man of 21 after he shouted at them for urinating in the metro station at Scampia. Vincenzo Esposito, right, who has been arrested for his alleged part in a brutal attack on a man in Naples . According to media reports: ‘Six or seven of them fell on the man with kicks and punches while a 15 year old stabbed him. ‘Another two attacked him from behind: One had a knife and inflicted ten stab wounds, seven of which doctors said were potentially lethal.’ Esposito, 16, grew up living with his grandmother because both his parents and his elder brother were in prison, an authentic background which directors said contributed to his selection. After winning the part he dropped out of school. But in a tragic echo of the onscreen mayhem, in which his own character ends up murdered by a rival gang boss, the young actor is now in a youth detention centre. In 2011 the 12-year-old Vincenzo had vowed not to follow his parents into a life of crime. In a book published by his school on pupils’ ambitions, he said: ‘I have a dream, more than a dream, that when I am grown up I will live with my father and mother, as I am not spending my childhood with them. The metro station near Scampia, where the attack on the 21-year-old man is thought to have taken place . ‘I dream that when they get out of prison we will all live together, far away from Naples. ‘When I am grown up I will never make the same mistakes as my father. It’s not worth wasting your life in a cell or worse for the sake of money.’ A former teacher, Paolo Battimiello who has offered his support, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: ‘I went to visit him last week- he’s calm. I hope that he manages to finish the education he began with us. 'I hope that his story, which we still hope can be turned around, makes clear that in this city the only way to destroy the Camorra culture is education.'","Vincenzo Esposito arrested after attack on man in the metro station .

"By . Sara Nathan . He is twice-divorced - so it's no surprise that Mick Jagger would admit: 'I don't really think that much of marriage'. But that did not mean the Rolling Stones frontman was not devoted to L'Wren Scott, his statuesque girlfriend of 13 years. Indeed, in 2007, Jagger, now 70, picked out a vintage diamond ring that signified the fact he expected to spend the rest of his life with the 6ft 3ins tall brunette, also twice-divorced, MailOnline can reveal. Today, the New York City medical examiner's confirmed that L'Wren, 49, had committed suicide by hanging herself at her Manhattan apartment on Monday. Scroll down for video . The ring that said it all: L'Wren Scott had been wearing a massive diamond ring on her engagement finger since 2007 . Vintage lover: L'Wren's stunning diamond ring up close. Her lover Mick Jagger was said to indulge her passion for vintage jewelry . And speaking about her romance with Jagger, a friend told MailOnline today: 'Mick gave L'Wren the ring as a sign of his devotion. I know it was a vintage ring that he picked out himself, but they were very quiet about it, they never discussed it in public - it was just private for them.' Worn on her tell-tale ring finger, L'Wren first showed off the huge rock when the couple were seen enjoying a string of performances at a folk festival in Rajasthan in India in October 2007. Neither would comment at the time on an engagement, but a friend confirmed they were never engaged. L'Wren told how Jagger indulged her passion for antique jewelry and once enthused to Vogue: 'Talk about someone who knows about jewelry - and the most fabulous taste!' She was seen wearing the ring at what would be her last public appearance on December 2 at the British Fashion Awards at the London Coliseum in London. The former model turned fashion designer was known to have been previously married to property developer Anthony Brand, a short-lived union that lasted from 1992 until 1996, when their divorce was finalised in California. However, MailOnline has learned she was also married for a second time before meeting Jagger at a photo shoot in 2001. In an emotional interview, L'Wren's adopted sister Jan Shane told how L'Wren admitted 'I envy you' at their father Ivan's funeral in 2002, adding: 'I know deep down she wanted a family . and kids, and I think she deeply wanted it and couldn't get it. I think . it bothered her.' ‘To me she had it all,’ said Jan, . fighting to hold back tears as she spoke in the kitchen of her . comfortable family home in Sandy, Utah. The mother-of-eight, who has been married for most of her life to a garbageman, added: 'She was going out . with a Rolling Stone and travelling to London and all around the world . and I was a stay-at-home mum who hasn’t really been anywhere.’ In love: Mick Jagger supported L'Wren Scott at the launch of her Banana Republic range in November 2013 - as the statuesque fashion designer clearly shows off the dazzling diamond ring . Lady in red: L'Wren Scott arrives at the premiere of Crossfire Hurricane at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City in November 2012 to support her lover . While Lupe Montufar, who worked as . L'Wren's housekeeper in Los Angeles between 1993 and 2009, told the New . York Daily News that the designer tolerated Jagger’s infidelity in the . hope of one day having a family with him: 'She wanted to get married and . have a family, but she didn’t want to get her hopes up or say it out . loud to Mick. She didn’t want to pressure him. 'She . always dreamed about having fame, fortune and money. She had all that . in her hands with him. She sacrificed a lot to be with him. A few years . ago, she thought she’d be with him forever and have a family. She knew . there were other women, but she accepted it.' When asked about her desire for children in 2010, L'Wren dodged the question, saying: 'Let me . see if I can articulate this in a way that makes sense.' 'I . have seven wonderful sort of children in my life, by default. I have . four fabulous grandchildren. I feel that being the product of adoption . is a wonderful thing, and at the moment my life is saturated with . children. My family life is a high priority.” Jagger and L'Wren shared a $10 million home in London and a stunning apartment on the Left Bank in Paris. And asked how her daughter had won the notorious Mick Jagger, L'Wren's adopted mother Lula Bambrough said in 2003: 'L'Wren . is very independent and would not take any nonsense from anyone no . matter how famous they were. 'She usually knows what she wants and she gets it. It . doesn't surprise me at all that she's tamed Mick. She is very much her . own woman and it would be my guess that is why this Mick Jagger likes . her.' Even Jagger's second wife, Texan supermodel Jerry Hall would later admit: 'I think she's better at dealing with him than I am.' The singer first wed Nicaraguan-born Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971 in St Tropez in the South of France, although the day was marred when he made a scene because Bianca refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. The marriage was effectively over after a year, though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter, Jade. L'Wren Scott married property entrepreneur, Anthony Brand (pictured) in 1993. They divorced after just three years of marriage . Mick Jagger and Bianca Jagger pictured together on their wedding day in 1971 at the Town Hall in St Tropez, France. They divorced in 1979 . When . Bianca finally divorced Jagger in 1979, smart work by his lawyers kept . her settlement at only around $1.6million (£1 million). He then wed Jerry Hall in a Balinese woodcarver’s hut in 1990. The . breaking point with Jerry was his affair with the Brazilian model . Luciana Morad, which resulted in a son, Lucas. When Jerry sued for . divorce, having by then had four children by Jagger, he crassly claimed . their Balinese wedding was legally invalid, and so the marriage was . annulled ‘by mutual agreement’. However, Jerry's rumoured settlement of $7.4 million (£4.5 million) made her the first Jagger ex to describe him as ‘very, very . generous’. So it's no surprise, that speaking in 2010, Jagger told the New York Times: 'I don’t really subscribe to a completely normal view of what relationships should be.' 'I have a bit more of a bohemian view. To be honest, I don’t really think much of marriage. I’m not saying . it’s not a wonderful thing and people shouldn’t do it, but it’s not for . me. And not for quite a few other people too, it would appear.' He laughed: 'I just think it’s perhaps not quite what it’s cracked up to be. I know it’s an elaborate fantasy.' L'Wren's body was found by her assistant at 10am on Monday. Jagger is said to be en route to New from Australia, where he was touring with the Rolling Stones. The tour of Australia and New Zealand has now been postponed and today the band's spokesman was forced to deny that Jagger had left his longtime love at home during the tour because his bandmates felt she was their 'Yoko Ono' - calling reports by PageSix 'ridiculous'. Jerry Hall had four children with Jagger - and managed to walk away from their marriage with a $7.4million settlement .","New York City medical examiner today confirms fashion designer L'Wren Scott committed suicide on Monday by hanging herself .

"By . Associated Press . A chokehold used by a white police officer on a black New York City man during his arrest for selling untaxed, loose cigarettes last month caused his death, the medical examiner announced Friday, ruling it a homicide. Eric Garner, 43, whose videotaped confrontation with police has caused widespread outcry and calls by the Reverend Al Sharpton for federal prosecution, was killed by 'the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,' said medical examiner spokeswoman Julie Bolcer. Asthma, heart disease and obesity were contributing factors, she said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Unresponsive: Police stand over Eric Garner who became unresponsive after being held in an illegal chokehold . Stripped of gun and badge: The officer who is filmed waving at the camera after Garner has been carted away in an ambulance is the same officer who put him in the chokehold . Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York Police Department. The case is being investigated by prosecutors on Staten Island, though Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department is 'closely monitoring' the investigation. For Eric Garner's widow, there is some small relief that the truth about her husband's death is out. 'Thank God the truth is finally out,' Esaw Garner told the New York Daily News. 'Thank God for that.' Video from after Garner has become unconscious shows him lying on the ground as police look over him. Almost seven minutes pass before paramedics arrive and no one had attempted CPR before Garner was loaded into an ambulance. The NYPD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the medical examiner's ruling. The officer who put Garner in the chokehold was stripped of his gun and badge pending the investigation, and another was placed on desk duty. Two paramedics and two EMTs were suspended without pay. Police Commissioner William Bratton has said the officer appeared to have placed Garner in a chokehold and has ordered a top-to-bottom redesigning of use-of-force training in the NYPD.

He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. 'We want justice for my son. ... I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy,' said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. Police also confirmed Saturday that another officer has been placed on restricted duty after an amateur video surfaced that appears to show him stomping on the head of a Brooklyn drug suspect during a recent arrest. In a statement, the president of the powerful Patrolmen's Association, cautioned against reading too much into the videos. 'Videotapes never present all of the facts in a situation,' said Patrick Lynch. 'They never capture the criminal act or offense that brings police action to the scene. They present an isolated period of a police interaction but never the entire scenario.'

The Garner family was joined Saturday by the fiance of Sean Bell, an unarmed man killed by NYPD officers in a 50-bullet barrage in 2006 on what would have been his wedding day. Three officers were cleared of manslaughter charges, but the city was forced to pay more than $7 million to settle a wrongful death claim. 'Seeing this family is like looking in the mirror,' said Nicole Paultre Bell, who legally took his name after his death.

"By . Sam Webb . Four years of guilt: Sebastian Bendou, 36, stabbed and battered his housemate Christophe Borgye in 2009 . A killer who got away with murder for four years until his guilty conscience forced him to confess to the killing was jailed for life today. Sebastian Bendou, 36, had stabbed and battered his housemate Christophe Borgye in 2009 before encasing his corpse in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete. He and an accomplice who planned the killing then kept their crime a secret after police treated the victim’s disappearance as a routine missing persons inquiry and assumed he had returned to his native France. But hotel worker Bendou could not live with the 'strain' of his guilt and in May last year suddenly travelled 200 miles from his new home in Dumfries, Scotland, back to the town where he carried out the killing. He went to a phone box and called police saying: 'This is too much for my mind.' The next day he led officers to the house of horrors in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire where the body of airline steward Borgye, 36, still lay. Officers broke open the tomb inside a shed to find it contained a low brick wall used to hide the corpse with three separate layers of concrete placed over the body to bury it. A claw hammer and two knives were found next the body wrapped in a duvet and tarpaulin. It emerged Bendou - also a Frenchman - had helped kill Borgye during a row over money. He later claimed he was under the influence of his accomplice, who convinced him Borgye was a French spy. Today Bendou was ordered to serve a minimum 14 years behind bars after being found guilty of murder at Preston Crown Court. His guilty plea to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was rejected by the prosecution. The killer told police he was convinced that Mr Borgye was 'a spy' Father of three Dominik Kocher, 35, from New Abbey in Dumfries, Scotland, who planned the killing was found guilty at an earlier hearing and jailed for life with a minimum recommendation he serve 23 years. Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice Alistair McDuff told Bendou: 'This was a wicked and cowardly attack but you already know that because it preyed heavily on your mind over the next four years. If you had been able to live with your conscience this would have been a crime which would have gone undetected. 'Christophe Borgye was a wholly innocent man and the fear and pain he must have suffered in his dying minutes is unimaginable. This was wickedness beyond comprehension. 'But I also take into account the fact that it was your conscience, your inability to cope mentally with the horrors of this event which led to the discovery of this crime.' Bendou and Dominik Kocher, who masterminded the murder, then hid his body in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete in the garden of the house in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire . Chester Crown Court was told Mr Borgye who worked as a flight attendant for Ryanair was originally from Ronchin in France but had moved to the UK in 2007 due to his job. He initially lived in Liverpool with Bendou and another man before all three moved to Ellesmere Port where Kocher lived with his wife and children. All struck up an arrangement where they would pay wages into the bank account of Kocher who then managed their financial affairs. But trouble began after Mr Borgye planned to move to Belgium meaning money would not be paid into Kocher’s account. In the days leading up to the murder Kocher bought a number of items from builders merchants including concrete, bricks and limestone chippings. He also bought a set of three knives from a supermarket. The victim was later lured into a specially prepared ‘kill room’ where tarpaulin had been laid on the floor and the killers wore blue plastic overshoes on their feet. During the attack Borgye was stabbed twice and hit with the claw end of the hammer eight times with massive force which had caused his skull to shatter. His body was dumped in the back of the shed and encased in the tomb. The victim was reported missing to police by a work colleague in May 2009 but enquiries at the time led officers and his family to believe he had left the country. Bendou carried on living at the house until August 2012 when he and Kocher moved to Scotland - with a warning to the new tenants that were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property. He eventually went to police fearing Kocher was about to 'eliminate’ him. In a statement he initially said he killed the victim in self defence. He said he was 'very scared' and added: 'I’m confessing now because I felt it was too much for my mind and I want some peace.' At the trial Bendou said he had been 'indoctrinated' by Kocher’s story that Mr Borgye was a secret agent sent by 'the Americans' to ensure his wife was deported to France where she had tax issues. Bendou added: 'Christophe was in his bedroom and Dominik called him down... Dominik put the knife into his neck. I took the hammer and I struck him three times in the head. 'I was manipulated by Dominik. I was like a puppet.' Talking of his life in Scotland he added: 'I was frightened for my life. My conscience said to me ""you've got to give yourself in now"".' Today Det Insp Gwyn Dodd from Cheshire Police revealed forensic archeologists, entomologists, cement experts, pathologists, psychiatrists, translators and financial investigators had helped with the investigation. After the killers had left the property, the new tenants were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property. Pictured is the sack in which the victim's body was discovered . He added: 'Kocher was the dominant force and had a controlling influence. He was instrumental in the cover up of the murder and leading people, including his family, into believing Christophe had simply moved away. 'But the strain of their secret in the end proved too much for Bendou.' Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'Bendou led us to the grisly tomb of Christophe Borgye and is now facing the consequences of his role in this tragedy. 'Mr Borgye, Kocher and Bendou were all friends yet Kocher seemed to exert some strange influence over the others that we have never managed to get to the bottom of. 'Borgye and Bendou had their wages paid into Kocher’s account and, in return, he seems to have managed their affairs. 'We may never know the reason why Bendou and Kocher killed My Borgye on that fateful day - the picture is too murky. 'But it seems likely that money was at the heart of it. Kocher bought knives in the days leading up to the killing and tarpaulin, bricks and cement... We’ve always maintained these were used in the killing and to then bury the body. 'This murder was planned, brutally executed and extensively covered up.' Manuel Wagner, 26, also from New Abbey in Dumfries, Scotland, was found not guilty of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial at an earlier hearing.","Sebastian Bendou, 36, stabbed and battered Christophe Borgye in 2009 .

"By . Sam Webb . Though Hamas rockets fill the skies over Israel, residents of cosmopolitan Tel Aviv have been seen hitting the beach, joyfully plunging into the water when the air raid sirens stop and the coast is clear. The threat of violence has hung heavy over the region since the creation of the state in 1948, and as a result Israelis have become accustomed to a daily reality that would fill the people of other westernised nations with dread. Because of its distance from the volatile Gaza strip, the coastal city became known as 'the bubble', avoiding the security threats faced by Israelis in other parts of the country. Scroll down for video . Life as usual: Smiling Israelis and tourists run from the beach to take cover in a nearby hotel in the costal city of Tel Aviv during a rocket attack fired by Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip today . Entering the fray: In the past Tel Aviv has been spared the rocket attacks faced in other parts of Israel, but no longer . However, as a result of the increasing sophistication and range of the rockets fired by militants, the city first came under fire in 2012 and today more volleys were fired, although all were brought down by the Israeli military's Iron Dome missile defence system. The relaxed attitude exhibited by the people of Tel Aviv may have something to do with the fact that not a single Israeli has died as a result of the launches -  a stark comparison to the estimated 170 Palestinians who have died from Israeli Defence Force airstrikes and artillery fire. 'After a while you almost get used to the sound of the air raid sirens, but not completely,' Meytal Cohen, who works in a Tel Aviv women's accessory store told USA Today. She added that she refused to shut up shop and stay at home because it 'would be handing Hamas a victory and I refuse to do that'. Wrath: Rockets fired from the northern Gaza Strip into Israel . Israel's 'Iron Dome' defence system is activated to shoot down an incoming rocket fired by Palestinians militants, near the city of Ashdod . Palestinian militants resumed rocket attacks on Tel Aviv on Monday after a 24-hour lull in strikes on the Israeli commercial capital, and Israel kept up its air and naval bombardments of the Gaza Strip despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire. The military said it had shot down a drone from Gaza, the first reported deployment of an unmanned aircraft by Palestinian militants and a possible step up in the sophistication of their arsenal, although it was not clear whether it was armed. Their rocket attacks have been regularly intercepted but more than half a dozen Israelis have been wounded since the start of the week-old offensive. Gaza health officials say Israeli air strikes have killed 170 Palestinians, most of them civilians. The other side: Palestinian girls mourn at their home before the funeral of their uncle, Adham Abed el-Al, who died the day before in an Israeli airstrike . Palestinians gather around the remains of a house which police said was destroyed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza City today . The violence was prompted by the murder of three Israeli teenagers and revenge killing of a Palestinian youth. Israeli officials said on Monday three people arrested over the Palestinian's death had confessed to burning him alive. Egypt and Qatar are seen as potential mediators but peace efforts were complicated by Hamas's rejection of a mere 'calm for calm' in which both sides hold their fire in favour of wider conditions including prisoner release and an end to Israel's Gaza blockade. The Israeli army said its aircraft and naval gunboats attacked dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip and that Palestinian militants fired more than 20 rockets into Israel, slightly wounding a boy in the town of Ashdod, where a home was damaged, and two girls, 11 and 13, near Beersheba. Palestinian health officials said at least 20 people in Gaza were wounded. But Israel did not carry out a threat to step up attacks against rocket-launching sites it said were hidden among civilian homes in the town of Beit Lahuiya after urging residents there to leave. A U.N. aid agency said around a quarter of the town's 70,000 residents had fled. Tel Aviv experienced a rare lull in morning rocket strikes, but they resumed during the evening rush hour, with Iron Dome going into action. Police said there were no casualties or damage. Hamas, the Islamist group which runs Gaza, said its armed wing had sent several locally-made drones to carry out 'special missions' deep inside Israel. A military spokesman said the drone was shot down near the port of Ashdod, about 25 km (15 miles) north of Gaza, by a U.S.-built Patriot missile, used largely ineffectively by Israel against Iraqi Scud missiles in the 1991 Gulf War.","Israelis go about their lives despite the ongoing fighting with Hamas .

"By . Sam Webb . Today, led by captain Philipp Lahm, the World Cup-winning German national team disembarked at Berlin's Tegel Airport, holding the trophy aloft as rapturous fans on the viewing terrace sang 'Football's Coming Home'. The scenes were a far cry from those seen in Ibiza, where Steven Gerrard, captain of England - where football actually comes from - paddled around on a gaudy pedalo in the sea with his family. The Liverpool midfielder could have been greeting a sea of red and white at Trafalgar Square today. Instead, following England's desultory exit from the World Cup in Brazil, he relaxes in the sun. Having a nice time, Steve? England football captain Steven Gerrard enjoys a jaunt on a pedalo in Ibiza . Meanwhile, in Berlin: Philipp Lahm holds up the World Cup as the German national team return . The Three Lions flew home nearly three weeks ago after meekly bowing out at the bottom of Group D. In a grim reminder of what could have been for England fans, the German team went on a parade to the Brandenburg Gate in an open-topped truck after leaving the airport. The players, in matching black T-shirts bearing the number '1', lapped up the love by playing up to the estimated 400,000 people packing the 'fan mile' in front of the landmark. Fans began arriving overnight to secure good spots to welcome home coach Joachim Loew's team and the trophy. Germany's fourth World Cup, the first since 1990, crowned years of work by Loew to modernise the team, and followed near misses at recent tournaments. 'We're all world champions!' Loew told the crowd. Scenes: Members of the German football squad wave to fans. An estimated 400,000 greeted the team . Open-topped, but not a bus: Gerrard was at the beach with his wife Alex and their three daughters . He added: 'Of course, it was a long way to the title, and an incredibly tough one in the end. But we're incredibly happy to be here with the fans now.' At a stage set up at the Gate, Mario Goetze, the scorer in the 1-0 win over Argentina in the final on Sunday, was greeted with deafening cheers by the sea of fans waving black, red and gold Germany flags. It was a stark contrast to the England team's less-than-triumphant return, where they were greeted by a handful of photographers, but no flag-waving fans, following the team's dismal early World Cup exit. National glory is starting to slip from the grasp of Gerrard, who will be 36 when the next major international tournament begins . When England landed in the UK, there were no fans to greet them .

Following her triumph, Sister Cristina punched the air and thanked God for her victory over a long haired rocker who had performed 'Stairway to Heaven'. She said: 'I want Jesus to come in here!' 'My presence here is not up to me, it's thanks to the man upstairs!' The remarkable nun has won a record contract with Universal Records but has yet to decide if she will take up a full-time pop career. She said: 'I will go back to my priorities – prayer, waking up early in the morning, school service. That's fundamental for me to be able to begin something new later on.' Unlikely winner: Sister Cristina's first performance broke YouTube records with 31million views . The 25-year-old nun has sung ppop classics including Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Time Of My Life . Cristina, who is from Sicily but lives in a convent near Milan stunned judges when she appeared on the show saying she was inspired to go on the show by Pope Francis, who has instructed nuns and priests to 'come out' of their churches and convents and spread the word of God 'to the periphery' of society. Since then the 25 year old Ursaline nun has appeared on stage singing pop classics such as Cindy Lauper’s 'Girls Just Wanna have Fun', ‘Time of My Life’ from the film Dirty Dancing, and even sang alongside Kylie Minogue during a performance of 'Can't Get You Out of My Head.' Her performance of Alicia Keys's 'No One' won the admiration of the US singer who said that she described the talented Italian as 'pure energy'. She has also received praise from Whoopi Goldberg who starred in the film 'Sister Act' as a pop singer pretending to be a nun. But critics have panned her as a novelty act rather than a serious singer. Emma Marrone, who represented Italy in this year's Eurovision song contest, moaned that the hype surrounding the nun was 'an insult to showbusiness'.","Sister Cristina secured more than 60 per cent of the vote .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Sara Nathan . Stephen Colbert is the rumored top pick to replace David Letterman as host of Late Show on CBS. Letterman announced he plans to retire in the next year or so. Colbert 'first engaged with network executives' while Letterman was still thinking about the best time to retire, Mashable reports. Sources tell the website that CBS has spoken to other candidates - including Colbert's Comedy Central colleague Jon Stewart - but that Colbert is the 'front-and-center' pick for the job. They also say Colbert has not yet had any formal contract discussions nor is there an agreement in place. Scroll down for video . Tough competition: Stephen Colbert is also said to be in the running for the coveted Late Show gig . Getting ready for the big gig? Colbert is seen shaking hands with Letterman during the May 4 2011 episode of Late Show . Frontrunner: Deadline founder Nikki Finke reported that Colbert is the only person CBS is considering to succeed Dave . Colbert's contract with Comedy Central, where he hosts The Colbert Report, runs through the end of 2014, the website notes, which would leave an opening for him to host the program. If Colbert hosts Late Show, he would give up the conservative 'Stephen Colbert' persona he uses on The Colbert Report, sources said. Last September, The Colbert Report finally put an end to The Daily Show's 10-year winning streak at the Emmys, claiming the title of outstanding variety series for the first time. Colbert recently came under fire for a satirical tweet and dedicated much of Monday's show to addressing the uproar he caused when he created a faux charity called 'The Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.' A Twitter hashtag #CancelColbert was created in response. Colbert insisted its creation was inspired by the irony of Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder's new charitable organization, 'The Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation.' 'Internet equality is more important than ever, as I learned this weekend when the interwebs tried to swallow me whole,' he explained. 'But I am proud to say that I got lodged in its throat and it hacked me back up like a hastily chewed chicken wing.' Colbert quipped: 'Who would have thought that a means of communication limited to 140 characters would ever create misunderstandings.' Other names reportedly being considered for the hosting gig include Neil Patrick Harris and Craig Ferguson, according to Mashable. E! Host Chelsea Handler has also recently been rumored to be a front-runner for the position. The brash blonde has become a household name, thanks to her E! late night show, but on Sunday she announced she was quitting the network when her deal expires at the end of the year. And the timing did not go unnoticed, when David Letterman revealed he was retiring next year. There she is! Chelsea Handler waved her arms in the air while filming Chelsea Lately in Sydney, Australia in March 2011 . Throwing insults: The E! host went on Davie's Late Night show last April - and the pair enjoyed hurling insults at each other. She's now a frontrunner to take over from him . Rumours were rife over the internet as one tweet read: 'David letterman is retiring, MY PRAYERS have been answered... They're a a slot open for you @chelseahandler' while another said: 'WAIT. Chelsea Handler. Just. Quit. E!. You don't think...' Chelsea, 39, known for her bawdy humor, counts Hollywood A listers Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Gwyneth Paltrow among her best pals - and has often had them on her show. Appearing on Letterman's show last April, Chelsea and Letterman enjoyed some banter about Dave's job. Discussing the shake-ups in late night TV, Chelsea said: 'Nobody can keep their job for very long, it seems. I mean, you're lucky to have a job over here at CBS.' 'I'm lucky to have a job, period,' Letterman replied: 'I don't care where - I'm lucky to have a job. Mowing lawns - I would be lucky to have a job mowing lawns.' Chelsea retorted: 'Well, yeah - you're a small man.' Discussing Jay Leno's departure from NBC's Tonight Show, Chelsea - who had made it no secret she was unhappy at E! - joked that Leno had left her a voicemail. The odd couple's interview ended when Chelsea called him 'dainty', and Letterman retorted: 'You're kinda hefty for a broad.' Grabbing her chest, Chelsea, clearly not insulted, replied: 'We all know what you're talking about.' Chelsea's manager  Irving Azoff, told The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday: 'Chelsea . intends to leave when her contract expires. She hired me to figure out . her life after E! We have at least seven suitors and many ideas.' 'Chelsea has nine months left on her . contract and E! will not comment on the future of Chelsea Lately at this . time,' a representative from the network said. If Chelsea were to take over, she would be the first woman to have her own network late night show since Joan Rivers, who hosted The Late Show - then on Fox - for just one year between 1986 and 1987. Bizarrely, new Tonight show host Jimmy Fallon - who could find himself going up against one of them - will have both Chelsea and Stephen on as guests on his NBC show next week. The late night host herself: The blonde comedian attended the 92nd Street Y Presents: An Evening With Chelsea Handler and Ronan Farrow in New York in March .","Colbert 'engaged' with CBS executives while Letterman was thinking about best time to retire .

"By . Sam Webb . A restaurant waiter dreamed one night of winning the Euromillions lottery - and scooped the £1million jackpot the very next day. Fatih Ozcan, who waited tables at the Kapadokya Turkish restaurant, in York, thought his financial troubles were over when he bought the winning ticket. But he ended up at the centre of a legal dispute after his boss, Hayati Kucukkoylu, claimed the prize for himself. The row led to threats and police involvement - but now a top judge has ruled the warring pair are entitled to £500,000 each. Stumped: Fatih Ozcan (left), a waiter at Turkish restaurant Kapadokya in York, . bought a winning Euromillions ticket. But he was left in a legal battle when his . boss Hayatu Kucukkoylu (right) tried to claim the winnings . Judge Mark Gosnell said Mr Ozcan ‘had a dream’ on the night of January 29 2012. 'He dreamt that he was holding a large bundle of cash and, standing in front of him, was his boss. 'Mr Ozcan is a strong believer in the power of dreams and interpreted this to mean that he and Mr Kucukkoylu would win the lottery.' The following day, Mr Ozcan 'pestered' his boss for three hours before he finally agreed to enter the Euromillions lottery, said the judge. It was the dreaming waiter who went to a nearby supermarket and bought the ticket which yielded the riches. However, once Mr Kucukkoylu, 47, heard the happy news, there were celebrations in the restaurant and he claimed to be the sole winner. He insisted that the stake money was his - having come from the restaurant’s till - and that he alone had chosen the winning numbers. But Mr Ozcan was adamant that it was his dream that prompted the win, that he had paid half the stake and that some of the number choices were his. Even split: Judge Mark Gosnell ruled that each man was entitled to half the windfall at £500,000 each . Mr Ozcan (right) dreamed of holding a large bundle of cash so persuaded his boss Hayati Kucukkoylu to enter the Euromillions draw. Despite agreeing to split the winnings, Mr Kucukkoylu claimed to be the sole winner . Fearing that Mr Kucukkoylu would cut him out of his share, the waiter phoned Camelot and the police, falsely accusing his boss of stealing the winning ticket from his pocket. Three days after he learnt of the win, Mr Kucukkoylu was arrested in his restaurant and held in police custody for around nine hours. And, when he returned from the police station, he discovered that Mr Ozcan had left his grace and favour flat without leaving a forwarding address. Mr Ozcan admitted he had lied to the police and Camelot, but said his boss had threatened him and he was ‘fearful for his safety’. That set the scene for a seven-day High Court hearing at which Mr Kucukkoylu hotly denied his former employee’s right to any part of the winnings. However, after viewing a series of increasingly angry texts between the pair and CCTV footage of events in the restaurant as the winning slips were filled in, the judge ruled that each man was entitled to half the windfall. Describing it as a ‘troubling case’, he said Mr Ozcan was ‘an admitted liar’, but he also had ‘concerns’ about the reliability of Mr Kucukkoylu’s account. Dispute: Mr Ozcan phoned police from the restaurant (pictured) falsely accusing Mr Kucukkoylu of stealing his winning ticket. His boss was arrested three days later and held in custody for around nine hours . The CCTV footage strongly suggested that both men had shared the task of choosing the winning numbers and that each had paid half of the £9 stake. Ruling Mr Ozcan’s story ‘inherently more plausible’, the judge said: 'I cannot see why he would be so determined to make his employer play if he was not directly to benefit. 'It is much more likely that he would badger his employer for hours if his dream was that they had played together and he needed his employer to play for the dream to come true. 'I prefer the evidence of Mr Ozcan on the determinative issues.' The judge added: 'I find that Mr Ozcan had a dream which involved him and Mr Kucukkoylu and a large sum of money. 'Mr Ozcan pestered his boss into playing the lottery with him... they contributed equally to the purchase price of the ticket.' Although Mr Ozcan gave his boss the lottery ticket, he kept the receipt and the pay slips. The judge said that, after Mr Ozcan challenged his boss, Mr Kucukkoylu ‘became angry and threatening and swore at him’. The restaurateur had also ‘through intermediaries attempt to persuade Mr Ozcan to drop his claim’. Judge Gosnell concluded: 'I find that the effect of these conversations was that Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan entered into a contract to jointly play the lottery on an equal basis. 'There should be a declaration that the prize money from this winning lottery ticket should be shared equally between Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan.'","Fatih Ozacan says he had fateful dream night before Euromillions draw .

"By . Sam Webb . Statement: Singer Katie Melua, pictured arriving at Warsaw Chopin airport on Friday, has spoken about her involvement in the Liberty tax avoidance scheme . Chart star Katie Melua has told how she was 'clueless and inexperienced' when she followed the advice of experts to sign up to what turned out to be an aggressive tax avoidance scheme. The 29 year-old singer was among around 1,600 people who were involved with the controversial Liberty tax strategy, but she went on to settle her tax in full with HM Revenue and Customs when it was brought to her attention. Opening up about the furore for the first time today, she admitted it 'sucks' that she has been under the spotlight for her part in it, and called for such schemes to be stopped to prevent others from being advised by experts to take part. Closest Thing To Crazy singer Melua was on a list of figures - including celebrities, doctors and judges - given to The Times after they put around £1.2 billion into the scheme from 2005 until 2009. The arrangement created a tax loss for investors which they could offset against other income. Other celebrities have not responded to the claims that they were involved, but Melua was upfront and told how she pulled out as soon as she was made aware of the nature of the scheme and then paid her full tax liability. Writing about the issue on her website today she explained: 'At 19 I was lucky enough to start making money from my music career, and when I was in my early twenties I trusted financial experts and advisors to guide me with how I invested money. 'That I was fairly clueless and inexperienced when it came to finance goes without saying and, I'm embarrassed to admit, not as interested in it as I should have been. My focus was, and still is, totally on making music, getting on the road and performing live. 'From what I can remember in 2008 when the Liberty scheme was presented to me it was not presented as ""an aggressive tax avoidance scheme"". It was presented as an ""investment scheme"" that had the potential to legally reduce yearly income tax. Totally legal and legit and my accountants and advisors would take care to complete the formalities which included dealing with HMRC. Seemed pretty straight-forward and simple, so I signed up.' Scheme: George Michael has been named as one of 1,600 people who used the tax avoidance scheme Liberty to shelter a total of £1.2bn. The scheme is legal but has been investigated for more than a decade . Katie Melua: 'My tax records are completely up to date and I don't owe HMRC any money' She went on: 'HMRC did later query it, and I paid the full amount of tax years ago. My tax records are completely up to date and I don't owe HMRC any money. 'Yeah it sucks getting this type of attention, but I commend the investigative journalism that is allowed in Britain. 'If there is ambiguity in the law then laws should be changed to disallow schemes like this, so that they would never be presented by legitimate tax experts to less experienced people like myself in the first place. British musician Gary Barlow after being made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He faces a hefty tax bill for his involvement in another scheme, Icebreaker . 'Hopefully the debate will lead to positive change for all.' Melua came in for criticism from Christian Aid when her name emerged earlier this week after it had listed her among nominees for its 'tax super hero' award four years ago. By that point the Georgian-born singer - who has adopted British citizenship - is understood to have paid her tax in full. The charity issued a statement to say it was 'disappointed' to hear she had been involved and suggested she was a 'fallen hero'. But it has now led to a backlash with many pointing out on social media platforms that as a charity, Christian Aid enjoys its own tax arrangements including Gift Aid, which has led the charity to issue a further statement to clarify its position. Melua is reported to have put £850,000 into the Liberty scheme . Involvement in 'aggressive' tax avoidance schemes has already led to criticism of other stars, including Take That's Gary Barlow. He faces a hefty tax bill for his involvement in another scheme, Icebreaker, which was styled as a music industry investment scheme, but was successfully challenged in court in May. Liberty faces a similar challenge, scheduled for next year. When details of the Icebreaker challenge emerged, Prime Minister David Cameron said the scheme 'wrong' and that 'it is right that they are going to have to pay back the money'.","Singer says she trusted her advisors from when she first achieved success .

Zach Selby, 19, and Chloe Tones, 16, planned a romantic camping trip to celebrate the first day of their relationship together on Sunday. But the young lovers' first kiss ended up being the kiss of life after Zach collapsed suddenly at the campsite in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, Lincolnshire. The teenager, who has no first-aid training, leapt into action to perform life-saving CPR while her new boyfriend lay on the ground unconscious. Scroll down for video . Love life: Zach Selby and his girlfriend Chloe Tones, who performed CPR to keep him alive when he stopped breathing . Ambulance staff instructed Chloe over the phone as she also performed mouth-to mouth resuscitation attempts for 40 minutes while paramedics rushed to the scene. Zach, an apprentice hairdresser, was taken to Grantham Hospital where doctors revived him and told his new girlfriend had saved his life. He was discharged 48 hours later and is now back at home recovering in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Today the couple say their blossoming relationship is now stronger than ever and they have a special bond as a result of their ordeal. Zach was rushed to Grantham Hospital, where doctors told him his beau had rescued him from the brink . Zach said: 'If it wasn't for my girlfriend I wouldn't be here right now and would never have seen my family again. I will never forget it. I can't believe how close I came to dying. 'She was amazing, she saved my life on our very first day as a couple - I don't know how I will ever pay her back. It really makes you appreciate things, especially us. 'She's saved my life so I can spend it with her.' The drama began after the pair went camping with friends just hours after they began their relationship. After enjoying a few drinks together Zach went for a walk alone where he suffered a horrific pain in his chest and fell to the floor at around 3.15am. The drama began after the pair went camping with friends just hours after they began their relationship . The couple re-enact that fateful day on the beach that forged their bond . Realising Zach had been gone a while, she and their friends went in search of him. Luckily, she spotted the light on his mobile phone, and found him lying on the floor. Chloe said: 'I noticed this flashing light in the ground and then realised it was his phone. 'That made me worried and I looked around and realised there was the outline of a body next to it. 'He was floppy. I tried to get him up and shook him but there was nothing. I looked closer and it was Zach, lying face down in the grass. 'I picked him up and he woke up again so I sat him on a bench and he told me about the sharp pains in his chest. But then he just collapsed, he wasn't breathing either.' As there was nobody around to help the teenagers they dialled 999 and spoke to an operator in the ambulance control room. Selfie: The couple take a picture in the hospital. Zach still had pads monitoring his heart . Chloe added: 'I told him he'd stop breathing and I had to check his pulse, and it was really fast. 'He told me to do CPR, which I have never done before. He had to talk me through doing everything. 'This was for 40 minutes until the ambulance got there - he kept waking up and gagging again. When I was giving his mouth to mouth his eyes were open. 'He was just staring up at me from lifeless eyes, it was terrifying. I can't believe that was our first kiss. 'I just thought to myself, if I stop he's not going to be able to live. I knew I had to keep going. It was awful.' With the ambulance nowhere to be seen, the control room operator told Chloe to send a friend to a nearby public access defibrillator, giving out a code to open up the casing. Following the instructions given by the machine, she placed the pads on Zach's chest, continuing CPR when instructed. Grantham Hospital, 40 minutes away from the beach where Zach first became stricken . Paramedics finally arrived and raced Zach to Grantham Hospital over 40 miles away from the campsite. Zach's brother and sister, who both work at the hospital, were soon by his side once his sister, a nurse, saw his name in a record book. Chloe stayed at Zach's side by his hospital bed throughout the terrifying ordeal. She added: 'It's had a big impact on us, we've got a really strong bond now because I saved his life. I can never forget that night, and it just brought us so close together.' Chloe's proud mum Claire Tones, 38, added: 'She's amazing. I'm the proudest mum on the planet. I'm very, very pleased that it didn't come to the worse and Zach is still here.' Doctors still don't know what caused Zach's collapse. As he was adopted age three and knows nothing about his biological parents and whether there are hereditary condition is responsible. To monitor his heart, Zach will shortly have a disc attached to the organ which will collect data over two years and help doctors figure out the mystery illness. A spokesperson for the East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'This is a great example of how members of the public can help save a life by learning first aid skills. 'We are pleased we were able to play a key role in giving him the best possible chance of surviving his heart attack.'","Zach Selby, 19, collapsed on a beach after he took a walk on camping trip .

"By . Sam Webb . The polar bear which mauled a 17-year-old schoolboy to death was elderly and had been suffering from painful worn-down teeth which made it behave 'aggressively and unpredictably', an inquest has heard. Horatio Chapple, 17, was on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands, north of Norway, in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) when he died. The Eton pupil from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage, inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body. Horatio Chapple, 17, was mauled to death by a polar bear on a trip to the Arctic Circle in August 2011. Right, the corpse of the polar bear, which behaved unusually and aggressively because it had severe tooth pain . Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site, where the group, known as Chanzin Fire, had been staying. Also injured during the incident were trip leader Michael 'Spike' Reid, from Plymouth, Devon, Andrew Ruck, from Brighton, Patrick Flinders, from Jersey, and Scott Bennell-Smith, from St Mellion in Cornwall. Assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon Ian Singleton said that a post-mortem examination of the bear’s mouth found that it suffered from worn-down teeth, a cavity in one, swollen and red gums and peritonitis in several teeth. The inquest into Horatio's death heard how the polar bear, pictured after it was shot dead, attacked the camp . The camp site where Horatio Chapple was mauled to death. Witness Matthew Burke said: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio' He said that the report stated that the pain suffered by the bear would have influenced its behaviour. Mr Singleton said: '(The bear) had badly aligned teeth causing them to wear down more than normal. It’s probable it affected the bear’s ability to gain food and if the bear is in pain it would have increased levels of stress causing it to behave more aggressively and unpredictably than it would otherwise.' Mr Singleton said that an examination of the teeth showed that the bear was estimated to be 24 years-old. He continued: 'The teeth suggest the bear is very old, more than 20 years based on the appearance of the teeth. The fatality rate for bears in Svalbard is high after 15 years, and very high after 20 years, it’s rare for a polar bear to reach 25 years.' An independent report produced by High Court judge Sir David Steel on behalf of BSES also said the bear was seriously underweight at about 250kg rather than the typical 400kg and the maximum age of a polar bear was normally 25. Expedition leader Michael Reid, 31, left, yesterday told of how he fought the polar bear that killed Horatio Chapple, 17, right . Lieutenant General Peter Pearson, from Earlswood, Chepstow, Monmouthshire, who is executive director of BSES, said the organisation had adopted all of the recommendations made by Sir David in his report. He explained that the specific recommendations relating to polar bears were not implemented because BSES have not returned to areas where polar bears lived since the incident three years ago. In his conclusion, Sir David criticised the reliance on a tripwire system to alert the group to the presence of polar bears and said that a bear watch should be used instead and also called for an overhaul of rifle training. Sir David concluded: 'In future a bear watch must become the norm for expeditions to Svalbard. The Etonian was described as 'a fine young gentleman with amazing potential' 'There needs to be complete review of available tripwire systems but they should be treated only as a secondary protection device. There needs to be a rigorous upgrade of rifle training.' Mr Pearson defended the two leaders of the expedition, Mr Ruck and Mr Reid, and said: 'These two leaders were perfectly competent, if we were to select them today we still would.' He said he was not aware at the time that there were parts of the tripwire system missing. He added that he had accepted the equipment, which was modified by the expedition group with paperclips, was unsatisfactory and explained that the BSES was working with a company to build a new system which was being trialled in Greenland. Lizanne Gumbel QC, representing the Chapple family, criticised the system, saying it was designed to protect chickens from foxes and asked Mr Pearson: 'When safety equipment is modified, it needs to be tried and tested by the manufacturer, not by children of 16 who had their physics GCSE?' Mr Pearson said the tripwire did not fire because the bear hit a post rather than the wire, and added: 'However much equipment we had around that camp, if the bear had hit a post it would not have gone bang. 'We have accepted what Sir David Steel said is the way we should go and we have actively sought to develop another system which will be more effective but I can never guarantee any system. 'In principle, we have accepted in the future it will be safer if there is a wire and a bear watch. This is not a fly-by-night organisation, we tasked a High Court judge to carry out an independent inquiry ... we are absolutely an open book.' Saying that the rifle training will be improved, Mr Pearson, who was formerly commandant of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, said: 'What we are putting in place is more training which may reflect better the situation they may find themselves in by getting people tired, by getting their heart rate moving faster and providing distraction and getting them to fire the appropriate distance. 'But it's going to be down to the individual and how they respond to stress and some are better than others.' He said that Mr Reid, who had difficulty firing a rifle at the bear before finally being able to shoot it dead, had a background in using firearms and he would have chosen him to handle the rifle. He added: 'On the occasion he didn't get it right but he did have the absolute courage after he had been badly injured to come back, find a round and shoot the bear.' Edward Watson, chairman of the British Exploring Society (BES) which the BSES is now known as, said: 'It's important, not just for us nor just the exploring community but also for the family, that we find out what we could about the expedition and the events surrounding Horatio's death and thus we commissioned the inquiry and I felt it was very important we found somebody to do that who we could rely upon to be dispassionate. 'We had already, in fact, been undertaking a review of our whole operations beforehand and this formed part of our strategic review and with that we carried out the recommendations that Sir David Steel laid out in his inquiry. 'As far as I am aware, everything has been implemented.' Describing the aims of BES, he said: 'It's about developing the character of young people and it does this primarily by taking them on expeditions to remote locations. 'These expeditions are intentionally challenging and all of them have a scientific purpose. 'Furthermore, I should add we do a lot of work helping very disadvantaged people in society to improve their lot.' He added: 'I would like to add that, both personally and from a society perspective, there is a genuine feeling of sympathy to the family. I really wish the family not to forget that we mean it sincerely.' The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow when the coroner is due to give his determination.","The elderly bear attacked Horatio Chapple, 17, as he slept in tent .

This week marks the end of the academic year in many parts of the country – and parents are already eyeing the clock as a summer exodus begins. Holiday carrier Thomson Airways is expecting a busy few days, and is expecting to fly more than 70,000 passengers off on summer breaks this weekend. Let's get out of here: British travellers will be heading for Europe's beaches this weekend . Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have revealed that they are due to take one million people away on trips this summer. It seems that British travellers will be keeping to familiar destinations in the next few weeks. The Spanish island of Mallorca, Dalaman in Turkey, and the beaches of the Riviera Maya in Mexico are among the most popular destinations this summer – while bookings to Jamaica and Mauritius have also been going well. Forever popular: The beaches of Mallorca are set to be packed with British tourists again this summer . Over the coming weeks, Thomson Airways will make more than 6,200 round trips to summer holiday destinations, while Thomson's four cruise ships will take 50,000 passengers to 128 ports of call. While passengers will be hoping to avoid summer chaos at the airport, there may be delays for those expecting to travel within the UK. The West Coast Main Line – the key rail route between London and Scotland – will be the subject of closures, with sections of the track due to be fenced off for three separate periods in August while maintenance work is conducted at Watford in Hertfordshire. The closures, which will have a significant impact on travellers, including those on London Midland services, will come into effect on 9-11 August, 16-18 August and 23-26 August. Those last three days stretch across the August bank holiday weekend. Tempted by Turkey: Resorts around Marmaris - including Icmeler - are also on British radars this summer . Work will also be ongoing on at the London terminal London Bridge. Between Saturday 23 August and Sunday 31 August, part of the station will be closed – and First Capital Connect and Southern services will not stop there, although Southeastern services will be able to call as normal. This will also affect Southern services to and from Victoria station in London, including the Gatwick Express, and some other Southern routes. Engineering work means that there will be no Heathrow Express services on Saturday 23 August.","Spain and Turkey are set to be big summer destinations for British families .

"By . Sam Webb . A boy was left almost completely blind for the first five years of his life after bungling NHS staff failed to notice there was anything wrong with him - despite the fact he couldn’t see his bottle as a baby. Billy Wells, now 12, suffered from a deteriorating eye-condition that 'robbed him of his childhood' after it went undiagnosed for five years. Health workers that visited concerned parents Tracy, 43, and Charlie, 44, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, were too busy to properly diagnose the youngster and repeatedly told them to 'stop being silly'. Clear victory: Billy Wells, 12, and his father Charlie Wells. The boy has received a payout after he was left almost blind by NHS staff who failed to diagnose his eye condition . Billy (right) with his brother Danny at Disneyland Paris in 2007. Billy didn't look at the camera in any of the 200 pictures. He simply didn't know where it was . This was despite Billy seemingly being unable to see his milk bottle right next to him and as he grew older needed to sit one inch away from the TV to see it. He would also sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around and barely moved when left alone. But alarm bells really started to ring for the couple when they returned from a trip to Disneyland Paris in 2005 and looked at their holiday pictures . They noticed that despite posing for over 200 photos - Billy hadn’t looked at the camera in any of them. They then took him to an optician who diagnosed Billy with a deteriorating sight condition called hypermetropica amblyopia which had left him barely able to see. Billy would sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around. He barely moved when left alone because of his poor vision . After being fixed with a pair of life-changing glasses which considerably improved his vision Billy is thriving seven years on. Now Charlie and Tracy have been handed an undisclosed payout from Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust after they admitted liability for a 'breach of duty'. The money will fund future occupational therapy, optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for Billy. Billy and his father in 2004. Billie used to cry for a bottle when it was in front of him when he was very young . Today Mr Wells, a full-time carer for his son, told how they brought bigger and bigger TVs in an attempt to stop his son sitting so close to the screen. He said: 'The health worker came to see him, she was rushed off her feet, she was trying to do the job of 55 people. 'So she missed it, she didn’t have time to properly look at Billy. We were always told there was nothing wrong, or we were being silly. 'I met her five years later and that report she wrote about him was still in the bottom of her briefcase, she just had been so rushed it got forgotten. 'It wasn’t until after we returned from a family holiday to Disneyland and we looked through our photographs, that we noticed that Billy wasn’t looking at the camera in any of the photos. 'When we asked him why he didn’t turn to look at the camera he said that he simply didn’t see where it was. 'He was sitting barely an inch from the screen of the TV, there was no way he could see anything. 'We were gradually buying bigger and bigger TVs to try and get him to sit further back, to the point we still have a 55 inch one. 'This all set alarms bells ringing and we immediately took him to the opticians for an examination. 'When we spoke to the optician about his results, the tests revealed his sight was very poor to the point where he could barely see anything at all. 'We were devastated and could not believe he had gone through so many years of his young life not being able to see properly. We just trusted the health workers like you do. 'When the optician put on that metal pair of glasses they do that they change the lenses in and he got to the point Billy could see, he refused to take them off. 'We had to wait for two hours while they made up our prescription with Billy wearing those glasses as he was so amazed. 'When we left he saw a pigeon for the first time, and he didn’t know what it was. He told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. 'I realised then he had never seen anything, I had to tell him what a leaf was.' His father said: '(After visiting the optician) he saw a pigeon for the first time, and he didn¿t know what it was. He told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen' He added: 'Despite his delay at the start he is now top of his class, he loves reading and doing many things normal boys do. 'I am just so sad he lost those first few years of his life for no reason. I want people to know that the NHS should treat all children with respect. 'I asked Billy why he never told me about his sight, and he just said he thought that’s how they were meant to be. 'The payout will help with paying for the glasses and physiotherapy but really this is about the fact that we were right all along about our son. 'However, we hope improvements are made in training and resource to help medical staff recognise the symptoms of hypermetropica amblyopia and refer other patients for the appropriate tests and treatment.' Fun: Billy can now play video games on the sofa with his brothers. Right, Billy his brother Danny at his cousin's wedding in Surrey in August 2013 . Thanks to his glasses Billy can now read, write and spend his free time playing his favourite game Skyrim on his Xbox. He said: 'I can play my favourite games on my Xbox now. 'The glasses have changed my life completely, I didn’t understand what seeing was, I just thought it was how it was meant to be. 'Now I love playing Skyrim and I can do that from the sofa with my brothers.' Jenna Harris, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who represented the family, said: 'Billy’s family has been left devastated because his early childhood was severely hampered by the delay to diagnose and treat him, despite the family raising their concerns repeatedly with health professionals. 'Billy requires a lot of intensive treatment to help assist his development. The settlement will provide Billy with vital funding to assist with his treatment and provide future financial support. 'We hope that lessons are learned by the Trust from Billy’s case and that all staff are adequately trained to ensure that children are given the appropriate tests to identify and treat health issues as quickly as possible.' The money will fund future occupational therapy, optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for Billy .","Billy Wells, 12, had serious undiagnosed condition for five years .

"By . Sam Webb . Gemma Simpson, who has not seen since 2000. A 44-year-old was detained on Tuesday night in connection with the disappearance of the 23-year-old . A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman who went missing more than 14 years ago. Gemma Simpson, 23, from Leeds, disappeared in May 2000. She told a friend she was catching a bus from the Harehills area of Leeds to the city centre but vanished. West Yorkshire Police have confirmed a man has been arrested in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and a property is being searched in the seaside town. Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Taylor, from West Yorkshire Police protective services (crime), said: 'A 44-year-old man was arrested in Scarborough last night on suspicion of the murder of Gemma Simpson, who went missing in Leeds in May 2000. 'An address in Scarborough is currently being examined as part of the investigation and the man remains in custody while our inquiries continue. 'We have notified Gemma’s family and will be keeping them informed of any developments.' It is understood that no body has been found at this stage. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post last year, Miss Simpson’s mother Linda Umpleby said: 'It’s unbearable. No mother should have to go through this. 'The frustration is so overwhelming you could scream.' She said: 'I have had to live with this for 13 years and it cracks you up. I feel like she’s there by my side all the time.' Police investigating the disappearance have gone as far as Amsterdam after reports that Gemma may have travelled to the Dutch city. Linda Umpleby, who described not knowing her daughter's fate as 'unbearable' Her face has also featured on cartons of milk and even emblazoned on the side of a fleet of lorries in an effort to generate leads. In a fresh appeal in October Superintendent Martin Snowden told Radio Aire: 'We have made a number of appeals over the years since Gemma’s disappearance but have never been able to confirm any further sightings of her since she was seen by a friend in Harehills on 5 May, 2000. 'She told the friend she was going to stay with another friend in Huddersfield but was not seen again.'

"By . Mark Prigg . It is already locked in a battle with New York's iconic yellow cabs, but now Uber has declared war on them by cutting its prices. The firm boasted today it will undercut cab journeys in the Big Apple. The move discounts prices by 20 percent, and follows similar price cuts in a slew of other cities including San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta. Scroll down for video . Uber came under fire in December when huge snowstorms left people stranded across the Northeast - and Uber charged up to eight times its normal fare. Customers can see the  driver’s name and photo before they arrive and receive an email of their route to ensure they have not gone around the houses. Uber takes a cut, usually 11 to 20 per cent, of the fares, which are taken from customers’ credit cards at the end of the journey — when they can also rate their trip. Journey costs increase during busy periods, but customers are not encouraged to tip because the gratuity is factored into the metered fare. Uber, which recently raised $1.2 billion in new funding, stressed the new pricing would only be available for a limited time - but hinted they could stay. But 'the more you ride,' the company claimed in a blog post, 'the more likely we can keep them this low!' Uber has expanded around the world at an astonishing rate, taking on cab firms in major cities around the globe. Described as 'one of the most rapidly growing companies ever,' earlier this month it was valued at $18.2bn, one of the highest valuations ever for a Silicon Valley startup. The firm, which relies on an app and software to match riders and drivers, was started in 2010 - and now operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. The firm has raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors in a funding round valuing the fast-growing rides-on-demand service at $18.2 billion. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick announced the funding round on Uber's blog Friday. The funding, eclipsed only by the likes of Facebook Inc before it went public, is a vote of confidence by investors in four-year-old Uber's growth potential. 'Uber is one of the most rapidly growing companies ever, and we believe there are opportunities for continued tremendous growth,' Joan Miller, a spokeswoman for Summit Partners, an investor in the funding round, said by telephone. Investors hope the company, which allows users to summon a ride on their smartphones, can expand globally and diversify into logistics. Uber says its new pricing will undercut yellow taxis across New York, showing these examples . The investors in the round valued Uber 'pre-money' at $17 billion, the blog post said. The $1.2 billion infusion took the startup's valuation to $18.2 billion. Fidelity Investments put in about $425 million, Wellington Management added $209 million and BlackRock Inc contributed $175 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Venture firms Summit Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures and Menlo Ventures also participated in the round, a person familiar with the matter said. Kleiner's investment came from its Digital Growth Fund, run by former stock analyst Mary Meeker, known for her bullish recommendations during the first dot-com boom. While Uber has grown rapidly since its 2010 launch in San Francisco, it has run into serious regulatory issues. Ordinances keep it out of cities such as Las Vegas, Miami and Vancouver, British Canada. In some places, including Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Uber and similar companies face lawsuits from taxi companies hoping to keep the new competition out. In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper signed a bill on Thursday that legalized drive-for-hire services in consumers' own vehicles, including UberX. In California, ridesharing is currently regulated through the state's Public Utilities Commission, although taxi drivers and Uber itself are challenging that authority. Her fund has had recent hits, including traffic app Waze, acquired last year for $1.1 billion by Google. Uber, which did not give details about its latest investors, operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. Kalanick said he expected to close a second round of funding from strategic investors of about $200 million. Uber originally started with a luxury town-car service, but in many cities has since added UberX, a low-frills service with nonprofessional drivers using personal cars. Competitors to Uber include Flywheel and Hailo, which connect passengers and taxis; and Lyft and Sidecar, which link passengers and drivers who use their personal vehicles. Uber sometimes offers promotional deliveries, such as roses around Valentine's Day or Christmas trees. Earlier this year, it launched a regular courier delivery service for small packages in Manhattan.","Move discounts prices by 20 percent .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . British travellers have to pay the highest airline taxes in the world - forking out up to 25 times as much as the French, according to new. Just a handful of countries impose a tax like the UK's Air Passenger Duty (APD) and those that do only charge a fraction of what British holidaymakers are forced to pay. UK holidaymakers pay between £13 and £91 each, per flight, depending on the route, but other European countries pay as little as 90p per flight. Rip-off: Families can pay up to £91 each, per flight, for long haul journeys, or £13 for short haul trips . Campaign group A Fair Tax on Flying looked at five European countries that levy a comparable tax - Britain, Austria, Italy, France and Germany. The UK has three levels of APD, £13.00 a person for short haul flights, like those to most European countries, £69 a head mid-haul, which includes Dubai and Israel and £91 each for those going long haul. Even the most expensive, Germany, starts with £5.99 for short haul, up to £18.70 for mid haul and just £33.66 for long haul. AUSTRIA: Short haul £5.59 - mid haul £11.97 - long haul - £27.93 . FRANCE: Short haul £0.90 - mid haul £3.60 - long haul £3.60 . GERMANY: Short haul £5.99 - mid haul £18.70 - long haul - £33.66 . ITALY: Short haul £5.99 - mid haul £5.99 - long haul £5.99 . UK: Short haul £13.00 - mid haul £69.00 - long haul £91.00 . Note: All amounts refer to economy tickets. Exchange rate used was £1 = 1.253 euro . But in contrast Italy, for instance, just charges £5.99 tax on all flights, no matter where they go. The travel industry and economic groups want the government to lower or abolish the rates to make it fairer for travellers. They calculate that abolishing the tax completely would increase the numbers flying by so much that the exchequer would not lose out anyway. Darren Caplan, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: 'These figures illustrate starkly the extent to which passengers from UK airports are paying a premium compared with people flying from other airports across Europe. Money-spinner: The UK pays the highest airline tax in the world and up to 25 times more than our French counterparts . 'It's impossible not to conclude that APD makes the UK less competitive. 'This is adversely impacting our connectivity, making it harder for businesses to access overseas markets, and damaging our all-important tourism sector.' And Mark Tanzer, CEO of travel agent organisation ABTA, said: 'There is still a huge disparity in the levels of air tax UK passengers are paying compared with our European neighbours.' A spokesman for A Fair Tax on Flying said: 'We believe APD is making UK goods and services more expensive, discouraging inbound tourists and investment and making the family holiday abroad - and visiting friends and relatives - less affordable.'","Britons pay £13 tax for short haul flights and £91 for long haul .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Hundreds of lives could be saved each year after British scientists worked out how to stop a potentially deadly outbreak of MRSA. They have managed to crack the superbug's genetic code, enabling them to identify and destroy the source of the infection, stopping it in its tracks. It led to them finding one member of staff at Rosie Hospital, in Cambridge, who may have unwittingly carried and spread the infection. This is the first time such testing has been used to identify and halt an outbreak. One expert said this would soon become 'standard practice' in hospitals. Scientists in Cambridge used the technology to identify a member of staff who may have been unwittingly carrying and spreading the infection . MRSA . (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is an antibiotic resistant . form of a common skin bug that can cause potentially deadly wound . infections in hospitals. There were around 1,000 deaths from MRSA and 4,000 deaths from C.diff each year in the mid-2000s. Rates rose significantly in the 1990s from just 100 a year to a peak of 7,700 in 2003 to 2004. Following the launch of the Clean Your Hands campaign in hospitals, rates fell steadily but more than 1,000 people still developed the infection in 2011-12. In an early test of the new technology, . researchers halted an outbreak of the MRSA superbug in a special care . baby unit at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge. By . quickly identifying the bacterial strains from their genetic codes, or . genomes, experts were able to target the transmission path of the . infection and cut it off. A report on how the baby unit . outbreak was brought under control appears in the latest issue of the . journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The . scientists used a technique called rapid whole genome sequencing, which . maps an organism’s entire genetic code, to analyse MRSA bacteria taken . from 12 babies. Standard . procedures had not been able to show whether a genuine outbreak had . occurred, or whether the babies had all coincidentally been exposed to . MRSA. The team was quickly . able to confirm that 10 babies were part of an MRSA outbreak involving a . previously unknown strain of the bug. It . also became clear from swab tests of parents and visitors that the . bacteria had spread outside the hospital into the community. Measures . were introduced to clear MRSA from carriers and deep-clean wards, but . two months later a new infection case was identified in the baby unit. In an early test of the technology, researchers halted an outbreak of the MRSA superbug in a special care baby unit at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge . DNA . sequencing showed it was caused by the same strain identified earlier, . carried to the ward by one of 154 screened health care workers. Co-author . Dr Julian Parkhill, head of pathogen genomics at the Wellcome Trust . Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, said: 'The staff member was . decolonised and went back to work, and we believe this brought the . outbreak to a close.' The scientists are now developing the . concept into a simple system that can be used routinely by hospital . staff who are not genetics experts. In future, it could be used to combat . many kinds of infection outbreak, and also help doctors decide the best . way of treating patients. The bug-busting 'black box' is being developed that can rapidly identify the source of hospital infections and help staff to stop them spreading. The device, which combines sophisticated DNA profiling and database analysis, could be available within 'a few years', say scientists. Professor Sharon Peacock, from Cambridge University, who led the research team, told a news briefing in London: 'What we’re working towards is effectively a ‘black box’. 'Information on the genome sequence goes into the system and is interpreted, and what comes out the other end is a report to the health care worker. 'It could, for example, determine the species of the bacterium; it could determine antibiotic susceptibility, and it could provide information about what genes are present that are often associated with poor outcomes in patients. 'It will give information about how related that organism is to other organisms within the same setting, giving an indication of the capability of transmission from one patient to another.' Dr Parkhill added that he expected the cost of whole genome sequencing of bacteria to fall from around £100 per sample to £50, and ultimately just 'a few pounds' in the near future. The MRSA outbreak at the Rosie Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, was estimated to have cost the NHS around £10,000. This was double the cost of the DNA sequencing, said the researchers. Dr Nick Brown, consultant microbiologist at the Health Protection Agency and infection control doctor at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, said: 'What we have glimpsed through this pioneering study is a future in which new sequencing methods will help us to identify, manage and stop hospital outbreaks and deliver even better patient care.' A Health Protection Agency report in May said more than six per cent of hospital patients in England acquired some form of infection during their stay.","Cambridge scientists used the .

Hitting the right notes: Two decades after hitting the street, busker Si Cranstoun has scooped a multi-million pound record deal with Warner music . But success evaded him until April last year when he finally landed a breakthrough deal with music giants Warner. Si is due to release his debut album this summer after being backed by Radio 2 DJ Terry Wogan and he looks set for success after his debut single 'Caught in the Moonlight' was shortlisted on the Radio 2 playlist last month. Si, from Caterham, Sussex, said: 'There were stages where I felt like it wasn't going to happen but in my heart I thought this is the path I wanted to go down. 'That mentality just got me through the day. Now I'm just thanking my lucky stars. When I was played on the radio my family came over and my parents were in tears. They are so proud.

"By . Claire Bates . A young woman is hoping surgeons can save her sight after her left eyeball 'exploded'. It's the second time Liz Hodgkinson has suffered a split cornea, which caused her optical fluid to dribble out of her eye. The first time was during a driving lesson two years ago. Liz, 28, said: 'I knew I had a condition called keratoconus (a bulging of the cornea) because my mother had it and my brother has it. 'But what I had, where the cornea split, is called hydrops. My case was so extreme that it has been written about in a medical journal.' Liz is currently resting her eye ahead of surgery that doctors hope will stop her eye from splitting open again . Beneath the bandage, Liz's left eye is resting ahead of a procedure where a sample of human cornea will be implanted in the hope it will prevent the thin tissue from breaking open and blinding her. Speaking from her parents' home in Mold, North Wales, Liz, a barmaid and artist, said: 'It first happened when I was on a driving lesson in 2010. I felt a very sharp pain in my eye. 'I wasn't sure if something had got in like a piece of grit, or if it was a very severe allergic reaction. 'Fluid started running down my face. I thought it was my eyes watering, but it turned out it was the optical fluid in the eyeball. I couldn't lift my eyelid. It was impossible.' A healthy eye and one with keratoconus . Fortunately, the driving instructor took over the controls, bringing her safely home and she was rushed to the doctor by her parents. Liz said: 'I had no idea what it was at all. We were told to go immediately to A&E. The pain was dreadful. 'I was given anaesthetic eye drops, but there wasn't a great deal the staff could do for me. 'The consultant decided to apply an optical bandage, which wrapped around a lot of my eyeball to protect it and to stop any more fluid weeping out, as my eyeball was basically deflating.' Under the pressure of the escaping liquid, Liz's iris had actually moved to block the gap and was bulging out of the front of her eye. There were fears her optic nerve would be dangerously exposed. She was put on Diamox, a drug used by high-altitude mountain climbers to prevent pulmonary oedemas, to equalise the pressure in her eyeball. Her case was deemed so severe it was discussed in a conference of optical specialists at the now-relocated H. M. Stanley eye hospital. Liz, who now lives in Ruthin, said: . 'If the optical nerve had contacted anything at the back of my eye, it . would've been game over. 'But, . fortunately the drugs and bandage started to work. There was a lot of . scarring on the eye, but I was able to get on with my life. Then, two . years later, it happened again.' She went to bed on Halloween night . with an itchy eye socket. Although the sensation was driving her crazy, . she thought it was just a bit drier than usual. Around 30,000 people in the UK suffer from keratoconus, . where the cornea becomes stretched and thin near its centre. The . thinned part of the cornea bulges, distorting eyesight. Around 500 . people a year undergo a corneal transplant due to the condition. Hydrops is a rare complication of keratoconus, . affecting around 2 per cent of people. A split in the cornea causes . fluid to escape, creating mistiness or temporary loss of sight in the . eye. The eye eventually . recovers with the help of steroid drops but this can take many months. A . scar is left behind, which can affect sight if it is over the eye's . centre. Instead, . the following day she suffered a short sharp pain, violently flashing . blue lights and, once again, the fluid started flowing. She said: 'I thought 'no, this can't be happening again'. The light was unbearable, it was like a welding torch. 'My mother took me to hospital - to Glan Clwyd as H. M. Stanley, in St Asaph, has since closed down - and we were sent on to Abergele. 'It was the same process - the drops, the bandage. I was told there and then that it looked like it would have to be a transplant, as it would happen over and over until I eventually lost my sight. 'I knew I couldn't go through life with this happening every so often, and this was a particularly nasty case.' An example of hydrops, when a split on the cornea causes the optical fluid to escape . Now, with a provisional date for the operation in two weeks' time, Liz is grimly practical about the procedure. She said: 'It will be a general anaesthetic job, pretty full on. I don't think I've got any strong feelings - it's a case of this thing is happening, and I've got to get my head round it.' Liz, with her limited vision and tired from a combination of pain and medication, she is currently unable to paint or work. But she has a positive example in her mother Sue, who successfully underwent the operation a few years ago. Sue, 63, of Mold, said: 'I was diagnosed with keratoconus from 18, and I recently had the corneal transplant. 'It worked for me - although it doesn't work for everybody because your body can reject the implant. I wear contact lenses but now I can manage without. It's been a success and, unless I do reject it, it's there for good. And it hopefully will work for Liz too.'

"By . Mark Duell . A 31-year-old civil servant almost died after being bitten by a normally-harmless house spider while in bed at her home in Britain. Natalie Hemme, of Wallington, Surrey, suffered horrendous swelling to her arm that blocked the blood flow and turned her limb septic. The astonishing bite resulted in her developing Compartment Syndrome, a condition which saw muscle and flesh on her arm begin to die. Horrific pain: Mrs Hemme visited an NHS clinic and was told her injuries appeared to be a house spider (file picture) bite. She was then prescribed antibiotics . ‘It was agony,’ Mrs Hemme, who has since recovered, told the Sun. ‘I was lucky to survive. You’d expect it in Australia - but not in Surrey.’ There was a possibility that her arm could have been amputated after it turned life-threateningly septic - but it was saved after five operations. Trouble began in February, when she woke up to see a red bite on her left wrist, before her arm began to swell and throb over the next two days. Mrs Hemme visited an NHS clinic and was told it appeared to be a spider bite. She was prescribed antibiotics and told to take paracetamol. But things got worse over the next two . days and her husband Michael, 35, called 999 after she started throwing . up green pus and couldn't stand up. Location: Mrs Hemme suffered the bite, which caused horrendous swelling to her arm, in bed at her home in Wallington, Surrey (file picture of area) Her muscles and nerves were dying. Surgeons spent three days removing infected tissue before they used . flesh from her thigh to rebuild the arm. 'I know I have been very lucky to survive and keep my arm. I can’t believe all this happened over a spider bite' Natalie Hemme, 31 . She spent three weeks in hospital but is now back at work now after physiotherapy, although her arm still bears the scars of what happened, reported the Sun. Experts told the newspaper that house spiders have fangs big enough to penetrate human skin - but are not known to attack people. Mrs Hemme told the Sun: ‘I know I have been very lucky to survive and keep my arm. I can’t believe all this happened over a spider bite. ‘I now sleep with my window shut and check the bed before getting in.’ Compartment syndrome can be caused by severe . swelling that arises from an injury, such as a limb being crushed. But . it can also be caused by a venomous snake or insect bite, surgery or a . severe bone fracture. Medical literature suggests being bitten by a spider is a more unusual way to develop the condition, thought to affect around 2,000 adults in the UK each year. Muscles in areas such as the lower . leg and forearm are separated into compartments by strong bands of tissues. Compartment syndrome causes painful swelling and increased pressure within one of these compartments. The tough, inflexible nature of these tissues means they cannot stretch to accommodate swelling, to the point that blood cannot supply the muscles and nerves with oxygen and nutrients. If the syndrome is left untreated, the muscles and nerves fail and may eventually die. Symptoms may include: numbness, pain and/or pale skin in the affected region; severe pain upon moving the affected limb; gaining no relief from painkillers; tight, swollen, and shiny-looking skin over the affected area. The treatment for acute compartment syndrome is surgery. This involves freeing up the bands of tissue (rather like splitting open the casing of the sausage), relieving pressure on the muscles and nerves.","Natalie Hemme .

A Spanish designer who has become known for his melancholy style presents his latest collection of feminine and edgy separates on models with what appear to be rather badly bruised knees. Manuel Bolaño, born in Barcelona but raised in Galicia, a sensitive, self-confessed introvert, called his latest offering The Boy With Sad Eyes. His collection of bug-embossed netting, clashing textures and gothic lace-up boots was shown shown on the fourth day of the 080 Barcelona Fashion 2014 yesterday. A model presents a satin drop waist dress with painful-looking knees as a quirky outfit of clashing textures is offset by a bashed-up beauty look . Influences appeared to be romantic, retro, sports and Gothic.

The . models' bashed-up beauty look, according to Bolaño's sombre description . of the range, may represent a metaphor for a bruised feelings and a . broken heart. The . designer, who's worked in fashion for more than a decade, describes his . latest collection and cryptic though it may be, it does offer some explanation for his seemingly 'wounded' models. 'Let's talk about the first kiss, hidden . from the world, in a corner. Tell me what you think of my life, of my . adolescence. In a corner I treat my wounds, and my tears will be lost in . the rain.

Called Pints In The Sun, the smartphone and desktop application uses 3D building data to figure out structure forms and factor in where the sun will be at certain times of the day. London-based digital agency POKE recently developed the nifty web tool that allows you to easily find a nearby pub that won't be in the shade without trawling the streets. The new app aims to ensure Britons can always enjoy a cold pint in a sunny beer garden this summer .

"By . Bianca London . When she was at the helm of Jimmy Choo, Tamara Mellon proved she knew exactly what women wanted and her creations became a hit with . A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana. After leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes. As she launches her e-commerce site, Tamara has called on supermodel Karlie Kloss to showcase her new designs. It's cowgirl Karlie! Miss Kloss is Tamara Mellon's new poster girl and shows off her svelte physique in the new campaign imagery . The 21-year-old Victoria's Secret model takes on the role of cowboy Karlie, modelling the brand's signature fringing and leather goods to perfection. In one shot, the American model poses with just ropes and a cowboy hat concealing her modesty and in another, she wears a revealing lace skirt. Yee-ha! Karlie plays a sexy cowgirl in the new campaign imagery as she showcases the best of Mellon's leather offerings .

Want to get Karlie's look? The . supermodel, who admitted that she has so many beauty products, a . bathroom isn't enough to contain them, has shared the secrets behind her . glow. The young star, who . appears in the July issue of ELLE, revealed: 'I have a whole second . bedroom filled with products, but I stick to the things that work.' She adds: 'I like products that streamline my morning routine. Sunday Riley has a really good foundation; it’s very velvety. I love RMS “Un” Cover-Up for under eyes or on a blemish.' She also credits Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, for making her hair 'bounce in a different way,' and mentions that Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer is also 'good.' And as for her body, the statuesque six-foot-one model told the fashion magazine that when she is travelling, she brings 'two or three-pound ankle weights and resistance bands' along with her, and favors the privacy of her hotel room over the gym. 'Sometimes I get a better workout staying in my room and forcing myself to do half an hour or even 15 minutes versus going to the gym, she says. 'Before I leave for work, I try to do something. It helps me feel better for the rest of the day.' Miss Kloss also mentions her Nike Training Club app - which features workouts for women - as helpful in keeping her active. Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge . Mellon's new collection has been causing quite the stir, particularly her £1,595 leather legging boots, which have been worn by Kim Kardashian.The range also includes a £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 fringed wrap-effect leather skirt. And her designs are winning over the fashion world: she's set to open her online shop in Britain and she's planning on opening outlets in London and New York next year before expanding into Europe and the Middle East - Cheryl Cole even wore a pair of her snakeskin metallic blue sandals at the X Factor auditions in Manchester. Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label - and Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12.

Mellon says her daughter loves fashion and has great style . ‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline. ‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’ She continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings. ‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’ Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like. 'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it! ‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’ Famous fan: Cheryl Cole, who is one of Britain's favourite style icons, wore a pair of Mellon's £825 shoes at the X Factor auditions in Manchester .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A husband has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife following the collapse of their 27-year marriage. Christopher Parry, 50, gunned down Caroline, 46, in a quiet suburban street in south Wales last year. Weeks before, Mrs Parry had moved out of the marital home, fed up with her husband’s controlling and domineering ways. Newport Crown Court heard jealous Parry turned up at her new address unannounced – armed with a semi-automatic gun containing three bullets. Face of a murderer: Christopher Parry, 49, shot himself in the face in a suicide attempt after he killed his wife . After shooting her twice in the back, he turned the gun on himself and unleashed a shot into his face at point -blank range. Parry, who has permanent facial disfigurement from the botched suicide attempt, admitted causing the death of his wife, but denied murder. However, a jury cast aside claims the depressed defendant was not in control of his actions - and ruled the killing was intentional. Despite announcing that their relationship was over, Christopher Parry continued to stalk estranged wife Caroline (above) and finally snapped and killed her . The shooting took place in Seabreeze Avenue, Newport, South Wales, on August 8. Mrs Parry had been living in the newly-built red-brick estate after moving out of the home she shared with her husband six miles away in Croesyceiliog, near Cwmbran. But despite being told on April 12 their relationship was over, Parry refused to accept this - and was convinced she still had feelings for him. A jury heard the defendant kept his wife ‘under surveillance’ and was described by prosecuting counsel Michael Mather-Lees QC as a man ‘not prepared to let go’. Armed police at the scene in Newport, South Wales, where Christopher Parry shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself . In the weeks leading up to tragedy, he repeatedly texted, phoned and followed his wife. The day prior to the shooting, licensed gun-holder Parry booked two days off work. And on that fateful day, Mrs Parry was leaving for work when something caused her to stop and open the boot of her red Toyota car. It was then her estranged husband got out of his Ford Focus and retrieved his firearm from the back of his vehicle. After pulling the trigger three times, neighbours found the couple’s bloodied bodies lying side-by-side on the road. Mrs Parry was pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital. Forensic staff examine Mrs Parry's red Toyota car after she was shot by her estranged husband . After the jury delivered a 10 to 1 majority verdict, there were cries of ‘yes’ from relatives of the late Mrs Parry in the public gallery. Judge Mr Justice Williams said he will sentence the defendant on Friday.","Christopher Parry, 50, stalked his wife Caroline, 46, believing she still had feelings for him .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A father who had been playing Assassin’s Creed 3 on his PlayStation killed his baby daughter because she would not stop screaming, a court heard. Mark Sandland, 28, picked up five-week-old Aimee-Rose by her torso and shook her during a sudden loss of temper, prosecutors said. He claimed that he had suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him at their flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex. Tattooed thug Mark Sandland arrives at court. He has confessed to the manslaughter of his daughter because she would not stop crying while he ws playing a computer game . Lewes Crown Court heard that police who attended the flat after Aimee-Rose was rushed to hospital on November 5 2012 found a PlayStation game controller on the settee opposite the TV. Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said: ‘It’s the Crown’s case that, frustrated by the distraction of Aimee-Rose screaming, the defendant picked her up and gripped her around her torso and shook her in a sudden loss of temper and loss of control. ‘Despite his admission that the television was on that morning, by the time the ambulance crew arrived it had been switched off, thus covering up the fact he had been playing the game on his PlayStation.’ Analysis of the heavily overweight tattooed Sandland’s mobile phone internet history showed a website offering tips on how to play Assassin Creed 3 was accessed at 2.22pm, Miss Howes said. The detail of the website, giving step-by-step instruction, meant there would have been little point accessing it unless the game was being played, she added. Some 16 minutes later, at 2.38pm, Sandland dialled 999. Mark Sandland, 28, had been playing Assassin¿s Creed 3 on his PlayStation when, fed up with her crying, he picked up five-week-old Aimee-Rose by her torso and shook her resulting in her death . On that day, Aimee-Rose’s mother was attending her first class for an applied social science degree course at the University of Brighton’s Hastings campus. During a break at around lunch-time, she sent Sandland a text message asking after Aimee-Rose, to which he replied: ‘She hasn’t shut up since about half an hour after you left.’ Miss Howes said Sandland called the emergency services, saying he had suffered a seizure and had woken up on top of Aimee-Rose. When an ambulance crew arrived, Sandland looked ‘panicked and anxious’ and pointed to where she laid in the sitting room, her limbs in a star shape. He told one member of ambulance staff: ‘I’m epileptic. I had a fit and when I woke up the baby was underneath me.’ Aimee-Rose was admitted to the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards with brain damage, and other injuries including bruising to her face, chest, abdomen and lower limbs. Miss Howes told the court: ‘She was unconscious, unresponsive and, although emergency procedures carried out by the ambulance crew re-established a heart-beat, she was unable to maintain any respiratory effort without life support.’ She was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at King’s College Hospital, London, but died four days later. Miss Howes added: ‘The combination of the post-mortem findings of recent head injury, recent traumatic laceration of the liver and recent fracture of the left clavicle is consistent with inflicted injury of the shaking/impact type.’ Sandland told a paediatric nurse at King’s College Hospital that his girlfriend had left at 9.30am to go to university. Miss Howes said it took him some time to become fully awake and he went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee. When Aimee-Rose woke up, Sandland told the nurse that he gave her a bottle, changed her nappy and put her in her bouncer chair before she fell asleep. Later, he claimed she woke up and was whinging, and could not recall whether he picked her up while standing or sitting. Sandland said he later woke up and his right arm was on the floor and he believed he had been on top of her, leaving her blue and lifeless. After Aimee-Rose was taken to the Conquest Hospital, two police officers were sent to her home. When Sandland arrived to collect some clothes, he told one of them: ‘I f***ing had a fit, for f***’s sake.’ Dr Hannah Cock, a consultant neurologist, found it was ‘highly unlikely’ that a seizure was a substantial contributor to Aimee-Rose’s injuries, the court heard. Had he suffered a seizure, Dr Cock would have expected him to drop anything he was holding, put it down and remember later, Miss Howes said. Miss Howes said: ‘Even if he had fallen on to Aimee-Rose, her pattern of injuries is not consistent with a fall and crushing alone. Dr Cock would have expected more disturbance to adjacent furniture than reported.’ Sandland was charged with murder but went on to plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) One expert found Aimee-Rose had sustained two episodes that had led to injury to her chest bones - one up to three weeks before she died and a second up to five days before death. When Sandland was told he would be arrested, Miss Howes said he became upset and said: ‘I suppose you are going to say that you know what it is like to be accused of killing your daughter.’ In one police interview, he declined to comment to most questions, except when he was asked if he had deliberately harmed her. He replied: ‘No.’ Miss Howes said Sandland - who had an ‘unconventional upbringing’ and was raised by his paternal grandparents - had made suicide bids in 2006. Two years later, he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition of the peripheral nervous system, following which he began experiencing seizures. However, the court heard that no medical cause could be found to explain them and he was admitted to numerous hospitals between 2008 and 2012. In the opinion of Dr Muhammad Chowdhury, consultant neurologist at the Conquest Hospital, his seizures had a ‘psychiatric rather than a neurological origin’. Sandland is said to have two to three seizures per week, and his triggers include photosensitivity, stress, lack of sleep and alcohol, Miss Howes said. She went on: ‘All experts agree that the defendant’s ability to cope with, and process stress, is poor.‘The incident of non-accidental injury to Aimee-Rose did not occur during a functional non-epileptic attack disorder, however, the fact that he does have fits of psychological origin as a response to stress, conflict and anxiety is a significant marker of his inability to cope with stress.’ Defence counsel Lewis Power, QC said Sandland had asked him to convey ‘contrition and remorse’, adding: ‘He feels that one life is over, but his is too.’ Mr Power told the court: ‘There can be no greater tragedy in life than the death of a child. A young child, a life extinguished, compounded by the fact it was at the hands of a loving parent.’ Mr Power said Sandland would forever ‘carry the heavy burden’ knowing he has killed his daughter ‘and there can be very little that one can say for mitigation’. ‘This is a man who is unable to cope properly with stress,’ he said. ‘These were not the actions of a reasonable man but a man who has struggled with various forms of medical diagnosis over the years. ‘The best part of his mitigation is that he has pleaded guilty to this dreadful offence.’ Sandland was charged with murder but went on to plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent at Southwark Crown Court last week, which was accepted by the Crown. He was due to be sentenced today but Mr Justice Sweeney, fresh from the Rolf Harris case, adjourned the case to Hove Crown Court on Wednesday.","Mark Sandland, 28, shook five-week-old Aimee-Rose to death .

The service, which launches today across the globe, allows the company's more than 240 million active users to use credit card details stored on Amazon.com to pay for services such as a monthly phone bill or a digital music subscription. Amazon then charges a fee on each transaction, boasting 'your shipping and payment information is safely stored with Amazon and accessible on thousands of sites where you love to shop.'

Amazon Payments  allows the company's more than 240 million active users to use credit card details stored on Amazon.com to pay for services such as a monthly phone bill or a digital music subscription. The service can also be used to transfer money between personal users. 'When you log in and pay with Amazon, you can use the information stored in your Amazon account to login and pay conveniently on thousands of sites other than Amazon.com,' the firm says. There's no recurring fee for retailers to use the platform, though Amazon plans to take a standard cut of 2.9% from those businesses, plus $0.30 for each transaction of $10 or more. EBay Inc's PayPal has long dominated online payments services but Amazon sees plenty of scope to push into new areas. The new service broadens Amazon's profitable role as a middleman for third-party sellers, which account for 40 percent of its sales and extends its influence beyond its website. It also comes ahead of June 18 unveiling by Chief Executive Jeff Bezos of what is widely expected to be a smartphone key to expanding Amazon's role in mobile payments. 'You should see it as one of many things that we'll do to expand where people might think about Amazon helping them,' Amazon vice president of seller services Tom Taylor said in an interview. Amazon has been testing the new service over the last several months with start-ups including Ting, a mobile phone company that is part of Tucows Inc. Those who used recurring payments by Amazon spent 30 percent more on Ting's website, product manager Justen Burdette said in an interview arranged by Amazon. Some analysts have said Amazon has been held back in payments because merchants are wary of handing over customer data to the company, which has a record of rapidly expanding into new areas and competing with sellers. The payments system is the latest in a  the latest in a series of moves that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (pictured)  has made into PayPal's territory . But Taylor said the only details collected by Amazon as part of the new service is the dollar amount of each transaction and not any 'item-level information.' He added that the service would encourage Amazon users who might otherwise be leery of handing over their credit card details to a fledgling companies to try out them out. 'If you think about giving a merchant that you may not know very well the right to continue to charge your credit card in the future, you really want to know that a good relationship with Amazon stands behind that,' Taylor said. 'We hope whoever the next Spotify out there is thinking about Amazon,' he added, referring to the privately held, popular digital music subscription service.","Service available to company's more than 240 million active users around the world .

"By . Katy Winter . A young woman facing a lifetime of obesity-related diabetes was inspired to lose more than 16st after her beloved father succumbed to the disease. Lisa Charlesworth, 26, was devastated when her father John fell into a diabetic coma and died aged just 51 in May 2009. At the time of her father’s death Lisa, from Blackpool, weighed around 27st after years of comfort eating. Lisa had a gastric band fitted and dropped from 27st 9lb and size 32 (left) to 12st and size 14  (right) She was warned that she too might develop diabetes unless she got her weight under control and, motivated by her late father’s wish that she improved her health, secured funding for a gastric bypass, which saw her shrink down to 10st 4lb. She said: 'I was a daddy’s girl. He always wanted the best for me and before he died he told me that he wanted me to improve my lifestyle and be happy. 'Everyone except me could see that my health was failing. For some reason, the message never clicked. But to see my father die from diabetes was frightening. 'Suddenly I knew I didn’t want that to happen to me, and I knew he would be proud of me if I managed to make the changes I needed to.' Miss Charlesworth, an office worker, first turned to large portions of starchy, stodgy food to comfort her when she was bullied at secondary school. She said: 'I’m a natural redhead and being ginger made me stand out. Children can be very cruel. I was the one which other children targeted. 'The more I ate, the larger I became and soon the kids were calling me fat as well as ginger. 'By the time I got to college the bullying had stopped but I was already trapped in the cycle of associating food with emotional comfort.' LIsa, left aged 14, began comfort eating in childhood after being bullied for being a redhead, and by the age she was 21 she weighed an unhealthy 21st (right) Weighing around 16st by the time she started college, she tried various diet plans and was even prescribed weight-loss tablets, but her weight continued to increase until, by the time her father became ill in the spring of 2009, she weight nearly 27st. The weight began to fall off following gastric band surgery, and Lisa remains on a restricted diet . After her father passed away, Miss Charlesworth made a lasting decision to turn her life around for good. She . said: 'Dad was as thin as rake and had been like that since he was . young. His diabetes was genetic, which meant I was at risk too. The fact . that I was overweight meant I was at an even higher risk. 'Ever . since I was small, I’d seen my father injecting himself with insulin . every day. It’s not a nice thing to see. Focussing on the options for . losing weight helped me through the grieving process.' Miss Charlesworth was eventually approved for a gastric bypass on the NHS. The day before the operation in November 2010 she weighed a dangerous 27st 9lb and was wearing size 32 clothing. She said: 'I hadn’t been able to work because of my size and I was looking forward to making the switch, although I was very nervous about the operation and scared about the consequences.' In the week following the operation, Miss Charlesworth dropped more than a stone. Within two years, she had shrunk down to 10st 4lb. She said: 'My life completely changed. I was able to go back to work and found James, my boyfriend, who’s been amazingly supportive.' Before undergoing the operation, Miss Charlesworth typically ate a bacon and sausage sandwich for breakfast, followed by a large chicken sandwich or a burger for lunch, and pasta with sauce with more bread for her evening meal. Lisa, pictured here with supportive boyfriend James, says that her life has transformed since her weight loss . Today, mindful of the restricted diet she must stick to following her gastric band, she eats a slice of toast in the morning, followed by a small barm cake with chicken for lunch and a portion-controlled plate of tandoori chicken and salad for evening meal. Miss Charlesworth now weighs 12st and wears size 14 clothes. Together with her boyfriend James Martin, 26, a debt advisor, she makes regular visits to the gym and is careful to stay active. She said: 'I’m the right weight for my height now and I feel amazing. 'Without my dad’s influence I wouldn’t have been able to get to where I am now. I know I couldn’t physically have done it without having the push I needed. 'I know dad would be very pleased for me.

"By . Ian Drury . and Eleanor Harding . David Cameron finally said ‘sorry’ for the passport shambles last night as emergency measures were brought in to tackle the backlog. After days of denials, the Government finally admitted that urgent action was needed to deal with the crisis.

The Passport Office has ordered an extraordinary internal inquiry after a photograph, above, emerged of hundreds of files full of applications stacked in a meeting room. A whistleblower took the picture at the passport centre in Liverpool. In a letter to staff, Passport Office security liaison officer Andy Bannon wrote: ‘This is being viewed as a serious security breach.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Instead of wasting resources chasing a genuine whistleblower, the Passport Office should spend their time and money getting people their passports.’ People were still queuing for up to four hours at passport offices in Peterborough and Durham as the Government finally took action.

In the Commons, Mrs May said the Passport Office would increase the number of examiners and call handlers by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high. She said the measures would help, but warned there was no quick ‘big bang, single solution’. Mrs May added: ‘I understand their anxiety and the Government will do everything it can while maintaining the security of the passport to make sure that people get their passports in time.’ In a clear sign of ministerial frustration at the mounting political damage to the Government, the Home Secretary said she was considering stripping the Passport Office of its agency status and bringing it under direct Home Office control. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This has been a sorry shambles from a sorry department and a Home Secretary who can’t even bring herself to say the word. ‘Government incompetence means people are at risk of missing their holidays, their honeymoons, their business trips. Every MP has been inundated with these cases and the Home Secretary hasn’t seemed to even know what is going on.’ Ministers say the Passport Office has dealt with 3.3million applications so far this year – an ‘unprecedented’ surge of 300,000 on the same period in 2013. However, Home Office accounts show that as early as December 2012, ministers were expecting 350,000 additional applications when it transferred responsibility for dealing with passports overseas from embassies and consulates. Some 97 per cent of standard applications are issued within the three-week target, although this leaves 3 per cent – or about 98,000 people – facing delays.

"By . Ian Drury . and Eleanor Harding . Union chiefs are threatening strikes which would worsen the passport crisis and enrage hundreds of thousands of families planning summer holidays. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union cynically seized on the problems at passport offices – which are struggling to issue travel documents in time – to warn that its members could take industrial action over job cuts. It said the under-manned Passport Office was battling a backlog of up to 500,000 cases. Overload: The Public and Commercial Services union said the Passport Office was in crisis because 'major job cuts and office closures' had left it unable to handle a surge in applications for travel documents . There are mounting fears that applicants will not get their documents before their departure date because of an ‘unprecedented’ surge in applications. The PCS said the agency was in crisis because ‘major job cuts and office closures’ had left it unable to handle demand. MPs have been inundated with more than 500 complaints in recent weeks from constituents about delays. The Passport Office, which recorded a surplus of £73million in 2012-13, said it had issued more than 3million documents so far this year, after receiving around 300,000 more applications than in the same period last year. The Home Office website advises it takes three weeks to renew a passport, but travellers are complaining it is taking twice as long. In a letter to the Passport Office’s chief executive Paul Pugh yesterday, the PCS said the problems were heightened by the loss of 315 staff and closure of 23 offices since 2010. PCS chief Mark Serwotka said the union would consider industrial action if the situation was not addressed satisfactorily by the end of this month. He added: ‘The Passport Office is failing holidaymakers because of a political decision to cut staff and close local offices. ‘While the economy is showing signs of . recovery for some, the damage being done by the Government’s spending . cuts is evident to anyone trying to get a passport at the moment and we . are not prepared to stand by and allow this to happen.’ Cutbacks: Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, which told Passport Office's chief executive Paul Pugh that the problems were heightened by the loss of 315 staff and closure of 23 offices since 2010 . Labour immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘Home Secretary Theresa May has taken her eye off the ball. Chris Gibbs, 30, left, should be on holiday in France but is stuck at home in Bristol because of Passport Office chaos. He applied to renew his passport on May 13. After calling the helpline numerous times, he has been told his application has been moved from Durham to Glasgow. He said: ‘I’m really disappointed. If they had warned people that there would be delays this summer, I would have applied much earlier.’ 'We have more and more new applications adding to the backlog and by their own estimate the Passport Office have 16 per cent more demand than they expected. ‘This is a mess and it is ministers who will be responsible if people’s holidays are ruined.’ But the Home Office said the ‘vast majority’ were receiving their passports on time. A million had been issued since the start of April. It added that since January the Passport Office had redeployed more than 200 staff – some from anti-fraud duties – to frontline operations to help meet the increased demand. It had also boosted the number of call centre staff from 350 to 1,000. A spokesman said: ‘We would remind people of our existing advice: Allow plenty of time when applying as a passport will not be issued until the necessary security checks have been done, and do not book travel until you have received your passport.’","PCS says Passport Office crisis is due to 'job cuts and office closures'

"By . Eleanor Harding . The parents of a boy who died after being denied a vital hospital scan have hit out at the NHS after it emerged the delay was caused by a computer glitch. Three-year-old Samuel Starr died in his parents’ arms after being forced to wait almost two years for a check-up which might have saved his life. He was one of dozens of children to have their treatment needlessly delayed because of blunders at Royal United Hospital (RUH) in Bath, it is claimed. Samuel Starr, three, died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check-up for 20 months. He was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old . Freedom of information documents . obtained by his parents suggest there were 63 missed paediatric cardiac . appointments at the hospital, with some taking nearly two years to . discover. An inquest heard . yesterday that  Samuel was making a good recovery  following surgery . shortly after his birth in 2010, but that regular check-ups were needed. Samuel, . who was born with a complex congenital cardiac defect, was supposed to . be under the supervision of RUH staff. His parents repeatedly chased the . hospital but a ‘glitch’ meant Samuel was left without a crucial echo . heart scan for 20 months. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin ruled the failure of the booking system left Samuel without examination and treatment. She . said: ‘This overall failure led to a five-month delay in Samuel being . seen by his cardiologist. This meant Samuel had not been seen for five . months and had not had an echo for 20 months.’ By . the time he was finally seen, Samuel’s condition had dramatically . deteriorated and he required urgent heart  surgery at Bristol Royal . Hospital for Children. Samuel had an operation at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and he was recovering well initially. However, his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check-up . Samuel . suffered a stroke during the procedure and died a month later, in . September 2012, in the arms of his  devastated parents, Catherine Holley . and Paul Starr. Yesterday the couple, from Frome in Somerset, said the NHS had ‘failed’ their son. Mr . Starr said: ‘It was devastating to hear that an improperly implemented . appointments system and a series of human errors resulted in the death . of our son. ‘We accept that . mistakes happen but we believe that leaving a child unmonitored for as . long as Samuel was, with so many opportunities to attend to him, goes . beyond simple error. ‘We . know that Samuel’s case was not an isolated one and the computer  system . that failed him put others at risk.’ Doctors diagnosed that Samuel had a . restricted pulmonary artery – causing blood to easily flow away from . his heart to his lungs – during a 20-week scan in pregnancy. After . his first open-heart surgery in 2010, he was discharged six days later . and referred to the Paediatric Cardiac Clinic at RUH for check-ups. Samuel underwent only one echocardiogram – a scan vital to monitor his . condition – immediately after his treatment. It was left to his parents . to chase the hospital for a further scan, but they were unable to get an . appointment. Medical secretary Annabelle Attridge said a ‘glitch’ with a new bookings  system meant the appointment was not logged correctly. Samuel was due to have his check ups at Royal United Hospital, Bath, but they became sporadic. A report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame . Following a three-day hearing in Flax Bourton (pictured), Bristol, Avon Coroner Maria Voisin ruled the 'failure' of the booking system left Samuel without examination and treatment . Miss Holley wept as she told the inquest of her devastation when Samuel was finally operated on – and did not survive. She said: ‘As we read Samuel his favourite stories, he died in our arms.’ The . coroner told the inquest in Flax Bourton, North Somerset, she would not . make any recommendations to the hospitals, because changes had already . been made. A spokesman for . RUH said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to the family of Samuel, and . are very sorry for the delay in him being seen in the specialist . outpatient clinic.’","Inquest records a narrative verdict in the death Samuel Starr .

"By . Lydia Warren . A family has discovered $300,000-worth of 300-year-old Spanish gold chains and coins during a sea scavenge off the Florida coast. The Schmitt family and a diver, Dale Zeak, found three pounds of thin gold chains, five gold coins and a gold ring just 15 feet below the surface 150 yards off the coast of Fort Pierce this weekend. The family runs a company named Booty Salvage but this is the biggest loot they've ever found. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Hillary, Rick and Eric Schmitt hold up one of the gold chains they found during a dive this weekend . Striking gold: Hillary, 20, shows off the gold chains found by her treasure hunter family at the weekend . 'This is like the end of a dream,' owner Rick Schmitt told the Orlando Sentinel. They were with diver Dale Zeak when he spotted the first piece of the gold. 'As I was reaching to grab, I found another one six inches away,' Zeak told WKMG. 'Then I saw three piles of gold chains.' Schmitt, who was out on the family's boat, the AARRRR Booty, with his grown children Hillary and Eric, then jumped in for a look. 'The whole bottom was covered in . gold,' said Schmitt, 65. 'Eight gold chains and all of these gold coins, . they were laying all over the bottom. It was the most unbelievable . thing I've ever seen.' Bounty: An image shows the gold chains and three of the coins they found. They also found a gold ring . Precious: The gold comes from a shipwreck in 1715, when a fleet of Spanish ships were hit by a storm . Florida will get 20 per cent of the gold and it will be displayed in museums. The rest will then be evenly split between the crew and the company. But Schmitt said he's happy with whatever they earn from the stash. 'I'm happy as hell to find it,' he said. 'I don't care if I got one per cent of it. Finding it is 90 per cent of it for me.' The haul is believed to have been lost at the bottom of the ocean after a fleet of Spanish ships carrying the treasure was struck by a strong hurricane on July 30, 1715. More than 1,000 people died in the . storm and 11 of the 12 ships were wrecked, spilling piles of gold and . silver across the sea floor, the Sentinel reported. Discovery: Rick Schmitt, left, made the discovery with a diver off the coast of Fort Pierce this weekend . Jewels: His daughter and friends show off the loot, which was found just 15 feet below the surface . Family business: They go on regular diving trips with their boat, AARRR Booty, pictured . Some of the artifacts were found in the years after the storm, but it is believed that there could still be millions of dollars worth of treasure beneath the sea's surface. The haul was valued by Brent Brisben, the co-founder of 1715 Fleet - Queens Jewels LLC which owns the rights to dive on the wreckage site. 'To be the first person to touch an artifact in 300 years is indescribable,' Brisben said. Rick Schmitt has been diving for treasure since he was a teenager in the 1960s. He retired in 1999 and started the family's diving salvage business. Another notable find was by his son Eric in 2002; he found a 300-year-old Mexican silver platter near Sebastian that was worth around $25,000.","The Schmitt family found three pounds of gold chains, five gold coins and a gold ring 150 yards off coast of Fort Pierce .

I don’t make individual evaluations because we are playing with a team not individual players.’ Responding to comments by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers that he will find the competitive nature of the Premier League very different to working at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich where the league is dominated by one or two clubs, Van Gaal replied: ‘That’s why I’m here. 'OK, maybe he is right because I have to experience that but I was also in Spain and in my first year and I won three titles, in Germany I won two titles. If I win one here we will all be happy.

Not ready: Robin Van Perise (left) faces a race against time to be fit for the Premier League opener . The United boss will try to give many of his players 90 minutes against Liverpool as they step up their preparations. He has not ruled out the possibility of Robin van Persie featuring in the first game of the season at home to Swansea even though the striker has made a late return to training with other World Cup players Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj. ‘They have already trained,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I sent them to train with a special group. They could reach the first match, not against Valencia (in a friendly). That depends on the individual because each one is different. ‘You have seen on this tour for example that Ashley Young already played 90 minutes and Darren Fletcher two matches of 90 minutes but not others. There is a difference between players and I have to see if they can do it or not. ‘I have to look at Robin van Persie if he is coming back or it. But if you have three weeks holiday and only four days training before Valencia you are not fit enough. For the first game in the Premier League it’s possible but I don’t think so.’ VIDEO: Anders Lindegaard catches footballs in the bag after training .","Louis van Gaal will tell his unwanted players they can leave after the tour .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Nasa is to try growing vegetables and herbs on the moon to see if humans could one day live there. The US space agency plans to send seeds to the moon in 2015 in sealed canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to thrive. As well as ten seeds each of basil and turnips, there will also be around 100 seeds of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard. The US Space Agency are to send a batch of seedlings to the moon in sealed canisters and will monitor their growth which could indicate whether human beings would survive in space . On landing, a trigger will release a small reservoir of water inside the canister and a team on Earth will monitor how the seeds germinate when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation. A group of scientists, students and volunteers - known as the Lunar Plant Growth Habitat team - are behind the project which will see the seedlings photographed at intervals to compare with those planted on earth. The air in the sealed containers should be adequate for more than 5 days of growth. A Nasa spokesman said: ‘They can test the lunar environment for us, acting as a canary in a coal mine. 'If we send plants and they thrive, then humans probably can.' Thriving plants need the same ingredients for life as humans – food, water and air – and also provide psychological comfort for people, demonstrated by the popular greenhouses in Antarctica and the International Space Station. The seeds will be sent to the moon in the Moon Express Lander (illustrated here by computer generation) in 2015 . Nasa plans on sending the seedlings to the moon by hitching a lift on a commercial spacecraft called the Moon Express lander, which is competing to win Google’s Lunar X-Prize in 2015. Scientists are currently constructing a unit to study the germination of the plants, which will have a mass of just one kilogram and will be deposited on the moon. Water will be added to the seeds in the module after landing and their growth will be monitored for five to 10 days and compared to Earth-based control seedlings. Arabidopsis (pictured), basil and turnip seeds will be sent to the moon in containers containing all the elements needed for the plants to grow on earth . Seeds will include Arabidopsis, basil, and turnips and Nasa says the experiment will be the first of its kind on another world and ‘an important first step in the utilisation of plants for human life support’. Follow-up experiments will improve the technology in the growth module and allow for more extensive plant experiments, the organisation said. Survival for 14 days demonstrates plants can sprout in the moon’s radiation environment but survival to 60 days demonstrates that sexual reproduction (meiosis) can occur in a lunar environment. Survival to 180 days shows effects of radiation on dominant and recessive genetic traits and afterwards, the experiment may run for months through multiple generations, increasing science return. There has been a lot of research on plant growth in microgravity, on space shuttles and in the International Space Station. But the surface of the moon is the only location in which the effects of both lunar gravity and lunar radiation on plant growth can be studied.","US space agency to send basil and turnip seeds among others to the moon .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . David Cameron has been inundated with demands for the return of priceless artefacts looted from Beijing in the 19th century as his visit to China draws to a close. The Prime Minister has to the southwestern city of Chengdu on the largest ever British trade mission to the country. Last Friday, British officials set up a microblogging page on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, attracting more than 260,000 followers by Wednesday evening. Children in Britain should ditch French and German and study Mandarin instead, David Cameron has said . He invited Chinese citizens to ask questions, saying he would aim to reply during the visit. One of the most popular questions was posted by a prominent Chinese think-tank, the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, which is headed by former vice-premier Zeng Peiyan and includes of the country's government officials among its members. The organization posed the question 'When will Britain return the illegally plundered artefacts?' referring to 23,000 items in the British Museum which it says were looted by the British army. The British were part of the Eight-Nation Alliance that put down the Boxer Rebellion at the end of the 19th century, a popular uprising against the incursion of European imperial powers in China. To the Chinese, the ransacking of the Forbidden City, and the earlier destruction of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860 remain key symbols of how the country was once dominated by foreign powers. Prime Minister said he wanted education ties with the country dramatically strengthened . One British officer wrote at the time: 'You can scarcely imagine the beauty and magnificence of the places we burnt. 'It made one's heart sore to burn them'. Asked whether China was asking for the treasures to be returned, Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters Wednesday: 'Relevant Chinese authorities are in communication with the government authorities of relevant countries.' Local knowledge: While the PM was ingratiating himself to local youngsters, his Sina Weibo page was being flooded with questions about Chinese treasure which a British led alliance looted in the 19th century . In response, the Department for Culture, Media & Sport in London said the 'UK enjoys excellent cultural relations with China. 'Questions concerning Chinese items in museum collections are for the trustees or governing authorities of those collections to respond to and the Government does not intervene.' Britain has consistently rejected requests from other countries to return artefacts such as the Elgin Marbles. Clashes: A colour lithograph illustrates battles between Chinese forces and Allied armies during the suppression of the Boxer rebellion . The British Museum argues the objects are part of world heritage and are more accessible to visitors in London. Beijing was outraged by Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama - whom it condemns as a dangerous separatist - last year, which led to a diplomatic tensions between the two nations. Despite the trip being billed as a trade mission, it has widely been seen as an attempt to repair some of the damage caused to China-British relations . Armed force: Officers and crews of the 1st sea battalion from Germany are pictured in 1990. They served as part of an allied army sent to stamp out rebel activity in China . But a leading state newspaper launched an attack on Cameron Tuesday, saying in an editorial headlined 'China won't fall for Cameron's ""sincerity""' that Britain should recognise it is not a major power but 'just an old European country apt for travel and study'. The prime minister has taken more than 100 businesspeople with him to China, including the heads of Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls Royce and Royal Dutch Shell and the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. British officials say deals worth £5.6 billion ($9.2 billion) have been signed so far on the trip. Peace deal: An Illustration showing the signing of the Peace Protocol of Peking bringing an end to the Boxer Rebellion in China. On the left side of the table is the multi-national delegation and on the right are the Chinese leaders . A spokesperson from the British Museum said: 'There is clearly a serious misunderstanding. There are around 23,000 objects in the Museum’s Chinese collection as a whole, the overwhelming majority of them peacefully traded or collected. 'Many indeed were made for export. Very few objects entered the collection, in the context of – even less as a result of – the Boxer Rebellion. 'The Museum has not received any official requests for the return of any objects to China.' Two accused members of the Boxer society kneel before the Chinese High Court . Beginning in 1899, the Boxer Rebellion was an uprising in China against foreign influence in religion, politics, and trade. The 'Boxers', otherwise known as the The Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, was a secret society consisting largely of people who had lost their livelihoods because of imperialism. They were given their name because they practiced pugilistic skills as part of their training, some believed they were impervious to Western weapons. In the summer of 1900 members of the Chinese society roamed northeastern China in bands, killing Europeans and Americans and destroying buildings owned by foreigners. They also staged sieges on foreign embassies in Beijing, in a bid to bring to an end foreign influence in China and restore to power the weak Qing Empire. Following a 55-day siege, the embassies were relieved by 20,000 Japanese, American, and European troops from Britain, Germany, Russia, France, Japan and the USA. After the defeat of the Boxers, punitive expeditions were launched and the Chinese government was forced to sign the 'Boxer Protocol' which called for the rebellion's leaders to be executed and the payment of financial reparations. During this time it is alleged that many priceless Chinese treasures were looted by the allied nations and taken overseas. The ransacking of historic Chinese sites is seen as a source of national embarrassment to nationalists in the country today. Many believe that artefacts from the Boxer Rebellion era are held in the British Museum. In 2009 calls for a Chinese delegation to be allowed access to the British Museum archives were reported. But the a spokesperson from the Museum confirmed that as yet, there has been no formal request from the Chinese government to return artefacts .","PM set up account on Chinese social network 'Sina Weibo' to take questions .

"By . Alex Ballard . Girls as young as nine described their ideal woman as a ‘pretty’ blonde who dresses provocatively to attract men, according to shocking new research. A group of 13-14 year-olds revealed that she would wear ‘tight’ tops, expose her bra straps to get attention from men and have expensive clothes. Asked to describe her, they used words such as a 'whore' and 'slutty' and said she would be promiscuous. More worryingly, an even younger group - aged between nine and 11 - said a woman should be ‘interested in guys’ and ‘snobby’. And when asked to draw their ideal woman, almost every girl from both groups produced a thin, blonde and white figure - even those children of non-white ethnicity. Controversial: Miley Cyrus has been criticised for being a poor role model for young girls due to her 'twerking' antics during performances . The findings came as researchers studied body image issues among young girls. Professor Niva Piran of the University of Toronto asked two groups of girls aged nine to 11 and 13-14 to draw ‘the ideal woman’. The younger children unanimously depicted a blonde, blue-eyed girl with expensive clothes, high heels and 'tight' clothes. The older girls drew a similar looking woman, describing her as promiscuous and stupid but physically attractive. Presenting the research at an international conference on body image at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Prof Piran said: 'What happens between the two groups is that the older girls start policing other women. 'They want to look like that but say she is stupid. So they are demoting themselves with this ideal. They are even uncomfortable in their own ideals. Their ideal woman was a double-edged sword.' She added: 'What we see is a constant failure to accept diversity, so we have a lot of work left to do.' Other speakers at the conference noted the negative influences of social media on how young people viewed their body image. Professor Ann Frisen of the University of Gothenberg examined the effects of cyber bullying on teenagers by studying a group of 15 year-old girls and boys. The girls admitted they feared being criticised for their looks and strongly desired admiration from people online, even if they are strangers. Cleancut: According to the study, Keira Knightley, pictured here watching the ladies' singles final at Wimbledon, is not the type of woman young girls aspire to become . Prof Frisen said: 'They are opening themselves up to such nasty comments, making themselves so vulnerable because they want so much to have someone post something complimentary or flattering. 'It’s worth the risk to them.' Most girls admitted they were cruellest to other girls while teenage boys said they feared posting photographs of themselves online in case they were called 'gay' by their peers. Jon Brown, head of sexual abuse programmes at the NSPCC, said: 'What we see with studies like these is that children don’t feel they can be themselves. 'We’ve noticed a significant increase in the number of children calling Childline and talking about the pressure they feel to look a certain way. 'Some of them say they don’t want to be seen in public because they’re too upset. It’s really very worrying considering they’re meant to be enjoying their childhoods.","Study reveals 13 and 14 girls say their ideal woman would be promiscuous .

"By . Chris Irvine . 'Pot princess' Kayla Mendoza, 21, was charged with DUI manslaughter on Monday in Florida . A 21-year-old woman who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' hours before she killed two young women in a car crash has made her first appearance in court, as the victims' families, who say they hope she is locked up forever. Kayla Mendoza, a self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' is still recovering from injuries she sustained in the crash five months ago that resulted in the deaths of Marisa Catronio and Kaitlyn Ferrante, both 21. On Monday she was wheeled into Broward County Jail, Florida, on a stretcher, covering her face with a sheet while the victims' families gathered outside the gates. The following day, she appeared in a wheelchair before Circuit Judge John 'Jay' Hurley, who set a $600,000 bond. If she makes bond, she will be placed under house arrest. Judge Hurley referred to court documents that alleged Mendoza's blood-alcohol levels were above the legal limit and that she did not have a valid license on the night of the crash, Nov. 17 last year. He also cited Mendoza's Twitter post before the crash which state she was '2 drunk 2 care', when Mendoza's attorney claimed that she may have been the victim of 'involuntary intoxication'. Party girl: Kayla Mendoza, a self-proclaimed . 'pothead princess' posted photos of joints on her Twitter account, is . allegedly responsible for a wrong-way crash that killed two women . Less than three hours before the wrong-way crash on November 17 last year, Mendoza tweeted that she was '2 drunk 2 care' Mendoza, a sales assistant, faces two counts of DUI . manslaughter while impaired, two counts of DUI manslaughter with an . unlawful blood-alcohol level, two counts of vehicular homicide and two . counts of driving without a license and causing death. She suffered a brain injury and broken legs in the crash. Gary Catronio, Marisa's father, said that Mendoza had 'changed the lives of our family forever.' 'You took my baby girl,' he said, according to CBS Miami. ' You took my baby girl. You took my wife's best friend. You made bad decision that night. The right decision was to have a friend drive you home.' Christine Ferrante, the mother of Kaitlyn, said: 'I don't want her to ever feel the sunshine ever. 'I want her to stay locked away forever.' Earlier this week, family members said that waiting so long to see Mendoza charged has been difficult but that they understood investigators had a complex task and wanted to be certain there were no legal loopholes. Mendoza, who is still recovering from her injuries from the crash, covered her face so she would not have to look at the faces of the grieving families who gathered on Monday at the Florida jail . Marisa Catriono's father Gary, pictured outside the jail on Monday, said his life had been changed forever . On the night of the crash, 20-year-old Mendoza had been drinking at the Tijuana Taxi Company in Coral Springs. Around 8pm, she tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' - just hours before climbing into her car and  allegedly causing the horrific wrong-way crash on the Sawgrass Expressway. Marisa Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene around 2am on November 17 last year. Kaitlyn Ferrante was taken to hospital but died from her injuries four days later.

The mother of Daisy Coleman, the teenager who claimed she was raped by a high school football star, has written a powerful essay in which she opens up about her daughter’s suicide attempt. Melinda Coleman, 52, writes that the media attention her daughter’s case has generated, as well as the internet backlash, ‘has been too much at times’. She also writes that the family has been followed by a private investigator. In January 2012, Daisy, then aged 14, claimed that Michael Barnett, a 17-year-old Maryville High senior, raped her at a house party. He said the sex was consensual. Daisy Coleman in October last year. Earlier this month, Daisy ended up in hospital after swallowing a mixture of cough medicine and prescription pills . Melinda Coleman, Daisy's mother, who has vowed to keep up the fight for justice and not bow down to intimidation . Recovering: Daisy Coleman, pictured on January 4, days before she was hospitalised . Last week, Daisy, pictured with blonde hair, briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends . The case received international attention after the relentless bullying eventually forced the Coleman family to move from Maryville to nearby Albany. Then almost exactly two years after the initial incident, Daisy attempted to commit suicide for the third time after ingesting a mix of cough medicine and prescription drugs. Mrs Coleman has now written a moving account of what happened that night, beginning with Daisy walking into her 18-year-old brother Logan’s bedroom to tell him she was seeing ghosts. ‘She was doing things like grabbing a glass of water and sticking her phone charger in it and saying the craziest things, making absolutely no sense,’ Mrs Coleman writes on XOJane. ‘It turned out that she had taken half a bottle of Benadryl in combination with some prescription drugs she shouldn't have gotten a hold of and taken them to try to overdose. ‘When they carried her into the back of the ambulance, she started screaming, ""I'm falling down a black hole."" At the time, she was being carried down the porch. ‘We rushed her to the hospital, crying and praying, and there her stomach was pumped. My life seemed like it was going to be over.’ Matthew Barnett, arriving at court earlier this month (left). He was convicted of Child Endangerment but escaped sex charges. Right, his High School Yearbook photo . Mrs Coleman, whose doctor husband died in 2009, says that Daisy was triggered when she went to a party and was subsequently bullied after a picture of her attending appeared online. ‘In the months since our case became the subject of widespread media scrutiny, I have seen the dark side of human nature. In addition to the party that she attended -- which resulted in significant backlash on Facebook, including from some of the friends who she grew up with who my deceased husband cared for -- she was recently almost run off the road, which terrified her, because the attack appeared targeted and deadly.' She claims that she has seen two Justice for Daisy Coleman pages on Facebook which claim to raise money to help the family but they were actually raising funds for people who were hiring private detectives to follow them. ‘We've been followed by a private investigator almost daily since all of this began. Typically I drove the Hummer, but the one day that she was driving it, she found herself so vigorously followed -- with this other car tapping her bumper and flashing his brights -- the experience left her terrified. Even though I got the license plate number, and I've talked to the highway patrol and the special prosecutor, no one can tell me who it was. Daisy has experience two years of bullying since she accused Barnett. Pictured left at her home in Albany, and right, a high school wrestling photograph . Bullied: Daisy and her family have reportedly been followed by private investigators and had to leave the Maryville after reporting the alleged rape . ‘The entire experience triggered her in a way that I refuse to let happen again. I will not lose my daughter.’ Mrs Coleman calls on parents to make sure their children are being protected from online abuse.‘Let them know that these people are cowards, and nothing but. Do not let the cowards win. Do not let them take your child's life.’ Mrs Coleman also writes that the family have spoken about plans for the future, and have decided to open up a rehabilitation center for children ‘who have been affected by tragedy and trauma’. ‘Daisy especially wants to help other kids who might be displaced in the foster system, which she was exposed to during one of her outpatient stays,’ she writes. ‘All Daisy wants to do is help other people and to carry on the love and spirit that so many have expressed to us in these past few months.’ Mrs Coleman has vociferously campaigned to get Michael Barnett convicted of the alleged attack on Daisy, in Maryville, Missouri. The investigation was reopened in October, but earlier this month it was revealed that no sex charges would be brought against Barnett. Instead, he was convicted of Child Endangerment – for leaving Daisy out in the freezing cold - given two years’ probation in a plea bargain deal and ordered to apologize to the 16-year-old. In the aftermath of that decision, Mrs Coleman told MailOnline: ‘I’m not finished fighting, not at all, this just makes me even angrier.’ At the time of the attack, back in January 2012, it was alleged one of the other boys present at the party, Jordan Zech, filmed Barnett, now 19, and Daisy having sex. That video was never found and Melinda is convinced that was also part of the cover up. The case received national attention after the relentless bullying eventually forced the Coleman’s to flee Maryville to nearby Albany. The family home then mysteriously burned down.","Daisy Coleman claimed two years ago that she was raped at a house party .

"By . Chris Irvine . A powerful new film has highlighted the increase in homophobic attacks in Russia ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics following the passing of an anti-gay ‘propaganda’ law. The film, ‘Young and Gay in Putin’s Russia’, from a VICE News film released in partnership with Stonewall, found that homophobia was ingrained in everyday people in the street, with one even comparing homosexuality to zoophilia. In June, President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill punishing people for homosexual ‘propaganda’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Part of his activism is to teach gay teenagers about how to protect themselves online from the likes of violent vigilante groups . Artem, a taxi driver for the gay taxi service in Moscow 'Our Taxi'. Unlike the activists he is cautious about being open with his sexual orientation. The law imposed fines on those who disseminate information aimed at minors ‘directed and forming non-traditional sexual setup’, or which may cause a ‘distorted understanding’ that gay and heterosexual relationships are equal. Activists and celebrities have repeatedly called on Mr Putin to repeal the law but to no avail, while there have been calls to boycott Sochi. Only on Friday, Mr Putin said that gay people would be welcome at the Olympics, but in a sign of the persecution the homosexual community is under in the country, he said: 'They must leave children in peace'. Last week, the powerful Orthodox Church – of which approximately 64 per cent of Russians identify themselves as – demanded one step further, calling for a national referendum on criminalising homosexual relationships altogether, a return to a Soviet law enacted by Stalin.

Nix, Ray and other LGBT activist staging an action in moscow in July 2013 to draw attention to the rise in suicides among gay teenagers since the anti-gay propaganda law was passed . ‘The one reason the law was installed in the first place was to please the Orthodox majority,’ explained Milène Larsson, a UK-based journalist originally from Sweden. ‘He [Putin] is looking for enemies. In Russia, homosexuals and gay rights activists are labelled as foreign agents. ‘You have such a vast majority of people who are Orthodox who potentially feel this way, those are his voters, that he is not going to step back and say “actually gay people are ok”.' The video highlights the abuse that homosexuals receive in the streets, with activists regularly attacked. They have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect themselves from persecution – from both official channels and neo-Nazi vigilante groups. The gay community has their own taxi service, while there are LGBT self-defense classes. There are also videos on YouTube held by activists, such as NIkita Gurjyanov, who has teaches gay people how to protect themselves from such groups. Ms Larsson, who filmed the documentary along with Olga Kravets, told MailOnline that she was particularly struck by the attitudes and reaction of everyday people in the street. ‘What I was particularly struck by was talking to a random person on the street, who in a very calm voice says they can’t be like Europe, “we have our own traditional conservative values, and at the moment in Europe, they’re legalising paedophilia, they’re legalising zoophilia, they have zoo brothels”, and this guy just looked like a regular professional on the street. There has been a rise in vigilante groups, like the neo-Nazi Occupy Pedofilyaj, that hunt down homosexuals online and make YouTube clips of how they abuse them. Here, two members of the group are humiliating a young Uzbek man . Russia's Vladimir Putin meets with volunteers taking part in the preparations for Sochi. On Friday, he said gays should feel welcome at Sochi, but must 'leave the children in peace' ‘The other thing when I felt the hatred the most, was when one of the activists Alexei Davydov passed away, and we had a funeral and a memorial, so the gay rights activists we had been following joined, and the plan (spread via social media) was to hold a minutes silence for Alexei. ‘So of course, violent homophobes and various neo-Nazi groups and orthodox thugs showed up because they heard about it. I didn’t expect this because somebody passing away is a sad moment. 'It’s not the place you expect people showing up to basically try and beat these people up. Luckily there was a heavy police presence. ‘So many violent people trying to pick fights and getting dragged away, and you could tell they were looking at me to see what side I was on, so much hatred.'","Law passed in June punishes people for homosexual 'propaganda'

A mother in Oakland has lost both her sons to gun violence within a space of three weeks. Dinyal New’s oldest son, 19-year-old Lamar Broussard, was shot and killed on Sunday, near the intersection of 100th Avenue and Longfellow in East Oakland, California. The Laney College student, who aspired to be a musician, was ambushed and killed along with his best friend Derrick Harris while riding in a car. However, her youngest son, 13-year-old Lee Weathersby, was gunned down on New Year’s Day, on 104th Avenue near Walnut Street, less than a mile away. He had been walking home from the Oakland Boys & Girls Club. The 41-year-old social worker’s assistant, told SFGate that she was struggling with her faith in God.‘I have no more kids,’ she said. ‘I’m still numb about Lee, so I don’t know if my heart has enough room to handle Lamar’s death. This is like a dream right now. ‘I know there is a God, but I’m like, “Why would he give a mother so much pain to handle within 19 days?” This is really had one me.’ Ms New appealed for anyone to come forward with information about both deaths, and has pleaded with the community to not seek retribution.

"By . Chris Irvine . For Gregoire Alessandrini, the diner is a symbol of American nostalgia as wholesome as the apple pie that was served inside. So a recent trip back to New York - 25 years on from when he first lived there as a film student - inspired the photographer to share his old images of the relics, for Big Apple ‘nostalgics’ like him as well as the younger generations of New Yorkers curious about their past. ‘As a pure bred Parisian, New York City had always seemed an obvious destination for me,’ he told MailOnline. The Lost Diners: photographer Gregoire Alessandrini wanted to share his 1990s photographs of the famous American restaurants to highlight the changing face of New York . Cheyenne: When pushing the door of the Cheyenne diner, he said, you felt like you were part of the legend of the city, just for the price of a burger with fries! Bygone era: I think they were also a type of restaurants which was accessible to everybody, from any social backgrounds, said Mr Allesandrini . ‘A place I felt I already knew through a personal exploration of American movies, rock vinyls, art and photography books. ‘I finally had the chance to go to New York to become a film student and I started exploring the city from one end to another… always carrying my old Nikons with me.’ He explained that while the city had obviously changed tremendously since the 1970s and 1980s, ‘you just had to walk around the corner and enter any downtown dive bar to find the signs and remains of this legendary New York’. Keeping up with the Jones's: The Jones diner was amazing because of its location,' he said. 'An old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown Manhattan. What a contrast! He explained that while the city had changed tremendously since the 1970s and 1980s, 'you just had to walk around the corner and enter any downtown dive bar' to find the remains of Old New York . Fusion: This old diner was converted into a Chinese and Spanish restaurant, a combination of food that doesn't usually go together . Mr Alessandrini focused on diners in particular as he saw them as a real part of American mythology and imagery. ‘You see them in classic films and the ones that were left in New York were really great looking. Their names were wonderful, some kind of urban poetry – The Moondance, The Lost Diner – and it seemed to me they were a real part of the old New York. His favorites include the Lost Diner ‘for its name’: ‘It was really lost on the edge of Manhattan and its name reminded me of Lost Highway by David Lynch!’ Dancing in the Moonlight: Among his favorites was the Moondance Diner, saying that its loss is a 'real pity' The Moondance, says Mr Alessandrini, had a particular allure for its turning moon crescent on the roof . Mr Alessandrini said he realized that many sites documented the disappearing New York neighborhoods and landmarks, with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores . He also had a soft spot for The Moondance and The Jones. ‘It seemed to be a real part of Soho and of the West Broadway area at the time and its loss is a real pity. It looked really great from the outside with its turning moon crescent on the roof. ‘The Jones diner was amazing because of its location. An old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown Manhattan. What a contrast !’ After spending eight years in the city, he returned home to Paris, but had a chance to return to New York last September, where he witnessed how fast the city was changing. This rapid change led to him posting his old images on his website galessandrini.blogspot.fr. ‘This sudden transformation of downtown Manhattan had started before the Twin Towers went down but it seems to have accelerated at an incredible pace. At the drive-thru: For Mr Alessandrini, he felt he already knew New York through his exploration of movies, vinyls and art . End of the empire: The diners were mainly replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings which seem to lack personality and the classic architecture . He believes that current restaurants in New York are now either very high-end or boring food chains all looking the same . ‘Surfing on the web, I realized that this transformation of the city is a widely discussed topic, with many internet sites documenting the disappearing New York neighborhoods and landmarks, with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores and the real estate development in Manhattan. ‘More reasons for me to keep scanning my old negatives and color slides kept in an old suitcase for almost 20 years!’ Most of the diners have now gone, a fact Mr Alessandrini laments. 'New York will always be New York and I see young people discovering Manhattan and being as fascinated by it as I was 25 years ago. Yet I really have the feeling that something was lost somewhere. Something of the city's soul is definitely gone. 'The diners were definitely a part of that New York. They were also a type of restaurant which was accessible to everybody, from any social background. 'When pushing the door of the Cheyenne diner, you felt like you were part of the legend of the city, just for the price of a burger with fries!' Now the diners have mainly been replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings lacking in personality, he argues, with architecture that 'will never become as ""classic"" and iconic as the diners were.' 'The recent evolution of restaurants in Manhattan seems to be a good representation of the global evolution of Manhattan as Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg wanted it to be. They are either very high-end or boring food chains that all look the same.","Photographer Greg Alessandrini spent the 1990s in New York as a film student armed with a camera .

"By . David Wilkes . A Romanian family of 17 is collecting more than £55,000  a year in state benefits – nearly three times as much as the father earns. Mihal Toma and his wife would require a pre-tax income of around £125,000 a year to maintain the same standard of living for their brood. His wages of £1,800 a month as an electrician and the fact that they have 15 children mean they qualify for a raft of benefits which they say total £55,200. Scroll down for video . Place to live: Parents Mihai and Veronica Toma (pictured standing with youngest child Elizabeth) reportedly 'lied' to get a three bedroom house in Harrow, north-west London. Pictured from the left, back row, are: Andreia, 17, Ionut, 16, Daniela, 19. Middle row: Cristina, 11, Beniamin, four, Ana Maria, 15, Filip Elisei, two, Miriam, eight, and Iona, 13. Front row: Magdalena, 10, holding David, one, Iosif, six, Naomi, five. Mara, 19, is not in the picture . They receive £2,500 a month in working tax credit, £1,400 in housing benefit for the three-bedroom rented home they cram their family into, and £700 in child benefit, which totals £4,600 a month. When Mr Toma’s £21,600 wage is added to the benefits, the family have a monthly income of £6,400 – or £76,800 a year. The Government’s £26,000 a year benefits cap does not apply as Mr Toma is in work and entitled to the tax credits. The farcical situation was revealed after the family admitted they were so desperate for a new life that they lied to their private landlord about the size of their family to secure their home in Stanmore, North West London. Packed: Housing inspectors were informed of the Tomas' living situation, and after visiting the property described it as one of the worst cases of overcrowding they had ever seen, but added the family had intentionally over-filled their home . Daughter Daniela, 19, speaking on behalf of Mr Toma, 47, and his wife Veronica, 37, told the Mail: ‘If we have the benefits it’s because it is our right in this country. We like it here, it’s a nice place.’ She insisted they pay their £1,700-a-month rent and council tax and ‘spend the [benefits] money in this country for the food and everything the children need and keep the bills paid up to date’, adding that this includes repayments on a VW people carrier parked outside. But the huge cost of supporting the family has led to renewed calls for a benefits overhaul. Bob Blackman, Tory MP for Harrow East, said: ‘If people choose to come here with their families and work that’s fine, but from their income they then have to generate the income to support their families, not expect the taxpayers of this country to subsidise their family. ‘The vast majority of people would say the public purse is supporting the family to a huge extent, far more than he is paid and far more than he pays in taxation. How is that reasonable?’ Mr Blackman raised the issue of the family’s overcrowded house with the council after being alerted by neighbours while campaigning during the local elections. He said there was a concern about the children’s welfare because of the cramped conditions. 37462 . 19343 . 60800 . 59307 . 223469 . 95488 . 45080 . 37129 . 62996 . Campaigners say the UK’s generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, are a massive lure for those from overseas. A migrant earning the minimum wage with a partner and two children can boost their net income threefold with tax credits and housing benefit. Mr Toma was at work yesterday and several of the younger children were at school. But Mrs Toma agreed to let her daughter Daniela, who speaks good English, speak to the Mail on behalf of the family. Eight of the 17 children are in local state schools, and Daniela is studying business at college. She said the family originally lived in Prahova, southern Romania, but moved to Spain seven years ago after Mr Toma got a job there. After the economic crisis, they came to Britain in 2012 so he could find new work and moved to their current home in September 2013. Council environmental health officers have told the family they must move but they will not be able to jump the queue for a council house. They are not eligible to be placed on the housing register as they have not been resident in the borough of Harrow for five years. Left behind: The Tomas left Romania for Britain in 2012 to give their children a better life in Britain, where they say they will have a better education and more opportunities. Pictured is the Romanian capital of Bucharest .","Toma family arrived in Britain from Romania in 2012 'for a better life'

Belfast is revealed as one of the UK’s most tolerant major city, with three-quarters of people saying the presence of foreigners was good for their hometown. But in London barely half of people think foreigners are well integrated into society. Scroll down for video . The audit of city life across the EU reveals people in the UK think health, education and unemployment are the most important issues faced by the areas where they live.

It showed dramatic differences in the way city dwellers view people from other countries. In Belfast, 75 per cent of people said they thought the presence of foreigners was good for the city in Northern Ireland - higher than the EU average of 73 per cent. By contrast, in London only 72 per cent of people agree, Glasgow 70 per cent, Cardiff 68 per cent, Manchester 67 per cent and Newcastle 63 per cent.

The study also showed that people in the UK were less worried about noise and air pollution than other parts of Europe. Most were happy with public services, but satisfaction levels were lower in relation to the state of streets and buildings and levels of cleanliness.","75% of people in Belfast say foreigners are good for the city, higher than EU .

Emma, who so far has struggled to find full time employment, spends 10 hours online each week searching for the latest vouchers, deals and coupons to save her money. And every month, she saves herself £2,000 on the cost of clothes, food, presents and days out - which amounts to a whopping £24,000 a year. 'Getting a good bargain is addictive. I just love the feeling of saving money and I make sure I never do without,' says Emma. When 20-year-old Emma's relationship ended she found herself lumped with rent, bills and and £7,000 worth of debt and became obsessed with using coupons . 'I have all the same things as my friends, but I still manage to save money at the end of the month,' she adds. Coupon-crazy Emma has turned her whole life around and converted to a money-saving way of life. She now no longer buys anything full price and with careful planning she is able to buy presents, food and even holidays for a fraction of their recommended price. Emma shows off her array of vouchers (above left) and her supermarket savings (above right) When there is a specific deal on, Emma will make sure she takes full advantage of it and often this means bulk-buying products with offers on such as shampoo and toothpaste. 'When I found myself in a desperate situation with no money, I didn't want to resort to selling everything I owned or getting in trouble with debt collectors,' she explains. Emma from Dorchester, Dorset, decided to make her wages as a part-time shop assistant in Next stretch as far as possible by becoming a coupon-savvy shopper . 'I knew I needed to make some savings somewhere and I had no idea how I was going to manage,' she says. 'I first heard about extreme couponing from an American TV programme, and ever since I started it has turned my life around. 'It really is a way of life and I don't understand why more people don't take it up.' Dripping in coupons: Emma has moved back in with her parents and pays minimal rent but has helped the family by slashing their £330 a month food bill in half . 'It takes a bit of effort in the beginning but who hasn't got the time to save themselves money?,' she says. 'The key is to be open-minded. People are slaves to brands when in reality cheaper versions are identical.' Emma moved out of the flat she shared with her ex-partner and now saves £300 a month by living at home with her parents. Emma says, 'I pay my parents £80 a month rent, which isn't as much as I'd like to, but with my wages that's all they ask for.' Emma Mumford saves the £95 a month she used to spend on gel nails by using a £10 home nail kit . 'But I do my best to save them money with things like the utility bills and food shop. It's my way of helping out,' she says. Emma makes sure that just because she doesn't splash the cash, she doesn't go without. She still manages to pamper herself each month with gel nails and a professional haircut and colour - all for just £20. Emma managed to slash the £95 she would have paid for her nails and hair in a salon too by using a £10 home kit for her nails, which she can do as she is a qualified nail technician. And she has her hair cut and coloured each month at her local Toni & Guy hairdressers for just £10 by offering to pose as a hair model. Cash-savvy Emma purchased her entire summer wardrobe in February, for just £60 by taking advantage of online codes and in-store vouchers . 'The haircuts are always supervised and I was nervous at first but I would highly recommend it, as it saves so much money and my hair looks great,' she says. Cash-savvy Emma purchased her entire summer wardrobe in February, for just £60 by taking advantage of online codes and in-store vouchers. Emma said, 'I'm a self-confessed fashion-lover and always preach Primark over Zara. For my spring/summer 2014 wardrobe, I bought it all in the beginning of February. 'I always find if you buy spring clothes as soon as they are launched they are very cheap. The shops put the prices up as soon as the weather warms up so usually around May.' 'I resent paying £50 for the same white blouse I could buy for £5 in a different shop.' Emma Mumford has managed to save £24,000 a year on supermarket shopping, clothes and treats by using coupons . And generous Emma even uses her savings to treat her family. This year, Emma spoiled her mum Jill on Mother's Day without spending a single penny. She bought Cadbury's chocolates, flowers and a card which should have been £10 for absolutely nothing, after saving up Morrisons' coupons. And she also won a birthday photo shoot for her mum worth £75 through a local radio competition offering vouchers for the shoot. 'Couponing is a great way for those who are feeling the pinch to get back in control of their finances,' says Emma. Before Emma's couponing days, the family of three would spend £330 a month on food and drink. But now Emma has convinced her parents to shop around and ditch the brands, she has slashed the family's food bill in half and now they spend just £10 a head, per week. Emma said, 'I have created a giant stockpile of things like toothpaste and shampoo which will last at least six months, so that costs me nothing.' On days out with her boyfriend Mitch, Emma will always use BOGOF vouchers and she will stay in with a bottle of discount wine, over expensive nights out in clubs. Emma has even blagged a two day holiday to Disneyland Paris for her 21st birthday with her parents, all expenses included, for just £93 a head instead of the £900 RRP. Emma said: 'I would never go back to frittering money away, couponing and saving money is now my way of life. 'The savings I have made mean that my finances are now getting back on trackand I don't have to worry each month.'

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Skeletal: Eric Ward's weight plummeted while staying at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff . Painfully thin at just six stone but still managing to raise half a smile, a skeletal Eric Ward is just a shadow of his former self. The former rugby player had weighed a healthy 11 stone before he was admitted to hospital. In just a few months, his weight had plummeted. His heartbroken widow Rosemary has now released this haunting photograph – taken just weeks before his death – as she launches legal action against the NHS. The 75-year-old claims her husband was left to starve to death in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Staff are accused of effectively giving him half of the 1,964 calories he needed every day ‘at best’. The father-of-five, 69, became so thin while in their care that his fragile skin could be ripped open by simple sticking plasters, she said. Mrs Ward, who was married to the retired builder for 53 years, said: ‘He went in to that hospital a walking man of a healthy weight and came out a skeleton in a wheelchair. ‘When he was discharged it was like bringing a dead body home, he was that frail and was just skin and bones. His legs were so thin.’ Four years after her husband’s death in June 2010, Mrs Ward has won a battle to have the case heard and justices at the High Court will hear the allegations later this year. ‘I’m not interested in the money – I want answers and justice for my Eric. He was my one and only love and the hospital just left him to starve to death,’ she said. Mr Ward, a grandfather of 37 who also has 25 great-grandchildren, was admitted to the Welsh hospital twice in February 2010 after suffering from severe abdominal pains. But despite being diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, staff are accused of failing to admit him to intensive care or administer adequate feeding. Instead he was discharged just days after each visit, it is claimed. Following his third and final admission to the hospital in March, Mr Ward discharged himself after two months because there was little hope of survival and the hospital put him on an end-of-life care pathway. He died at his semi-detached home in Cardiff just two weeks later. Claiming negligence against Cardiff and Vale University Local Health Board, court papers say Mr Ward was ‘effectively starving to death and must have been in considerable pain’. The hospital ‘persisted’ in trying to feed him orally even though a scan revealed a gastric obstruction. The papers say he should have been fed intravenously to ensure he got enough sustenance. As a result he received a fraction of the daily protein he needed, the documents add. Mr Ward’s GP and a dietician raised fears over his ‘clinically significant 21 per cent body weight loss’ over two months. But he remained in hospital for three weeks after his family’s repeated pleas for him to be able to go home where he could be cared for by nurses. Fight: Wife Rosemary Ward, 73, with a photo of her husband before hi weight loss . Mrs Ward, who slept on the floor by her husband’s hospital bed, said: ‘In the photo he was smiling because he thought he would be able to come home. Just moments later he broke down as they said no again. ‘It took us three weeks to get him back home where he belonged.’ The case claims that the hospital ‘unreasonably refused or failed to act upon the deceased’s requests to be discharged’. Mrs Ward added: ‘When he was dying I told him I would fight this to the end, even if I end up losing our house I won’t give up.’ Cardiff and Vale University Health Board offered its ‘sincere sympathies’ to Mr Ward’s family. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of this sad case and we extend our sincere sympathies to Mr Ward’s family. 'Our defence in this case will be lodged shortly and, given the ongoing legal proceedings, we are unfortunately not in a position to comment further.'","Eric Ward's weight plummeted at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A village cricket team has been banned from hitting sixes after an angry neighbour threatened to take the club to court over balls landing in her garden. Diana Attenborough, 69, complained that it was dangerous if the heavy cricket balls fell within the grounds of her detached home which lies at the end of the club’s grounds. Now Britwell Salome Cricket Club in Oxfordshire has been forced to introduce a ban on batting sixes and has had to spend over £4,000 on installing a 50ft high net. Dispute: Diana Attenborough, 69, who owns the circled house, threatened to take the club to court . Dispute: Ross Joyner, the captain of the cricket team, explained how protecting Diana Attenborough's house from cricket balls has cost the club its savings . But yesterday, the club, which has used up all of its financial reserves to meet Miss Attenborough’s demands, discovered that the grandmother has put her £850,000 home up for sale. Chairman of the club, Nigel Joyner, said: ‘We play on average two games a week for five months a year and have been in the village for over 85 years, in all that time we have not had any complaints other than those from Diana. ‘About two years ago she complained and threatened to take an injunction out to stop the club playing cricket but we managed to come to an amicable decision in January. ‘But it means we’ve had to use up all of our funds, money we had hoped to use to replace our tractor so we can cut our grass and build a new shed as the old one is falling down.’ The 61-year-old businessman added: ‘We understand she is concerned and a ball has gone over and smashed a pane once before which we covered the cost for but it is odd that she has now put her house on sale. ‘Either way the net, which unfortunately is a bit of an eyesore because of the great white posts, will prevent any future problems there.’ Village green: A £4,000 net will have to be erected and draped between the three poles at one end of the pitch . Team captain Ross Joyner, 30, added: ‘Cricket is a way for many people to keep fit and socialise, its a shame how one person can ruin that for the others. ‘There seems to be a lot of health and safety cases being taken to the extreme across the board and its a bit worrying if that continues in this way.’ The club, which has around 30 members with games being played between May and September, is now enforcing a ‘local rule’ after consulting the Oxfordshire Cricket Association. The new rule means that if a player hits a six, no runs will be allowed to be scored. However, residents of the affluent village of Britwell Salome near Watlington said that they supported the cricket club and had no reason to be concerned. One villager has even donated £400 to cover the cost of the net which will be installed on three 50ft posts which the club had made and shipped in from Norway. Rules: The club has also instituted a new rule discounting any runs scored from sixes . A neighbour, who lives near the grounds but did not want to be named, said: ‘We all love the club and have never had any problems. It is mainly dads and sons from the village who play. ‘It is only the odd ball that comes over every now and then, and the club would cover the cost of any damage caused. ‘I can’t see why such a fuss has been caused, particularly as Diana has put her house up for sale. It is just a local club and it cannot afford paying for all these measures.’ Another villager added: ‘The club is part of our community, it puts on events for the village and allows dog walkers to use it grounds. ‘It has always been there and she (Diana) knew it was there when she moved in. ‘If you live next door to a cricket pitch what do you expect?’ The club initially installed a 15ft high net after first receiving the complaint from Miss Attenborough but balls continued to land in her garden. Miss Attenborough, whose son is a barrister, has given the club a month to demonstrate that the problem has been solved by the new preventative measures. The grandmother, who has lived in her house for eight years, said: ‘The old net was much lower so the balls came over and made it very dangerous to be in the garden. We came to an amicable solution.’ Mr Joyner, 30, said the club, which survives on donations and money from fundraising events, will now have to find funds to buy a £3,000 tractor and £1,000 to build a new shed for storage from other means.","Britwell Salome cricket club in Oxfordshire has played for 85 years .

"By . Paul Bentley . and Inderdeep Bains . Brian Copsey arriving at Southwark Crown Court, where he was sentenced to eight years in prison . A ‘charming’ accountant who stole more than £1million from his wealthy neighbours has been jailed for eight years. Brian Copsey, 60, pretended to oversee refurbishments to a luxury mansion block near Marble Arch in West London, but spent residents’ savings on shopping sprees at Harrods, Tiffany and Selfridges. He also splashed out on luxury  holidays and boarding school fees for one of his sons at £30,000-a-year Ampleforth College. The father-of-three was chastised by a judge for his ‘gross breach of trust’ as he was jailed this week. His neighbours at exclusive Bryanston Court, where Wallis Simpson, the wife of Edward VIII, once lived and where apartments are worth up to £4million, said the swindler had caused ‘turmoil’, with tenants turning on each other. Copsey stole the money while living there with his wife of 14 years in a four-bedroom flat worth £3.7million. He charmed his neighbours before being chosen to look after residents’ contributions to refurbishments by Bryanston Court Management, the group of tenants managing the flats. Copsey, who lived there rent-free, forged bank documents to authorise service charges to be paid to his own companies. He paid £250,000 into his own bank account and transferred nearly £80,000 to his children. His wife Caroline, 49, is said to have had more than £110,000, while £27,000 went on bills. He told neighbours he had invested the money in a mining company called Anglo-African Minerals and then flew to Africa on a string of ‘business’ trips. He was exposed when other members of the flats’ management board tried to start the refurbishments and found £1,160,525 had disappeared from the account. None of the residents in the 56 flats has been repaid. One grandfather, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that he was ‘distraught’ at being conned. ‘We are all very upset,’ the businessman said. ‘Everyone has suffered. Everyone is shattered by what has happened. He forged our signatures. ‘He nicked it all. He was very charming so nobody suspected anything. He was always in smart suits but lied to us right from the beginning. We still haven’t received a penny back. There is a whole kerfuffle in the block about it. How can you trust anyone?’ Another branded Copsey’s eight-year sentence ‘ludicrous’ and said: ‘It should have been a lot longer.’ In impact statements read to Southwark Crown Court, it emerged that one victim was 97 while another has suffered stress-related Bell’s Palsy as a result of the deception. Copsey, originally from New Zealand, lost his own fortune in poor business dealings before he started the scam, which ran between March 2010 and  September 2012. Exclusive: The Bryanston Court block where Mr Copsey lived and conned his neighbours . He was found guilty of fraud by abuse of his position, and was also disqualified from being a company director for 12 years. Judge John Price told him: ‘The victims are ordinary people who lost about £30,000 each. Neighbour has turned against neighbour. You have done all of that – you destroyed the feeling of good neighbourliness that was in the flats.’ Detective Constable Julie Jode, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘Despite the revelations, Mr Copsey continued to live among his victims with no apparent shame or remorse.’","Brian Copsey, 60, pretended to oversee refurbishments of luxury flats but kept the money for himself .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A couple who finally conceived after nine years of trying lost their baby because of a fatal human error by hospital staff, an inquest heard. Karen Legg, 37, and her husband Sion, 30, were overjoyed when she became pregnant naturally with Alyssa Rose after four courses of unsuccessful fertility treatment. But their daughter died at just seven days old last July because she had been starved of oxygen at birth. Tragic: Alyssa Rose Legg died at just a week old after being starved of oxygen at birth. An inquest heard she would have survived had she been delivered 18 minutes earlier . An inquest heard a bungling doctor at Nottingham City Hospital missed vital signs the baby was in distress and failed to order a Caesarean section in time – a decision which could have saved her life. As a result the otherwise healthy infant suffered multiple organ failure. Coroner Heidi Connor ruled at the inquest last week that Alyssa Rose would have survived if the C-section operation had been carried out just 18 minutes earlier. The hospital has admitted that poor care in the late stages of labour led to the death, and blamed human error. Mrs Legg said: ‘It took me nine years to conceive Alyssa Rose. She was an incredibly precious baby. The post-mortem examination proved that my daughter was perfectly healthy. She was a big baby at 8lb 10oz. ‘They couldn’t find a single thing wrong with her other than the fact she was brain-dead. And that was simply because they [hospital staff] wouldn’t intervene and do a C-section. The doctor kept saying we’ll leave it another half an hour.’ Delivering a narrative verdict, the coroner said: ‘It was an individual human error … she died after the late stages of labour after her [mother’s] care was incorrectly managed. Better management would likely have meant Alyssa Legg would not have died.’ Under fire: The inquest heard that errors by staff at Nottingham City Hospital (pictured) meant problems with Alyssa's heartbeat were not detected . The inquest heard Mrs Legg went to the hospital on July 9 believing her waters had broken, but she was sent away and told to return the next day to be induced. When she came back, she was attached to a CTG machine which monitors the baby’s heartbeat and the rate of contractions. After her waters broke at 4.10pm the doctor noted activity on the CTG machine was suspicious – but took no further action. However, when the shift changed at 9pm, another doctor checked the vital signs again and realised the seriousness of the situation, immediately calling for an emergency C-section. By then it was too late and Alyssa Rose was born not breathing and without a heartbeat. Despite the efforts of the neonatal unit to save her, she died on July 17. No disciplinary action has been taken against the doctor responsible for the fatal error. A spokesman for Nottingham University Hospitals Trust said: ‘The doctor’s practice has been reviewed and as this was a single incident they were not deemed to be a danger, therefore no formal disciplinary action was taken.’ Apology: The hospital has admitted that 'sub-standard care' in the late stages of Mrs Legg's labour led to the death and blamed 'human error' for the fatal mistake . After the verdict, Alyssa’s parents called for a further investigation and said the hospital had not learnt from the death. The couple, from Hucknall in Nottinghamshire, added that they are considering legal action against the Trust. Mrs Legg said: ‘This inquest was the opportunity to expose the failings in my case and ask the questions that nobody is answering. ‘But we feel it was a missed opportunity to learn the lessons from my case. I felt I wasn’t listened to and my concerns were ignored by staff with devastating consequences.’ Mrs Legg said she should have been identified as a high-risk pregnancy because she had been diagnosed with endometriosis, a condition affecting the lining of the womb. Her labour was also ten days overdue and her waters broke early with discolouration – a known risk factor. But despite these warning signs, she claims hospital staff were not vigilant to possible problems. ‘Sion was so looking forward to being a father,’ she said. ‘Everything seems to have gone wrong in the last 24 hours … the medical staff need to listen to, and act on, the concerns of mothers, they need to be more alert to potential complications.’ The Trust spokesman added: ‘We appreciate that this is little consolation but apologise unreservedly that we provided poor care.’","Baby Alyssa Rose was starved of oxygen at birth after C-section delay .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . The tuberculosis outbreak among cats in the Home Counties is at risk of spreading across the country and infecting more people, according to experts. The warning came as the mother of the first documented victim said she would not dare to keep a pet again. Claire Livings witnessed her daughter Jessica, 19, suffer for months with hallucinations, fevers and dramatic weight loss after contracting the potentially fatal disease from their kitten Onyx. Jessica Livings, 19, suffered hallucinations, fever and lost a stone in weight after contracting TB from her pet cat. Her mother Claire (right) now says she will never keep a pet again . The 40-year-old hotel worker, who caught a dormant form of TB, said: ‘I still love cats. I don’t mind being around them and although what happened to us is very rare I can’t be sure it wouldn’t happen again. 'After what we went through last year I couldn’t risk it, but I don’t know how I will feel in the future.’ Jessica was forced to undergo emergency lung surgery. She and her mother – two of the first four recorded cat-to-human transmissions of bovine TB – are believed to have caught the disease from a wound on the kitten who later died. It was revealed last night that five-month-old Onyx may have been infected at Falkland Veterinary Clinic in Newbury, Berkshire. The centre’s clinical director Carl Gorman, who identified the outbreak, diagnosed nine cats with TB between January and March last year. He said: ‘Onyx came in to us around January to be spayed … There is a chance that when he was castrated the wound was infected with the TB organism … it may have been because he was very young or the strain of TB is very aggressive.’ Jessica's kitten, Onyx, may have been infected at Falkland Veterinary Clinic in Berkshire. The clinical director Carl Gorman has warned that another outbreak could spread if colleagues are not vigilant . Seven of the nine infected cats had bite wounds thought to be from badgers. Six were put down or died but 18-month-old tabby Milhouse, who belonged to Dr Gorman, is missing. The vet believes the outbreak started with a local herd of cows which contracted TB. It is argued the spread of the disease is accelerated by badgers and the Government is undertaking a cull. But Robin Hargreaves, of the British Veterinary Association, said: ‘It is going to happen again. It’s low risk, but not no risk.’ Calling for vets to be vigilant, he warned that TB would persist in pets even if it was eradicated in cows because of a ‘high endemic problem’ in wildlife. He added that all infected animals should be put down to reduce health risks to humans.","Jessica Livings, 19, was infected with TB from her pet kitten Onyx .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A sales director offered two female executives free shopping sprees in Harrods if they agreed to his demands for a threesome, a tribunal heard yesterday. Married Darren Scott allegedly pestered Anna Mazover, 29, and Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, for sex and promised to shower them  with expensive gifts, oysters  and champagne. He also said they would be promoted if they agreed to return with him to his £1.4 million penthouse apartment  in London. The women claim they were sacked after refusing the 55-year-old’s ‘non-stop’ sexual advances. Claims: Anna Mazover, 29, (right) and Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, (left) told Central London Employment Tribunal they were offered promotions in return for sex with their boss, but were dismissed when they refused . Harassment: The women (left) claim Darren Scott, 55, (right) subjected them to persistent sexual remarks during the single month they worked for him at publishing firm Entico . Giving evidence at the Central London employment tribunal, Miss Mazover said: ‘It started on my first day, it was every day. ‘I . cannot tell you how many times a day he made some sort of remark. On my . first day, he said “you have a sexy body, you’re are very tall and . slim” and he said “have you ever thought about working in a strip club”. He would talk about my breasts and body. It was non-stop. I thought it . was very shocking and outrageous.’ Mr . Scott’s representative, Adam Gadd, dismissed the claims as  ‘complete . fantasy’, claiming Miss Mazover was dismissed from her job at . London-based publishing firm Entico Corporation for lateness and poor . performance. But Miss . Mazover said: ‘He harassed me and asked me to come to his penthouse to . have oysters and champagne with him. (He) then said, “I will buy you . everything that you want in Harrods or Selfridges”.’ Miss . Mazover, the daughter of a Ukrainian businessman, also claims racial . discrimination. She said Mr Scott mocked her accent and made derogatory . comments about Russian women, implying they were easy, and one day . greeted her with, ‘Good morning, Red Army’.

Police investigated the claim but no further action was taken. Both . women, who are seeking £108,000 in damages between them, claim that on . May 21 last year they were at an office party when Mr Scott invited them . to his penthouse for a threesome. Miss . Mazover, a former professional synchronised swimmer, said: ‘He said to . both of us: “It would be nice if we go back together to my penthouse and . have a threesome”.’ On June 14 last year, Entico's director James Ramsey (left) called both women into his office and allegedly told them 'there were no grounds for the complaints'. Darren Scott (right) fired them shortly afterwards, they claim . Allegations: Miss Mazover, who is from Ukraine, claims she was the victim of racial discrimination. Mr Scott mocked her accent and made remarks on the reputation of 'Russian women', she says . Both . women complained to the company’s human resources department, but they . say that on June 14, Entico director James Ramsey called them into his . office and told them ‘there were no grounds for the complaints’. Shortly afterwards, they were both dismissed with no explanation, it is claimed. The . women are bringing the claims against Scott, Entico Corporation and Mr . Ramsey on the grounds of sexual harassment, victimisation, race . discrimination and public interest disclosure. Miss Mazover is claiming £41,000, while Miss Nicholl-Pierson is claiming £67,000.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A mother was reduced to tears when staff at a naval museum ordered her to stop breastfeeding in its creche, telling her ‘we don’t do that here’. Heather Vaughan, 29, was feeding her nine-week-old daughter in the National Museum of the Royal Navy when a male member of staff told her to  stop. The mother of two said she felt  victimised and humiliated at the museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Heather Vaughan, 29, was reduced to tears at being told off for breastfeeding her baby daughter - in a creche . It happened while she was visiting the National Museum of the Royal Navy, in the dockyard, with husband Daniel Vaughan, son Josh and baby Lydia . Yesterday bosses apologised and said it had simply been an ‘error of judgment’. Mrs Vaughan, who had been visiting with  husband Daniel, son Josh and baby Lydia, said: ‘The four of us were in the museum and I took my daughter to the creche area to breastfeed her. 'While I was doing that, a male staff member came up to me, pointed his finger and said “We don’t do that here”. ‘I stopped and asked him what he said because I thought I had misheard him, but he repeated it again and said it really aggressively. I told him I was feeding my child but he told me I would have to do it in the baby toilet. ‘Another mum with her family in the creche told the man to leave me alone, and eventually he tutted, turned on his heels and left. ‘I was shocked and sat there in humiliated silence.’ Museum director general Dominic Tweddle apologised for the mistake, saying the staff member had become confused. Above, the museum's dockyard . Mrs Vaughan, from Whiteley in Hampshire, added: ‘As soon as I could, I bundled Lydia up, grabbed the buggy and left to find my husband. 'Once I was out of the building, I burst into tears. As we walked away and I told my husband what had  happened, I couldn’t stop crying. ‘I felt so emotional at being caught off guard when I was simply being a good mother. The whole episode shattered my confidence.’ Museum director general Dominic Tweddle apologised for the mistake, saying the staff member had become confused. He said: ‘We’re very sorry to Mrs Vaughan for this mistake and error in judgment from one of our team. ‘Our member of staff became  confused and is deeply and sincerely sorry for his comments and reactions. This incident is not representative of him or our organisations and we all regret the distress caused. ‘The museum and dockyard take this issue very seriously. We are committed to putting in place improved procedures and staff training to ensure an incident such as this will never happen in the future.’ Campaigners said incidents such as this could stop women from going out, or make them give up breastfeeding early. Lactation expert Lynn Timms, who runs Breastfeeding Matters which offers support to mothers, said people needed to be more accepting. She added: ‘We all know mums need to go out and about and they should feel comfortable feeding their baby. ‘Incidents such as this might cause mums to stop breastfeeding or they might avoid going out.’ Emily Slough was out shopping last Friday when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old daughter Matilda on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch. Unbeknown to her, a stranger had spotted her, taken a photo of her and posted it on Facebook, saying: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp' Earlier this week, a mother spoke of her outrage after a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter in public and uploaded it to Facebook, branding her a 'tramp'.

'I am very confident and comfortable with my breastfeeding, but I know plenty who aren't and don't even humour the idea of nursing because of some ridiculous stigma attached to it and fear of embarrassment, humiliation and non-acceptance.'","Heather Vaughan, 29, was feeding nine-week-old Lydia during a family trip .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Sir Christopher Chataway, pictured in 2010, died from cancer after suffering from the disease for two and a half years . Christopher Chataway, who acted as pacemaker to help Roger Bannister become the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, died yesterday. He had been diagnosed with cancer more than two years ago and passed away in a London hospice, aged 82. Paying tribute yesterday, Sir Roger, 84, said: ‘He was gallant to the end. Our friendship dated back over more than half a century. We laughed, ran and commiserated together. ‘People will always remember him for the great runner he was, but it shouldn’t be forgotten that he had an extremely distinguished career off the track.’ In 1954 the former Tory minister won the 5,000 metres at the White City Stadium, setting a new world record of 13 minutes 51.6 seconds. Later that year he became the first person to be named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. But he is more famously remembered as the pacemaker who helped Sir Roger to become the first person to run a mile in less than four minutes that same year. Lord . Sebastian Coe added: ‘He was a ""Renaissance Man"" and, although his . international career was relatively short, he packed an enormous amount . in it.’ Sir Chataway’s . son Mark confirmed the former athlete and broadcaster died at around . 7am at St John’s Hospice in north west London. The . 53-year-old paid tribute to the father-of-six who he described as a . ‘very compassionate and wise man’ who had the ‘ability to put other . people’s needs first’. Best of friends: Christopher Chataway (right) shakes hands with Roger Bannister (left) after helping to pace him to become the first man to run a mile in under four minutes at Oxford in 1954 . Award winners: Bannister and Chataway were named Sporting Personalities of the Year in 1954 . Champions: Chris Chataway, pictured right with watch in hand, yells the time at a running Bannister during the 4x100 relay. The British team, which included Chataway, Seamons, Bannister and Nankeville, set a new world record of 16 minutes and 41 seconds during the England-France Athletic meeting at White City . ‘We were, especially in these last few years, struck by his amazing qualities of humility and strength,’ he said. Mr . Chataway said that the former athlete’s interest in keeping fit . continued despite his old age and illness and saw him - up until a few . weeks ago - still using his exercise bike every morning. Sir Christopher also kept his passion for running alive - even when he was approaching 80 years of age. ‘He . kept running almost until the end of his life. He ran with a couple of . my brothers in the Great North Run about three years ago now,’ Mr . Chataway said. Adding: ‘And then doing it in a very respectable time.’ Speaking . about taking part in the Great North Run, Sir Christopher said at the . time: ‘I sometimes think that running, which was a sort of tormentor in . my youth, has returned to be a friendly codger in my old age - that what . was Joe Stalin has turned into Dixon of Dock Green.’ Sir Christopher competed for Great Britain in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, coming fifth in the 5,000 metres final.

In 1954, he won a gold medal in the three-mile event at the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. In the same year he competed in the European Championships in Bern, winning silver in the 5,000 metres. In 1957, Sir Christopher entered Parliament after winning Lewisham North for the Conservatives. He held several posts including junior education minister, but lost his seat in 1966. Prime Minister David Cameron described the former Tory former minister as 'one of a kind' and a 'great Briton'. Mr . Cameron said: 'Chris was a rare politician in that he enjoyed such . extensive, wide-ranging and successful careers both before and after he . served in Parliament. 'In . politics, he held a number of influential positions and as the . Government Minister responsible for introducing local commercial radio, . left a lasting legacy millions continue to enjoy today.

Multi-talented: Chataway also had a distinguished career as a television news broadcaster and a Conservative politician . 'And after politics, Chris continued . to hold senior positions with organisations as diverse as BT Systems, . Laker Airways, and Bletchley Park. 'Chris . was one of a kind; throwing himself into every project and achieving so . much in so many fields. We have lost a great Briton, a true . Conservative and a man of many talents. 'My thoughts and prayers are with Chris's family.' Mr . Chataway added that he believed Sir Christopher would like to be . remembered as ‘a wonderful father, a husband, a grandfather’. ‘Those probably mattered more than any of the sporting or political things,’ he said. He . said he and his siblings ‘grew up with him as a person, not as a . runner’, adding: ‘Of course we all thought it was remarkable. ‘We all saw the old footage, but I think as a child that’s not what you focus on in a parent.’ Sir . Christopher is survived by his sons Mark, Matthew, Adam, Charles, Ben, . his daughter Joanna, his wife Carola and his former wife Anna.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Boom to bust: Gregg Wallace has seen his third company shut down, following two others last year . His cooking advice may be lapped up by millions on Masterchef, but Gregg Wallace may need to listen to some of his own tips as he appears to be on the brink of going bust. The TV chef’s already crumbling business empire has suffered yet another blow with a third company being shut down following two others in the last year. The 49-year-old MasterChef judge has been forced to close his Wallace and Co restaurant in Putney, South West London and sell its parent company Wallace Cafes after it failed to attract enough customers and received poor reviews. The closure comes after the father-of-two closed Gregg’s Bar and Grill in Bermondsey, South London in August and his greengrocers, West Veg Ltd, collapsed in March with debts of more than £500,000. A source close to the former market trader, who has been married three times, told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Gregg’s not in a happy place - his business empire is collapsing around him. ‘He was forced to sell the restaurant so no one would go bankrupt. But it’s devastating for him after pouring so much cash into it.’ The star has now hired show business agent Jonathan Shalit, who represents Myleene Klass, in a bid to turn his fortune after reportedly sacking his agent of ten years Rosmary Scoular. ‘He has demanded to make millions more from the BBC and other celeb ventures, because he needs the money,’ the source added. According to Companies House records Wallace, who is dating Anne Marie Sterpini, 21 years his junior, was once the director of nine firms, but six of them have been dissolved with liabilities between £50,000 and £1.8m. Wallace’s West Veg Ltd is in administration after collapsing with £500,000 worth of debts. Documents showed it owed £78,991 to 15 former employees, £166,915 to partners, £77,839 to NatWest and £143,591 in taxes despite a gross profit of £700,000. He was forced to close Gregg’s Bar and Grill in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel when the chain dropped his restaurant after he was involved in a brawl with a fan in another one of its luxury hotels. The restaurant had a rocky start when it was set up in February 2012, receiving scathing reviews by critics who branded it a ‘travesty’ and a ‘joke’. Shrinking empire: Wallace, pictured with his partner Anne Marie Sterpini, was once director of nine firms, but six have now been dissolved . Now Wallace Cafes - the company behind his first restaurant Wallace and Co, has been sold with its most recent accounts showing it had a net worth of -£146,639, assets of £65,812 and liabilities of £405,841. His Lobster Enterprises is now Wallace’s only remaining directorship. Wallace, who was born in Peckham, began his career selling vegetables at a stand in Covent Garden. He started George Allan’s Greengrocers in 1989, a company that built up to an eventual turnover of £7.5 million.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Inderdeep Bains . and Amie Keeley . Submerged: Cameron Bespolka, 16, died after being swept away by an avalanche . A British schoolboy died when he and his father were swept away by an avalanche as his brother watched in horror. Cameron . Bespolka, 16, was on a skiing holiday with his fellow triplets – . Nicholas and Megan – and their parents in the Austrian Alps. City . banker Kevin Bespolka, 51, and the two boys, from Winchester in . Hampshire, were skiing off-piste with an experienced guide when the . avalanche struck. The . torrent of snow swept Mr Bespolka, Cameron and the guide 500ft down the . mountain, leaving other triplet Nicholas watching helplessly at the top, . police said. Nicholas is understood to have joined the ski guide, who managed to free himself, in frantically searching for the others. After . a few minutes, Mr Bespolka, a former executive of American banking . giant Merrill Lynch, was pulled from the snow, seriously injured but . alive. However, rescuers were unable to save Cameron, who was declared dead at the scene. Officers said the guide was now under investigation for negligence. The . upmarket resort, Lech am Arlberg, is the same place where Dutch Prince . Friso was buried in an avalanche while skiing off-piste. He died this . year after being in a coma for a year and a half. The . latest tragedy happened on Tuesday at 1.25pm, when the rest of the . family – Corrine Bespolka, 53, and the boys’ triplet sister – are . thought to have been at their hotel. The Bespolkas also have a . 12-year-old daughter Sienna who is believed to have been with them on . the week-long holiday. Last . night Mr Bespolka was in intensive care with knee and lung injuries, . while surviving son Nicholas was being checked for trauma by a . psychologist. Mrs . Bespolka and her daughters were understood to be having treatment for . shock and were visited by a priest, according to local reports. The . family live in a detached seven-bedroom mansion in Winchester. The . £1.7million white building sits at the top of a hill on a private road . with views overlooking the historic city. Cameron . had been a student at The Pilgrims’ School in Winchester, an . independent boys’ preparatory school, costing £5,500 a term. Last night shocked neighbours said the accident was a ‘tragedy’ and one added: ‘They are a lovely family, it is just awful.’ Fatal: The slope in Lech where the family was hit by a torrent of falling snow . She described Cameron, who was a keen photographer and birdwatcher, as a ‘lovely, happy boy’. Another . female neighbour said: ‘It is such a shame to have lost Cameron. I . cannot imagine what as a family they are going through right now. ‘The . news is devastating. They were all very close and one thing they share . is being very keen skiers. They would often go away as a family like . this.’ The Bespolkas . also have a holiday home in Vero Beach, Florida, where a neighbour said: . ‘They come here a couple of times a year during the school holidays. ‘They . are a lovely family and it’s always a pleasure to see the children … It . is absolutely tragic what has happened. Kevin and his wife lived for . the children.’ Resort: The accident took place in the upmarket resort of Lech am Arlberg . Susanne Dilp, of the Austrian . police, said: ‘The father is severely injured. He was trapped under the . avalanche. The rescuers found him and pulled him out but he was badly . injured. The surviving son is physically unharmed but is obviously in . shock. It will take time to interview him about what happened.’ A . spokesman at the hospital, in the nearby town of Feldkirch, said of Mr . Bespolka: ‘At the moment, he still is in intensive care but he is no . longer in critical condition. He is stable but still in observation at . the intensive care unit. He has knee and lung injuries. ‘An English-speaking psychologist is taking care of the other 16-year-old son.’ According . to police all members of the group were equipped with an avalanche . airbag, a probe, shovel and avalanche transceiver – which emits signals . allowing trapped skiers to be found under the snow. Despite managing to trigger his airbag, Mr Bespolka was completely submerged, police said. Perilous: The accident happened at the same resort where Dutch Prince Johan Friso (pictured, above, with his daughter Zaria) suffered fatal injuries in an avalanche . The group was in an area called . Bereich Madloch, heading towards Richtung Stierloch. Although . off-piste, the route is not prohibited. The . unnamed guide was swept ahead of the deadly wall of ice and snow and . immediately made an emergency call. Mountain rescue officers, two . trained avalanche dogs and three helicopters were sent to help. Police said investigating the possibility of negligence was ‘normal procedure after an avalanche when a ski guide is present’. The . region had issued a category one avalanche alert, a very low risk, at . the time. But Austrian journalist Matthias Loinig said: ‘There were . really strong winds  that were blowing the snow around and... piled it . up on the icy gully higher up.’","Cameron Bespolka, 16, was killed in Lech am Arlberg by a torrent of snow .

This is the first picture of the man who shot his ‘childhood sweetheart’ leaving her in a critical condition hours after the family returned from a Boxing Day shooting trip.

He said they were . ‘really not the argumentative type’. ‘It’s a massive shock,’ he added. ‘They were a lovely couple, I have no idea what’s behind it.’ However, neighbour Karen Taylor, 40, . said she had seen the ‘usually very quiet’ Mr White walk home from the . same pub earlier in the afternoon on Boxing Day looking drunk and . ‘wobbly’. A police spokesman confirmed yesterday that the road worker and Manchester United fan was a licensed shotgun holder. A Land Rover, which was parked outside the house yesterday, had a British Association for Shooting sticker in the back window. As a keen game shooter he reportedly had several guns, and regularly enjoyed shooting trips with Miss Cockrell’s father Gerald, known as Gez. Friend Tiffany Carmichael, 25, who works in the local fish and chip shop, said the couple were ‘childhood sweethearts’. Hunter: A Land Rover with a British Association for Shooting sticker in the back window was parked outside the house yesterday . Confiscated: It was towed away after the incident on Boxing Day . ‘They’d been going out since school and been together all their adult lives,’ she said. ‘They aren’t known as a couple who row a lot.

She is a lovely, lovely lass.’ Miss Cockrell, who drives a Range Rover and works as a mobile hairdresser, a business she is believed to run with her mother, was described by friends as ‘bubbly’. Another neighbour added: ‘This is going to devastate the whole community. The people are very close here. It is an old mining community. When you need people they are there for you.’ Mr Cockrell and his wife Julie, live in a house directly opposite the scene of the tragedy. Police cordon: Officers are investigating after a man was found dead and a woman with serious injuries in Bircotes, Nottinghamshire, today . There was no answer at the property yesterday, and it is thought the couple were at their daughter’s bedside. Mr Cockrell was a former miner who was forced to give up work after he lost an eye in a pit accident. Miss Cockrell’s uncle said last night: ‘It’s very tragic and terrible for the children. We are a close-knit family and this is going to hit us hard. ‘Shani and Paul seemed like a great couple. They were devoted to their kids so something awful must have happened for this to happen, but I have no idea what. ‘Paul was very into shooting in the countryside and it was well known he had a gun.’ A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police yesterday confirmed they had found a man’s body at the property. He said the children were unharmed and ‘safely removed’. A cordon remained in place at the scene last night while the investigation continued.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . New installation: The Tate Modern (pictured) in London has purchased a cluster of Scottish sheep droppings strung across wire for £16,000 . A cluster of Scottish sheep droppings strung across wire is one of the art works among a collection the Tate Modern purchased for more than £200,000 from a Mexican artist. The gallery bought the £16,000 installation entitled ‘S**t Models ‘ along with 17 other works by artist Abraham Cruzvillegas. The taxpayer funded gallery in London describes the 2008 creation on its website as ‘sheep excrement, dung, plaster, cardboard, steel and wood’. Mr Cruzvillega admitted he used discarded items he found on the street or in fields for his works when he spent six months in Scotland creating his exhibition; Autoconstruction. The 45-year-old told a contemporary art magazine that he used ‘wool, sheep shit, chicken wire, discarded furniture, cardboard, stones, grass and my own hair’ to make the installations. ‘They are unplanned assemblages, made to test new dialogues between odd and contradictory objects and prime matter,’ the artist explained. S**t Models appears to be made from a discarded bird table on top of which upright metal wires have been placed with lumps of sheep excrement hung on top. His collection also includes ‘Blind in Self Portrait’ which consists of scores of scraps of paper he came by in Scotland, such as leaflets, ferry tickets and receipts which he painted red. According to a report, the cost of the installations was revealed in a document showing all the artworks bought by the Tate, which is Britain’s national gallery, in the past year. Expensive purchases: The Tate, which is run by Sir Nicolas Serota (pictured), also spent £2,100 from a Government grant to buy a piece from artist Ed Herring which consisted of an old plastic card-index file . Mr Cruzvillegas’s work was bought with funds given to the Tate, which with almost 5million visitors a year is the most visited modern art gallery in the world, by wealthy benefactors. A further £229,000 was spent on a piece by Cuban Felix Gonzalez-Torres which featured two light bulbs, light sockets and cable. The Tate, which is run by Sir Nicolas Serota, also spent £2,100 from a Government grant to buy a piece from artist Ed Herring which consisted of an old plastic card-index file. Charles Thomson, of Stuckists, which promotes traditional art, told the Sunday Express: ‘If this stuff was auctioned on eBay it would sell for a fiver. ‘The Tate’s meant to be the national collection of modern art. It’s more like the national junk shop.’ However, The Tate defended its decisions saying: ‘We are pleased to acquire works by these artists using funds raised by Tate.’ Mr Cruzvillegas’s collection is currently on loan to the Haus der Kunst gallery in Munich, Germany.","London's Tate Modern bought installation entitled 'S**t Models' for £16,000 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Inderdeep Bains . Boasts: One of the last images of Ifthekar Jaman, who died while fighting with al-Qaeda in Syria . A young British man who boasted of fighting ‘5-star jihad’ in Syria has been killed, his family has revealed. Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died at the weekend in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his Hampshire home. He was one of an estimated 350 British men to have taken up arms with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria – where they are known as British Kataa’ib, meaning British Brigade. Speaking a month ago, Jaman declared he was ready to die as a martyr, vowing: ‘I don’t plan to come back. Life is for the hereafter... it’s an eternal paradise so the sacrifice is small.’ He also urged fellow Britons to join him, using his Twitter account to glory in his hate-filled missions. He described fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature. Recent photographs show Jaman – a supporter of fanatical British cleric Anjem Choudary – apparently manning armed checkpoints in the Middle Eastern war zone. Yesterday his parents were too upset to speak at their £190,000 three-bedroom terrace house in Southsea, but his younger brother Mustakim Jaman confirmed he had died on Saturday night and that his distraught family had been informed on Sunday. He said: ‘We are in complete shock. We need time to process this, it is a lot for us to take in.’ Jaman, was who born in Portsmouth and attended local schools, left the UK earlier this year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey, but he slipped across the border to Syria on May 14.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A man told a woman ‘I’ve come to rape you’ after smashing down her front door in revenge because she had helped to convict him of burglary four years earlier. Weeks after his three-and-a-half-year sentence for the break-in ended, Ashley Mills broke into his victim’s house and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint. Speaking yesterday, she said she feared she would die in the ‘brutal and prolonged’ two-hour attack by homeless Mills, 28, who had burgled her home in 2009 after she took pity on him and let him camp on her land. Career criminal: Ashley Mills, 28, has been jailed after he broke into Linda's home with an iron bar, grabbed a carving knife and told her: 'I've come to rape you' in a revenge sex attack . Linda, 59, who has waived her right to . anonymity but not revealed her surname, said: ‘It was obvious he had . been determined to get me. It was blatant revenge.’ Mills . was jailed for 18 years at Portsmouth Crown Court last month after . admitting three counts of rape, an attempted rape and one count of . trespass with intent to commit a sex offence. At . her isolated £350,000 home in a village just outside Portsmouth . yesterday, Linda said: ‘I live off the beaten track and he came all the . way out here to find me because he was so angry. Terrifying: Linda, holding part of damaged property, has spoken of her torment following the brutal and 'prolonged' attack after Mills was released from prison . ‘He asked if I recognised him and denied ever burgling me. ‘I . thought he was going to kill me. I was convinced that, as he had . smashed in my front door to get me, he could completely cross the line . and kill me so he wouldn’t leave a witness who could identify him.’ Mills had first approached his victim when she let him camp in her garden four years earlier. She . said: ‘This fella came up on a bicycle with a tent. He gave his name, . shook hands with me. He wanted somewhere to camp for two weeks. I . thought it was a lad living in the countryside. ‘He . camped here for a couple of days, then he got in through the front door . and burgled me. That was Ashley Mills. It’s scary how this can happen . when I was just trying to help someone. ‘I saw that he needed somewhere to camp and said he could pitch up in my garden, I had no idea how dangerous he was.’ After . being jailed in February 2010 for breaking into Linda’s home and . committing arson at a church, Mills was released on May 15 this year . having served his full sentence. Within weeks, he returned to Linda’s home. She . first saw him after he tapped on her window and asked for a glass of . water. Frightened, she refused and rang her neighbours, who alerted . police. But on June 29, he returned and carried out the horrific revenge attack. Linda . said: ‘I was asleep in bed and I heard this terrible crashing and . banging. I opened my bedroom door and there he was in my hallway with an . iron bar. ‘He had smashed . his way right through the front door. He promptly head-butted me. He . said, “I’m not going. I’ve come to rape you”.’ Linda, who lives alone, said: ‘I tried to run out of the house. He went to the kitchen and came out with a carving knife.’ When . she tried to grab the knife he got angry and threatened to use it. ‘I . just had to submit and he did what he wanted,’ she said. Brave: Linda, 59, has waived her right to anonymity to ensure the full story about what Ashley Mills did to her is told . Ordeal: Linda took pity on homeless Mills and kindly let him pitch his tent in her garden but after that he turned her life into a living nightmare . ‘I thought he was going to kill me. I just wanted to keep on his good side. I’m not brave.’ After the attack, brazen Mills asked for a glass of water and sat in an armchair to drink it. She said: ‘He just sat there like nothing happened and made small talk.’ Realising that he had dropped the knife and iron bar, she kicked the blade under the cooker and dropped the bar behind a sofa. Police . praised her ‘great courage’ and quick-thinking and say this evidence . helped to convict him. When he finally left, Linda hid in the garage, . too scared to go back inside and dial 999. She said: ‘I didn’t think I was going to get out of it alive as he knows I can identify him. ‘I thought if I came back into the house to ring the police he might come back and kill me.’ She eventually ran to a neighbour who called the police. Linda . now plans to move out of the home she has lived in since she was 15. In . a statement read in court, she said: ‘Since Mills came and attacked me, . I feel I can’t live here now. ‘I was terrified of being stabbed and how painful it would be. ‘I did survive when I thought I was going to be killed in a horrible manner. ‘Sometimes when victims are killed, I think they are the lucky ones. They don’t keep reliving the horror of it all. ‘The . survivors have to live with this for the rest of their lives. I’m . grateful to be alive, but now have all the life-changing problems I’m . now facing. ‘I’ll never forget it, and the disgusting things he did to me. It fills me with horror.’ Trial: A judge sentenced Mills to 18 years in prison Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) for the revenge attack on June 29 .","Ashley Mills broke into victim's .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A pensioner who ran down her violent husband in a Nissan Micra after suffering years of domestic abuse has avoided jail after a judge heard that the troubled couple still love each other. Sally Stickland, 72, could have killed her husband of 50 years when she ploughed into him as he walked along a country lane. She then drove home, leaving 73-year-old John, the father of her three children, lying motionless and seriously injured on a grass verge where he was discovered by passers-by. Sally Strickland, 72, right, was spared an immediate prison sentence despite deliberately running over her husband John, left, after a court heard they still 'loved each other deeply' Judge Gary Burrell said ‘battered wife . syndrome’ caused by years of violence may have led Stickland to commit . the ‘dreadful incident’. Despite their troubled relationship, . however, the couple showed a united front in court where they claimed . they planned to stay together. The judge described how Stickland had . used her car as ‘a weapon’ when she crossed to the other side of the . road and hit her husband from behind. He was ‘lucky’ to have survived. She returned to the scene only after the emergency services called to . say her husband had been hurt in a hit and run. She was heard saying; ‘Do I have to go with him?’ as paramedics put her husband into an ambulance. Lucky: Judge Gary Burrell, sitting at Southampton Crown Court, said Mr Stickland was lucky not to have been killed after his wife crossed from the other side of the road in her silver Nissan Micra and hit him . Neighbours . of the couple spotted the silver car, its windscreen damaged, parked at . a strange angle outside their £450,000 detached home in Langley, . Hampshire, and grew suspicious. Police seized the vehicle and arrested Stickland later that day, May 18. She was charged with attempted murder, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing. At . her sentencing on Monday her husband, who suffered fractures to his . cheekbone, back and neck and a cut to his forehead, declared his love . for her. Speaking at Southampton Crown Court, in front of a public . gallery packed with family and friends, he said he has made a full . recovery. Mr Stickland added: ‘I love my wife and care for her very . much.’ He said he did not want her to be kept away from him any longer – . she has been ordered to stay away from the marital home since the . incident. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told how Stickland was driving on . the eastbound side of the road before crossing to the other side. ‘It appears that his (Mr Stickland’s) head was in contact with the windscreen, resulting in damage to the windscreen,’ he said. 'The family remain united. Mr and Mrs Stickland still love each other deeply' Statement from Stickland family . ‘Mr . Stickland would have been unaware of the approach of  the car behind . him. At no stage did Mrs Stickland alert police to say she had been . involved in any sort of accident.’ Judge Burrell sentenced Stickland to . 18 months in prison, suspended  for two years. He told her: ‘There is . a very unusual background to this dreadful incident. You suffer from . post-traumatic stress syndrome and battered person’s syndrome. ‘Although . you and Mr Stickland have been married for 50 years and have three . children, what seems clear is that for a period of the relationship it . was marred by violence, mainly on his part. ‘You previously sought . help from domestic abuse services. As a result of that your emotional . wellbeing suffered and so did your mental health.’ Judge Burrell . made reference to an assault in 2004, when  Mrs Stickland was kicked in . the head by her husband, and  a 2011 attack, when he held her by the . throat until she began  to lose consciousness. The court heard that she . occasionally retaliated. The emotional couple embraced after hearing Stickland had avoided an immediate jail term, and left the building together. Solicitor . Janet Brownlow, reading a family statement outside court, said: ‘The . entire family have found the last few months very difficult and are . still coming to terms with the traumatic circumstances surrounding the . incident and everything that has followed. ‘The family remain united. Mr and Mrs Stickland still love each other deeply and they understand . the reasoning behind the judge’s sentencing. ‘The family wish to start to put all of this behind them and look forward to the future.’ Stickland also received a two-year residence order saying that she must live with her son and a 24-month supervision order.","Sally Stickland, 72, drove into the back of husband John, 73 .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . A top student died from a brain tumour after being sent home four times by a GP who dismissed her severe headaches as migraines caused by exam stress. Lucy Goulding, 16, told her mother ‘I can’t take it any more. I just want to die’ after being turned away by her doctor for the final time. Just hours later she collapsed and she died the following day in hospital, an inquest heard. The teenager died without knowing her fellow students had voted for her to be crowned prom queen at a school event which was cancelled after her death. Lucy Goulding, 16, died of an undiagnosed brain tumour after her GP sent her away four times saying she was suffering from migraines caused by stress . She also died without learning that she had gained eight A grades at GCSE which would have seen her placed in the top ten students at Chatsmore Catholic High School, in Worthing, West Sussex. Her tearful mother Antonella Goulding, 44, recalled how Lucy was repeatedly sent home by Dr Jaspal Mahil in the weeks leading up to her death on June 27, this year, despite complaining of headaches, vomiting and dizziness. The inquest heard how the doctor had told the bright schoolgirl that ‘there was not enough evidence of a tumour’ after her mother begged for an MRI scan just days before she died. Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said that medical staff who came into contact with Lucy had failed to take her symptoms seriously. She said that ‘everyone was closed to anything but the psychological cause of Lucy’s symptoms’ and that had the tumour been detected earlier it was ‘high unlikely’ that she would have died. On May 28, Lucy had first seen Dr Mahil with headaches and she saw her again on June 11, June 24 and June 25. Lucy died without knowing her classmates had voted for her to be crowned prom queen and without knowing that she achieved eight As in her GCSEs . Her mother asked Dr Mahil for an MRI scan on her fourth visit but was told ‘there was not enough evidence of a tumour’ to have one. Dr Mahil told the inquest: ‘After looking at her history and examining her, my findings were that it was a migraine. ‘She had finished her exams and I also thought it might be related to caffeine withdrawal or dietary.’ She added: ‘Knowing what I know now it (the tumour) probably does all fit in. ‘I’m sorry to all of Lucy’s family.’ On June 26 Mrs Goulding described her condition as screaming with pain, very weak and complaining of headaches. The mother of two added: ‘I couldn’t help her so I called paramedics. An inquest heard that Lucy might not have died if she had been diagnosed and had surgery sooner . ‘They asked if she had any dietary issues so I told her that she had bulimia a year before but she was fine now. ‘I asked them to watch her as her headaches weren’t normal.’ The teenager was taken to Worthing Hospital where the staff wanted to discharge her to the community mental health team. But Mrs Goulding insisted that she was admitted for more tests on her headaches. Later . that evening Lucy had a seizure and was rushed by ambulance to . Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire which specialises in . neurosurgery. Dr Jaspal Mahil told the inquest into Lucy's death that she believed the teenager was suffering from migraines . Mrs Goulding said: ‘The staff seemed to see her in pain but didn’t react. They weren’t seeing her. ‘She lay on my shoulder and said: “I can’t take it any more. I just want to die”. ‘I said “no you don’t, once they find out what’s wrong with you, you will be fine”. ‘I was holding her hand as the doctors and nurses arrived.’ ‘They took her for a scan and then I was told she had a mass on her brain which was a possible tumour.’ Consultant on the ward Dr Mwape Kabole, admitted that there had been no neurological monitoring or observations, nor had Lucy been seen by a consultant, once she had been admitted to the paediatric ward. Dr Abir Chakraborty, a consultant at the hospital told the inquest in Worthing, the ‘slow growing’ brain tumour was in the back of her brain and had grown to a ‘considerable’ size. He said: ‘We took the tumour out completely but the swelling was so big we couldn’t put the bone or skin back. ‘When she slipped into coma that is when she effectively died. ‘If she came across earlier to have surgery the outcome may have been different.’ Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Karen Henderson said: ‘What strikes me about the evidence today is that no one believed Lucy or Mrs Goulding at any time from her admission to the point of her death. ‘Everyone was closed to anything but the psychological cause of Lucy’s symptoms.’ After the inquest, Mrs Goulding said that she wanted the tragedy to change the way the NHS cared for children. Recording a narrative verdict at the inquest at Worthing's Centenary House, assistant coroner Karen Henderson said: 'What strikes me about the evidence is that no one believed Lucy or Mrs Goulding at any time' She said: 'It is a sad disgrace that with the education and the tools available today, Lucy's symptoms were not recognised which resulted in Lucy's death. 'I have trusted both the GP and the health professionals at the hospital and I have let my Lucy die. 'I can't undo my error. Nothing and nobody can give Lucy her precious life back. 'You can't undo your errors, but you can and must ensure that the same doesn't happen again costing another special young life.' In a statement from Western Sussex Hospitals Trust, Dr Tim Taylor, Consultant Paediatrician and Chief of Service for Women and Children, said: 'We deeply regret what happened to Lucy and the failings in her care and offer our sincere apologies to her family.' 'We have carried out a full investigation, which has been externally scrutinised and made changes as a result.' He said all paediatric patients are now see by a consultant at the beginning of the day followed by two reviews in the evening and night.’","Lucy Goulding visited Dr Jaspal Mahil four times with nausea, dizziness and headaches but was told her symptoms were caused by migraines .

"By . Aaron Sharp . and Inderdeep Bains . It must have seemed like the perfect place for a catnap. But when Phoenix the kitten chose to snuggle down among the damp bedding in a tumble dryer, his decision nearly proved fatal. Deryn De Temple had no idea that her daughter Elfie’s black cat was in the machine and switched it on. Survivor: Elfie De Temple, 17, and 7-month-old Phoenix the cat who lived after the 20 minute ordeal . The . seven-month-old pet found himself trapped inside for 20 minutes as it . revolved at high temperatures  – until Mrs De Temple opened the door he . tumbled out. Phoenix was close to death when he was rushed to a vets last week but was allowed home just six days later after making a 'miraculous' recovery. The house-cat suffered mild burns to most of his body and had ten times the normal amount of potassium in his blood, an effect of the extreme heat exposure during the spin cycle. Alive and kicking: Phoenix had climbed into the drum, which was full of dog bedding waiting to be dried . Owner Elfie De Temple, 17, of Arundel, West Sussex, said: 'When he came out of the dryer he looked like he had inhaled nerve gas - he was convulsing and spasming. 'I feel terrible. I think Phoenix has forgiven me though - he gave me a cuddle last night I'll never be able to forgive myself.' After Phoenix was found Elfie's step-dad, Ron Cole, 58, researched what to do online, and discovered they should slowly try and lower his body temperature with cold water. Deryn, 52, said: 'We did that for a few minutes and then rushed him to the vet. He barely looked alive at all, we were all so scared. 'The vets were fantastic. They put him on a drip and told us that the first few hours were the most crucial. Luckily he survived the night, and the next day he got a bit stronger. 'That happened for a few days, and on the sixth day, he was strong enough to be allowed home. He's still a bit poorly, but he seems to be getting back to normal. 'He walked up to the dryer, meowed loudly at it and then scampered off, so I think he's told the machine who's boss.' Ron added: 'His kidneys shut down and he was unable to feed himself. 'He got so hot that his red blood cells started rupturing and he was unable to regulate his own body temperature. 'His recovery was miraculous. It was a real miracle - he went through hot hell and came out the other side.' Phoenix was close to death when he arrived at the vet, but he made a full recovery from his burns in six days . Vet Annette Moyart said: 'We were at the point of putting him to sleep when he came in. We had to pull out all the stops to save him. 'Cats like crawling inside dark places, like piles of clothes, tumble dryers or even ovens, and if they are hiding, they won't purr when disturbed. 'It's always best for cat owners to just give a quick check to make sure their pet isn't inside any household appliance before turning them on.'","Phoenix the cat sneaked up to the open drum and climbed inside .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . and Andy Dolan . Loss: Andrew Kirkman, a student at Balliol College, Oxford, gassed himself in a tent hours after breaking up for Christmas . An Oxford student gassed himself in a tent hours after breaking up for Christmas. Andrew Kirkman, who was in his second year at Balliol, was found dead by a walker who spotted his tent in a meadow on the edge of the city. It is thought the talented physics and philosophy student killed himself with chemicals. The discovery of his body led to a major chemical alert with six people being treated for exposure to dangerous fumes. Last night a friend said the 20-year-old had told her only a few weeks ago that he had been going through a ‘rough time’. ‘I messaged Andrew on Facebook a few weeks ago and asked how he was getting on at Oxford,’ Danielle Bethel said. ‘He replied that he was having a rough time. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but he didn’t reply.’ The tearful 19-year-old student, from Watford, added: ‘He had a brilliant mind and so much potential to do something amazing. ‘I can’t believe he has gone. He was just incredibly smart.’ Mr Kirkman, who went to Rickmansworth School in Hertfordshire and had a brother called George, had discussed exam worries on Twitter in May. In one post, on May 31, he told a friend: ‘I feel ok but there’s a very real chance I’ll fail all of mine.’ Other worried tweets followed. Last night his parents, who live in a £1million detached house in Northwood, north-west London, paid tribute to a ‘friendly and thoughtful’ young man. In a statement released through the university, Wendy and Michael said: ‘Andy was loved by everyone who knew him. He was a kind young man who took great pleasure in helping other people. He will be sorely missed.’ Sara Lomax, who studied physics with Mr Kirkman at A-level, said she was almost certain he would not have committed suicide. ‘He was a quiet lad but happy within himself,’ she added. ‘He was never a depressive sort. He was just so bright – he knew he had a good life ahead of him. He didn’t care what others thought of him. ‘Andrew was so, so passionate about physics that it wouldn’t surprise me if he was conducting an experiment with some chemicals. It may be something just got out of hand and he didn’t quite have the knowledge to save himself.’ Abigail Miles, 19, who was a school prefect with Mr Kirkman, said: ‘He was really good at physics – he was clever at everything.’ Officials from the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Team were drafted in after strong chemical odours were detected coming from the tent. Within an hour all of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began their examinations. Mr Kirkman was pronounced dead at the scene on Sunday and the six fume victims were taken  to hospital.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . and Ray Massey . Football coach Justin Byrne has upset some parents but say he 'only interested in winning' When the village boys’ team appointed a new manager, they were not expecting a boss with the fervour of a Jose Mourinho or a Sir Alex Ferguson. So parents of the under-10s side were aghast when coach Justin Byrne outlined his win-at-all-costs philosophy. Mr Byrne insisted he was not there so the boys could have fun playing football – he was ‘only interested in winning’. He said parents who complained when their boy did not make the first team were ‘not doing their sons any favours’. Those who opposed him were ‘weak-minded’ and ‘think sport is about knitting’. The volunteer coach outlined his forthright views in an email to parents at Chalfont St Peter’s Football Club in Buckinghamshire. Four days later, despite his team’s success on the pitch, he suffered a fate familiar to many a Premier League boss... he was fired. In his email, the 42-year-old company director, who had coached the under 10s for more than two years, told parents: ‘I am only interested in winning. I don’t care about equal play time or any other communist view of sport. 'Those that are not as good need to work harder or demonstrate more during training, or change sports.’ Father-of three Mr Byrne, who runs London-based recruitment firm Certus Sales, added: ‘You are not doing your son any favours by suggesting the world is fair or non-competitive. 'Everything they are likely to do in life will be competitive so my view is get them used to it.’ However, Australian-born Mr Byrne, who lives in a £1.2million seven-bedroom house in Gerrards Cross, admitted that his son would be picked for the under-10s’ more successful A team whether or not he was good enough. Frank: Mr Byrne's philosophy was 'win at all costs' despite him managing an under 10s team (file picture) He said: ‘The only reason I am coaching is for him to be able to play.’ Mr Byrne claimed the club’s rules prevented him from moving players freely between the more successful A team – which lost only twice last season – and the less successful B team. He is considering taking legal action against the club, but said yesterday of his email: ‘I didn’t say it in the most PC of ways. 'I call a spade a spade and everyone knows I don’t like to dress things up. ‘That’s just me. The fact is that we have got a weaker-minded group of individuals who think sport is about knitting.’ He claimed that many parents were told about the sacking before he was, and that the club had not given him the right of reply or opportunity to defend himself before making its decision. He says he was told to stay away from matches but refused, adding: ‘A lot of parents have contacted me to express their support.’ A club spokesman said Mr Byrne had been sacked after complaints from parents about his email, which went against the club’s ethos. ‘This is a friendly village football club that just wants to get as many children playing football as possible, and make sure they have fun doing it,’ he said. ‘Everyone enjoys winning, but not at the expense of leaving kids disappointed, upset and disillusioned with sport.’","Justin Byrne coached Chalfont St Peter's Football Club, Buckinghamshire .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Tracey Emin's controversial My Bed artwork has sold for £2.2million to an anonymous buyer at Christie's in London on Tuesday night. Before the auction, Emin said that she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the UK - but that she doubted this would be possible as there would be no-one who could afford it. Turner Prize shortlisted My Bed is a dishevelled monument to 'ladette' culture, surrounded by used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles. Scroll down for video . 'Iconic': Emin said My Bed, which nearly won the Turner Prize, 'changed people's perceptions of art' Popular: The bed, pictured on display in 2003, is currently owned by Charles Saatchi which could make £1.2m from the sale . It had been put up for auction by . millionaire Charles Saatchi, and had been expected to net him between . £800,000 and £1.2million. Emin was in the packed auction room as the work was sold, to applause from the crowd. Saatchi, . who paid £150,000 in 2000 for My Bed, one of the key works of the Young . British Artist movement, sold it to support the work of the Saatchi . Gallery Foundation. Ahead of the sale, Emin, 50, said she would prefer the work go on display rather than vanish into a private collection, but doubted anywhere could produce the necessary cash. She told the Evening Standard: 'I feel kind of philosophical about it. The Tate really want it but they haven’t any money. No one has any money to buy it.' Pricey: Emin revealed that she doubts any UK galleries will be prepared to pay between £800,000 and £1.2million for the piece . Last week, she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she's near the bed, the display of which she said 'changed people's perceptions of art'. She said: 'This is a surreal . experience. Every time I'm near the bed or install the bed I get . flashbacks and recollections of when I first saw the bed, which was in . my bedroom and that was 16 years ago. 'When . I made the bed today, I actually had to get in it and pull the duvet . over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real. 'Even . the smell and everything, it's all still there for me. It's very, very . evocative. Except it's like waking up, I wouldn't say a nightmare, but . definitely ... it's really strange. 'It's now going on a different journey. I just hope it goes to a nice place. It's helped me a lot.' Emin said reactions to the artwork, which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown, varied across the globe. Up close: A close up of Tracey Emin's piece 'My Bed' which features cigarettes and used condoms . She said: 'In Japan they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms'. 'In America it was like, ""Yeah, we've seen feminist art before, we've done it already"", no fuss, just treated it like a regular artwork. 'Of course in the UK, it just exploded with the Turner Prize. It just went crazy. I still think it's iconic. There was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this, that has ever been like this, it's seminal. 'It changed people's perceptions of what art is and what art can be. That's why it's still really special to me. 'If I could I would show this at my next exhibition. I still love it, I still stand by it and I made it 16 years ago.'","My Bed features condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A man whose pregnant partner was killed by their two pit bull-type dogs has walked free from court. Lee Horner, 34, could have been jailed for his illegal dogs’ brutal attack – but was given a community order instead because of the emotional distress of losing his partner. The dogs – named Bella and Dollar - killed 27-year-old Emma Bennett while she was pregnant with her fifth child. Freed: Lee Horner, left, was given a community order and a dog owning ban rather than a custodial sentence because he felt remorse that his illegal dogs killed his pregnant girlfriend Emma Bennet, right . Horner was out at the time, but a neighbour heard Miss Bennett shouting and called police. Officers arrived at the house in Leeds to find the dogs with bloodied snouts, and their victim with severe head and shoulder injuries. Horner admitted breaking the Dangerous Dogs Act by owning the pets, and was sentenced today at Leeds Magistrates’ Court. He was given a community order and 280 hours unpaid work on account of his remorse. He was also banned from keeping dogs for life. Relatives of Miss Bennett say they wish he had been given a custodial sentence. Her brother David Garside said: ‘I’m no graduate of law but I would have at least liked to have seen him sentenced to some time behind bars. ‘I’m worried the authorities won’t be able to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn’t have dogs.’ Deputy District Judge Tim Spruce made clear the case ‘crossed the custody threshold’ but said he felt it was not appropriate to jail him given the personal loss he had suffered. When Horner appeared before magistrates last month, prosecutors described how Horner was out when police arrived at the house he shared with Miss Bennett in Dawlish Avenue after being alerted by neighbours who heard a noise they first thought was an argument. Miss Bennett was heard to shout: ‘No, no, no.’ Banned: Experts confirmed the two dogs, Bella and Dollar, were illegal pitbull-type animals (file photo) The two officers went inside after getting no response and found the two dogs acting excitably with blood on their snouts. They tried to resuscitate Miss Bennett, who had suffered severe injuries to her face and head, but she did not survive. Prosecutor Vincent O’Malley told the court how two women social workers visited the house in July last year and Horner told one of them: 'Shut it or I’ll set the dog on you.' He said that Horner told the other social worker, who was eight months pregnant at the time: 'What you looking at? Wait until I get the dog and see if you continue looking at me like that.' Sentencing today, Mr Spruce said the legislation was designed to protect the public from certain breeds 'because these animals are inclined to be unpredictable in nature and often with devastating consequences'. The district judge said: 'That unpredictability, those consequences could not be more solemnly illustrated than in the unique and tragic circumstances of the case before the court today. 'Two dogs with no previous recorded history of difficulty, danger or harm have set up their owner in circumstances which may never be entirely clear.' Mr Spruce said: 'This was a truly shocking, tragic and disturbing episode.' He told Horner: 'No sentence this court can impose could possibly compensate or make good or recompense for the loss of a beloved granddaughter, sister, daughter and mother.' The district judge said he was satisfied the defendant did not know the dogs were banned . but also that he made no effort to find out. He said he was 'ambivalent' to the possibility of the risk they posed. 'Those risks are now catastrophically obvious,' Mr Spruce said. He told Horner: 'The devastating consequences of your decision making, Mr Horner, are something you will have to live with for the rest of your life.' Mr Spruce banned Horner from keeping dogs for life. He ordered him to pay £500 towards the destruction of the two dogs and their housing since the incident. He will also have to pay £240 in prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Horner left court without comment, referring all questions to his solicitor.","Lee Horner, 34, owned illegal dogs which mauled his girlfriend to death .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The perfectly-preserved remains of a sandwich have been found inside a church organ 118 years after being left there by workmen. Slices of crusty bread were found wrapped in a paper bag, which was sealed within the instrument when it was built in 1896. The meal - thought to have been eaten with cheese by workers on their lunch break - was only found when the organ was being dismantled to be sold for parts. Still good? The slices of bread were found inside a church organ in Burnley - where they had been for 118 years . Accompaniment: The bread was found alongside crinkled pages of the Stockport Advertiser from 1896 . Church organist Kath Yates found the bread alongside a copy of a local newspaper dated to 1896 as the instrument was being taken apart in Padiham Road Methodist Church in Burnley, Lancashire. The package was preserved in the inner workings of the organ, within a soundproofed area sealed with wood, which also seems to have protected the meal from the elements. It was stashed away with pages from the Stockport Advertiser, the newspaper from the area where the organ was built. Her husband Peter Yates, the church property steward said: 'The bread has been perfectly preserved. It must have been the remains of a lunch for the organ-fitters who I imagine sat down for a butty break. 'I can just picture them sat reading the paper with their sandwich and perhaps a large hunk of cheese. They were found in the swell box of the organ when we took the inner layer out. Find: The organ had stood in the Padiham Road Methodist Church in Burnley, Lancashire, for decades . Remains: The organ, built in 1896, was sold for parts to German buyers - pictured is what remains of it today . Old-time religion: The above picture shows the organ as it would have been during the church's heyday . 'It was full of wooden shavings which gave out a beautiful smell of pine alongside this wonderful snapshot of history.' Parts for the two manual mechanical action pipe organ had been sold on eBay to bidders in Germany for £1,700. The organ, which Mrs Yates played for more than 30 years, originally belonged to the former Claremont Methodist Church, also in Burnley, but was brought over when the two churches merged. The instrument was sold to fund redevelopment work at the church. Mr Yates added: 'The organ was a wonderful piece of workmanship and it will be missed but we have to move on. Innards: The remnants were found inside the organ in a part sealed by thick wood to make it soundproof . 'We hope to display the newspaper cuttings but we suspect that the bread will perish now its been removed from inside the organ.' 'Inside part of the organ there's a huge empty box which is like a huge void. It has to be completely sealed to stop the sound from leaking out so it's covered by what I call Victorian plywood, which is like a thin skin of wood. 'This is how the sandwich has been so well preserved - it's been protected from the elements. It really was an amazing find. After the discovery, the organ was dismantled and transported to Germany, where its interior and pipework will be re-installed in a church near Munich.","Slices of bread were stashed away by workmen in 1896 with a newspaper .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A kitten cruelly dumped into a bottle bank escaped with his life after miaowing so loudly that passers-by rescued him. Nine-week-old Archer was left to die surrounded by discarded glass at a recycling centre in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The tiny animal was just hours from death, but managed to make enough noise that he was noticed and free. Rescued: Archer, pictured, was abandoned in a bottle bank but made enough noise that he was rescued . Dumped: Archer was eventually rescued from the bottle bank in Harrogate, North Yorkshire . Rescued: After the RSPCA was called in they were able to pluck starving Archer from the bin . Archer - named after Archers schnapps because he was found surrounded by alcohol bottles - was taken in by the RSPCA and is now being looked after by volunteers. Harrogate's RSPCA branch manager, Nicola Outhwaite, said: 'Thank God he has got such a loud voice for a little thing. It most certainly saved his life.' Archer now lives with 'foster owners' Dave and Alex Lee, who have given him a place to cat-nap until a permanent home can be found. Mr Lee, 41, an electrician, said: 'Archer is so adorable. He's so energetic and playful, it's hard to see how anyone could have done something like this to him. 'He is very vocal. He wakes us up every morning with his loud miaow-ing because he wants feeding. 'It's not a surprise that he managed to get someone's attention while he was stuck in that bottle bank. When he wants something, he lets you know about it!' Namesake: The RSCPA gave Archer his name as a reference to the alcohol bottles he was surrounded by . Vocal: Archer, pictured left with 'foster' owner Alex Lee, has been described as 'energetic and playful' - and has kept to his reputation of making lots of noise when he wants something . Archer has been fostered with two other kittens, Jack and Rose, who were abandoned in a garden. Mrs Lee, 32, a financial controller, said: 'As an animal lover, it breaks my heart to think they were just thrown out. I am so pleased we did it, I didn't even know fostering was an option until I saw the post on Facebook.' Mrs Outhwaite said: 'The RSPCA cattery is full and newborn kittens need lots of love and attention and cuddles, so it has been great to get them fostered. 'They are all coming out of their shell and getting used to people so will make great pets.'","Nine-week-old Archer was dumped in a bottle bank in Harrogate, Yorkshire .

"By . Eliza Scarborough . When you're thinking about where to do your shopping for the perfect summer wardrobe your local supermarket probably won't pop into your head. But Eliza Scarborough has found that this summer you can forget your usual ports of call on the High Street and head down to Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda for some stylish - and cheaper - alternatives. Scroll down for video . Dress, £40, shoes, £16, sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk . You might instantly head to Debenhams or Monsoon if you need a frock for a wedding or special occasion. But since Sainsbury’s doubled its design team on own-label Tu last year, and invested heavily in fabrics and workmanship, they’ve become a real alternative to the High Street. Fresh designs, such as this floral frock, are perfect for summer weddings or formal events. The hour-glass style flatters curves, while the tailored pleat gives you a neat silhouette. Shoes, £25, and dress, £25, www.F-F.com . Forget more expensive shoes at old reliables such as Russell & Bromley or LK Bennett; Tesco is giving them a run for their money.

Shoes come in sizes 3 to 8 and they are always comfortable, often with padded soles and ankle straps. They also have a choice of brands other than their own, including Dunlop and Dolcis. This pair costs £25, but the zip detail and chain trim makes them look far more expensive. Drop-waist dress, £16, and shoes, £25, asda.com . Topshop and Zara are renowned for interpreting high fashion. But did you know Asda, too, has become adept at churning out catwalk copies at the drop of a hat? It has even had its own catwalk show in one of its North London stores. Among the clothes was this drop-waist dress that’s not dissimilar to Victoria Beckham’s ‘blanket dress’. Hers costs £855, but this can be yours for £16. Better yet, it’s far easier to wear than the billowing original, thanks to the clever cut. Coat, £28, shirt, £6, skirt, £10 and shoes, £16, asda.com . When you have to buy  an outfit for the office workwear, take a minute before rushing out to give your credit card a bashing at Hobbs or Jigsaw — Asda has a great line which is unbelievably cheap. Its best-selling £6 white shirt is crisp and well-tailored and it does wonderfully tapered trousers, also £6. This white coat is a useful summer cover-up and looks like it means business. A stretchy midi-length skirt is another great option. The perfect length, so you don’t scare your boss, and comfy enough to sit in all day at your desk, it comes in a variety of prints and flatters curves.

"By . Ruth Styles . Rodrigo Medellin, 57, from Mexico City, wasn't like other children growing up. Instead of a pet dog or hamster, the animal-mad child kept a group of very unusual creatures in his parent's bathroom - a clutch of vampire bats. 'I would feed them blood from . cows or from me sometimes,' he remembers. 'I'd keep blood in the fridge so I could feed . them every night.' Rodrigo, who is famous in Mexico under the alias 'the Bat Man', grew up to become a conservationist and has made it his mission to get the country's bat species off the endangered list. Passionate: Rodrigo Medellin, 57, from Mexico City, aka the Bat Man of Mexico, with a Lesser Long Nosed Bat . And he's met with considerable success. In just 30 years, he's created a network of bat-friendly 'safe caves' and pioneered conservation techniques so successful, they've been rolled out to save endangered species all around the world. But despite his success, Rodrigo says he's still never happier than when deep underground and surrounded by bats. 'For most people, caves would sound like a . terrifying place, like a place they don't belong, but caves are my . perfect place. An incredibly peaceful place. 'There's little bats, big bats, short snouted, long snouted, little eyes, big eyes, long ears, short ears, every type of bat,' he continues. 'In Mexico and in other places because of . what I do, they call me the Bat Man. All I want is that people get the . right information about bats, about how important they are for us, and . if that entails them calling me the Bat Man, then so be it.' Laughing, he adds: 'I am the Bat Man!' Pet: As a child, Rodrigo kept vampire bats in his parents' home, feeding them on animal - and his own- blood . Hard work: Rodrigo has since dedicated his life to saving Mexico's bats, including the Lesser Long Nosed Bat . Tasty: The bat has developed a symbiotic relationship with the tequila producing agave plant . Rodrigo's journey to becoming the Bat Man of Mexico began when he was a child, with his remarkably understanding parents agreeing to let him keep vampire bats as pets. 'That was not easy to withstand,' he admits, 'and still, my parents . let me do that. It was fascinating to see these bats feeding and . interacting with each other - they take care of each other so well. It . was a lot of fun.' Although he no longer keeps vampire bats as pets, he still spends much of his time squelching through caves splattered with guano in a bid to track and conserve a very different type of bat: The Lesser Long Nosed Bat or Tequila Bat. 'My first Lesser Long Nosed Bat came into . my hands when I was 15,' he remembers. 'We knew nothing about it and we found out that . they were really endangered. 'We were looking at roosts that were reputed . to have many thousands of Lesser Long Nosed Bats but when we visited, we . found only hundreds or none. That told us they were in trouble.' Ever since, Rodrigo has made it his mission to save the Lesser Long Nosed Bat, which plays an essential role in producing Mexico's most famous export - tequila. 'As a Mexican, I'm proud of my country and part of the Mexican spirit is a beverage that is called tequila,' he explains. 'Tequila . is a very important part of the Mexican economy and it is owed to bats. Bats provide pollination to the tequila plant, the agave plant.' The agave plant, a relative, bizarrely, of the hyacinth, is found mainly in Mexico but also in southern parts of the US and in the rest of Central America. It flowers once every 15 years and relies on the Tequila Bat for pollination - a process that takes place once a year during the bats' migration. Little friend: Rodrigo with one of the Lesser Long Nosed Bats his hard work has helped to conserve . Journey: The Tequila Bat migrates north to the Sonora Desert - with Rodrigo tracking them the whole way . The journey, which takes them 1500km from southern Mexico to the upper reaches of the Sonora Desert on the US-Mexico border, sees them fly along the 'Nectar Corridor' - a strip of land sitting between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. 'The link [between bats and agaves] has been here for . millions of years,' adds Rodrigo. 'Agaves rely on the bats to move their pod. 'Bats rely . on agaves so that they can survive. We could not have tequila if it wasn't for the bats. 'When I drink it, I can't help but think about the bats . and thank them for the incredible service they give us.' Although bats were once worshipped in Mexico in the form of the Aztec goddess Ītzpāpālōtl who ruled over Paradise, the arrival of Spanish colonists who loathed the creatures kickstarted an almost terminal decline. When Bram Stoker's Dracula was released in 1897, the association between bats and the forces of evil became even more entrenched. 'To this day, people are afraid, saying that they are filthy and they are everything bad in the world,' complains Rodrigo. 'That is really not the case.' Free: Rodrigo says despite his successes, there's more work needed to save Mexico's bat species . In a bid to change public perception of bats, Rodrigo has become a one-man PR machine for the animals, travelling the length and breadth of Mexico in a bid to change peoples' minds. 'You can see it in the eyes of people . when you talk to them - it suddenly all makes sense,' he reveals. 'It all makes sense. 'Their frame of mind changes and they're bat friends from then . on. And they propagate the message; they talk to people in the home, . at school, in the office, and suddenly, the message goes snowballing and . really changes the panorama for the bats.' And for Rodrigo, the effort really has paid off. Thanks to his hard work, the Tequila Bat population is recovering strongly and has even been taken off the endangered list. 'This is a clear indication that our work is actually having a good impact on the world,' he beams, delighted. 'This is a great day for the Lesser Long Nosed Bat. There's a lot of work to be done but first, it's time to celebrate.' Rodrigo and the Lesser Long Nosed (Tequila) Bat appear on Natural World: The Bat Man of Mexico, tonight at 9pm on BBC2 .","Rodrigo Medellin, 57, from Mexico City has loved bats since he was a child .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . One Britain's most famous police units has had its numbers slashed because felons are giving up on old-fashioned bank robberies. The Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad, which deals with bank heists and armed robberies, has had half of its bases closed and shed almost 50 officers as criminals turn to online theft instead. Flying Squad, nicknamed the Sweeney, was once faced with an onslaught of major robberies, which peaked in 1992 with 291 raids in London alone. Obsolete? The Met Police's Flying Squad, as portrayed above in 1970s drama The Sweeney, has had its numbers slashed by almost a third in just one year . Not like the old days: The cuts come as criminals shun traditional bank robberies, once staple fare of Flying Squad officers, such as those shown by John Thaw  Dennis Waterman above . That year there were 847 raids nationwide, a figure which has plummeted since. The latest data from the British Bankers' Association, for 2012, show 108 branch robberies, 26 of which were in London. And the decline looks set to continue, with Flying Squad officers investigating 33 bank robberies in the 2013/14 financial year, just five per cent of their total workload. As a result, officer numbers have been cut from 112 to 160, two of their four bases closed, and the whole unit folded in to a large organised and economic crime command. The squad was made famous in the 1970s by ITV series The Sweeney, starring John Thaw as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, and Dennis Waterman as Detective Sergeant George Carter. Real-life Flying Squad officers helped investigate some of Britain's most notorious criminals, including the Kray twins and the gang behind the Great Train Robbery. Heist no more: The number of bank robberies reported each year has fallen from a high of 847 nationwide in 1992 to barely more than 100 in 2012 . Perhaps their finest hour came in 2000, when a diamond raid on the Millennium Dome was dramatically foiled by 140 officers. A gang of robbers smashed a JCB digger into the dome, intending to make off with the fabulous £200million Millennium Star, along with 11 other fine diamonds. They were armed with smoke bombs, ammonia knock-out gas and nailguns to break through high-security glass. Their plan was then to flee the dome via speedboat and, police believe, sell on their takings to mafia bosses. But . Flying Squad had been tipped off, replaced the gems with fakes and lay . in wait for the raid on November 7. All the robbers and accomplices were . captured, while CCTV cameras captured every moment. Finest hour? Flying Squad officers foiled a dramatic diamond raid on the Millennium Dome in 2000 . Smashed: Thieves busted through security glass defending the £200million Millennium Star diamond - but officers had replaced it with a fake and swiftly arrested all the would-be robbers . Escape foiled: Flying Squad officers can be seen above approaching a speed boat which would have been the getaway vehicle . Now, however, criminals are turning to less dramatic, but equally costly, raids carried out through cyberspace. Earlier this year gang leader Tony Colston-Hayter was jailed after admitting a raid at a Barclays bank in northwest London. But rather than guns and getaway cars, the robbery was carried out using a keyboard video mouse - a device which he used to hijack the bank's computers and siphon off £1.3million. It comes as anti-fraud agencies report a resurgence of thefts using bank card data - with £450million stolen from British cards through a combination of identity theft, cloned cards, computer viruses and internet scams in 2013. The figure had shot up 16 per cent since 2012, approaching its all-time peak from 2006. Online banking fraud has also increased to £40.9 million, up from £39.6 million in 2012. Bank card fraud is on the increase, with losses on British cards totalling £450.4 million last year, a 16 per cent rise on 2012. Online banking fraud increased by 3 per cent to £40.9 million, up from £39.6 million in 2012. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The last 12 months have seen the Met undergo significant changes as we seek to modernise the services we provide the public whilst making essential savings.'","Metropolitan Police cuts almost 50 Flying Squad officers in a single year .

"By . Mark Prigg . NASA doesn't have enough money to get its new, $12 billion rocket system off the ground by the end of 2017 as planned, federal auditors warned today. The Government Accountability Office issued a report Wednesday saying Nasa's's Space Launch System is at 'high risk of missing' its planned December 2017 initial test flight. The post-space shuttle program would build the biggest rockets ever - larger than the Saturn V rockets which sent men to the moon - to send astronauts to asteroids and Mars. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. 'They can't meet the date with the money they have,' report author Cristina Chaplain said. She said it wasn't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally-required program, but that Nasa didn't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking. The GAO report put the current shortfall at $400 million, but did say Nasawas 'making solid progress' on the rocket program design. Nasa's launch system officials told the GAO that there was a 90 percent chance of not hitting the launch date at this time. This usually means Nasa has to delay its test launch date, get more money or be less ambitious about what it plans to do, said former Nasa associate administrator Scott Pace, space policy director at George Washington University. The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds . Nasa is working on the problems GAO highlighted, but delaying launch or diverting money from other programs would harm taxpayers, Nasa Associate Administrator William Gerstenmaier wrote in the agency's response. 'Welcome to aerospace,' Pace said, pointing out that large space projects often end up as much as 50 percent over budget. He said that 'is why you shouldn't believe initial cost estimates.' The space agency has been reluctant to put an overall price tag on the Space Launch System. The GAO report says it will cost $12 billion to get to the first test launch and 'potentially billions more to develop increasingly capable vehicles' that could be used for launches to asteroids and Mars.","Construction of the Space Launch System has already begun .

This is the last thing you'd want on the beach and disappointing as M&S swimwear is usually so well designed. Polka dot swimming costume, £30, next.co.uk: Anyone would look trim in this costume. The material is body smoothing and, from the waist down, a Spanx-like lining holds you in. The leg is elegantly cut and while the small cups might not be ideal on those with bigger busts, the overall shape is wonderfully flattering. Too fussy: Prom dress, £89, marksandspencer.com . Sophisticated: Embroidered dress, £175, next.co.uk . Prom dress, £89, marksandspencer.com: The M&S dress may look simple from a distance, but close up the design is far too fussy. The pale pink, leopard print fabric has a metallic sheen, the waist is nipped in, there are diagonal seams along the bust, the collar is embellished and the skirt flared. It's a riot of detail and they're all fighting against one another. One thing should be pared back - whether it's the material, embellishment or cut. Embroidered dress, £175, next.co.uk: Next's dress from its Signature Collection is far more sophisticated - if also far more expensive. The simple cut, which nips in at the waist and has a loose panel of fabric hanging over the top, cleverly disguises the stomach while still flattering the silhouette. And while it's covered in embellishments, they're dainty and intricate, rather than being overwhelming. A simple yet show-stopping classic. Worth the price. Got it wrong: Linen dress, £39.50, marksandspencer.com . Spot on: Monochrome dress, £38, next.co.uk . Linen dress, £39.50, marksandspencer.com: Sometimes block colour can be used to divert the eye and optically 'trim' the figure. But M&S haven't mastered it here. Thick horizontal panels across M&S's linen dress have the reverse effect, widening the hips and bust. The white middle band cuts you off just below the armpits, a deeply unflattering place, making larger busts look droopy and producing a mono-boob effect. The linen fabric felt comfortably light, but creased a little too easily. Monochrome dress, £38, next.co.uk: Next have got it spot on. The black front panel optically reduces your waist size while the dark side panels alongside the leg give you a trimmer silhouette and the diagonal seams flatter curves. The polyester material is stretchy, figure-hugging, but breathable, and the overall style is not a million miles away from a Roland Mouret frock. For £38, it's an absolute bargain.","Next's profits have overtaken their rival .

"By . Eliza Scarborough . Last season, to many women’s despair, pink seemed to be the only colour for coats. Don’t all groan at once, then, when we tell you this spring’s must-have shade is even trickier: yellow. Thanks to early outbreaks of sunshine, High Street shops are struggling to keep up with demand for cover-ups in shades from mustard to lemon, despite the fact that the wrong shade can make any skin tone look wan.  But pick the right pigment for you and there can be nothing more flattering. Fashion editor ELIZA SCARBOROUGH shows you how to choose the right hue . . . Highlight your golden undertones with a rich, sunny yellow, which will lift your complexion without jarring. Teamed with orange and terracotta, it will pack quite a punch. If you’re not feeling so bold, match your coat with understated khaki and caramel.

But this year, British stores such as John Lewis and Debenhams have joined in, slashing their prices for one day only.

"By . James Slack . Emergency legislation will today be announced at Westminster to allow Britain’s spies to access data about the public’s phone calls, texts and internet use. The laws will be rushed through Parliament amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the UK by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria. Ministers and security officials have also voiced public fears about the damage caused by Edward Snowden – the fugitive US official who stole and leaked top secret documents on GCHQ intelligence gathering to the Guardian newspaper. The laws are intended to protect the 'capability' which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing . The law will force mobile phone and internet companies to store information relating to all recent telephone calls, emails and internet searches, so they can be accessed by security officials. There are long-standing Coalition tensions over the issue of communications data. But officials insist the legislation is not intended to give the security services and police any new powers. Rather, it is intended to protect the ‘capability’ which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing. Under an EU directive passed in the wake of the July 7 attacks, telephone and internet companies have been obliged to store details such as who a person calls, where from and for how long for a period of 18 months. It has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots, as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups. But the directive was ruled unlawful by the European Court of Justice in April this year – with ministers given a strict deadline to re-write UK law or stop using the spy powers. The MI5 headquarters in central London will be protected by the new laws it is said . After weeks of negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers. This will be done by writing them directly into British law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 EU data retention directive. Tory ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 General Election. The Liberal Democrats remain implacably opposed to the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call, email and internet search in Britain. These three men all claim to have come from Britain and feature in an ISIS video featuring young British jihadists encouraging Muslims in the West to join them in Iraq and Syria . In a speech last month, Mrs May said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘real and deadly’ threat from jihadists. She said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane. At the same time, the internet has become a ‘paradise’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities. But Mrs May added that the powers used to defeat Britain’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology, leading to a collapse in Britain’s capacity to protect its citizens. Later this year, a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, southeast London, is expected to argue that - had MI5 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot.","Ministers have voiced fears about the damage caused by Edward Snowden .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson’s marriage ended in divorce yesterday - three years after his wife’s affair with his police bodyguard. In a two-minute hearing, their 23-year marriage was brought to an end after his former wife, Laura Jane Patient, petitioned for divorce on the grounds of a two year-separation. No reasons were given, but Miss Patient, 50, had an affair with her husband’s bodyguard during his time as Home Secretary between June 2009 and May 2010. She was said to be seeking a divorce at the time. Alan Johnson's marriage ended in divorce - three years after his wife's affair with his police bodyguard . Mr Johnson, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, now 63, left Labour’s front bench and was said to be ‘absolutely devastated’ by the affair. In a statement released at the time, he said: ‘I have found it difficult to cope with personal issues in my private life while carrying out an important front bench role.’ Mr Johnson’s departure left Labour in turmoil after party leader Ed Miliband had to appoint Ed Balls, his rival for the top job, as shadow chancellor. Despite this, Mr Johnson defended his ‘poor wife’ who he said was upset by all the attention created by the scandal. Yesterday, neither would comment on the end of their marriage. Mr Johnson, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, now 63, left Labour's front bench and was said to be 'absolutely devastated' by the affair . Following the revelation of the affair, Mr Johnson’s police protection officer PC Paul Rice was suspended from duty. In 2011, he was dismissed from police service following an internal investigation and misconduct hearing. Mr Johnson married his second wife Laura in August 1991 and they have a 13-year-old son together. He was previously married to Judith Elizabeth Cox with whom he has three children. Most recently, Mr Johnson, a former postman and member of a pop group, was in a relationship with Carolyn Burgess, a businesswoman 13 years his junior. The 50-year-old award-winning businesswoman is the boss of translation agency Language is Everything in Hull where he is an MP. The father-of-four revealed the relationship in a local newspaper interview with her to celebrate her being made an MBE for services to business and the Humber area. Miss Burgess, who has been married at least twice, is believed to be separated from her husband, a customer services manager whom she married in 1999. PC Rice worked for Mr Johnson for more than a year as part of his protection team, guarding his home and travelling with him in Britain and abroad. He was one of around 230 officers who are part of a unit called SO1, which provides protection for the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, former ministers judged to need specialist protection and visiting heads of state. The technical term for the person they are protecting is ‘the principal’. Former Met Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick was head of specialist operations at Scotland Yard and said at the time: ‘This is really bad news. When you deploy a protection officer, the principal is placing enormous trust not just in the Metropolitan Police Service but in the individual as well. ‘There is an ethical dimension to their training, teaching them not to betray the trust of the principal. The protection officer is in a privileged position and is invited into the private life of the principal. This photograph shows Mr Johnson celebrating his 1997 General Election victory with Laura Patient . ‘If a protection officer is compromised in any way, emotionally or professionally, the obligation is on the officer to seek removal.’ Yesterday, Miss Patient declined to speak outside her detached £500,000 house in Upper Norwood, south London. Mr Johnson was not available for comment at his Victorian terrace house in the same area, which is also worth £500,000, but his press spokesman declined to comment.","Alan Johnson's marriage ended yesterday - three years after the affair .

"By . Claire Ellicott . and David Wilkes . Archived files have revealed how Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher considered deploying the army against striking miners . Margaret Thatcher planned to mobilise hundreds of troops and considered declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 miners’ strike, previously secret files reveal. Another option was to switch to a three-day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in Britain, according to the National Archives. As panic appeared to grip the government, Mrs Thatcher faced the possibility of defeat in the prolonged and violent strike that became a defining episode of her time in power. The dispute was triggered in March . 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits. Arthur Scargill, leader of . the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), went into battle with the . Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued. Mrs . Thatcher had been expecting the  confrontation and preparing for it . since 1981. Publicly, she remained resolute, but the files show how, . privately, panic surrounded her. John . Redwood, head of the policy unit, warned that giving in to the unions . would be ‘the end of effective government’ in Britain. ‘The . Left’s aim is to pave the way for the  ultimate defeat of the . Government by destroying its policies and its credibility,’ he wrote to . the prime minister. ‘Its purpose is to oppose and destroy.’ There was stalemate until July, when a dockers’ dispute escalated into a national strike, giving the NUM extra leverage. There were fears that power supplies would run out and the Ministry of Agriculture warned of possible panic-buying of food. As the pressure grew, Mrs Thatcher held a meeting on July 16 at which declaring a state of emergency was discussed. The . minutes noted: ‘It was not clear how far a declaration of a state of . emergency would be interpreted as a sign of weakness, nor to what extent . it would increase docker support for the miners’ strike.’ Scroll down for video . Miners from the Kellingley colliery march in support of the general strike in1985 . The files reveal that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal. It was suggested that 4,500  military drivers would be needed. The Government suspected that the NUM was receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from  Russia during the miners’ strike. MI5 informed ministers in November 1984 that the Soviets were funding the union and it was reported in Russia that £500,000 had been raised by workers to support the strike. Officials suspected government involvement, with a briefing  letter noting that it was ‘most unlikely that the Soviet miners’ union could have been given access to convertible Roubles without official permission’. But they had to admit that they were powerless to do anything about the funding and would  have to rely on detecting a representative of the NUM ‘entering this country with a suitcase full of bank notes’. NUM leader Arthur Scargill has always insisted that the miners received no overseas money. In a letter from the Ministry of Defence to Andrew Turnbull, the PM’s private secretary, on July 11, 1984 the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic. It said: ‘My secretary of state [Michael Heseltine] … supports the view that the use of servicemen to move existing coal stocks would raise the emotional temperature and recommends that it should not be considered any further at this stage in the dispute.’ The correspondence also reveals that one of the options being considered was a state of emergency – proclaimed by the Queen – if power supplies were interrupted. It spoke of using servicemen ‘as a last resort’. The concern at the heart of government was summarised in a letter to the PM from Norman Tebbit, the trade and industry secretary, warning her that ‘time is running out’. Dated July 25, 1984, he said coal . stocks would last until January, adding that the prospect would . strengthen the miners’ resolve. ‘I . have no wish to rock the boat, and believe it essential that we should . continue to present our existing public face,’ he wrote. ‘But it is just . as important that we should be utterly realistic among ourselves about . what is actually going to happen.’ Last night, Lord Tebbit recalled that the miners’ strike was a ‘close-run thing’ but said that Mrs Thatcher ‘never wavered’. The files reveal that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal. It was suggested that 4,500  military drivers would be needed . ‘I was obviously concerned because I was looking after industry and people in industry were concerned so I was expressing those fears,’ he said. His letter alarmed the PM, but she was encouraged by the response of industry leaders following a hastily arranged meeting. The prospect of a three-day week remained on the table but in the end the strike failed to have a widespread impact. As support among miners and the public drained away, it came to a formal end on March 3, 1985. Margaret Thatcher did not mention Nelson Mandela’s detention during an official meeting with the former prime minister of South Africa – despite being advised to by the Foreign Office, documents reveal. Margaret Thatcher with South African Prime Minister P W Botha in 1984 . In a briefing paper written by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ahead of the four-hour meeting with P W Botha, it was suggested that Mrs Thatcher include Mr Mandela’s release as  a ‘point to make’. The documents reveal that the ANC leader’s imprisonment was mentioned with ‘little success’ during a private, 40-minute ‘tete-a-tete’ with Mr Botha, ahead of the official meeting in 1984. A memo about the meeting of the two politicians – who both died last year – notes that Mrs Thatcher mentioned Mr Mandela, but Mr Botha said he was not able to interfere with the official process.","PM considered declaring a state of emergency at height of strike in 1984 .

"By . Claire Ellicott . When he appeared on Dragons’ Den to market the Reggae Reggae Sauce that would make him a multi-millionaire, Levi Roots billed it as the ultimate family collaboration. He told the world that the sauce was made to his Jamaican grandmother’s authentic recipe and said that his children helped out in his business. But it seems that most of the entrepreneur’s eight children – by seven mothers – struggle to think of him as a family man. Last night, two of his daughters claimed he had never paid a penny in child support, at least four of his children are struggling on benefits, and one is effectively homeless after he refused to help her. Most of Reggae Reggae Sauce entrepreneur Levi Roots's (above) eight children - by seven mothers - struggle to think of him as a family man . Law student Joanne Caesar, 33, said her father has cut her out of his life – and his £30million fortune – after she helped to develop the famous sauce and provided backing vocals on his advert. Miss Caesar said her father, who still lives in the two-bedroom Brixton council flat he has rented for 20 years, had ‘exploited’ her by getting her to work for him without paying her. Her half-sister Sharlene Williams, 32, said her father ‘took advantage’ of her by making her work at his shop without paying her a wage and refusing to make her an employee. Both agreed that he had not been a good father to them and their siblings, aged one to 36. Law student Joanne Caesar (left), 33, said her father has cut her out of his life - and his £30m fortune - after she helped to develop the famous sauce and provided backing vocals on his advert. Her half-sister Sharlene Williams (right), 32, said her father 'took advantage' of her by making her work at his shop without paying her a wage and refusing to make her an employee . Miss Caesar described her father as ‘incredibly tight’ and said that, following his success, his main purchase had been a £300 sofa. Last night, Miss Williams said her father, 55, had fired her from his takeaway shop Papine in Clapham Junction, South-West London, after a row with a customer. She said that the customer groped her and she refused to serve him, but her father insisted that she did. They then had a row in front of the customers and he fired her. She fell behind on her rental payments and asked her father for help, but he refused and she was evicted. Miss Williams, who works in retail, said: ‘It was always his way or the highway. I managed the shop, but he didn’t want to pay me. He refused to pay me and my brother a wage. I was forced to claim benefits to make ends meet. Without my benefits I would have been homeless a very long time ago.’ Miss Caesar, a mother of one from Leytonstone, East London, said that at least three of his children had to claim benefits to survive. Mr Roots, real name Keith Valentine Graham, was born in Jamaica and raised by his grandmother while his parents worked to make money in the UK so he could join them. Dragons Peter Jones (left) and Richard Farleigh invested in Roots's business. Shortly after, Sainsbury's said it would stock the sauce, and he has since expanded his range and made a fortune . He appeared on Dragons’ Den in 2007, serenading the judges with his Reggae Reggae Sauce song. Dragons Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh invested in his business. Shortly after, Sainsbury’s said it would stock the sauce, and he has since expanded his range and made a fortune. In 2011 he fought a court battle against a former friend, Tony Bailey, who claimed he had stolen the jerk barbecue sauce recipe. Mr Roots won, but Judge Mark Pelling attacked him for misleading the public, saying he ‘regards the truth as an optional extra’. The businessman said the sauce was invented by his grandmother and had been the ‘taste of Notting Hill Carnival’ since the early 1990s. But the judge said he was guilty of ‘fraudulent misrepresentation’ and Mr Roots admitted the story behind the sauce was a ‘marketing ploy’. Miss Caesar said: ‘He and Tony came up with the idea of making a sauce but my dad took the recipe home to see what he could do with it. ‘Me and my sister Sharlene made the sauce in his kitchen, so we knew the secret. He used to send us to Lidl to pick up the ingredients. ‘We worked on the sauce in his kitchen, experimenting with the ingredients until he perfected it. He already had a deal with a bottling factory and found someone to make the logo.’ She said she gave up her job so that she could live with him and help him make the sauce. But things changed between them as soon as he got the investment. ‘After Dragons’ Den, we stopped hearing from him. He let the money and the fame and fortune get to him and his ego got the better of him,’ she said. ‘He cut all of his children off because he said that we were all after his money.’ She said her father did not visit her in hospital when her son Keenan, now two, was born, and didn’t even phone her after the birth. Although she went on to perform backing vocals on his Reggae Reggae Sauce song that was used in an advert for the brand, she claims that he didn’t pay her for her work. She added: ‘I just want him to remember who he was before he became Mr Reggae Reggae Sauce man because he was a nice man.’ Mr Roots declined to comment.","Father-of-eight Levi Roots found success after promoting his Reggae Reggae Sauce on Dragons' Den .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Facebook is profiting from the controversial drinking game NekNominate by displaying adverts next to videos of people taking part in challenges. The social networking site is now facing growing pressure to ban footage after the craze claimed the lives of two British men this weekend. Last night, a Facebook page called Ban NekNomination started by friends of the latest victim had 24,000 ‘likes’ and relatives condemned the game as ‘stupid and dangerous’. Victims: Stephen Brookes, 29, left, and Isaac Richardson, 20, right, both died on Sunday after drinking huge amounts of alcohol . Campaigners also called for the site and others to review their policies on allowing the videos to remain online. Andrew Misell of Alcohol Concern said: ‘Facebook have declined to take these pages down. I would ask them to look at reviewing their policy. ‘I would also urge people who are using these social networking sites and who see these particular pages, to report them to the site and complain.’ His warning came after the deaths of two British men this weekend after apparently taking part in the game – in which participants film themselves drinking dangerous and bizarre alcoholic cocktails and urge others to outdo them. Two other young men died in Ireland last week. The first British victim was former grammar school boy Isaac Richardson, 20, who downed wine, whisky, vodka and lager in a pitcher and lost consciousness two minutes later. Foolish: Triathlete Ross Fawcett, pictured above, contributed to the craze by uploading a video of himself trying to drink a beer while cycling down the street . He died in hospital in the early hours of Sunday. Friends said he had told them he wanted to ‘outdo’ everyone else. Yesterday it emerged that Stephen Brookes, 29, from Cardiff, also died on Sunday morning after being NekNominated and downing a pint of vodka. Friends said he liked to challenge people to drinking contests and his catchphrase was: ‘Do you wanna race?’ They have now started a Facebook group called Ban NekNominate and called on the social networking site to check related videos before they are uploaded. A family spokesman said: ‘We want to tell other people to think what they are doing before taking part in something stupid like this. 'We don’t want to see any more victims of this drinking craze or for any other  families to suffer.’ Mr Brookes’ mother Paula, 49, said: ‘Stephen was a fabulous son – he was kind, generous and funny, everybody loved him. Craze: Other extreme NekNominate examples include grandmother Susan Cairney, who downed a cocktail laced with laxatives, and Rebecca Dagley, 19, who stripped to her underwear in an Asda store to drink beer . 'The community here will not be the same without him – he would do anything to help anybody.’ The craze has taken hold on Facebook primarily, but is also on sites including Twitter and YouTube. Although Facebook has removed advertising on NekNominate groups and does not show targeted advertising linked to the craze, it is still running adverts alongside the videos. This means that it is either paid by a company up front to run the adverts, or it receives money when a Facebook user clicks on the link. A spokesman said behaviour on the site that some people may find offensive or controversial is ‘not always necessarily against our rules’. He added: ‘We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case-by-case basis. ‘We also give people the ability to remove themselves from an uncomfortable conversation through tools such as untagging and blocking.'","Site faces pressure from campaigners and victims' families to ban videos .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Campaign: Paul Lamb and Jane Nicklinson, both 58, at the Supreme Court in Central London yesterday . The severely disabled are treated worse than pets under existing laws, a right-to-die campaigner said yesterday. Paul Lamb, who is paralysed from the neck down following a car crash, said very sick or badly injured animals are put down as an act of kindness. He wants a change in the law to allow doctors and healthcare professionals to assist severely disabled people to commit suicide. Arriving at the Supreme Court for the latest stage in his legal battle, Mr Lamb, 58, said: ‘You would not do this [prevent assisted death] with pets. Pets have got the law in their favour.’ He was joined by Jane Nicklinson, who is bringing the case on behalf of her late husband Tony. Mr Nicklinson, who was paralysed from the neck down, fought for his right to an assisted death until he passed away last year. Mrs Nicklinson, 58, of Melksham, Wiltshire, said it was ‘uncivilised’ that people such as her husband had to suffer instead of being allowed to die with the help of a doctor. A change in the law, if it happened, would apply only to the severely disabled, she added. ‘I saw the way that Tony suffered and I don’t want other people to suffer like him,’ she said. ‘We feel very strongly… something needs to be done.’ Nine Supreme Court judges yesterday heard the arguments, which revolve around whether the law on assisted suicide is incompatible with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act –  the right to a family life. Paul Bowen QC, for Mrs Nicklinson and Mr Lamb, said that the law was an ‘insurmountable obstacle’ for severely disabled people who need assistance to end their lives. Scroll down for video . Argument: Mrs Nicklinson (left) is bringing the case on behalf of her late husband Tony (right). Mr Nicklinson, who was paralysed from the neck down, fought for his right to an assisted death until he passed away . Mrs Nicklinson, Mr Lamb and another man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, brought the case to Britain’s highest court after it was rejected by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. A ruling is expected next year. Father-of-two Mr Nicklinson was left paralysed by a stroke in 2005 but remained mentally sound. He died from pneumonia aged 58 in August last year, a week after learning he had lost his case at the Court of Appeal. He had refused food and fluids following the ruling. Mr Lamb, from Bramley, Leeds, has been paralysed except for limited movement in his right hand and in significant pain since his road accident in 1990. ‘A change in the law would mean more to me than a million dollars,’ he said outside court. ‘A change in the law would be a massive step in the right direction.’ Team effort: (Left to right) Lauren Nicklinson, Jane Nicklinson, whose late husband Tony suffered locked-in syndrome, lawyer Saimo Chahlal, Paul Lamb and his carer Michaela Turner arrive for the right-to-die hearing . The Court of Appeal ruled it was up to Parliament to change the law on assisted suicide as it was an issue of conscience, not of legal principle. 'A change in the law would mean more to me than a million dollars. A change in the law would be a massive step in the right direction' Paul Lamb . The then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias, said Parliament ‘represents the conscience of the nation’ in life and death issues, adding: ‘Judges, however eminent, do not; our responsibility is to discover the relevant legal principles, and apply the law as we find it.’ On Sunday, one of the country’s most distinguished judges warned of the perils of legalising assisted suicide, arguing that it would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia. Baroness Butler-Sloss said: ‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involved ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others. ‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.’","Paul Lamb, 58, is paralysed from the neck down following a car crash .

"By . Claire Ellicott . By the time British children reach the age of 15, they are already languishing three years behind their Shanghai equivalents in maths. It is just one marker of how the Chinese city is racing ahead of Britain – and the rest of the world. Shanghai is top of the international league table in maths, reading and science for the second time. The city triumphed despite spending just 60 per cent of the international average on education – $49,000 (£29,852) over a pupil’s lifetime compared to the average of $83,382 (£50,793). Hard work: Many of Shanghai's pupils study for nine hours a day . In Britain, the spending per pupil is $98,023 (£59,719) – yet the investment does not bear fruit. The disparity in academic standing cannot be blamed on large class sizes, as the average number of pupils in Shanghai’s nearly 3,000 state schools is 35.4, compared with 25 in the UK. The key difference between  Shanghai and Britain appears to be pushy parents – and even pushier teachers. In the Chinese city, 45.9 per cent of parents got in touch with teachers to discuss school performance compared with 18.9 per cent in the UK. This was also the case in other  top performing countries such as Vietnam and Poland. The teachers also phone parents regularly,  telling them how to improve their parenting as well as checking on how hard the children are working at home. Pressure and expectation seem to bear results – 80 per cent of Shanghai’s 1.8million pupils enter higher education. Vietnam claimed 17th place in the league tables despite spending much less than Britain. The average number of children in a class is 41, making a mockery of the idea that education depends on low pupil-teacher ratios. Vietnam had the highest proportion of parents – 49.2 per cent – who got in touch with teachers to check on their child’s progress. The OECD’s Andreas Schleicher, in charge of the PISA tests, highlighted Vietnam’s ‘star performance’ in its first appearance in the international tables. It was in the top ten for science and outperformed many much wealthier western education systems, including the United States. Top performing high school students in Vietnam are expected to study additional courses and parents often use tutors to help children at underfunded state schools. The average monthly salary of state teachers is between £35 and £60 a day, so many supplement their income with private tuition. Britain spends 14 times as much as Vietnam on each pupil. Estonia’s pupils also outperform their British equivalents in every subject area, despite it spending $55,520 or £33,824.78, around half of what the UK spends on education. But it had just 20.6 pupils per class. The ‘pushy parent’ effect could be a result of China’s one child policy or perhaps the fact that 80 per cent of Shanghai’s youngsters have some form of private tuition in addition to mainstream schooling. Other reasons for the city’s success include the intensive training given to teachers throughout their careers and a culture of sharing and competition in the classroom. Most children spend long hours in school, studying in bursts, before continuing with plenty of homework and extra-curricular activities later. The OECD study said: ‘Top performers, notably in Asia, place great emphasis on selecting and training teachers, encourage them to work together and prioritise investment in teacher quality not classroom sizes. ‘They also set clear targets and give teachers autonomy in the  classroom. Children whose parents have higher expectations perform better.’ Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s education expert, added: ‘Teachers call up parents at least fortnightly –  they ring them on their mobile to check on how their children are working. They also tell them how to improve their parenting. ‘The pupils in Shanghai have agile, mobile schools and a lot of parental pressure.’ The length of the academic day varies between schools, but having children work for nine hours is not uncommon. Classes are highly selective and competition is actively encouraged. Mr Schleicher said the system is intensely meritocratic, adding: ‘If you are better than others, you’re going to get better chances. That’s the underlying belief.’ However, while Shanghai and Hong Kong, which also performed well, are China’s economic power-houses, the results for the rest of the country are likely to be much more patchy. Figures for the whole of China were not submitted for the OECD survey. Shanghai’s teachers are paid relatively modest salaries but have the incentive of 30 per cent of their earnings being based on performance.

"By . James Tozer . and Claire Ellicott . Suspended but not struck off: Dr Judith Ames, 52, with new husband Robert Owens, 66, pictured together today, who got together just days after his wife, her patient, died of cancer . A GP who began an affair with the husband of one of her patients just days after his wife died from cancer has been banned from practising medicine for six months. Dr Judith Ames sobbed yesterday at the verdict, as she was branded ‘entirely selfish’ and told to ‘reflect on her behaviour’. Dr Ames had been a regular visitor to Joyce Owens, 69, in the days leading up to her death, but within two weeks she had moved in with 66-year-old widower Robert. The couple married in September. Lawyers for the mother-of-three argued she should escape punishment usually targeted at doctors who prey on vulnerable patients to satisfy their own sexual appetite. Yesterday, however, the 52-year-old GP was handed the six-month ban – just a step down from being struck off. Afterwards the dead woman’s brother – who previously branded the affair a ‘betrayal’ of her memory – told the Daily Mail that Dr Ames had brought her professional disgrace upon herself. ‘The past 20 months since my sister died have been extremely difficult for the family and particularly for our 91-year old mother, who is in poor health,’ Colin Mason, 59, said. ‘Dr Ames’ actions and those of Robert Owens have been entirely selfish, with no thought for the effect they had on the other members of Joyce’s family.’ Thanking the General Medical Council for its ‘thorough investigation’ of the case, he added: ‘I feel a sense of satisfaction that the behaviour of Dr Ames and Robert Owens have been exposed to the public at large and without the work of the GMC this would not have been possible.’ Dr Ames was working at the Mannamead surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens went for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness. She was later diagnosed with lung cancer. Tragic: Joyce Owens, late wife of Robert Owens, who was treated by Dr Judith Ames as she died of a terminal illness last year . Over the following ten months, Dr Ames made regular trips to the couple’s home, up until Mrs Owens’ death in March last year. Within two weeks Dr Ames had left her . teacher husband and was sharing the marital bed, agreeing to marry Mr . Owens days later. Dr Ames informed partners at her practice that she was . in a relationship with Mr Owens, who was a patient there but hadn’t . been treated by her. She resigned after they accused her of breaching . conduct guidelines and the case was referred to the GMC. Risk: The doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and the governing body but was prepared to do so to be with Mr Owens . Treatment: Dr Ames was a doctor at Mannamead Surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens was diagnosed with cancer . Request: Dr Ames called the General Medical Council herself to discuss the implications of her relationship . Earlier this year the Medical . Practitioners Tribunal Service ruled she was guilty of misconduct . because she ‘transgressed fundamental rules governing the doctor-patient . relationship’. The General Medical Council, . represented by Simon Phillips QC, had called for the doctor to be struck . off. But at yesterday’s hearing in Manchester, panel chairman Gareth . Davies said Dr Ames presented no risk to patients and would be unlikely . to repeat her behaviour. However, he rejected submissions that the . earlier ruling was punishment enough and suspended her from practising . for six months. The suspension was postponed for four weeks so she could . complete a stint as locum at another surgery in Plymouth. Mr Davies said that as well as . showing her actions were considered unacceptable, a six-month suspension . would give her ‘the opportunity to reflect further on your conduct and . the standards of behaviour expected of you as a medical professional’. Afterwards Dr Ames told the Daily . Mail: ‘I accept the outcome graciously as a professional lady.’ She . declined to comment further. Following the original hearing, the . Mail told how Mrs Owens’ family had slammed the ‘indecent haste’ with . which the couple began their relationship. Her first husband, who didn’t want to . be named, claimed she left him, taking their two daughters with her, . because Mr Owens was ‘younger, had a degree, a good job and money’. He added: 'Hurtful comments made by . Dr Ames that we were not a close family only added to our pain as did . those made by Joyce’s first husband, who took the opportunity of this . case to make a series of unfounded allegations against Joyce. ‘This . action says more about his own bitterness. I had hoped he would find . solace in his subsequent marriages but this has clearly not been the . case.’","Joyce Owens from Plymouth died from terminal lung cancer in March 2012 .

"By . Catherine Hardy . Parents as well as children have been struck by Frozen fever, as a new UK baby name poll sees Elsa enter the list of most popular names for the first time. And it looks like Eric really does have the X Factor, with the name leaping up 284 places since pop mogul Simon Cowell announced the name of his child back in February. Inspired by the Disney animation, which has seen people all over the globe left with that song stuck in their heads, the poll by pregnancy and parenting website BabyCentre revealed a 243 increase in babies named Elsa since 2013. The Ice Queen cometh: Frozen character Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, has inspired parents when naming their daughter . ‘Whilst the film’s popular heroine is called Anna, Elsa offers a more unique name and is also a strong female role model’, says managing editor Sarah Barrett. ‘Elsa is the ice queen but she sees the error of her ways and is shown to be a sensitive, but strong and confident character. Just in the way the name Arya from Game of Thrones increased in popularity in 2013, films are hugely influential.’ In fact, the name has proven so popular that children have been demanding it be bestowed on new siblings. However, while Elsa, taking the 88th spot, and Eric, placing 118th, have a new-found popularity, parents are still choosing old favourites for their children, with Emily and Oliver bagging the top spots for little girls and boys. Heir on his chest: Simon Cowell out and about with his son Eric, who was named after Cowell's father . Old-fashioned names are a firm favourite among parents, with Penny, Audrey, Edith, Bertie, Ronnie and Albert ranking high. Unexpectedly, it looks like the gorgeous baby prince is serving as a deterrent when it comes to naming our children, with George moving down to number 19. This is the lowest it has listed since 2000, suggesting parents are put off by the idea of being seen to copy the third in line to throne. Names of power: The chubby-cheeked cherub may be third in line to the throne, but parents won't be naming their children after him . Down with the kids: William and Harry have remained popular names for boys . However, other royal names are still a popular choice, with Harry placing third and William coming in 10th for boys. Some 30,140 Mums took part in the survey to see which 200 boys and girls names have proven most popular in the first half of 2014. However, Sarah expects the list will continue to change as we hear the pitter-patter of tiny celebrity feet. Films are a big influence too, with Logan – the real name of X-Men Character Wolverine – and Noah – Russell Crowe’s title role in the recent biblical epic – placing 14th and 4th respectively. Emily .

"By . Scarlett Russell . and Catherine Hardy . They might appear to be a relatively modern phenomenon but 'mandals' - or sandals for men - were also a hit with the Victorians. Now a rare 19th century pair of mandals are to appear in a new exhibition celebrating the life and work of artist, William Morris. The sandals, which date from the 1880s, were a favourite choice of footwear for the artist, who is best known for his elaborate wallpaper designs, and, say curators, reflect his radical brand of left-wing politics. On trend: This pair of Victorian sandals belonged to Edward Carpenter who helped popularise them in the UK . Speaking in an interview with the Guardian cultural historian Fiona MacCarthy told of his overwhelming belief that 'beauty was a basic human birthright'. As a result, despite his membership of the Socialist League, he wasn't immune to the odd vanity project, including encasing his copy of Marx' famous treatise, Das Kapital, in gold. 'Only William Morris would encase Karl Marx in a gold-tooled binding,' added MacCarthy. 'It was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace.' Despite his lofty ideals, much of Morris' work ended up on the walls of the Victorian elite, although his 'art for everyone' philosophy made him enormously popular. And one of the ways he showed off his left-wing credentials was by adopting the mandal, an Indian fashion popularised in the UK by Morris' friend, philosopher Edward Carpenter. Portrait of an artist: William Morris' radical politics have influenced intellectuals for generations . Family: William Morris (back row right) with his friend Sir Edward Burne-Jones and their wives and children . 'Carpenter was the man who introduced the sandal to left-wing circles,’ reveals MacCarthy. ‘They became a kind of cult among left-leaning middle-class intellectuals. But the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which opens on the 16th October, isn't only about Morris and his mandals. Among the 140 artifacts starring in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of Morris' wife Jane as well as some rather risqué gardening tools. One, the Adam and Eve roller created by sculptor Eric Gill, features a relief of a couple entwined together in the throes of lust. Other highlights include striking pieces by Bernard Leach and Terence Conran, as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to Morris himself. Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris And His Legacy, 1860-1960, opens at the National Portrait Gallery on the 16th October and runs until the 11th January 2015. For more information, see npg.org.uk . Write caption here . Despite their popularity with modern lefties and the odd stylish yachtsman, the men's sandal - or mandal - has a long and, at times, glorious history. The shoe of choice for nearly every ancient culture, among them the Greeks, Romans and chilly-toed Iron Age Britons, sandals were cheap and easy to make using anything from leather to tree bark. Indeed, the world's oldest mandals, thought to be 10,000 years old, are made of bark and were discovered in the Fort Rock Cave in Oregon, which itself is believed to be well over 13,000 years old. The word sandal itself, however, didn't come into being for another 8,000 years and was coined by the ancient Greeks, who called them 'sandalon'. Greek men could choose between baxeae, which were made from willow twigs, and the cothurnus, a calf-length boot sandal which was worn by VIPs and politicians, and in an echo of former French president Nicholas Sarkozy, was often fitted with a thick cork sole to give the wearer extra height. Later incarnations included the caligae, a Roman mandal used on marches, and the Paduka, an Indian knob-fronted sandal that has neolithic antecedents but is still popular today. The Paduka was also partially responsible for the mandals' reintroduction into the UK more than two millennia after Britons discovered how to make closed-toe boots. Worn by Edward Carpenter during a visit to India, the shoes proved so comfortable he set up a sandal-making workshop near Manchester on his return home and in doing so, kickstarted a left-wing footwear trend that continues to this day.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pet pug died during a Channel crossing on a P&O ferry after he was banned from leaving the car - despite temperatures soaring to 30 degrees. Kirsty Wallace's dog Merlin and two of Ms Wallace's other dogs had to be kept in the vehicle during the journey from Calais to Dover on Friday - one of the hottest days of the year. When Ms Wallace returned to her car after the four-and-a-half hour crossing on the Spirit of France, the three-year-old dog had died and could not be resuscitated. Scroll down for video . Pet pug Merlin, three, died on board a P&O ferry during a crossing . between Calais and Dover after having to be left in his owner Kirsty . Wallace's car for the journey - while it was 30 degrees outside . Now more than 6,200 people have signed a . petition set up after Merlin's death, which is calling for dogs to be . allowed on the passenger deck of the ferries. The Government warns that dogs should . not be kept in cars for more than a few minutes once the temperatures . exceeds 25 degrees as it can lead to distress and suffering. It warns that temperatures inside cars can be double that of outside temperatures, due to the greenhouse effect. P&O Ferries said it was a 'distressing' incident but that the company had followed the rules. Nina Gadsdon, a friend of Ms Wallace who set up the campaign, alleges the death of Merlin is 'not an isolated incident'. The woman, from Aldershot, Hampshire, intends on handing the petition to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to . 'ensure animal welfare is taken into account'. More than 6,000 people have now signed a petition set up by Ms Wallace's friend Nina Gadsdon calling for dogs to be allowed onto the passenger deck of ferries . At the start of the petition, she wrote: 'Yesterday, a friend’s dog died . on a cross channel ferry run by P&O due to heat exposure, they came . down to their car after the crossing to find one of their . beloved pet's dead, this is not an isolated incident. P&O Ferries allow passengers to take animals on board from £15 each way. On . the website, it says: 'Please note that pets must remain in the vehicle . - Foot passengers are not permitted to travel with pets.' It will also not accept pets which are travelling without their owners. P&O said all its procedures regarding pets travel are governed by DEFRA. Severl . pets - including rabbits - are eligible to be taken on board, as long . as it is a credited company and route, such as P&O. On . the Government website, in the section about pet travel, it says: . 'Animals should never be left in vehicles in direct strong sunshine . and/or high temperatures as it is difficult to ensure sufficient . ventilation to keep them cool. 'Unless . animals are fully acclimatised, overheating, distress and suffering is . likely when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Celsius for more than a . few minutes. 'The . temperature in a car in full sun on a hot day can rise to double that . outside of the vehicle in a short time, leading rapidly to distress for . any animal in the vehicle.' 'Cross . channel ferries refuse to allow owners to have their pets with them, no . matter what the weather, and we believe that this is an animal welfare . issue. 'It would be an . animal rights abuse for a person to leave their pet in their car on land . for over an hour, so how can the ferry companies be allowed to make pet . owners do this? 'The companies charge pet owners a premium for taking their pets already.' After the incident, Ms Wallace, 31, from Alnwick, Northumberland, took to social networking site Facebook to describe her black pug dog as her 'angel' and said she simply 'couldn’t believe' he had died. Her sister, Jade Allan, 24, also from Alnwick, wrote on the petition: 'This is my sister’s dog, and I can’t tell you how upset the whole family are. 'They are moving over from Germany. When they go back home to pack he is going to be a massive miss he was her baby along with her other pets get this spread and known about.' Warnings are regularly issued about leaving dogs in cars for even a short period of time. They recommend leaving windows open if dogs are left in cars to increase ventilation. Natalie .

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . and Peter Lloyd . Attack: The Fathers4Justice advert targeting Kate Holmes. She hit back at the 'baseless' campaign . Actresses Katie Holmes, Halle Berry and Kim Basinger are being targeted in  a new ‘crummy mummy’ campaign by Fathers4Justice, which accuses them of denying their children access to their fathers. The pressure group is using the Hollywood stars in a series of adverts criticising their childcare arrangements. The new controversy comes after actress Kate Winslet, who has three children by three fathers, last week threatened to sue for being singled out in a Christmas advert by Fathers4Justice. Undeterred, the group says it will continue to highlight high-profile mothers who, they say, deny their children access to their fathers for no good reason. The Katie Holmes poster features a large picture of the star and the headline: ‘Katie, do you believe in equal parents, equal love?’ Text on the advert reads: ‘Katie Holmes demanded  sole custody of her daughter Suri in her divorce from  Tom Cruise, limiting the time the actor spends with her.’ Last night Ms Holmes’s lawyer Jonathan Wolfe criticised Fathers4 Justice, saying: ‘The campaign is baseless and offensive. Katie will continue to have no comment on personal and private matters  that affect her family.’ The 38-year-old actress is believed to have divorced Cruise last year because of her long-held concerns over Cruise’s status as one of the leading figures in the Church of Scientology. She was said to be determined to shield her daughter from it. Another poster features a picture of Oscar-winning star Halle Berry with the headline: ‘Halle, a father is for life, not just conception.’ It reads: ‘Actress Halle Berry tried to take her daughter Nahla to live in France against her husband’s wishes.’ In fact, a judge in Los Angeles refused her application to move to France after hearing objections  from Nahla’s father, French-Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. Berry and Aubry then announced an amicable joint custody arrangement. Provocative: Fathers4Justice has attacked Kim Basinger, left, and Halle Berry, right, with slogans like 'a father is for life not just conception'. The group claims the celebrities have denied their exes access to their children . Protest: A Fathers4Justice member dressed as Spiderman. The group regularly goes for high-profile stunts . The poster targeting Kim Basinger, who has daughter called Ireland with Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin, is headlined: ‘Kim, never hate your ex more than you love your child.’ The advert claims that Ms Basinger ‘fought’ with Mr Baldwin over his access rights to  their daughter. Baldwin blamed the stress of a seven-year custody battle on his decision to leave an angry voicemail message in which he called his daughter, then aged 11, a ‘rude, thoughtless, little pig’. Last night a spokesman for Fathers4Justice said the crummy mummy adverts were part of its ongoing campaign against the ‘fatherless society’. He added: ‘As an organisation we strongly believe in 50/50 shared parenting and are concerned that contact denial – where one parent denies a child access to the other parent, normally the father – is not only increasing, but is a serious human rights violation and an abuse of a child’s right to their father. ‘The behaviour of female role models shapes public thinking and we will promote those  celebrity mothers who support shared parenting while naming those who fail to support it.’ Fury: Kate Winslet threatened to sue Fathers4Justice over an advert, left, which she said misquoted her. Right, Katie Holmes with her and Tom Cruise's daughter Suri, who she reportedly wanted to shield from Scientology . The group claims that 200 children lose contact with their fathers every day in secret family courts, that half of court orders are broken and not enforced, and that there are 3.8 million fatherless children  in Britain. The first advert appeared after Kate Winslet said in an interview: ‘My kids don’t go back and forth. None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.’ Fathers4Justice then produced a poster that said: ‘Kate, every child deserves a father for Christmas.’ Her lawyers said it was ‘misleading and defamatory’. Ms Winslet’s ex-husband, director Sam Mendes, father of her son Joe, also expressed his disapproval of the campaign, saying: ‘It is inappropriate for this organisation to involve my family and me when they know nothing of our personal circumstances. While I fully support fathers’ rights, I can state this has never been a concern for me or my son.’ Kim Basinger and Halle Berry declined to comment.","Ms Holmes is being attacked alongside Halle Berry and Kim Basinger .

"By . Kate Lyons . Andrew Thomas can still remember the moment in August 1992 that he received a call offering him a position in the astronaut program at NASA. 'I remember putting the phone down and thinking, wow, my life has just changed in ways I can't begin to imagine. How does this happen? A kid from Adelaide has just joined NASA,' he told MailOnline. With the offer, Dr Thomas, 62, became the first Australian to travel into space. He has just hung up his space helmet, retiring after a 22-year career with NASA, which has seen him undertake four space flights, 177 days in orbit, a visit to the Mir space station, and a space walk. Scroll down for video . Left: Andrew Thomas (left) films a colleague in 2005 during the Return to Flight mission following the Columbia accident. Right: Dr Thomas preparing to launch on the 2005 mission, which was his last space flight . Andrew Thomas completed four space flights during his 22 years as an astronaut. On his 1998 stay on the Mir space station he went on a six and a half hour space walk. Pictured: Another astronaut on Dr Thomas's 2005 space walk undertaking a space walk . On each of his four missions Dr Thomas took with him an artefact from Australian exploration history. For his first mission, a flight on-board the space shuttle Endeavour in 1996, Dr Thomas took a fragment of wood from Captain James Cook's HMS Endeavour, from which the shuttle got its name. 'I wonder what Captain Cook would have thought about a piece of the ship orbiting the earth,' he said to MailOnline. On his subsequent trips, the artefacts he carried included a slide rule from Douglas Mawson's Antarctic expedition, the watch worn by aviator Charles Kingsford-Smith, and the pilot wings of Ross Smith, who was the first person to fly from London to Australia in less than 30 days. Carrying the objects was a way to honour the history of Australian exploration, something that was particularly important to Dr Thomas, who had to take up dual U.S. citizenship to become an astronaut, and was launched into space wearing a U.S. flag, not an Australian one, emblazoned on his space suit. Dr Thomas grew up in Adelaide during the space race and watched in awe as the first humans ventured into space. 'I had a bent toward things spacey. I had read science fiction, I had read space books, and then seeing things unfold in the space race made it all very real,' he said. 'But of course for a kid growing up in Adelaide it wasn't a real prospect at all.' Dr Thomas received a first-class honours degree and later a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Adelaide but said that if someone had told him at his graduation ceremony that his career would see him follow his astronaut heroes he simply would not have believed them. 'I would have thought someone was on drugs. It's totally absurd. It wasn't until my late 20s that I realised I had accrued the sort of credentials that might make this possible, and then I made a very serious commitment to pursuing it.' The commitment included moving to the U.S., being selected from thousands of applicants, subjected to psychological evaluations and interviews, as well as a 'very serious medical examination' in which he said 'they poke and prod at you in ways that you couldn't begin to imagine.' A proud Australian: Dr Thomas tries on various patriotic outfits in the lead-up to embarking on the US space shuttle Endeavour . Dr Thomas spent more than four months living on the Mir space station (pictured) in 1998. In preparation for the trip he spent a long time training in Russia and said that being a cosmonaut seemed even more far-fetched than being an astronaut .

Unique viewpoint: Thomas's missions gave him the rarest of opportunities,  with this picture showing an inverted Discovery over the ISS, and the Earth in the background . High above the world: The International Space Station has been visited by a select few astronauts since its construction began in 1998 . His first flight was not until 1996, when he travelled on the space shuttle Endeavour. Before take-off he remembers lying on the launch pad thinking, 'I don't know how the next 10 minutes are going to go.' 'It's the most extraordinary ride you can ever imagine,' he said. During its first orbit, the space shuttle flew over Australia and the premier of South Australia had encouraged Adelaide's residents to turn on their lights at the time the space shuttle was due to fly over the city. 'And they did and I saw it, it was amazing,' he said. Dr Thomas said that Australia is actually very easy to spot from space. 'It is so strikingly red, it contrasts against the blue ocean. I remember many great views of Australia, flying over it.' Other highlights for Dr Thomas included seeing the Aurora Australis – 'these beautiful green, iridescent, shining, shimmering lights over Antarctica' – and completing a six-and-a-half hour space walk. 'I was high up on the trusses, on the dark side of the earth and I turned away from the space station. 'It was a blackness that was absolutely amazing, I've never seen anything as black and dark as looking out into infinity, just seeing the space station suspended in that nothingness.'

(Right) on the same flight another astronaut on a space walk . Earth-rise: Dr Thomas grew up in Adelaide during the space race and said he was always interested in space, but never dreamed that he could actually become an astronaut . Andrew Thomas (front left) and the crew of the 2005 mission following the Columbia accident pose for a photo in zero gravity. Dr Thomas said that scuba-diving was the closest approximation to zero gravity and scuba-diving was a key way of training for a space mission . In 1998, Dr Thomas spent 130 days aboard the Russian Space Station Mir and was the last astronaut from NASA to visit it. He said that life in zero gravity is 'very unnatural' but something he adjusted to very quickly. 'It's a great feeling,' he said. 'Scuba-diving is the nearest approximation, but even when you're scuba-diving there is a definite up and down, but in space there is no up.' This presents a particular problem for sleeping, he said, which requires the astronaut to tie their sleeping bag somewhere and zip themselves in. 'You zip yourself in or you'll float out of it during the night,' he said. Dr Thomas is married to a fellow astronaut, American Shannon Walker, with whom he lives in Houston, Texas. She went on her first space flight in 2010, an experience which gave Dr Thomas 'a much deeper appreciation for what [people] go through when they watch their better halves launch'. Initial fears give way to enjoyment of the experience, and in the end as he watched his wife launch 'there's a certain amount of envy actually and you think that's fantastic.' Apart from a wish that he could have visited the moon, Dr Thomas says he has no complaints about his extraordinary career. He will spend his retirement building a house on some ranch property that he and his wife purchased in central Texas and doing speaking engagements. 'I think I've got a good story to tell. To tell young people to aim high – the sky is not the limit!' Left: Dr Thomas arrives at the Kennedy Space Center in his jet in 2005.

A marketing company is reported to have hired people to pose as customers and contact branches of Sainsbury’s where the brand has been removed from shelves. A marketing company is reported to have hired people to pose as customers and contact branches of Sainsbury's where Typhoo tea has been removed from shelves . Intelligent Marketing Solutions allegedly paid field workers to lobby the supermarket chain to stock the tea via Twitter, Facebook, email, letter or the phone. The company, which is based in Thame, Oxfordshire, is alleged to have sent an email saying: ‘We have been asked by our client to contact Sainsbury’s by the following methods [email, Facebook etc] to ask why they no longer stock Typhoo tea in a specific store (the stores will be listed) and to ask if this product can be restocked. ‘Rates of pay are £1.50 per call, with the exception of the letter and telephone assignment, which are paid at £2.50.’ The email, which was reportedly sent to IMS field workers, did not mention that they should identify themselves as marketing staff. It added: ‘You will be provided with a Sainsbury’s store for each call, but this may not be a store near you. 'However, because this is an online assignment, this will have no bearing on you conducting this assignment successfully.’ Intelligent Marketing Solutions allegedly paid field workers to lobby the supermarket chain to stock the tea via Twitter, Facebook, email, letter or the phone (stock picture) The email did not identify the client, which could be Typhoo tea, another marketing company or simply a wealthy customer who desired its return to the stores. The campaign was reportedly due to start today, but field workers are believed to have been told over the weekend that it is now on hold. IMS specialises in field marketing including face-to-face promotion of a product and mystery shopping, which involves its employees going into a store as ordinary consumers and giving feedback. But there is no mention on its website of a service in which its staff directly contact companies to ask them to stock certain brands. Typhoo tea has been steeped in British history since it was launched in Birmingham in 1903 by grocer John Sumner and it was the first brand of tea to be sold pre-packaged rather than loose. The company is now owned by Apeejay Surrendra Group, one of the largest tea producers in India.IMS and Typhoo were both unavailable for comment yesterday and neither provided a comment when they were contacted by other newspapers last week. A spokesman for Sainsbury’s said: ‘We always aim to offer our customers a choice and we do stock Typhoo tea in some of our stores. ‘But from time to time we have to remove lines so that we can increase the availability of the products that are the most popular with our customers.’","Company allegedly paid field workers to lobby Sainsbury's outlets .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The secret 'first son' of Lucian Freud has lost his bid to secure a share of the artist's £96million fortune following a dispute in the High Court. Paul McAdam Freud is legally accepted, but not proven, to be Freud's first son from a relationship with fashion student Katherine McAdam in the 1950s. Mr McAdam Freud, brother of fashion designer Bella Freud, was fighting a clause in his father's will which meant he would inherit none of the money. He was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist's estate is handed to. Paul McAdam Freud (left), an alleged 'secret son' of elusive artist Lucian Freud (right), has lost a High Court battle to lift the lid on the beneficiaries of Freud's will, and potentially secure part of it for himself . At the time of Freud's death three years ago, Diana Rawstrom, his trusted solicitor, and Rose Pearce, one of his daughters, were the sole beneficiaries. After legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £42million. But they have since revealed Freud secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others, without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved. Mr McAdam Freud tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate, but he failed in his attempt today. If he had succeeded it would also have meant Freud would have died largely intestate, and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin, a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was 'at least 14'. Lucian's only legitimate offspring, two daughters named Annie and Annabel, came from his marriage to Kitty Garman - a muse of his whom he married in 1948. However, he had another four children by  Suzy Boyt, a student he had met at the Slade school of art in the Fifties, and another four, including Paul McAdam Freud and sisters Jane, Bella and Esther, by Kathleen McAdam. After Kathleen left him in 1966, it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years. The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, a close friend of Lucian's, estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime, while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30. Revealing the true beneficiaries of Freud's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery, but following today's ruling, only Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce will know who receives the money. Speaking at the High Court today, the judge said he could ‘readily understand’ Mr MacAdam Freud’s concerns about the secrecy of the will, from which he stood to gain nothing. ‘There is a lot of money involved here, so I fully understand these are important issues,’ he said, before ruling that Mrs Rawstrom’s and Mrs Pearce’s interpretation of the will made ‘common sense’. Freud made his fortune through his portrait work, thought by many to be the best of his generation. His most famous work, 'Benefits Supervisor Sleeping' (pictured), sold for a world-record $33.8million in 2008 . Freud's portraits often featured nudes of  his friends and family. This portrait is of his daughter, Bella . Although, on the face of it, the will appeared to give the £42 million to Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce ‘absolutely’, they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality. ‘They wish to respect the deceased’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary,’ their barrister, Michael Furness QC, earlier told the court. The judge said it had ‘at one time been disputed’ that Mr McAdam Freud was the artist’s son from his relationship with fashion student, Katherine McAdam, in the 1950s. But it had been accepted, at least for the purposes of the court hearing, that he was ‘another of Lucian Freud’s children’. By his will, the artist specifically left a £2.5m tax-free gift and a house in west London to his assistant of more than 20 years, David Dawson. A second clause instructed Mrs Pearce and Mrs Rawstron to dispose of ‘chattels’ on the basis of instructions given during his life. One of Freud’s works was also given to the National Gallery in lieu of inheritance tax.","Freud left estate after legacies and tax - about £42million - to his solicitor Diana Rawstrom and one of his daughters Rose Pearce .

"By . Daniel Mills . Leura, in the Blue Mountains, was one of the regions which received a healthy splattering of snow on Friday . Australians are bracing for a wild weekend of winter chills as a cold-snap brings snowfall and extreme winds to many parts of the country. Residents living in Sydney's scenic Blue Mountains were treated to a splattering of snowfall on Friday night, as the first pictures of white atop the ranges appeared on Twitter around the Katoomba and Lithgow region. Further afield it was Bathurst, about three hours from the city, which copped an unexpected overnight overnight drenching of snow as residents braved the plummeting temperatures. The opening of the heavens ended Sydney's spell of above average temperatures which peaked on Thursday with a top of 25 degrees celcius. The mercury climbed to temperatures just shy of the record July 24 date, set 14 years ago, when the city was hit with a top of 25.9 degrees. Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Peter Zmijewski told the Sydney Morning Herald that snow had been forecast to fall down to 600 metres across the Blue Mountains and Central Tablelands.

The state's snow resorts also copped a fresh coating of powder with up to 15cm falling at Thredbo on Friday and 27cm bucketing over Perisher in the past 48 hours. In Victoria, residents of Ballarat froze through a night of below-zero temperatures with the temperature gauge plummeting to -5. The cold-snap brought snow, blanketing the town with 5cm of icy powder making for some of the heaviest snow fall in Ballarat in recent years. A Weatherzone spokesperson said the 'super cold temperatures' were produced in the wake of a vigorous cold front which not only swept across Victoria. Canberrans and South Australians were also met with minor snow falls and weather experts are anticipating more ahead for the weekend. Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Brown said he had heard reports of snow falling around the Canberra region on Friday although he said any sighting would have been fleeting. 'I've heard reports that there has been snow falling around the Canberra region, but most likely around the elevated areas and higher peaks around Canberra, not the city itself,' he said. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast 'a brief snow shower' around the higher peaks of the Adelaide Hills and Flinders Ranges in South Australia. region. Peaks of up to 600m at Mt Lofty and 700m further north are in line for snow fall. Snowfall fell over the Blue Mountains ranges in Bathurst about three hours west of Sydney .

"By . Kate Lyons . Matt-Dillion Shannon has been denied parole for the second time. He was sentenced to three years' in jail for setting another boy on fire at a birthday party . A teenager who poured petrol on another teenager and set him alight in a 'Jacka**-style prank' has been denied parole on the grounds that he may still pose a risk. Matt-Dillion Shannon, 19, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment after he celebrated turning 17 by setting Hayden Calder, then 16, alight in August 2012 at his own birthday party. Mr Calder attended the birthday party in Hastings, New Zealand, along with 70 other people, but about midnight became tired and went to Shannon's bedroom where he sat on the floor. He told the court that Shannon entered the room and picked up a 10-litre plastic petrol container before leaving, reported Fairfax NZ. Shannon returned to the room with eight other people and told the others to grab Mr Calder and then three people held him down. 'He [Shannon] was laughing. He picked up the petrol can and was pouring it over me. It felt wet and warm. I thought it was just water. When I figured out it wasn't, I freaked out,' Mr Calder told police in an interview that was played in the court. When Shannon pulled a lighter from his pocket Mr Calder pleaded with him not to harm him. 'I said, “Matt, please don't do this.” I was begging him,' Fairfax NZ reported. Shannon held the lighter to Mr Calder's T-shirt  and flames ran up the garment, onto Mr Calder's neck and face. He told the police that the pain was incomprehensible. Mr Calder, who was 16 at the time of the incident, required hospital treatment for his injuries, which he said were excruciating . 'It was the most excruciating thing you could imagine, times 10,' he said. Mr Calder was held down for about 20 seconds before he was able to run out of the room. He pulled off his T-shirt, which was still on fire, and rode home on his bicycle, shirtless. Fairfax NZ reported that Sally Calder, the victim's mother, heard her son screaming as he approached the house. He was taken to the hospital and treated in the intensive care unit for burns to his body. At court Shannon claimed that he was attempting a 'Jackass-style' prank on Mr Calder who was very drunk and had vomited through Shannon's bed. He also claimed to have only poured a shot glass of petrol on Mr Calder. However, Mr Calder claimed he had not been drinking at the party as he was recovering from glandular fever, and police found no sign of vomit at the scene. He insisted that Shannon had poured petrol on him straight from a cosntainer. Shannon pleaded guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with reckless disregard but not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. His lawyer, Bill Calver, said Shannon thought Mr Calder would 'roll around, put the fire out, no harm done, and it would be a big laugh for all those present'.","Matt-Dillion Shannon poured petrol over a friend and set him on fire .

"By . Steph Cockroft . An academic who stripped off in front of 200 students during a lecture has been let off with a warning. Dr Ian Lamond, an events management lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University, stripped down to his underpants in an apparent attempt to teach his first-year students how to pitch to clients. The 51-year-old began the striptease by draping his jacket over the front row of desks where the students were sitting. Scroll down for video . Dr Ian Lamond, 51, an events management lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan university, stripped off down to his underpants while teaching first-year students - but has been let off with a warning . The academic, who reportedly carried out the stunt in a bid to teach the students how to pitch to clients, draped his jacked over the front row of desks before removing the rest of his clothes - except for his underpants, glasses and socks . Photos then show the lecturer undoing his purple shirt and tie, before removing his trousers - until he was stood wearing just glasses, grey underpants and socks. But Dr Lamond has been left off with a warning, following an investigation by Leeds Metropolitan University. In a statement, the university said: 'An internal investigation has taken place. The University has clarified its expectations in lecture delivery and so the matter is now closed.' Dr Lombard did not want to comment on the incident, but did not deny any of the claims. He said: 'The university is a big institution. All communication must go through them. I am happy for my response to come through them.' A source added: 'He is still in post. He has been given a warning but no sanctions.' The bizarre incident took place while Dr . Lamond was taking a lecturer in front of events management students . about how to pitch to clients. Stunned students went online soon after the incident, with one tweeting: 'I literally have no idea what is going on right now, why is my lecturer semi naked.. and now painting his face white..' And another told her friend: 'Ian Lamond is stripping and shaving to try and convey a point but I really have no clue what is going on!' A video of the incident was also posted online. It shows students chuckling in their seats as Dr Lamond marches around the front of the lecture hall, holding up his clothes. No students complained directly about the lecturer's behaviour but the university launched an investigation after spotting the picture on Twitter. Students in the lecture began tweeting their surprise as the incident unfolded . Another tweeted her friend say Dr Lamond was carrying out the performance to 'convey a point' - but that she had no idea what was going on . He was not suspended from the role during the investigation, but was not teaching during most of the interim period due to most students having finished for summer. Dr Lamond completed his PhD in . arts and culture policy at Sheffield Hallam University in 2012 and has . since studied political activism while lecturing on the £9,000-a-year . university course. In a recent interview with a careers website, he boasted about his '(cough) ""athletic physique""'. Telling . the website about his job, he said: 'What I am really enjoying is the . combination of lecturing, particularly when I'm in-front of a cohort of . 200 plus events students in one of the larger lecture theatres, and . research. It's that voracious curiosity and performer in me I guess. An investigation was launched by Leeds Metropolitan University, pictured above, after the incident. A spokesman said the university had 'clarified its expectations in lecture delivery' 'Unless you are passionate you cannot enthuse your students, your colleagues and, importantly, yourself.' Chris McGovern, Chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, criticised both the lecturer and the university. He said: 'University lecturers should focus on teaching students rather than on stripping for them. 'This episode brings higher education into disrepute. It illustrates an arrogant contempt for students; many of whom make sacrifices to attend university and incur considerable debt. 'Equally worrying is that Leeds Metropolitan University has recently had its standards and quality confirmed by “The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). 'This means it can market itself under the QAA Quality Mark to prospective student in the UK and abroad.'","Dr Ian Lamond, 51, stripped off during an events management lecture .

"By . Kate Lyons . A civilian crew damaged a $1.5 billion 27,000 tonne warship to be known as HMAS Canberra, when they took it out on a test cruise between Sydney and Melbourne, it has been reported. The hull of the Landing Helicopter Dock was damaged and its electrical systems melted down during the ship’s first 'shakedown cruise', which tests a ship’s performance before it enters service. The crew from Teekay Shipping Corporation who crewed the vessel encountered two problems, both of which were the result of user error, reported The Daily Telegraph. The HMAS Canberra had an electrical meltdown and had its hull damaged during a test voyage by a civilian crew . A source said the first issue occurred when the electric powered pods at the stern of the ship were operated independently in low-speed mode when the ship was travelling at high speed, when they should have been operated in tandem, which caused serious vibrations across the ship. A source told The Daily Telegraph: 'It was like the shaking floor in an amusement park house of fun. 'Once the pods were back in the correct mode the vibration ceased.' The vibration caused paint to be stripped form the ship’s hull, though damage was minimal. Both issues were the result of user error and occurred during a 'shakedown cruise' from Sydney to Melbourne in May . The vessel is the first of the two Landing Helicopter Docks that are being built for the Australian Navy. The HMAS Canberra should be commissioned later in the year . Length: 230.82 m . Displacement: 27,500 tonnes . Speed: Maximum of 20 knots . Carrying capacity: Up to 110 vehicles, 1,600 troops . Cost to build: $1.5 billion each . The HMAS Canberra is one of two Landing Helicopter Dock ships being built for the Royal Australian Navy, the other, the HMAS Adelaide is still being fitted out. The will be the largest vessels ever operated by the RAN. They will likely be operated out of Townsville in Queensland. The HMAS Canberra also reportedly suffered an electrical power failure when the crew forgot to disconnect the emergency power, resulting in the circuit breakers melting. The error resulted in the vessel losing steerage and forced the crew to drop anchor for four hours. The source told The Daily Telegraph that 'There were no major design errors during the trials and both issues were operator errors.' A spokesperson for Teekay Shipping Australia, who supplied the crew for the sea trial denied the claims that any problems occurred during the sea trial due to user error. '[C]laims that the hull of the HMAS Canberra was damaged and that an electrical system melted down are fallacious,' he said. 'The claim that Teekay seastaff were negligent resulting in damage to the vessel is completely false.' The Canberra is the first of two Landing Helicopter Docks being built for the Australian navy. Other problems detected during the shakedown cruise were corrosion in propeller nuts and a small crack in the hull of the ship, caused by the long barge journey made by the ship from Spain, where it was built. The next round of sea trials for the ship will be in July and she is due to be handed to the navy later this year.

"By . Chris Pleasance . One diver experienced a real life trout pout after puckering up for a smacker with a fishy friend. Photographer Cesare Naldi, 36, from Napoli, Italy, captured the moment a grouper fish popped its head out of a hole and landed an underwater kiss on diver Maurilio Mirabella's lips. The tender moment happened when Maurilio was diving in the waters of Roatan, Honduras, and decided to make friends. Pucker up: Maurillo Mirabella shares a tender moment with a grouper fish while diving near Honduras . Photographer Cesare Naldi, 36, captured the moment the grouper fish swam from its hiding place among some rocks and moved in for a kiss . The fish popped out of its hole and let Maurilio embrace it and even have a kiss. Photographer Cesare said: 'To take these pictures I used standard scuba diving equipment, but the guide that came with us had extra equipment for cave diving including double oxygen tank and lights. Grouper fish are often a favourite find of snap-happy scuba divers, due to their impressive size and the fact that they are largely unafraid of humans . 'I couldn't believe I managed to shoot such unique pictures. The fish was very friendly with the diver and even let him hug and kiss on the lips which was amazing to watch.' The Nassau grouper fish, which live in warm waters around the world including in Honduras, Florida, Brazil, Panama and Columbia, can grow up to 4ft long and weigh as much as 55lb. They are often found hiding in shipwrecks and reefs, preferring to stay hidden in cracks and crevices. They are carnivorous, eating smaller fish and other small crustaceans. Grouper were once common, congregating in groups thousands strong around spawning time in December and January, usually to coincide with a full moon. However, thanks to their large size and peaceful demeanor, numbers dwindled as they were hunted for food and for sport - as their impressive bulk makes for a good trophy. Habitat destruction has also helped cause this decline, as the fish need large reef systems to hunt and breed in. They are now listed as endangered and have protected status in the U.S., though as stocks have recovered in recent years, officials are now considering removing this protection.","Maurillo Mirabella was scuba diving in sea off Honduras when he saw fish .

"By . Chris Pleasance . From the surface, Natural Trap Cave doesn't look like much. Its entrance is just 12ft by 15ft wide, and so well hidden that you cannot see it until you've almost fallen in. But hidden below the ground is a cavern 85ft deep and 120ft wide. Piled up on the floor underneath the opening is a 30ft deep mound of bones from extinct animals. And now, for the first time in more than 30 years, scientists are preparing to descent into the depths of the cave to inspect the remains, some of which are more than 100,000 years old. For the first time in 30 years, Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming is being opened to scientists to excavate a pile of ancient animal bones, some up to 100,000 years old, piled  30ft deep on the floor of the cavern . The incredible treasure-trove of bones built up over thousands of years as unsuspecting animals fell to their deaths, unable to see the entrance until it was too late. Among the bones at the bottom of the pit are extinct mammoths, short-faced bears, American lions and American cheetahs. Despite the huge number of bones in the cave, scientists have ruled out the possibility that the beasts were deliberately driven there by humans, and instead think that the cave's position along a migration route means they fell in naturally - hence the name. The entrance to the cave is just 12ft by 15ft wide, and is invisible until you have almost fallen in. Thousands of animals plunged to their deaths because of this, and their bones are still down there . Most of the animals would have been instantly killed as they plunged into the cavern, but if they did survive the drop on to the pile of corpses below, then the low temperatures of 40F and high humidity of 98 per cent would have quickly finished them off. The cave was explored once before, in the mid 1970s, by a team from the University of Kansas but in the 1980s the U.S. Bureau of Land Management sealed over the entrance with a metal grate, and nobody has dared to venture inside since, until now. Des Moines University paleontologist Julie Meachen said she has been getting ready to lead the international team of a dozen researchers and assistants by hitting the climbing gym. 'I'm pretty terrified,' Meachen admitted Wednesday. She hasn't done any real climbing before, she said, and the only way in is to rappel down. The only way out is an eight-story, single-rope climb all the way back up. Even Bureau of Land Management regional paleontologist Brent Breithaupt, who isn't one to be put off by lots of animal bones, describes it as a tad creepy. 'One can only hope that, as a researcher, you're able to leave,' said Breithaupt, who visited the cave as a college student the last time it was open to scientists. 'It's an imposing hole in the ground. But one that actually has very important scientific value.' However, braving the conditions will be worth it to give scientists what may be their best look yet at the variety of critters that roamed the foothills of the Bighorn Mountains during the planet's last glacial period, around 25,000 years ago. Some mammal remains from the cave could be over 100,000 years old, Breithaupt said. The remote site is exceptionally well preserved. A mound of dirt and rock containing layer upon layer of animal bones rises from the floor of the bell-shaped chamber. Meachen believes the remains will be in good enough condition to contain snippets of genetic information. Co-investigator Alan Cooper with the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide will attempt to retrieve fragments of mitochondrial DNA from the bones, Meachen said. Entrance: 12ft by 15ft . Depth: 85ft . Width: 120ft . Average summer temp: 40F (4C) Average humidity: 98 per cent . Height of animal bones pile: 30ft . Oldest skeleton: 100,000 years old . Last time it was explored: 30 years ago . Such analysis wasn't possible the last time scientists dug in the cave and could shed light on how the animals were related to their modern counterparts and each other. 'It's so cold all year long, that it has got just the perfect conditions for preserving DNA, in multiple species, in large numbers of individuals,"" Meachen said. 'Which is not really found anywhere except Siberia and the Arctic.' Starting Monday, scientists will lower dig lights into the cave, powered by a generator on the surface, before dropping in to re-explore the cavern, dig and extract as many fossils over a two-week period as possible. A National Science Foundation grant will enable additional excavations in 2015 and 2016. One goal is to learn more about the Pleistocene extinction, when climate change and possibly the arrival of humans in North America at least 13,000 years ago wiped out dozens of species. The scrubby, rocky country surrounding the cave probably looks much like it did back then, though the climate may have been cooler and wetter, Meachen said. The scientists will camp out nearby and venture into the cave a couple of times a day. Ropes will haul bones up top in boxes, Meachen said. 'I don't think it's necessarily going to be easy,' she said. 'But I think we're going to be pretty well prepared.'","Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming to be reopened for first time in 30 years .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Just a few years ago, finding an England football fan openly supporting the German team would have been almost unheard of. So it is perhaps surprising that, during the World Cup final, English fans will be flocking to support the old rival Germany against a newer rival in Argentina. Sir Geoff Hurst, England's hat-trick hero of 1966, has already pledged his support, as has UK Prime Minister David Cameron, as Germany's stylish football and impressive attitude has won the country over. In a final between two old enemies of English football, English fans seem to be backing old rivals Germany over newer adversaries Argentina . Champions elect: The Germans played some scintillating football to beat hosts Brazil in the semi-final . Together: The German performances and team spirit has drawn support from English fans . Hurst told the Sun on Sunday: 'I know England supporters will be shocked to see me backing the Germans but they are the tournament's best team. 'They are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined, strong and proud.' While . the Argentinians are capable of playing with flair and style, . particularly when Lionel Messi performs, the Germans have been excellent in Brazil, particularly in their semi-final annihilation of the hosts. David . Cameron is also lending his support to our European neighbours, though . it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with Chancellor . Angela Merkel. Mr . Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in Wednesday's . crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark . Rutte 'furiously'. But after the Dutch crashed out on penalties Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans. England's hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst (left, holding captain Bobby Moore), who helped England to victory over the Germans in 1966 has come out in support of the European team over the South Americans . Seventh heaven: The German's 7-1 thrashing of Brazil sees them go into the final as favourites . England and Germany have plenty of history, both on and off the field. Alf Ramsey's side beat the Germans 4-2 in 1966 to win the World Cup, thanks . to two controversial goals from Hurst - one which hit the bar and bounced over the line, and another at the end of . extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch. It . was Germany who knocked England out of the last World Cup, beating . Capello's side 4-1 in 2010, inflicting England's heaviest World Cup defeat . thanks in part to a disallowed goal from Frank Lampard. Of course, in terms of real-world rivalries, the two World Wars are what made Germany into the enemy in the first place. For German fans, a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly-men, making the semi finals or finals of the last four World Cups without a win . If Argentina were to emerge victorious it would mark the third World Cup win in the country's history . Meanwhile, . on the Argentine side, the Falklands war and the still-bitter argument . over the islands has done nothing to endear English minds to the . prospect of an Argentine win. On . the pitch, Diego Maradona's 'hand of God' moment, when he scored . against England from an unpenalised handball in 1986, still sticks in . the memory, as does the memory of Diego Simeone hitting the turf after . being tapped on the leg by David Beckham in 1998. Given the animosity that most England supporters feel towards the two nations, it is almost a shame that they cannot both lose. But when it comes to picking a winner, it seems that the English are choosing to back the Europeans over the South Americans.","Germany and Argentina meet in World Cup final on Sunday night .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A police officer risked his own life to save a suspected drunk driver after the man ran on to a busy freeway and laid down in the road during a traffic stop. Patrolman Matt Beck was forced to run into the path of oncoming cars and drag 340lb Richard Solis across three lanes of traffic by himself during a routine stop in Ohio. A dash-cam video taken from Beck's patrol car captures the moment that Solis, 54, runs from his vehicle and into the road, before Beck manages to rescue him. Scroll down for video . Police officer Matt Beck risked his life to rescue 340lb drunk driving suspect Richard Solis after he ran into the middle of a busy highway and laid down in the road . The incident began on July 10 after Solis was pulled over for driving erratically. But after pulling over at the side of the road, Solis runs into traffic shouting 'kill me, kill me' Solis, 54, then laid down in front of oncoming traffic, apparently waiting for a vehicle to run him over . The incident began before 11am on July 10 when Beck stopped Solis while he was driving along the I-480 near North Olmsted. Footage shows Solis pulling over to the side of the road, before leaping out of his vehicle and running on to the highway while cars and heavy trucks speed past. Beck shouts at Solis to get back into his car, while the suspect can be heard yelling: 'Kill me, kill me.' The pair disappear from the frame, but reappear again as Beck hauls Solis's body across three lanes to the side of the road. Patrolman Beck was forced to run into oncoming traffic and drag Solis to safety by himself as backup had not arrived on the scene yet . After the incident, Detective Sergeant Bob Wagner praised officer Beck, saying he did a 'great job' According to WKYC TV, Detective Sergeant Bob Wagner said: 'We are very happy with the way he handled the situation. He did a great job. 'He was waiting for backup and they weren't there yet so he pulled the man to safety all by himself.' Solis has been charged with driving under the influence and speeding.","Officer Matt Beck pulled over 54-year-old Richard Solis for drunk driving .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Updated: . 02:10 EST, 23 July 2014 . British pilot Chris Wilson, 39, died with 19 others when the plane he was controlling plummeted from the sky . A plane crash which killed a British pilot in Africa may have been caused by passengers panicking over an escaped crocodile, an inquest heard yesterday. Chris Wilson, 39, died alongside 18 others when the jet he was co-piloting plunged to the ground during a routine flight across the Congo. First Officer Wilson died instantly, alongside fellow pilot Danny Philemotte, and no cause for the crash has ever been established. But today an inquest into his death . heard a stampede may have broken out over an escaped crocodile in the . cabin, which saw passengers surge forward, causing the plane to plummet. The only . surviving passenger claimed the reptile spooked a cabin crew member, who . ran towards the cockpit causing the passengers to follow. Assistant Coroner David Dooley read out an email from Chris’s dad Rob to Congonese officials. 'Rob . Wilson said he had spoken to the original investigator on site who said . that there was a gentleman who came up with a story about a crocodile,' he wrote. 'There is apparently a video of the crocodile being taken out of the plane. 'They think it may have frightened the cabin crew member and she ran forward, with the other passengers following. 'The weight shift caused by the panic may have affected the plan causing it to stall.' He added: 'It would have been a maximum of two or three feet in length. 'We . don’t know if one was being carried for certain, although it was . apparently quite normal for animals and chickens to be carried on the . plane, it was used like a taxi in this regard.' The . inquest, at Gloucester Coroner’s Court, heard that Chris had moved to . the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010 after giving up his job as a . cabin crew member with a British airline to follow his dreams of . becoming a commercial pilot. He began to fly for local company Filair to carry out the required 1,000 hours of flying needed to get a licence. Chris had already completed one stint with the company, and on June 24 went back for another three month attachment. Today an inquest into Wilson's death heard that the crash may have been caused by passengers stampeding to the front of the plane after a crocodile escaped from a passenger's holdall . Gloucester Coroner's Court heard that Wilson was flying with African airline Filair to train for his licence, but had told family members he didn't want to work there because it was dangerous . But . he became more and more concerned about the state of the airline and . the flying ability of Mr Philemotte, who also owned the company. In . a statement read to the court, Chris’s brother Martin said: 'Every time . he flew with Mr Philemotte there was always one incident or another. 'He said he didn’t want to fly with him anymore. He said if it wasn’t for the fact they could see where they were going . they wouldn’t ever get anywhere because Philemotte couldn’t read the . instruments. 'He said he didn’t know how Philemotte was still alive his flying was so bad.' Chris . also told his brother how passengers would walk around, making the . plane unstable, and would stand up when they were supposed to have their . seat belts on. It was also . commonplace for passengers to take animals on planes, the inquest heard, . and local media reports at the time claimed the crocodile had escaped from a passenger’s holdall. 'He didn’t really want to go back there but he wanted to get his flying hours in,' Martin added. The . inquest heard Chris had been flying from the capital, Kinshasa, to . Bandundu airport on August 25, 2010, when the tragedy happened. The . small plane, which was full to capacity with passengers, was beginning . its descent to land when it suddenly 'fell out the sky like a leaf'. A number of different explanations had been put forward for the sudden crash, but none had been proven, the inquest was told. The inquest heard that animals were commonplace on flights as people often took chickens on board to take them to market. The crocodile was thought to be between two and three foot and was stored in a holdall . Wilson who was piloting a Let 410 turbo prop (pictured) at the time of the crash, said co-pilot and airline owner Danny Philemotte was so bad at flying he he was surprised he hadn't killed himself already . Mr . Dooley said evidence had been put forward about a fuel shortage, the . over-loading of the plane, pilot error, an engine failure, maintenance . issues and a mass surge of passengers to the front of the plane. Timothy . Atkinson, an air accident investigator, said he had reviewed the . evidence given to him by Congolese authorities but was unable to draw . any definitive conclusions because they had not handed over the black . box. He said: 'To date we have no information from the black box reader, it has been almost four years since the accident. 'The aircraft struck a mud and brick building with a straw roof, and it came to a rest against another one on the ground. 'The most likely explanation I can find is that the aircraft stalled, or was in a spin prior to impact. 'There is no evidence suggesting an engine failure although I cannot be sure without looking at the plane. 'It . would reinforce the idea that the accident appears to have the . hallmarks of a stall and spin, which may have been from a variety of . causes. Essentially, it fell out of the sky.' The court heard sabotage of the plane may also have been a possibility as rival companies fiercely competed for business. Mr . Dooley said there was not enough evidence to conclude any one of the . factors had caused the crash, and said contradicting evidence had been . presented. Recording an open conclusion, he said: 'Problems . with direct witnesses and problems with the black box have only . resulted in vague guesses as to what happened with this crash. 'All . we have are possibilities rather than probabilities. I don’t believe . any further efforts could have been made to obtain any more . information.'","Pilot Chris Wilson, 39, died in Congo in 2010 after plane fell from the sky .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A British rapper who joined rebels fighting the Syrian regime has launched a rant against anti-terror police after his family home was raided. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, tweeted to say that 'kuffar mi5' had kicked his family out of their £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, while officers carried out a search. Bary, who used to be an aspiring rapper and had his music featured on BBC Radio 1, walked out of his parents' house last year to join rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria. He tweeted: 'These kuffar mi5 have removed ma mum and fam from house and raided mum's house. 'Hip-hop jihadist': Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah' Bary launched a twitter rant against anti-terror police who raided his family home in west London calling them 'kuffar' (non-believers) and pagans . 'They have nothing to do with this, they did not even know where I am. I haven't lived at home for years you pagans.' Bary, who goes by the name Abu Klashnikov [sic] on Twitter, has since had his account suspended. A police spokesman said: 'Officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, with support from the Met Police, searched a property in Maida Vale in connection to an on-going, Syria-related investigation. 'No arrests were made and inquiries are continuing.' Earlier this year Bary claimed he was kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of rival Islamic terror groups. Posting under the name 'Terrorist', he said: 'Me & Abu Hussein al britani got kidnapped /tortured by FSA/IF scum they stole our 4 ak's and a 7mm, my vechile & our phones and cash.' Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He has posted a series of photographs online, including shots of him masked and posing with guns under the title 'soldier of Allah'. In other messages he called on Allah to 'grant us martyrdom', and praised Osama Bin Laden. Bary, whose music has featured on Radio 1, is one of six children of Adel Abdul Bary, 53. Bary used to write music under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinny and had his songs featured on BBC Radio 1 before deciding to give up his promising career to become a rebel fighter in Syria . Bary walked out of the family home last year in order to join rebels fighting in Syria. Since then he has been tweeting under the names 'Terrorist' and 'Abu Klasnikov' though his account in now suspended . Bary's father Adel Abdel was extradited from Britain to the US in 2011 after an eight-year legal battle that made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Investigators believe he was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network. He faces life in prison if convicted of involvement in the bombings of US embassies in East Africa in 1998. His son's appearance among the ranks of UK jihadists in Syria, where several Britons fighting for the militants have already been killed, will add to concerns about their potential threat to the West. Video courtesy of SBTV . Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, owned by Westminster Council. If it were sold on the open market it would be worth £1million. She travelled to Britain from Egypt in 1990 after her husband was granted refugee status. Friends said Bary's conversion to radical Islam happened as he grew increasingly frustrated with the British authorities over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it came despite his fledgling success on the underground grime music scene, where he rapped under the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny Bary appeared in dozens of videos, including one in which he posed outside the Bank of England and declared his allegiance to the global hacking group Anonymous. Connection: Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) On July 1 last year, he announced that he was turning his back on music as 'I have left everything for the sake of Allah'. It is understood that soon afterwards he travelled to Syria, where one of his oldest friends had already joined the fighting. He changed his Twitter name to Soldier of Allah and posed for pictures wearing a mask and military fatigues while carrying an AK-47 and other large assault rifles. Last November he said, 'Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom' and praised Bin Laden, calling him a 'lion'. Referring to conditions in Syria, he said it is the 'real jungle out here'.","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left Maida Vale home last year to go to Syria .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Two criminals have gone on the run after escaping from open prison, including one who was jailed for firearms offences. Philip Stephenson, 33, and Gareth Robinson, 24, fled HMP Kirkham in Lancashire together yesterday. Stephenson was serving a sentence for firearms offences while Robinson was in prison for burglary, Greater Manchester Police said. Philip Stevenson (left), who was jailed for selling or transferring an illegal firearm and possession of ammunition, has gone on the run with Gareth Robinson (right) who was jailed for burglary . Stephenson, according to the Oldham Chronicle, had been charged with selling or transferring an illegal firearm and possession of five rounds of live ammunition. They are believed to have got into a silver Volkswagen Golf before heading to the Oldham area, where they are both originally from. Detective Chief Inspector John Mazzolai said: 'Neither of these men has been seen since they escaped from prison on Saturday. Michael Wheatley, who earned the nickname 'Skull Cracker' after pistol-whipping his victims, went on the run in May before being recaptured . 'They are not to be approached by members of the public, but if anyone sees them or knows of their whereabouts, please contact GMP on 101 immediately. 'If you would prefer to pass on information anonymously, then you can do this by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. 'I would also like to remind people that if anyone is found to be assisting or harbouring these wanted men, they too will face being arrested and a possible prison sentence of their own. 'So please get in touch if you know where they are.' There has been a flurry of controversy over open prisons after a spate of inmates went on the run. In the most high-profile case, Michael Wheatley, who is known as the 'Skull Cracker', carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent in May. Wheatley is believed to have caught a train from HMP Standford Hill, Kent, to London where he raided the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames. He was arrested in Tower Hamlets, east London, where he is originally from, after a five-day manhunt. He was given the nickname 'Skull Cracker' after pistol-whipping several of his victims, including a 73-year-old woman. Stephenson and Robinson both absconded from HMP Kirkham (pictured). It is thought they then climbed into a silver Volkswagen Golf before heading to Oldham, Greater Manchester .","Philip Stephenson, 33 and Gareth Robinson, 24, have gone on the run .

"By . Chris Pleasance . When a couple in Hawaii came to buy a Jack Russell named Sally Mae for $85 from an animal shelter, staff happily handed the dog over, and took a picture to mark the occasion. But less than an hour later a very similar picture appeared on Craigslist which seemed to show the same dog up for sale - but this time for $200. The post even claimed Sally Mae was half her age, advertising her as a five-year-old dog instead of her actual age of ten. Jack Russell Sally Mae was adopted from shelter on Hawaii by couple who paid $85 - only to reappear in a Craigslist advert an hour later on sale for $200 . Followers of the Hawaii Humane Society shelter on Facebook spotted the similarities between the dogs after the woman holding Sally appeared wearing the same t-shirt. The ad claimed: 'My boyfriend and I is [sic] too caught up with work since we have 2 jobs each and she needs a family that'll give her attention. Please.' Furious website users demanded that the new owner return Sally Mae to the shelter, prompting workers from the animal home to contact the couple. While local news reports suggested that the woman initially refused to return the animal, the Hawaii Humane Society have now confirmed Sally Mae was given back to them. Jacque Vaughn, a spokesman for the shelter, said: 'Great news. Sally Mae was returned to us when the adopters recognized they could not care for her. 'She was adopted to a loving family this afternoon. We applaud them for returning her to us. They did the right thing and that's all that matters.' The ad listed Sally as five-years-old, which she is in fact ten. The shelter said they contacted Sally's owners who have now returned the animal after 'realizing they were unable to care for her' But social media users have have called the shelter's adoption process into question. Thomas Nitta wrote on the group's Facebook page saying: 'I wonder how they know these people are a loving family? Just wondering.' Callmea Cab added: 'The public outcry helped to prevent Sally Mae from being flipped on CL and more importantly made HHS realize that they need to update/revamp their adoption  policy.'","Ten-year-old Jack Russell Sally Mae adopted by couple in Hawaii .

In a TV interview, Hillary revealed details of her tense first meeting with Barack Obama after the primaries in 2008, and said when he first offered to make her Secretary of State she turned it down . Hillary Clinton has spoken about what it was like seeing Barack Obama for the first time after losing their bitter run-off battle in 2008. She described the meeting as being 'like an awkward first date between teenagers' saying the pair decided to clear the air after a brutal campaign which saw personal attacks from both sides. She said: 'We met and it was like an awkward first date between teenagers. We had a glass of wine, which helped, and tried to clear the air. 'What I told him was actually how I felt. It had been hard fought, he won I lost and I was going to do everything I could to get him elected President.' Speaking on This Morning in the UK, she also described the moment Obama decided to offer her the Secretary of State job after he won the presidential race against John McCain. She said she was aware that there were rumors the President elect would offer her a job, but she dismissed them as just rumors until she was called to the White House. Despite being bowled over by the surprise offer, she added that she initially turned it down before later accepting. During the wide-ranging interview, she also told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she hasn't decided whether to run for president herself in 2016. Hillary said that, as she was just about to become a grandmother, she was weighing up whether to run against the time she would get to spend wit her family - saying that part of what made her hesitate was being too familiar with the role. However, when speaking about her new book, she highlighted chapters on gay rights and women's rights, calling both areas 'unfinished business' - perhaps hinting at possible campaign policies. On the . issue of family, Hillary agreed that professional women faced a burden . of guilt when sacrificing time with their children for time in the . office, but urged people to try their best to fit both in. She . said that things had not always gone perfectly with her own daughter, . but added that she was very glad to have become a mother. Speaking with hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford about her husband Bill, she said she 'knew he was trouble' and turned down his proposal of marriage twice before accepting . Speaking about husband Bill, she said she 'knew he was trouble' from the start, and said she turned down his marriage proposals twice before finally agreeing. Asked about her decision to stay with him after it was revealed he had been unfaithful, Hillary said it had been a difficult choice, but ultimately turned out to be the right choice. She added: 'It is such an individual choice. For me it was a very hard choice but the right choice, to choose forgiveness and continue what had become a central part of both of our lives. 'I am very grateful that was the decision I made but I respect people who make the other choice. 'When you are in public and people are throwing their views at you, you really have to be very conscious of just listening to your own heart and not judging prematurely and that was challenging.' The interview forms part of her book promotion tour which is taking place worldwide, and included Radio interviews yesterday in which she made an embarrassing gaffe - confusing the names of Britain's main political parties. Speaking to Jenni Murray on women's hour, she suggested the Tories and Conservatives were opponents - when in fact the two names refer to the same party.","Clinton spoke about first meeting with Obama after primaries today .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Neighbours of Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney spoke of their fury yesterday over his plans to strip thousands of trees from his Scottish estate. The trees will be uprooted from the singer's 600-acre High Park Farm near Campbeltown in Argyll and Bute as part of a forestry maintenance programme. McCartney's management company is understood to have proposed to move 300 lorry loads of timber a year using a single track road. Neighbours say plans to remove 300 lorry-loads of timber a year from Sir Paul McCartney's Scottish farm down a single-track road are unsafe (McCartney pictured on the farm in 1970 with first wife Linda, left) But nearby residents already endure heavy vehicles using surrounding roads to service a quarry, and have said adding more vehicles is dangerous to pedestrians and other drivers. Colin Chrystie, of Upper Ballywilline Farm, said: 'We are already at saturation point. This wood could easily be taken out another road on McCartney's estate which joins the A83 at his Craig's Farm. 'My son and his partner have just built a house opposite me and they have a four-week-old daughter and there is no way you would want to push a pram on that road. 'It is a dangerous, single-track road with blind corners, potholes and limited passing places.' Colin lives at the foot of a steep hill which is particularly difficult for both cars and lorries to climb. He said: 'I'm not sure McCartney is even aware of this proposal. I think if he knew, he would see sense, he's a family man. Sir Paul purchased the farm in 1966 and moved there with first wife Linda and his children in 1970 after The Beatles split up . 'I've met him lots of times and think he would listen. He's always respected this area and his neighbours always protected his privacy when the media came sniffing around. 'We have been very loyal to him.' Sir Paul, 72, shocked his fans around the world when he purchased the farm in 1966. He later moved there with his wife Linda and their children for peace and quiet after the band's infamous break-up in 1970. His family used the farm to grow their own food and keep horses for riding around the local countryside. Neighbours were known to frequently send reporters looking to find High Park on wild goose chases to places as remote as the Mull of Kintyre. McCartney said the beauty of the peaceful and rugged area saved him from a nervous breakdown caused by the pressures of his stardom. Since Linda's death at the age of 56 from breast cancer in 1998 he began severing ties to the area, but there is a memorial garden in Campbeltown named in her memory. William Taverner, who also lives close to the farm, said: 'I have three young children and I am concerned about road safety. 'It is busy enough with quarry lorries. Timber lorries would be too much. 'Mr McCartney is perfectly entitled to take out his timber, I just hope he looks at this differently.' Local councillor John Semple said: 'There have already been concerns about the safety of those using Gobagrennan Road. 'It is also part of the Kintyre Way and well used by cyclists and walkers.' A spokesman for McCartney's management team, MPL, said: 'Plans for felling have been underway for some time in the interest of good forestry management. 'No decision have been made on how the wood will exit the estate. All available options are being explored taking into account a whole range of factors including impact on residents.'","McCartney bought farm in 1966 with first wife Linda and lived there in 70s .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Karen Dunlap, from Texas, had to be rushed to hospital after swallowing a piece of wire brush . A woman in Texas had to have emergency surgery after swallowing a wire bristle from a barbecue brush that got stuck to her grilled chicken. Karen Dunlap was rushed to the emergency room after eating what she thought was a piece of crispy chicken, but turned out to be a metal wire. Doctors found the offending object after Karen complained of pain radiating from her esophagus every time she swallowed. She told Fox Detroit: 'It was really the best grilled chicken he'd ever made, I was like wow! This is so good and I'm eating it and the third bite I bit down on something hard. 'I thought at first it was a charred piece of the chicken or something and as I swallowed it I realized no, this is not something I should be swallowing.' Karen's husband had used a wire scraper to clean the grill before cooking, but left one of the bristles behind which then got stuck to the food. Doctors quickly removed the offending object, after which Karen says she felt much better. The wire (pictured) stuck to the grill after Karen's husband cleaned it, then got stuck to the chicken . Experts say the wire fell off the brush after the heat of the grill loosened the plastic holding it in place . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that using metal brushes on grill can be dangerous, especially if the bristles are mounted in plastic. If the grill is hot the plastic will loosen, allowing them to slip out and stick to the grill bars and then to food. They advise only using a wire brush on a cold grill, or using a wooden spatula. While it comes with a straight edge, it will eventually char to fit around the grill bars.","Karen Dunlap was tucking into barbecue chicken her husband had cooked .

At a wedding ceremony at Lobo castle in Aguera Hills, California, the couple indulged their love of the HBO show in front of around 80 costumed guests. Julian (centre left) and Mandie (centre right), who shre a love of anything medieval, got married in a fantasy-themed wedding in California . And my sword: The couple met while playing Final Fantasy XI online and say that fantasy has always been a big part of their relationship . One ring: For the ceremony Mandie wore a tiara similar to that worn by Cate Blanchett in Lord of the Rings, along with elfin tips on her ears (left) while castle Lobo's turret and battlements made for the perfect fantasy backdrop (right) Julian, a Coder for an online beauty and skincare company, and Mandie, a sales rep in the fashion industry decided their TV show would be a 'natural fit' for their big day. The SyFy channel followed the couple on their romantic journey through the grim, dark and sexy world of Game of Thrones for their show My Big Fat Geek Wedding. Groom Julian said: 'The whole Medieval and fantasy theme has always been a big part of our relationship. We met playing Final Fantasy XI online when we were both living in New York City. 'A Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings theme seemed like a natural fit for us. Mandie is a huge fan of both series and we wanted to incorporate our geek passions into the wedding.' The bridesmaids' dresses came with a colour coordinated dragon's egg for each of them to hold - based on the eggs given to Daenerys Targaryen at her wedding in the first seasons of Game of Thrones . Some of the guests also wore bracelets themed around Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal - Daenerys' three dragons from the HBO show . Dracharys: An actress dressed as Emilia Clarke's character Daenerys even made an appearance at the wedding, alongside one of her fully-grown monsters . Iron Throne: The festivities even featured a replica model of the royal seat from Game of Thrones that characters compete to rule from . The bride, who wore a stunning figure hugging white gown, said the day was 'intense' but full of surprises. Mandie said: 'The day itself was quite hectic, a wedding day is always stressful so having a film and production crew there to make sure they got the correct shots was intense. 'The day was full of surprises, Julian's fight with Khal Drogo and Legolas was a complete surprise - as was the dragon. We're both so grateful that all our friends dressed up for the event. 'It really helped to make the wedding feel immersive and like we were all party of a medieval adventure to together. I wish we had gotten more time to enjoy the day, it went by super fast. But thankfully we have the show to relive it as often as we like.' Royal banquet: Food plays a big part in the Game of Thrones books, so it was only appropriate that Julian and Mandie were treated to a banquet of their own .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Chris Pleasance . and Aap . More than 100 days after the Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight went missing search authorities admit they have been looking in the wrong place. Based on new satellite projections, the Australian-led search operation will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the Indian Ocean. Officials also said they are confident the Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, was set to autopilot several hours before its demise into desolate and unmapped waters. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said: 'It is highly, highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings.' Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said it was 'highly, highly likely' flight MH370 was on autopilot . Mr Truss said the new phase of the search could take more than a year and involves mapping 23,000 square miles of ocean, while the previous search area was only 330 square miles . 'Certainly for its path across the Indian Ocean we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel,' Australian Transport Safety Bureau boss Martin Dolan said. Mr Truss added that officials were confident the plane ran out of fuel earlier than they had previously predicted. Mr Truss said the new search area is based on fresh analysis of existing satellite data from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. The plane vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard. Mr Truss added that the new search phase could take more than a year. It will take about three months to map the ocean floor before the search can begin. The new analysis comes days after Malaysian police said pilot Zaharie Shah, 53 (pic), is the main suspect in the disappearance . 'We could be fortunate and find it in the first hour or the first day, but it could take another 12 months,' he said. The new search area, about 1800km from the West Australian coast, has been the subject of an aerial search previously, but efforts will now head below the waves, combing the ocean floor which is some 5km deep in parts. Underlining the scale of the task, he said the previous search area covered just 330 square miles of seabed. The shift was expected as the head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Martin Dolan, said last week it would move south. 'This site is a most likely place where the aircraft is resting,' he said. 'The search is going to be painstaking – of course we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour or the first day, but it could 12 months.' Mr Truss said Australia remained dedicated to the task of solving 'this greatest aviation mystery in total history.' Two . vessels, one Chinese and one from Dutch engineering company Fugro are . currently mapping the seafloor along the so-called seventh arc, a travel . path where the plane last made contact with satellites, where depths . can exceed 16,000ft (5,000m) in parts. The . next phase of the search mission is expected to start in August and . cost of A$60 million ($56 million) or more. The search is already the . most expensive in aviation history. The . news that the plane was on autopilot comes just days after Malaysian . Airlines pilot Zaharie Shah, 53, was revealed to be the prime suspect . behind the plane's disappearance. Malaysian police made the announcement after discovering files on Shah's home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields, including several in the Indian Ocean. The files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it, but have since been recovered by detectives. Malaysia airlines flight MH370 vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard . The criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur, but the only individual arousing suspicion was Captain Zaharie. The father-of-three was found to have no social or work-related future plans, unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot, Fariq Hamid. The criminal inquiry, which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism, has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators.","Australian Deputy PM says it is 'highly likely' plane was on auto pilot .

"By . Chris Pleasance . It's a problem we all face each week, getting to laundry day only to find you don't have enough quarters for the machine. But now a company is offering to solve the problem, by mailing you $20 worth of quarters each month for the bargain price of $26.99. Or, if you don't think you'll get through that many washes, then there's the budget option of $10 worth of quarters for only $15 per month. Washboard offers to make laundry day easier for customers by offering to deliver $20 worth of quarters per month at a cost of $26.99 or $10 worth for $14.99 . Washboard was co-founded by Caleb Brown, 27, a Pittsburgh-based software developer, and Shaun Chapman, a designer based in Mountain View. Speaking to Valleywag, Brown said: 'It is a legit business. We do have customers. A few. Very few. Less than ten. 'I'll admit, it's a little bit of a negative critique, which is good. I think it's good. I think it's a polarizing thing. 'Laundry pickup services are expensive and often have long turnaround times. For many folks, the biggest pain point is simply finding enough quarters. 'Banks have long lines and close early. We put getting quarters on autopilot so you never have to worry about it again.' The website includes a calculator to help users work out how many quarters they'll need. The site's creators insist it 'is a legit business' despite having less than ten customers . On Twitter, user Matthew Bailey said: 'Washboard. When you're too rich to care about the value of a quarter yet still have to do your own laundry.' While Seth Rubenstien added: '$14.99 a month for... $10 in quarter for the laundromat. Sometimes the internet makes me sad.' Meanwhile, Cale Mooth said: Is this real? Quarter delivery service? Washboard isn't for laundering clothes, it's for laundering money.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Almost 300 people have been arrested in southern California after a month-long pedophile sting investigation. Operation Broken Heart lead to 275 arrests, including a special needs teaching assistant, a retired sheriff's deputy and a U.S. Army soldier, according to investigators. Officers posed as 12 to 14-year-olds online during the probe in scenes similar to TV show To Catch A Predator. LA deputies have arested 275 alleged pedophiles, including a special needs teaching assistant who was caught after traveling to a meeting believing they were about to have sex with two children . The mission, in May, involved dozens of local, state and federal authorities  targeting sex offenders, child sex traffickers, pimps, child porn traders and sex tourists traveling abroad. 'The dirty old man stereotype no longer applies,' said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of ICE Homeland Security Investigations, which works on the task force. 'The perpetrators in these cases come from all walks of life and virtually every strata of the socio-economic spectrum they're community leaders, white-collar professionals and even law enforcement personnel. 'The common denominator in most of these cases is the Internet. It has become the preferred playground for child sex predators.' Officers arrested the teaching assistant after they allegedly showed up to a meeting believing they were going to have sex with two children. The former LA County Sheriff's deputy was tracked down after allegedly distributing child porn over the internet, and the soldier was arrested while on leave after responding to two adverts offering underage sex. Authorities emphasized the importance of educating youth about the dangers of the Internet and insisted that parents strictly supervise and are aware of their children's online activities. 'You lock your doors and windows every night to be able to keep predators out of your home,' said Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell. The month-long To Catch A Predator-style investigation saw officers posing as children aged 12 to 14 online to ensnare potential pedophiles . 'If your child is in the next room on the Internet, you may have a predator basically sitting virtually in the next room and you're giving that predator access.' Of the arrested, California parole agents picked up 186 sex offenders for violating their terms of release. Three were found in possession of child pornography, multiple found in places where they're barred such as parks, schools and children. Of the 186 sex offenders arrested, 155 were sent back to court with recommendations to have their parole revoked. Among the others arrested was a 64-year-old computer programmer was caught after allegedly traveling to a park to try to meet with a 15-year-old child for sex. A search warrant for his home and business indicated he'd exchanged emails with multiple other children and had posted 100 advertisements looking for sex with young girls. A former substitute teacher allegedly posted a personal ad seeking sex with a father and a son. He was arrested after allegedly traveling to meet with what he believed was an 8-year-old boy. The number of arrests and potential allegations are expected to grow as forensic investigators continue analyzing seized evidence. Law enforcement conducted the operations in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.","LA deputies round up 275 alleged pedophiles in Operation Broken Heart .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Council bosses have ordered a town on . Yorkshire to take down home-knitted Tour de France bunting after . claiming the weight of the wool was causing streetlights to bend.

But yesterday workers arrived from North . Yorkshire County Council to taken them down, because officials worried the metal poles were 'leaning' under the weight of the wool after it got . wet. Council workers have forced residents in Mashman, Yorkshire, to take down bunting they knitted to celebrate the Tour de France after claiming it was bending the lamp-posts . Officials complained that the metal poles were 'leaning' under the weight of the bunting after it got wet, so residents have been told to had it on buildings or trees instead . Tour de force: Some of the impressive collection of 20,000 jerseys after they had to be removed from the route . Tessa Klemz, 45, Manager of Mashamshire Community Office, said: 'It’s health and safety gone bananas. 'Sheep don’t fall over when they get wet. If the lamp posts are that flimsy and fragile they need looking at. 'They have been there for years and we don’t think a few jerseys - that weigh nothing - are going to make any difference. “We . have not seen any bending at all and we have had more than our share of . rain. We did not want it to end up in a corner of some council . building. 'So we have taken . the bunting back and it is hanging from guttering, windows, and the . doorways and arches of houses without any problems. 'You would think the council has better things to spend our money on.' Harrogate Borough Council asked residents to knit woolen jerseys in November last year to hang around nearby villages as the tour passed through, and received entries from as far afield as Canada and Bermuda. After the entries were collected, Masham was given 40 metres of the bunting to hang from half a dozen 20ft tall lamp posts in the market square. But North Yorkshire County council, who are charged with taking care of streetlights in the town, overruled them and demanded the decorations be taken down. A county council spokesman said: 'The council is fully supportive of putting up . bunting to celebrate Yorkshire’s hosting of the Grand Depart of the Tour . de France. Sheepish: Some of the bemused knitters in the Yorkshire Dales, where the bunting has had to be removed. Tessa Klemz, 45, Manager of Mashamshire Community Office, said: 'It's health and safety gone bananas' Stockpiled: Masham was given 40 metres of the bunting to hang from half a dozen 20ft tall lamp posts . 'Indeed, the . authority is distributing four kilometres of bunting to schools, council . buildings and libraries along the Tour route to support the festivities . for this fantastic event. 'Following . Harrogate Borough Council’s erection of bunting in Masham we noticed . that the lighting columns were leaning and in the interest of safety we . asked the council to take them down as a matter of some urgency. 'We welcome bunting on buildings, or between trees, but it cannot be hung between lampposts for the safety reasons.' Jack . Hart, of The Freedom Association, said: 'The Tour de France visiting . the UK is an opportunity for us to show our community spirit at its . best. 'Yet again it appears . that a local council is ignoring the excitement of local residents in . favour of an over-zealous approach to health and safety. 'The . fact that local residents have taken the time to create home-made . bunting in order to decorate their town and welcome the Tour de France . should have been celebrated by the council, not criticised. 'Local . residents want their town to look its best, given it will have the . world’s attention on it. It’s such a shame the council has chosen to act . in such a nonsensical way.' The Tour de France begins in Leeds on 5 July with the first stage travelling to Harrogate via the Yorkshire Dales and a second stage on the 6 July from York to Sheffield. The Tour will begin in Leeds on July 5 this year before travelling to Harrogate via the Yorkshire Dales, where it will pass through Masham (pictured, Bradley Wiggins wears the race's signature yellow jersey) Bonkers: A primary school in Cumbria told pupils that they needed to wear goggles if they wanted to play with conkers . Other cases of bizarre health and safety policies include a local council in Scotland which banned a dog training club over allergy fears. The club, which had been running in a community hall for 60 years, was banned because the council claimed that those using the hall next door might be allergic to dogs or catch a disease from the pets. In June last year, a mother in Gloucester was told by the headteacher that her seven-year-old daughter was no longer allowed to wear her homemade frilly socks because they could become a tripping hazard. Meanwhile in Derbyshire, small wooden canes protecting daffodil bans were pulled out of the ground in case someone tripped over them and fell into a flowerbed. A primary school in Cumbria told pupils that they needed to wear goggles - if they wanted to play with conkers at school. The rule came after the local council attempted to ban children from playing conkers in the playground. In 2012, a Santa was not allowed to ride his float in Sutton - despite the tradition being around for decades. The ban was imposed after health and safety assessments found the sleigh too dangerous, instead Father Christmas had to walk alongside his sleigh . In 2008, children were banned from taking part in a sack race in Durham because teachers feared they would hurt themselves. Instead pupils was asked to run or skip. A town council near Manchester created a policy preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves.","Residents in Masham, Yorkshire, spent months knitting wooly jerseys .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A car enthusiast from Detroit has been reunited with his dream Corvette more than thirty years after it was stolen. The last time George Talley saw his '79 Chevrolet Corvette was in 1981 as it was parked on Jefferson Avenue, Detroit, before thieves made off with it. But authorities have tracked it down to Mississippi after noticing a suspect VIN number on the chassis, and it is now waiting at a police station in Hattiesburg. When George Talley last saw his beloved Chevrolet Corvette (pictured) it was parked in Detroit in 1981 before thieves made off with it . George filed a police report at the time, but thought the car was gone until last week when he got a call to say officers in Mississippi had tracked it down . George told WXYZ Detroit: 'I was sitting at home last Friday looking at Judge Mathis, and I get a call from AAA telling me you have a Corvette in Mississippi, come and get it. And I said, ""what?”' George told reporters that he always liked Corvettes as they were attractive cars and popular with the ladies. When the car stolen 33 years ago, he filed police report, but after officers found no trace of the vehicle he decided to forget about it. Now officers in Mississippi say the car still in working order, has only 47,000 miles on the clock, and are asking George to come and collect it. Speaking about the moment the car was found, George's friend Fred Alexander said: 'It was just exciting, I felt like I was part of finding the car. Despite some cosmetic damage, Mr Talley's Corvette is running and has just 47,000 miles on the clock . Now George is considering whether to have the car shipped to him, or whether to drive it home . Corvettes registered in 1979 are considered by many to be classic American cars, and can fetch up to $6,000 (£3,500) in good condition with around 50,000 miles. While images appear to show George's car has suffered since he last saw it, with rusted bodywork and peeling seats, it could be worth a similar amount once repaired. Now George is considering whether to have the car shipped to him, or whether to take his friends on a roadtrip to go and collect it himself.","George Talley last saw his beloved Chevrolet Corvette in July 1981 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Mark Manning, 54, went missing from his home in Lacing West Sussex two months ago. Police have now upgraded the search into a murder investigation . A murder investigation has been launched after a former military bomb disposal expert disappeared. Mark Manning, 54, who worked for a charity that removes landmines in some of the world's poorest countries, vanished nearly two months ago. Police dressed in full body suits, hair nets, gloves and masks have been searching garages behind his home after upgrading their investigation. His say his disappearance is completely out of character and he has never gone missing before. Bald Mr Manning, from Lancing, West Sussex, is described as white, 5ft 9in, clean shaven, tanned and of stocky build with blue eyes. Upgrading the investigation to murder, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Ashcroft, of Sussex Police said he was treating it as 'seriously' as possible. DCI Ashcroft said: 'Although we can't categorically prove that Mark is dead at this time, we are treating this as seriously as we can. 'His sudden disappearance is completely out of character. He is close to his family but they have not heard from him at all. 'He hasn't used his mobile phone, or carried out any financial transactions, hasn't turned up for pre-arranged appointments and meetings and there has been no reported sightings of him. 'There were no signs that he was depressed or may wish to harm himself. He seems to have vanished.

"By . Chris Pleasance . When it comes to calling the police, most children could tell you that all it takes is to pick up the phone and dial. But it seems the system confused one caller to West Midlands Police, who phoned the 999 emergency number to ask how to call the non-emergency 101 line. In a recording of the call, the man can be heard asking if he needs to put the Birmingham area code 0121 before the number, or press the hash key afterwards. Scroll down for audio . West Midlands Police have released a recording of a man phoning 999 to ask how to dial 101. In the clip, he can be heard asking whether he needs to put the Birmingham area code in front of the number . On Tuesday evening the force tweeted from its @WMPolice account: 'UNBELIEVABLE - This sound clip is taken from an actual 999 call. 'In it, the man who dialed 999 asks how to call 101. Note to caller in clip... to dial our non-emergency 101 number you pick up the phone and press 1 then 0 then 1. 'Please remember that 999 should be used for genuine emergencies ONLY. For non-emegency calls and enquiries, please dial 101. Thank you.' Yesterday Chief Superintendent Jim Andronov, head of the force’s Contact Centre, warned time-wasters that their calls could cost lives. He added: 'Typically West Midlands Police receive over 1500 calls a day to the 999 number and our operatives have to deal with each one accordingly. 'Of these, some 10 to 20 per cent are not police matters and around 50 per cent are non-emergency calls where contact is appropriate via the 101 number. The force released the clip yesterday  in order to shame the time-waster, saying hoax calls put lives at risk . 'As well as the bizarre calls police also receive deliberate hoax calls which take up vital time. It’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth. 'Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait. 'I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only, for guidance this is defined as: a crime is in progress, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened. 'We do not want to discourage people from contacting the police so for any other reason call 101.' It was the latest in a string of bizarre to the 999 services across the West Midlands Police force region in recent months. A West Midlands officer said around 20 per cent of calls to their emergency number are not about police matters, and 50 per cent should be directed to 101 (stock image) Earlier this month the force had a call from a homeowner who wanted to report a rat in her kitchen. And last year police released a recording of a man who dialled police to complain about a prostitute's looks after meeting her outside a hotel. The caller dialled 999 and told operators he 'wished to report her for breaching the Sale of Goods Act'. Almost half of the 700,000 telephone calls received by the force’s emergency number were inappropriate.","Man called West Midlands Police 999 line to ask how to dial 101 number .

"By . Sarah Dean . An Australian athlete has been arrested during a bust-up at the Commonwealth Games athletes' village. A 29-year-old male, who has not been named, has been charged with assault after the incident on Wednesday at around 6am. He is being held in custody and will appear in Glasgow Sheriff Court on Friday. The athlete is alleged to be weightlifter Francois Etoundi, Fairfax Media understands. Etoundi overcame injuries to win a bronze medal in the 77kg class weightlifting on Monday. Scroll down for video . Francois Etoundi, who won bronze in the Men's Weightlifting 77kg category at the Commonwealth Games, has allegedly been charged with assault . Daily Mail Australia has reached out to the Australian Commonwealth Games team for comment. However, there will reportedly be no statement until chef de mission Steve Moneghetti is made aware of all the facts, The Australian reports. Etoundi, who was born in Cameroon, suffered pain in his leg, shoulder and arm before winning bronze this week. After his result he wrote on Facebook: '3rd lift 177kg C&J. Bronze medal! Thankyou to everyone for your support.' Meanwhile, the Australian athletics team's Commonwealth Games trip is reportedly in a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions' after its head coach slammed the country's biggest track and field star, leading to him being suspended. Eric Hollingsworth launched an extraordinary attack on Olympic champion Sally Pearson on the eve of her Commonwealth Games 100m hurdles title defence. The attack has dramatically escalated his falling-out with Pearson, who he said had set a 'bad example' as team captain by declining to attend a pre-Games training camp in Gateshead. Channel 10 reported Hollingsworth had been suspended for his outburst. Etoundi was reportedly detained after police responded to a disturbance at the athletes' village . A 29-year-old was arrested at 6am on Wednesday at the accommodation in Glasgow . 'What's lost here is she's the team captain and there's a reasonable expectation she'd be in the camp ahead of something as major as the Commonwealth Games,' Hollingsworth said in a statement issued through a PR company. 'Her no-show sets a bad example to the entire national team.' Hollingsworth also defended his right to criticise Pearson's inability to defend the world indoors 60m hurdles title in March, after which their relationship broke down completely. Australian athletics head coach Eric Hollingsworth has reportedly been suspended after calling track and field star Sally Pearson a bad example after she missed a pre-Commonwealth Games training camp . The arrest of an athlete also comes after the brother of an Australian boxer was jailed and charged with aggravated assault at another Commonwealth Games venue on Wednesday. A 25-year-old man from Perth, Laith Samardali, was so angry about his brother Jordan's defeat in the light heavyweight quarter-finals that he allegedly verbally assaulted the referee. The furious incident occurred at the Entertainment and Convention Centre. Bottles were thrown across the room and one of them hit a seven-year-old boy. On Friday a weightlifter from Papua New Guinea will appear in court over an alleged sexual assault at a Glasgow supermarket. Papua New Guinea competitor Toua Udia, who competed at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday, was arrested following a report of an incident at a Tesco store near the athletes' village. The Glasgow Sheriff Court says Udia pleaded not guilty. The weightlifter, 22, competed at the Clyde Auditorium at the weekend following the alleged assault last Monday.

"By . Reuters . A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a federal occupational safety agency's finding against SeaWorld Entertainment Inc following the workplace death of one of its killer whale trainers.By a vote of two to one, the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that SeaWorld had violated its duties as an employer by exposing trainers to 'recognized hazards' when working with killer whales. The ruling means the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) can require SeaWorld to limit the interactions trainers have with killer whales.The federal agency had fined the company $75,000, a sum later reduced to $12,000, after trainer Dawn Brancheau died in February 2010. She drowned after being pulled underwater by Tilikum, a 12,000-pound (5,400-kg) bull orca at the SeaWorld site in Orlando, Florida. Killer whale: Dawn Brancheau was drowned when an orca named Tilikum dragged her underwater during a show . OSHA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, had told SeaWorld it could resolve the problem by requiring trainers to be protected by physical barriers or by adopting other abatement measures. SeaWorld, which operates 11 parks around the United States, said in a statement that it already has introduced new safety procedures, including removing trainers from the water during shows. Even after the court's ruling, 'there will still be human interactions and performances with killer whales,' the statement said. The company said it had yet to decide on whether to appeal the decision. The Labor Department said in a statement that courts have 'consistently upheld our position that killer whales pose a danger to employees who are not adequately protected.' New rules: Sea World San Diego President John Reilly testifies about a bill by Assemblyman Richard Bloom that would set new guidelines for treatment of killer whales in captivity before the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee on Tuesday, April 8, 2014 . Known danger: The whale Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths when trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged underwater by him during a show . Human-orca interaction has long been filled with controversy, revisited last year with the release of the movie Blackfish about Brancheau's death and Tilikum's career as an entertainer and stud for other captive whales. SeaWorld has criticized the film as 'inaccurate and misleading.' Rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed the court decision. Jared Goodman, the group's director of animal law, said it 'brings to an end the days of trainers standing and riding on orcas for human amusement.' SeaWorld had appealed over the federal agency's application of federal safety law to an unusual workplace situation it had not regulated before. The appeals court concluded that OSHA did not overstep its authority in bringing the action against SeaWorld. Documentary: The 2013 film Blackfish blames attacks and deaths of SeaWorld trainers on the mistreatment of the animals, increasing their aggression . 'Statements by SeaWorld managers do not indicate that SeaWorld's safety protocols and training made the killer whales safe; rather, they demonstrate SeaWorld's recognition that the killer whales interacting with trainers are dangerous,' Judge Judith Rogers wrote on behalf of the court. She played down SeaWorld's concerns about the impact on its operations, saying that improved safety 'does not change the essential nature of the business.' Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion noting that people who work in dangerous fields in the sports and entertainment context are aware of the risks. OSHA has 'departed from tradition and stormed headlong into a new regulatory arena,' he said.","A court upheld a finding by the federal occupational safety agency that SeaWorld violated its duties as an employer .

"By . Joel Christie . Besieged theme park SeaWorld has launched its first major PR attack against Blackfish in an attempt to offset almost 12 months of damage caused by the chilling documentary, which chronicled the aquarium's 39-year treatment of killer whales in captivity. Hit with cancellations from high-profile performers and school field trips, coupled with aggressive animal activist campaigns and a tarnished image, the Orlando-based marine park has placed full-page ads in eight of the country's largest newspapers, rationalizing their whale practices. The 'Open Letter from SeaWorld's Animal Advocates' — which appears in today's Orlando Sentinel, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today, among other papers — defends the way SeaWorld cares for the 29 whales in its corporate collection. Although it doesn't identify Blackfish, the ad is the first step in the company's move to rebut the wide-spread criticisms raised by the film, such as allegations that captivity turned orca Tilikum - the world's largest whale held in captivity - into a killer, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Tragedy: Blackfish focuses on a 12,000lb orca named Tilikum - the world's largest killer whale held in captivity - who in 2010 dragged trainer Dawn Brancheau (pictured with Tilkum) underwater to her death at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld has staged a new campaign to react to the documentary's allegations . PR to the rescue: An excerpt of the letter SeaWorld released as part of a new ad campaign in response to the negative criticism spawned by insightful documentary Blackfish . SeaWorld has previously dismissed the doco as propagandist and inaccurate. 'Tili' was responsible for the deaths of three people, most notably that of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who he grabbed and dragged underwater until she drowned during a 2010 training session in Florida. The Oscar-buzzing documentary - which details Tilikum's life, starting with being forcibly removed from his family in 1983 near Iceland - claims the whale's living conditions effectively turned him into an aggressive killer. It also includes scientific data saying there has never been one reported case of whales attacking humans in the wild. After watching the critically-acclaimed film, rock star Joan Jett sent a cease and desist letter to Seaworld asking them to stop playing her song, I Love Rock 'n' Roll, as part of their Shamu Rocks shows. Then eight of the 10 acts scheduled to headline SeaWorld's annual Bands, Brew & BBQ concert series - including Willie Nelson, Barenaked Ladies, Trisha Yearwood and Martina McBride - pulled out of the show citing the concerns raised by Blackfish. McBride wrote on Facebook to her fans: 'Given all the issues that have been aired recently, the time isn't right for me to play at SeaWorld.' Also this week, Point Dume Marine Science Elementary School in Malibu, California, dropped a long-scheduled field trip to the park, according to Fox 5. Out: After watching Blackfish, rocker Joan Jett wrote a letter to SeaWorld asking them to remove her song, I Love Rock n' Roll, from their Shamu Rock water shows . Cancelled: Country singer Martina McBride is the latest of many high-profile artists to withdraw from the annual Bands, Brew and BBQ SeaWorld festival in light of the theme park's negative criticisms . For at least a decade the school has held an overnight excursion at SeaWorld for fifth-graders, however Principal Rebecca Johnson told CNN both parents and students had asked to go elsewhere this year. SeaWorld President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Atchison said in an interview Thursday that the company decided to make statements regarding Blackfish only after losing their musical line-up. 'That ended up getting more coverage and became a story of its own, and, accordingly, what we wanted to do is to make sure that some of the misconceptions that were floating around related to that coverage were put to bed,' he told The Orlando Sentinel. SeaWorld would not say how much it spent on the newspaper ads, which could soon be followed by an online campaign. But the move suggests the company, whose 11 theme parks drew a combined 24.4 million visitors last year, is concerned about potential long-term brand damage from the small-budget film, which was just shortlisted for an Academy Award. In its open letter, SeaWorld says it has invested $70 million improving its killer-whale habitats in the past three years. Swimming killer: Tilikum continues to perform at SeaWorld, despite being responsible for the deaths of three people . SeaWorld's open letters ads, which appeared in newspaper around the country today, are on behalf of the marine park's 1,500 employees, it says . Much of that has been spent on safety upgrades implemented after Brancheau's death, which remains the subject of a legal battle between SeaWorld and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. SeaWorld says in its ad that the life spans of its killer whales are equivalent to those living in the wild, which contradicts claims by animal-rights groups. A widely cited 1995 study found that the mortality rate of killer whales in captivity was about two and half times that of killer whales in the wild. Blackfish claims whales in captivity live for about 25 years, while whales in the wild live to an age comparable to that of humans. Christopher Dold, SeaWorld Entertainment's vice president of veterinary services, said the rate of survival for SeaWorld's whales is just as high as that of whales in the wild. Regulations:  Following Brancheau's death, trainers were banned from going into the water with the performing animals and now have to be separated from the whales by glass. SeaWorld is appealing the decision . The Seaworld ad also says that it does not separate killer-whale calves from their mothers, aside from rare occasions when the mother cannot care for the calf herself. But activists have compiled a long list of young killer whales separated from their mothers at SeaWorld parks. The difference is one of definition: When SeaWorld says 'calf,' it is typically referring to whales still nursing, which can last until about two years of age. 54Number of orcas known to be kept in captivity worldwide28Number of captive orcas owned by SeaWorld, according to public Securities and Exchange Commission filings$538 millionTotal revenue reported by SeaWorld in the third quarter of 2013$9 millionApproximate amount of money the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund has spent on conservation, rescue and rehabilitation efforts over the past decade, according to its 2011-2012 annual report . Activists generally include juvenile and adolescent whales, which can be a decade or so older. 'They're just trying to take advantage of the difficulties in finding absolute numbers to compare,' Howard Garrett, director of the Orca Network, an advocacy group in Washington state and a researcher who participated in the making of Blackfish, told The Sentinel. Despite its high-profile PR response, Atchison insisted that Blackfish and the negative publicity it has spawned has not hurt SeaWorld's business. The company says it is on track to post core earnings of almost $440 million on sales of nearly $1.5 billion, both of which would be company records. 'As much data as we have and as much as we look, I can't connect anything really between the attention that the film has gotten and any effect on our business,' he said. Blackfish grossed only about $2.1 million during limited theatrical, but has repeatedly aired on CNN and this week debuted on Netflix. A representative for Blackfish distributor Magnolia Pictures said Thursday that the film's performance on Apple's iTunes and video-on-demand channels has been 'through the roof', though the company would not provide figures. Netflix also would not disclose viewership data for the film. Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who says she wasn’t a marine mammal activist before making the film, calls the news encouraging. 'If you tell people the truth, they’ll change the way they do things,' she said. 'They’ll make powerful and dignified decisions.' Blackfish writer-director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who admits to not being a marine expert before making the film and rather just a worried SeaWorld patron, says the backlash her movie has caused is 'encouraging'","Blackfish is a 2013 documentary that charters SeaWorld's 39-year treatment of killer whales in captivity .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron will support an attempt to compel Britain by law to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, after his hand was forced by the Liberal Democrats. At the last election, all three main parties promised to introduce the law, but the Prime Minister quietly ditched the policy following fierce protests from the right of his party. However, in a move calculated to provoke a damaging Tory split on the issue, Nick Clegg yesterday endorsed a Private Members’ Bill on the 0.7 target – causing the Conservatives to quickly say their party leadership would support the measure in any Commons vote. Pressure: David Cameron will support an attempt to compel Britain by law to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid . The Lib Dems were copying Tory tactics, for Mr Cameron has highlighted Mr Clegg’s opposition to an EU referendum by supporting a private bill to introduce the vote. There is now the bizarre prospect of a Conservative prime minister speaking in support of the legislation, but backbench MPs being free to try to wreck it. The Bill will be introduced in September by former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Michael Moore. It stands a strong chance of being approved by the Commons even without Tory support, as Labour MPs are expected to back the measure. In 2010, Mr Cameron controversially ring-fenced the foreign aid budget from austerity measures hitting other areas – giving it protection only otherwise afforded to the NHS and schools spending. Official figures show Britain hit the 0.7 per cent target for the first time last year after giving away £11.4 billion. Meeting the target required a 30 per cent increase in the budget. Nick Clegg yesterday endorsed a Private Members’ Bill on the 0.7 target . Mr Cameron has said that hitting the target is his proudest achievement in Government – but many Tory MPs have argued big increases in spending have been unjustifiable at a time of austerity at home. Conservative MP Peter Bone, a long- standing critic of aid spending, said: ‘Overseas aid should be based on need, not a fixed percentage of GDP. If the Government is supporting this measure, it should introduce a Government Bill. It would be outrageous to try to bring it in through the back door, and I will be voting against the damn thing.’","Nick Clegg has endorsed a Private Members’ Bill on the 0.7 target .

"By . Ryan Lipman . The closest thing to being 'free as a bird' is flying a plane upside down according to Victorian pilot Jeremy Miller. Mr Miller runs a flying school in Lethbridge, west of Melbourne, and offers joy flights, basic flying and specialises in daring aerobatics. The 31-year-old pilot said there was no better feeling than freedom of flying a plane through the air. 'Aerobatics has always been a passion of mine, I've always been fascinated by it,' he said. Scroll down for video . Aerobatic ace Jeremy Miller practices his aerobatic routines including flying upside down, in Lethbridge, west of Melbourne, Victoria . The pilot flies a 2009 super decathlon, pictured, and the aircraft can remain upside down for up to two minutes before it needs to be turned upright again . After running an aerobatics school in Western Australia for about four years, Mr Miller decided to set up his own school in Victoria in 2010, where he said there was a big aviation community. On an afternoon about three weeks ago, Mr Miller was photographed flying a 2009 super decathlon aircraft ahead of the Queensland Aerobatics Championships in Queensland in August, which many of his students will compete in. In one of his most daring stunts, Mr Miller flies his plane upside down for about two minutes - the longest the aircraft allows. 'The sensation, it's like being free - you're not really limited,' he said. 'A aircraft, it's a 3D machine and aerobatics explores that third dimension. Positive g-force can pull you down into your seat, negative g-force (when upside down) - it's like doing a handstand and blood rushing to your head. 'You feel like you're coming out of your seat. I love the freedom it gives you.' Mr Miller said aerobatics was limitless and he was often surprised by some of the tricks he sees . The Victorian pilot said the only way to fully appreciate the thrill of the air was to experience first-hand . Yet Mr Miller admitted the thought of flying upside down was not for everyone, with some of his students initially 'apprehensive' about the idea. 'Once they have their first few goes, they really start getting into it and getting enthusiastic,' he said. 'It's one of those things, it's difficult to describe if you haven't experienced it. The best way I explain it  is telling people to come and experience it for themselves. 'We've all seen the movie Top Gun, but until you actually experience it, you really don't know what to expect. 'Aerobatics is an open book, you're only limited by your own creativity, some of the things you see, you don't think it's possible.' Mr Miller starting learning to fly at just 14 years old and got his restricted pilots license when he was 16 . Learning to fly at 14, Mr Miller got his restricted pilot's license at 16, before finishing high school. He said flying ran through his blood. 'My grandfather flew in World War II, I have some uncles who are pilots...It was always something I wanted to do and I love vintage aircraft.' Working as a pilot since 2001, with more than 10 years experience, Mr Miller has been able to perfect his own aerobatic skills and regularly performs at air displays across Australia. He has about up to 50 students at his flying school, with about 30 active, and Mr Miller said many now competed at aerobatic competitions around the country.","Victorian pilot Jeremy Miller runs a flying school and specialises in aerobatic stunts .

"By . Kate Lyons . A Darwin man has died after he was struck by a falling tree branch while playing golf. William ‘Bill’ Brown, 62, was waiting to tee off during a game with friends at the Gardens Golf Links in Darwin last Friday when a branch snapped off and came down on top of him. The branch caused damaged to his spine, as well as other injuries and over the weekend friends and family believed Mr Brown was paralysed, but would survive the accident. William 'Bill' Brown, 62, died at an Adelaide hospital about 2.30pm yesterday with his wife and stepdaughter Kerry Collins by his side . He was taken to the Royal Darwin Hospital and later flown to Adelaide, where he passed away yesterday, with his wife Gail and step-daughter Kerry Collins by his side. Mr Brown was a shot firer in quarries and mines in the Northern Territory and was a keen baseballer. He had belonged to the Palmerston Reds Baseball Club for more than thirty years, where he played in the Masters competition, as well as coaching and scoring, and acting as a mentor to younger players. Lisa Hooley, the State Executive Officer of the club, said the community was 'absolutely devastated' by the news of his death. 'Billy would always have a smile and have a chat, he was a true, decent guy, a family man. He loved to have a beer with his friends and his teammates,' she told MailOnline. Bill Brown was a passionate baseballer and had been involved in the Palmerston Reds club for more than 30 years . Mr Brown was known as a decent bloke and a family man who was always ready to share a laugh and a beer with his friends . She said he was fit and loved his sport, playing golf whenever he got a Friday off work. 'But baseball was his great love,' she said. The community was particularly shocked, she said, because they initially thought Mr Brown had survived the accident and the baseball club had already started fundraising to help with his rehabilitation costs. Ms Hooley said the phone call informing her of Mr Brown's death was 'one of the most horrific calls I’ve had in a long time'. 'The golf course is a place where a lot of our members go. I don’t think there’s anyone in our club who hasn’t stood on that first tee. 'It was just such a random incident and I know there’s a big outcry to take out the trees. But seriously a tree? I get lost for words, it’s just such a random event,' she said. Mr Brown was hit by a branch of an African mahogany tree, which have been the target of complaints from residents in the area. A nine-year-old boy was killed in 2006 when a branch of the African mahogany tree fell on him in 2006. Ms Hooley said the Palmerston Reds were playing a game tonight and the players would wear black armbands and have a minute of silence. 'They're playing tonight which is just incredible, they’ve decided to play because that’s what Billy would’ve wanted.'

"By . Jason Groves . Dominic Grieve says clashes over EU Human Rights led to his downfall . Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve yesterday claimed his sacking was ‘driven by Ukip’, as the backlash over David Cameron’s brutal reshuffle grew. The Prime Minister sacked 15 ministers last week in the biggest Cabinet clear-out for years. Although some were handed knighthoods to go quietly, others yesterday indicated they will make trouble for Mr Cameron on the backbenches. Signs were emerging of a Right-wing axis involving sacked Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, who rejected an offer of a junior post. Employment Minister Esther McVey is also reported to have had a  stand-off with Mr Cameron after he initially offered her a job that lacked Cabinet status. Mr Grieve served as Britain’s top law officer for four years before his sacking. He infuriated Tory High Command by repeatedly warning of the danger of withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Cameron is keen to put the pledge in the next manifesto in a bid to persuade voters who have defected to Ukip that he is serious about standing up to Europe over controversial human rights rulings, such as the demand that prisoners be given the right to vote. Mr Grieve yesterday told Sky News it was ‘certainly possible’ this was why he had been sacked. But he said this would not remove the legal and diplomatic problems associated with pulling out of the Strasbourg court – and suggested the Tories’ proposed pledge may be unachievable. Mr Grieve, who said he was ‘actually a Eurosceptic’, said he disagreed with some of the Strasbourg Court’s judgments. But he warned that withdrawing would cause ‘reputational damage’ – and could leave Britain open to legal challenge from the EU. Mr Paterson was among the Cabinet casualties despite attempts by senior Right-wingers and the National Farmers’ Union to keep him in post. Yesterday he published a stinging attack on the green lobby – dubbed the ‘Green Blob’ – who called for his removal because of his scepticism about the impact of climate change. Clarke: We're not winners any more . He is reported to have had a 20-minute row with Mr Cameron, in which he warned his sacking would alienate traditional Tory voters and be a ‘smash in the teeth’ for 12million people in the countryside. Mr Paterson is said to have asked him: ‘Do you actually want to win the election?’ He is now expected to lead a Eurosceptic alliance with Dr Fox that will harry the Prime Minister over Europe. Sources had suggested Dr Fox was due to make a dramatic return to Cabinet three years after he quit because of links to an unofficial adviser. Mr Cameron offered him the number three job at the Foreign Office. Although this came with a seat at the National Security Council, Dr Fox rejected it as an insult. He is said to have told the Prime Minister: ‘You must be bloody joking. I assume the ambassadorship to the moon is taken?’ Miss McVey was also tipped for promotion to the Cabinet. But in the end she remained as Employment Minister, albeit with permission to attend the Cabinet. She is said to have rejected an initial job offer and refused to leave Number 10 until she got the Cabinet concession, but a Government source last night dismissed reports she had clashed with Mr Cameron as ‘absolute rubbish’.","Sacked Attorney General says move was 'driven by Ukip'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Sporting Lisbon have slated the actions of Eric Dier's father and the player's agent for their part in the England Under 21 international's move to Spurs. Tottenham announced on Thursday they had signed 20-year-old Dier from Sporting, pending the completion of a medical, but the Portuguese club were far from happy at the way the £4million deal unfolded. Dier had been on Sporting's books since the age of 10, eventually signing his first professional contract just over four years ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eric Dier set up Ricky van Wolfswinkel . Spurs bound: Eric Dier has agreed to a £4million move to Tottenham from Sporting Lisbon . Turning his back: Dier, pictured above at the age of 16, had been at Sporting since he was 10 . In the middle of talks with regard to a new deal, Sporting were then stunned when presented with Spurs' escape-clause bid, forcing them to part with the young defender. A statement on Sporting's website read: 'Over the course of the last month, Sporting Clube de Portugal began negotiations with the athlete Eric Dier for the renewal of his contract. 'Unexpectedly, Sporting was confronted by the player's father and official representative with a bid from Tottenham Hotspur, with that bid activating a clause agreed by previous boards of directors for the sale of the player for an amount of five millions euros or more, unless the personal terms offered as part of the bid are matched. Prospect: Dier has been capped at Under 21 level for England . 'Due to the club's current salary policy, the respective balance within the squad and the ongoing financial restructuring under way at the club, it was not possible to match the proposed terms. 'Furthermore, Sporting was also informed the player did not want to remain with the club even on equal terms, and that any equal or improved personal terms would not have been accepted. 'In light of the above, Sporting announces the complete sale of the economic rights of the player Eric Dier to Tottenham Hotspur for five million euros without any future rights relative to the player. 'Despite the above mentioned events, Sporting wishes Eric Dier all the best in his career.' Dier, who had a spell on loan with Everton from January to May 2011 to further his experience, made 26 league appearances overall for Sporting after making his debut in November 2012. Exit: Iago Falque (left) has left Spurs for Genoa in a £4million deal . Iago Falque, meanwhile, has become the fourth player to exit Tottenham during pre-season after signing for Italian Serie A side Genoa. Genoa have a completed a deal for the 24-year-old Spanish winger, understood to be in the region of £4million, pending a medical. Falque joined Spurs on a season-long loan deal from Juventus three years ago before completing a permanent move the following year, but during his entire time with the club he made only one Premier League appearance. Falque follows Jake Livermore, Heurelho Gomes and Gylfi Sigurdsson out of White Hart Lane in recent weeks.","Portuguese side release statement slamming actions of Eric Dier's father and agent .

"By . Mark Bryans . Arsene Wenger believes keeping Arsenal competitive in their barren years has been the most important achievement of his reign. Winning last season's FA Cup final gave the Gunners their first piece of silverware in nine years, a trophy drought which had seen some question whether the 64-year-old Frenchman was still the right man to take the club forward. Having delivered three Barclays Premier League titles since taking charge in 1996, Wenger has also overseen a move to the Emirates Stadium - a decision which left the club unable to compete financially with other title rivals for almost a decade. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger say no player is too good for Arsenal . Greatest achievement: Arsene Wenger managed to keep Arsenal in top four despite financial restraints . Wenger out! There were calls from sections of the club for Arsene Wenger to stand down as manager . In the intervening years after leaving Highbury, Wenger still managed to guide Arsenal to top-four finishes in every season and finally ended his trophy jinx with a 3-2 win over Hull in May. With the purse strings also loosened as the loans taken out to build their new home were repaid, Wenger has finally been able to flex his muscles in the transfer market - breaking the club's transfer record last year to sign Mesut Ozil and acquiring Chile forward Alexis Sanchez this summer. But it was those years of battling against free-spending sides like Chelsea and Manchester City, as well as rivals such as Manchester United and Liverpool, which Wenger admits he may remember more fondly in the years to come. 'I accepted the challenge when I signed my contract knowing what would happen,' he said. 'Personally, I think it was the most sensitive and important period of my career here - it was exciting to keep the club at the level with less resources. 'Did we do well or not? The only thing I can say is that we were consistent at that level but maybe we lacked some quality to really win it. 'The only thing I can assure you is that I gave absolutely everything to do as well as I could. Is it enough? You'll never know. Could someone had done better? You never know.' The wait is over! Arsenal ended their seven-year trophy drought by winning the 2013 FA Cup at Wembley . With the FA Cup success behind him, Wenger penned another contract extension at the club, with the new three-year deal taking him up until 2017. Negotiations over the deal were lengthy and, although Wenger is adamant he always wanted to sign, he would not be drawn on whether victory in the cup final played a part in his decision. 'I don't want to answer that question,' he replied when asked if there would have been doubt over his future without the trophy win. 'Was it always going to happen? Certainly. I always said the same thing, I want to think that I have done well for the club. My motivation was never at stake, I always wanted to stay. 'But as well I wanted to feel that I had done a good job. The fact that we could not win was going on my mind and it was important for me to feel like I was doing a decent job. 'I never look behind me at what is done. I look in front of me. I'm always turned forward. We have won the cup but we want to win more and we want to come back and fight for more, what is done is done.' New era: Arsenal can compete in the transfer market again, brining in the likes of Alexis Sanchez . A fourth Premier League crown would be Wenger's ideal target for this coming season, with another assault on the Champions League also in his mind. With the extra money now at his disposal, he believes things are more even in Arsenal's fights with the elite. 'I would say that the balance of power is a bit more even than it was five or six years ago,' added Wenger. 'With the financial fair play added to the fact we have more financial power than five years ago it gives us a better chance. 'The last two seasons it has changed because we had the financial power to do it, the seasons before we could not and I was sitting here saying where do we go next, but we managed to get into a better position.'","Arsene Wenger insists keeping Arsenal competitive has been his main achievement .

"By . Laura Williamson . As the saying goes, ‘nobody remembers who came second’, yet the past week of athletics at Hampden Park has shown this is clearly nonsense. Two 20-year-old former world junior champions from England, Adam Gemili and Jodie Williams, brushed aside the might of the Caribbean to win silver in the sprints and immediately spoke of their first senior honours as ‘stepping stones’ to success. We will remember these names, all right. In the first five days of athletics at the Commonwealth Games, England won 16 medals, including three golds. But best of all, 11 of those who stepped onto the podium at Hampden are 23 or under. Delight: Kelly Holmes reckons the British success in Glasgow will get them going for gold in Rio . Many of these silver- and bronze-medal performances were significant breakthroughs for young athletes who seized their chances at a major competition. Others, such as British 200m champion Danny Talbot and Asha Philip in the 100m — both 23 — reached high-calibre finals, gaining valuable experience against some of the fastest athletes in the world and performing well on the biggest stage of their careers. For long jump silver medallist Jazmin Sawyers, 21, Laura Samuel, 23, in the triple jump and wheelchair racer Jade Jones, 18, Commonwealth success has been an exciting surprise. Yet they too are not content to dwell on their achievements but recognise they can be a springboard to more. Gemili said: ‘People have said that this Commonwealth Games is a great place to establish yourself, get that great championships experience and learn how to win medals at championships. Taking that forwards, I know we’ve got the Europeans in a couple of weeks’ time, and then the World Championships next year and eventually the Rio Olympics in 2016. ‘So it’s been great to learn how to win a medal and how to deal with the stress and the pressures of it and go out and win a medal on the day. It’s a great stepping stone.’ Better luck next time: Adam Gemili picked up the silver and will hope for even better in Rio in two years . Fighting against the best: Gemili came up against some of the best sprinters around at Hampden Park . Dame Kelly Holmes remembers sharing a room with Sally Gunnell, already a 400m hurdles world and Olympic champion, at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. Holmes was 24 and still a ‘soldier who ran a bit’ and marvelled at Gunnell taking cold showers after her races to aid her recovery. Yet Holmes won 800m gold there and went on to complete a remarkable middle-distance double at the Olympics in Athens 10 years later. ‘Without the Commonwealth Games there’s no chance I would have ever become a double Olympic champion,’ Holmes told the Evening Standard. ‘The Commonwealths have been an unbelievable springboard for me and many others. ‘It may still be two years to go until Rio de Janeiro but it’s effectively just around the corner for all these athletes. New star names are emerging here in Glasgow who will go on to become household names.’ Double trouble: Bianca and Jodie Williams celebrate their bronze and silver medals in the 200m final . England’s young team at Hampden could have been even stronger had it not been for injuries, the early selection deadline of June 1 or the clash with the World Junior Championships. The fastest female in Britain this year, Dina Asher-Smith, won world junior gold in Oregon, while heptathlete Morgan Lake, 17, achieved a heptathlon and high jump double after withdrawing from these Games. Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who missed the Commonwealths with a foot injury, is still only 21 but leads the British rankings for heptathlon, high jump and long jump. Matthew Hudson-Smith, 19, is the quickest over 400m. Chijindu ‘CJ’ Ujah, the only man to break the 10-second barrier for 100m this season, has not been selected in the individual event at either the Commonwealths or European Championships. Getting close: Danny Talbot came close against the Jamaicans in the 200m final and is looking promising . Greg Rutherford, who won long jump silver in Delhi aged 23 before going on to clinch the Olympic and Commonwealth titles, said: ‘That’s where I see the Commonwealth Games being of major importance, for younger guys or guys who grab that opportunity to break through and give it a go. It would have been great to see CJ here and, looking at the field, I think he really would have stepped up and had a good time. He is a different level of athlete. ‘Competing in front of a crowd like that really is something special and sadly it will be a little while before we get another British crowd at a major — the World Championships in London 2017, I guess — so hopefully he’ll be there. It will be a handy relay team as well, actually.’ Crucially, British athletes also now face significant competition from within. Admin: Holmes is now President of Commonwealth Games England and has been working in Glasgow . Our women won 4x100m bronze at the World Championships last year, but the battle is now even more fierce for those four relay places, with the nation’s young guns now believing they can take on the Americans and Jamaicans. Bianca Williams, 21, who won Commonwealth 200m bronze and came sixth in the 100m final, agreed: ‘Definitely — there are loads of us coming up and we’re all upping our game because we all know next year at the World Championships we’re all going to be on the podium. ‘We’ll all be in the final chasing those Americans and Jamaicans down. We know we can do it.’ Williams said those words just minutes after winning her first senior medal. The Commonwealth Games are not over yet but we are already looking forward to the successes they could spark for this exciting, hungry young group of athletes. Close but no cigar...what about in Rio? Asha Philip is another showing potential - in the women's 100m .","England won 16 medals in first five days of Athletics at the Commonwealths .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A trip to pick a Year 12 formal dress ended in tragedy when 16-year-old Emily Payne was killed in a car accident last Sunday. After spending the weekend dress shopping in Brisbane, Emily was a passenger in a silver sedan, driven by her cousin. The pair were on their way home to Roma, in south west Queensland when the car lost control and collided with a tree off a gravel road outside Chinchilla at about midday, near a relative's home on Cameby Rd. Emily Payne was killed in a country road car crash near Chinchilla in south west Queensland on Sunday, July 5 . The teenage schoolgirl had spent the weekend shopping for a dress in Brisbane to wear to her Year 12 formal . Her cousin was able to call for help, but Emily died at the scene, leaving the both girl's families heartbroken and the Roma community shell-shocked, reported The Courier Mail. With her funeral to be held on Tuesday, Emily leaves behind a twin sister Abby, brother Sam, parents Judy and Rodney Payne and boyfriend Jack Moller. Abby Payne said she was reeling at the sudden loss and that her twin was an outgoing, happy and independent person. 'We did everything together.

New boy Ander Herrera, signed from Athletic Bilbao for £24million this summer, stole the show with an impressive display in midfield as he created chance after chance for his new team-mates. Danny Welbeck opened the scoring from distance before Wayne Rooney scored a brace to give Man United a 3-0 lead at half-time. The second half saw 20-year-old defender Reece James score twice before Ashley Young also scored two in the final minutes courtesy of Herrera assists. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's match report from Pasadena . Host commentator . Louis van Gaal lands his first trophy as Manchester United manager... the Chevrolet Cup! What a performance from the Red Devils and in particular Ander Herrera. The Spaniard was the star performer in the middle of the park with some exquisite passing. What a signing he could prove to be! The 24-year-old deserves his Man-of-the-Match award. Great finish by Young but once again it's Herrera with a wonderful through ball. Ashley Young latches on to a perfectly-timed through ball from Herrera and places the ball into an empty net after the goalkeeper rushed out. James may be a defender but he certainly knows how to shoot. The 20-year-old was first to react after Kagawa was denied by the onrushing Galaxy goalkeeper and passed the ball into the net from outside the area with his left boot. The Japan international did well to control the ball and turn in the box to beat his defender but was unable to curl his shot on target. The defender looks to have hurt his shoulder and has been replaced by Charlie Rugg. Manchester United frontman Juan Mata shield the ball from LA Galaxy defender AJ DeLaGarza . After claiming the second 45 minutes hadn't really got going Manchester United score right on cue through 20-year-old defender Reece James. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: In traditional pre-season fashion, United made a host of changes at half-time with only Herrera and Fletcher surviving from the starting eleven. Indeed such were the changes that Fletcher – captain for the night – found himself pushed in to the centre of defence so that Van Gaal could persist with his three-man back line. Not that any of this has done much to change the pattern of play. United are still dominating the play and scored their fourth goal on the hour when Ashley Young crossed low from the left and young left-back Reece James marked his debut with a goal from 12 yards. As is the case with many of these friendly matches when both sides make a host of changes at half-time. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler: David Beckham and Patrice Evra were surprise guests at Manchester United’s Los Angeles training base on Tuesday.Beckham, who has returned to live in London with his family after five-and-a-half years in California, is back in town for United’s first game on their pre-season tour of the United States against another of his former teams, LA Galaxy.He met up with new United boss Louis van Gaal and some of the players and is expected to attend the Chevrolet Cup match at the Rosebowl on Wednesday.Click the above link to read the full story. Great start to Louis van Gaal's tenure at the club as the Red Devils lead 3-0 at the break. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Tommy Meyer has somehow managed to fall over when trying to clear a routine low cross from Welbeck which has allowed Rooney to score his second, and United’s third, from just six yards. Half-time here in California and United’s pre-season is up and running in some style. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Lots of love on social media tonight for Ander Herrera and United’s new signing is having a nice game. It was Antonio Valencia advancing from wing-back who won the penalty that has just given United their second goal, however. Valencia worried AJ DeLaGarza and when he went past him and crossed from the right the Galaxy player lifted his arm to concede a penalty. There were plenty of complaints from Galaxy players but it was a clear handball and Wayne Rooney converted the penalty with his right foot. Click the above link to read what Louis van Gaal had to say during Tuesday's press conference. New boys Shaw and Herrera also made an appearance. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Robbie Keane is playing for Galaxy tonight and he has looked to operate in the spaces in between United’s back three. He hasn’t really had much joy but he did get in behind Phil Jones in the 30th minute, only for the United central defender to get a toe on the ball as Keane was about to shoot. Keane thought he was being held by his opponent and appealed for a penalty but from where I am sitting he was never going to get it. This really is a superb setting for a football match, by the way. The stadium isn’t quite full but there seems to be well over 60,000 in the ground. ...and if the game ends in a draw then both clubs will share the trophy. Very old school like with the Charity Shield. Galaxy left-back AJ DeLaGarza (what a great name) marauds forward and lets fly from 25 yards out but Man United's Spanish goalkeeper gets down to his right to deny the Guam international. It may only be a friendly but the Red Devils look lively. Herrera has been particularly impressive with his neat, tidy passing. Only fifteen minutes gone here at the Rose Bowl in beautiful Pasadena and already Manchester United have their first goal under Louis van Gaal. A bustling run from Juan Mata saw the ball break 20 yards from goal and Danny Welbeck swept it in off the post with a first time shot with his right foot. United had started brightly before that, Juan Mata bringing a save from Galaxy goalkeeper Jamie Penedo from a similar distance. Interesting also here that Van Gaal has sent United out to play with three central defenders, as he did with Holland in the World Cup. Juan Mata lays the ball off to Welbeck who shoots from 20 yards out and sees his effort canon off the post and into the back of the net! The first goal of the Van Gaal era! Just two players who start tonight under Louis van Gaal appeared in David Moyes' first friendly as manager - Danny Welbeck and Jonny Evans. but the Spaniard's shot is tipped over the bar. Bright start from the £24million midfield man. Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera both starting with midfielder Darren Fletcher preferred as captain over Wayne Rooney.

Ivica Olic gave Niko Kovc's men the lead after just ten minutes before Alex Song saw red after appearing to lash out at Mario Madzukic in an off the ball incident. With ten men, Cameroon's task became more difficult as they went further behind to an impressive solo goal from Croatia wideman Ivan Perisic. Frontman Mandzukic made sure of the victory with a brace late on. The Indomitable Lions follow Australia and Spain through the exit door. Click here for the full match report .

Cameroon are OUT of the World Cup after tonight's defeat. With zero points from their opening two games, Cameroon can not progress from the group with Mexico and Brazil level on four points and Croatia now on three. Croatia's clash with Mexico is now a winner-takes-all clash! Ivan Rakitic is played in on the edge of the box and delicately scoops the ball over the onrushing Itandje in the Cameroon goal but the ball spins wide. So unlukcy. Would have been a great goal! Moukandjo gets the ball on the edge of the area and attempts to curl the ball into the top corner but scuffs it hopelessly wide. Moments after that chance Assou-Ekotto appeared to headbutt Moukandjo as the two exchanged heated words.and squared up to each other. Cameroon: Edgar Salli replaces Eric Choupo-Moting . Croatia: Ante Rebic comes on for Perisic . Mandzukic's scores possibly the easiest goal of his career to put Croatia four goals ahead against Cameroon. Goalkeeper Charles Itandje could only parry Eduardo's low, curling shot and Mandzukic was on hand to tap home with the goal gaping. Inter Milan's Mateo Kovacic has been introduced to the action. Former Arsenal man Eduardo, currently with Ukranian giants Shakhtar Donetsk, comes on for Olic. Mandzukic makes it three for Croatia with a powerful header from a corner. Surely game over? Cameroon set to be the third team to be eliminated from this summer's tournament following Australia and Spain's (!) exits earlier this evening. Perisic's solo goal will have certainly excited Evertonians. The Croatian is a target for the Toffees. Click the above link for the full story. The Bayern Muncih frontman was through on goal but Nicolas N'Koulou does enough to put the striker off who shoots wide. Mandzukic should have done better with that opportunity. Ivan Perisic doubles Croatia's advantage! The wideman received the ball just on the halfway line and raced towards goal unchallenged before slotting the ball into the far corner. Great solo effort from Perisic! The Cameroon wideman spent last season in the French second division having signed for Nancy from Monaco in 2011. The 25-year-old is certainly quick on the counter and may have caught the eye of some potential suitors. Aboubakar blazes over just before the referee blows for half-time. Croatia lead and Cameroon are down to ten men. Can the African nation turn things around or will Niko Kovac's men make their numerical advantage count? Alex Song - Silly, silly boy. Cameroon midfielder Song is given his marching orders after appearing to hit out at Mario Mandzukic in an off the ball incident as the pair raced forward as Croatia broke. The incident was right in front of the referee and there was only one outcome. The former Arsenal man has really let himself down, there. (and his team-mates) The Schalke defender went on a mazy, if quite fluky run, beat three players but took one touch too many and knocked the ball out of play. Decent effort. The QPR man, who spent last season winning the Europa League with Sevilla, received the ball on the edge of the area. The midfielder could have crossed first time but instead raced goalwards and saw his eventual square ball easily blocked. The ball bounces into the box and Olic takes a swing of his left foot from a tight angle... but the ball ends up in row Z. Looks like the Croatia left-back felt it was time for a change... The crowd waited for the net to bulge as Perisic's effort looked destined for the goal but Aurelien Chedjou somehow managed to whack it away for a Croatia throw. Croatia take the lead through the evergreen Ivica Olic. The Wolfsburg frontman had it laid on a plate to him courtesy of Ivan Perisic's tidy square ball and made no mistake in slotting the ball into the corner of the net. 22-year-old Aboubakar definitely watched France '98. The Cameroon frontman has just shown off the old Ronaldo (the original, not Cristiano) stepover to beat his man. Tidy. Vincent Aboubakar's powerful header is stopped on the line - wouldn't have counted anyway after the referee blew for a foul. Croatia free-kick. Benjamin Moukandjo hits the side-netting in the first minute. Positive start from the Indomitable Lions. Samuel Eto'o will not start for Cameroon. The striker, who arrived at the World Cup with a right knee injury, played in the opening game defeat to Mexico but later admitted he had played through the pain barrier. For Croatia, Luka Modric will start in the midfield and Mario Mandzukic will play up front after missing the 3-1 loss to Brazil through suspension. Cameroon XI: Itandje, Mbia, Chedjou, N'Koulou, Assou-Ekotto, Song, Matip, Enoh, Choupo-Moting, Aboubakar, Moukandjo.
