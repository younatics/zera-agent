"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted that he was drinking after being caught on video on Monday night incoherently rambling in what appears to be a Jamaican accent. In the video, immediately posted on YouTube and going viral, Ford is seen in a fast food restaurant, swearing and talking about police surveillance. The video is titled 'New Video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Drunk, Swearing in Jamaican Patois? Bumbaclot.' Watch Rob Ford in action here . An undated video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was posted to YouTube this week where he rambles incoherently in what sounds like an imitation of Jamaican Patois . On the tape, Ford rants incoherently in what appears to be an imitation of a Jamaican dialect while throwing a series of random shapes with his arms. Ford said in November that he quit drinking following his crack-smoking scandal. In a TV interview at the time, Ford said: 'I've had a come-to-Jesus moment if you want to call it that. Just the humiliation and the belittling and the people I've let down. 'And it's all because of alcohol. Excessive, stupid, immature behavior and that's it.' The mayor acknowledged last year that he smoked crack 'in one of my drunken stupors' after police said they obtained a copy of a tape that appears to show him smoking crack. Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced in May when reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video. Before the mayor admitted the video was filmed on Monday, his brother and fellow politician Doug Ford defended him by saying it was not filmed recently because his brother had stopped drinking in November. Doug Ford said: 'He's a lot heavier in that picture than he is now...It couldn't have been last night.' When asked whether it was appropriate for his brother to put on an accent, Doug Ford ducks the question saying he hasn't actually seen the video. Ford gestured wildly and appeared to not know he was being filmed during his drunken rant . Earlier this month, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process. Muzik is known party palace for both . locals and visitors, in the past entertaining touring musicians like . Justin Bieber as well as celebrities and sport stars. Numerous . photos of the 44-year-old looking hot and sweaty popped up on Instagram . and Twitter, posted by revelers surprised to see Ford wandering around . the dance floor. Ford admitted that he had been drinking when the clip was filmed on Monday night . Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's . brother and campaign manager, said the appearance was in the name of . drumming up support for the forthcoming election, set for October 27. He said the mayor consumed only a sugar-free energy drink and was at the club for about an hour. 'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford earlier told The Toronto Sun. 'There . have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, there’s been the . Bieber there and no one got a response like Rob did. 'The place went upside down ballistic. 'All he did was take pictures.' Ford was forced to apologize at a press conference for using 'graphic language' when describing sex with his wife Renata (left) The disgraced Toronto mayor, pictured earlier this month, claimed to have stopped drinking in November following his crack-smoking scandal .

"Outside the simple apartment building where the Democratic Republic of Congo are staying, the team's warm-up bibs are hanging out on a fence to dry. Inside, a kit man is ironing Cup of Nations badges onto the sleeves of each shirt. It is a long way from the fancy hotels and perfect preparation of the Premier League. But upstairs one of the top flight's rising stars is doing his best to cope with the testing conditions of Ebebiyin, a tiny jungle town in north eastern Equatorial Guinea. 'When we came, there was no TV and only cold water,' says Yannick Bolasie, the Crystal Palace winger who is fast making a name for himself as one of Africa's finest players. Yannick Bolasie (right) vies for the ball with Zambia's Nathan Sinkala in the Group B game in Ebebiyin . 'The internet wasn't set up until two hours later, and there's never enough food. They have to serve us at the buffet, otherwise they'd run out before the staff have eaten, and the portions are tiny. I'm getting up in the morning crazy hungry.' It could have been worse. Several teams have had to move hotels amid the hastily planned tournament, and Monday's opponents Tunisia arrived at their base to find no electricity, running water, soap, bed sheets or towels. The Democratic Republic of the Congo face Tunisia on Monday at the Estadio de Bata . 'I guess we weren't that bad off then,' laughs Bolasie. 'Because I thought we were having a terrible time until I heard the other stories.' Ebebiyin is about as far as you can imagine from where Bolasie hopes to end up – at the pinnacle of European football. 'It's any player's dream to play in the Champions League,' he says. 'I think it's normal, and for myself I want to be at that level. If I get a chance to take the step up, I'd like to.' That might ring alarm bells for Crystal Palace fans and their new manager Alan Pardew, but with the form Bolasie is showing it can only be a matter of time before one of the big boys come knocking, especially if his game continues to develop at its current rate. A Democratic Republic of the Congo fan cheers for Bolasie and co in Ebebiyin against Cape Verde . It is only six years since the Congolese star was playing for Hibernians in Malta, a chance he took because it meant the opportunity to play full time. From there he turned down a contract at Sturm Graz to sign for Plymouth, going out on loan twice before moving to Bristol City, and then on to Palace. 'The journey has made me stronger as a person and a footballer, because I didn't have it all my way,' he explains. 'I had to go out on loan to the Conference, League Two, then come back and play. Then we got relegated, so I had to play in League One to try and get back in the Championship. I learned a lot.' Just when he was starting to make a name for himself two years ago, the Cup of Nations came around, leaving the winger a difficult decision – stay and keep up the momentum, or represent the country of his parents' birth. In the end he chose the former, helping Palace win promotion. Democratic Republic of the Congo's goalkeeper Robert Kidiaba Muteba poses in front of his teammates . The timing is less than perfect this time around too. Three weeks ago, Bolasie's fiancé gave birth to their second child, just before the player had to leave for the tournament. 'It's been very hard,' he admits. 'I'm going to go back and she might not even know me.' On top of the personal upheaval, it's also not an ideal time to leave for footballing reasons, with a new manager in place. 'He's a top manager,' says Bolasie of Pardew. 'He's not come from being sacked, he's come from another team. I think he's been aware of me for a while because his assistant at Newcastle, John Carver, worked with me at Plymouth.' But after three wins in Pardew's first three games, Bolasie admits his team-mates have been messaging him suggesting he might struggle to get back in the team. Crystal Palace have enjoyed a recent rejuvenation in form since Alan Pardew returned to the club . 'It's going to be interesting,' he laughs. 'I guess, when everyone's doing well, that's when you leave it to the manager.' Such is Bolasie's form, both at home and here in West Africa, that dropping him seems a remote possibility. Congo's left winger was undisputedly the man of the match in the first game against Zambia, and despite a disappointing performance against Cape Verde, is unquestionably his side's star man, and their only goalscorer so far in Equatorial Guinea. The curling effort from the edge of the box on Monday took his international goals this season ahead of his club tally, and it's something the player knows he has to work on. 'The only thing people are saying right now is that I don't score enough goals. But I'm pretty confident that's going to come, and when it comes it's going to be really interesting.' Things could have been very different for Bolasie, who was eligible to play for both England and France, but instead picked Congo two years ago. Had he waited, his domestic form this season might well have led to a call up from Roy Hodgson. Bolasie took inspiration from Wilfried Zaha's (left) international call up to the England squad . 'England are like that,' he reflects. 'I think there's a lot of people that get called up.' 'At the time I remember Wilfried [Zaha] getting called for the England team, and I did think it could be possible. But I thought, 'I can do something for Congo, something a bit special.' That special something could be achieved in the next few weeks. The Leopards haven't won a Cup of Nations since 1974, but a win against Tunisia on Monday night would take them into the knock-out stages, and they have a squad capable of progressing further. 'Getting out of the group was always the target,' says Bolasie. 'Then anything can happen. The way the tournament's looking, it's really tight, anyone can go through, and if some of the bigger teams don't qualify then anyone can win it.' If Bolasie can lead his team to victory, he will confirm his status as a new legend of African football. Bolasie's teammates have joked that he will struggle to get back into the team following Pardew's arrival .","Crystal Palace winger fast becoming one of Africa's finest talents .

"This sequence of never-before-seen photographs shows the Challenger space shuttle disaster from a dramatic new perspective as it explodes over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven crew on board. They were uncovered by a Reddit user who was sorting through the attic of his recently deceased grandmother nearly 30 years after the tragedy. American Mustache, who posted the photos, says they were given to his NASA-contractor grandfather by a co-worker and despite all efforts, he hasn't found pictures from the same angle. Scroll down for video . Countdown to disaster: The Challenger Shuttle took off for the ninth and last time on January 28, 1986 . New perspective: Reddit user American Mustache posted a series of never before seen photos  that document the Challenger disaster from beginning to end on Tuesday . Once hopeful: America was full of hope as the very symbol of the space age achieved liftoff and began its ascent towards the vast cosmos . America watched: The launch appeared to go smoothly at first, a launch which American Mustache says he witnessed on television from his fourth grade classroom . Something amiss: As seconds continued to pass, unusual changes in the smoke plume and pitch of the shuttle made it progressively clearer to layman viewers that something was amiss . The shots capture the tragedy . beginning to end: from the anxious yet hopeful moments before take-off . through to the devastating end when all that's left of the once-mighty . spacecraft is a lingering plume of smoke off the Florida coast. 'My grandfather worked for NASA as a contractor for years,' writes American Mustache. 'So he got to see just about every launch. His . friend was the one who took these shots. 'He gave him a copy of the . prints and somehow they got mixed in and forgot about for years until I . found them the other day.' Doomed from the start: NASA experts who witnessed the disaster saw things the untrained eye could not. The color and size of the smoke indicated there were serious problems just seconds after takeoff . All too real: The extent of the tragedy became all too clear as the smoke plume grew ever large and then was seen to envelope Challenger itself (left) Horrifying: Fuel tanks began to jet away in opposite directions spewing white vapor and leaving behind a startling pyrotechnic display . All seven Challenger crewmembers - . Christa McAuliffe, Michael J. Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison . Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik - perished in the disaster . on January 28, 1986. The . launch had received particular attention because of the inclusion of . McAuliffe, the first member of the Teacher in Space Project, after she . beat 11,000 candidates to the coveted role. The . unique trip, where she planned to teach American students from space, . gained the program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had . an immediate rapport with the media. But . the excitement quickly turned to horror when the shuttle exploded about . 10 miles in the air, leaving a trail debris falling back to earth. Rest in peace: The seven astronauts who died onboard were Francis R. Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Gregory B. Jarvis, Christa McAuliffe, Judith A. Resnik, Ellison S. Onizuka and Ronald E. McNair . All was lost that January day as the shattered remains of the Space Shuttle Challenger plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean . Everything changed: The immense explosion was seared in the minds of a generation of Americans who would no longer see NASA and its once-inspiring Space Shuttle program the same way again . The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks. The . shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts, but it became known . later that at least several of those on board survived the initial . explosion. Then-president . Ronald Regan ordered a probe into the Challenger catastrophe, where it . was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were . said to have played a role in the accident. Grounded: The smoke would soon settle, but it would be two years before the pioneers at NASA would again take to the skies in a Space Shuttle . The crew of the space shuttle Challenge from 1986.

It . resulted in a nearly three-year lapse in NASA's shuttle program, with . the next shuttle, Discovery, taking off on September 29, 1988. NASA . ended the shuttle program for good last year, retiring the remaining . vessels and instead opting for multimillion-dollar rides on Russian . Soyuz capsules to get U.S. astronauts to the International Space . Station. Private U.S. companies hope to help fill the gap, beginning with space station cargo and then, hopefully, astronauts. In their honour: The Challenger Memorial Plaque at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, in memory of the seven crew members who died in the 1986 disaster . Challenger was one of NASA's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies. It was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle, but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft. In its heyday, it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut. But it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off. Roger Boisjoly, a NASA contractor at . rocket-builder Morton Thiokol Inc, warned in 1985 that seals on the . booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures. 'The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order — loss of human life,' he wrote in a memo. On . the eve of the ill-fated flight, Boisjoly and several colleagues . reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of . predicted cold weather at the Kennedy Space Center. But they were overruled by Morton Thiokol managers, who gave NASA the green light. After the accident, Boisjoly testified to a presidential commission investigating the Challenger accident. The . group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the . booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of . the shuttle's hydrogen fuel. Boisjoly died in 2012 aged 73.","Sequence of images show the explosion from a dramatic new perspective .

"Sky Sports News have pulled reporters from the streets on deadline day to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos. The rolling TV channel was forced to reconsider its tactics after a series of problems during their live transfer coverage in September. This included one journalist trying to report the latest updates as a fan crept up behind him and shoved a sex toy in his ear. A blow-up doll put in an appearance as the clock ticked towards the transfer deadline last September . Alan Irwin had his broadcast interrupted by a fan with a sex toy at Everton last year . Sky Sports News have now taken the decision to place their reporters inside stadiums and training grounds, rather than outside the gates in public areas.

"He's famous for his love of nature and organic farming and now the Prince of Wales is set to give the world a glimpse of his eco-friendly ethos in action courtesy of a new book. Highgrove: A Garden Celebrated takes readers inside the stunning gardens enjoyed by the heir to the throne and his wife, as well as offering tips on how to recreate the look at home. Highlights include the gorgeous Sundial Garden, a formal plot bursting with Prince Charles' favourite delphiniums, and the Carpet Garden, a pretty spot festooned with scented exotic flora. Spectacular: Camassia, buttercups and dandelions bloom in the wildflower meadow in front of Highgrove House - a vital addition for the area's insect population . The gardens are the culmination of more 30 years work and have been transformed from a brown path and a wilted lawn transformed into a veritable bower of blooms. Each has a different character and were created with input from some of the UK's leading garden designers, among them the Marchioness of Salisbury, Rosemary Verey, . Miriam Rothschild and Sir Roy Strong. And despite Prince Charles' penchant for tradition, not all of the gardens are formal, among them the gorgeous wild flower meadow. One of the most striking parts of the Highgrove Estate, the meadow, first planted 30 years ago, is home to a huge variety of wildflowers and buzzes with insect life in Spring - much to the delight of the eco-conscious royal. Elaborate: The Carpet Garden is packed with exotic blooms and was inspired by a Turkish rug that decorates one of the rooms in Highgrove House . Labour of love: Prince Charles says he has put his 'heart and soul' into the beautiful Highgrove gardens, among them Thyme Walk (right) seen here from the Lily Pool . Peaceful: The gorgeous Cottage Garden is packed with traditional perennials and includes Prince Charles' old fashioned summer house which he uses for writing . Another eye-catching part of the garden includes the Thyme Walk, a fragrant pathway edged by herbs, that runs from the Dovecote to the Terrace Garden. The new book, which comes complete with lavish photographs of the house and garden, is a joint project authored by the Prince of Wales and landscape architect Bunny Guinness. Writing in the Telegraph, Ms Guinness reveals that she spent months getting to know the gardens at Highgrove, describing them as 'sublime' and 'exhilarating'. For his own part, Prince Charles calls the work at Highgrove a labour of love and says he was inspired by the idea of creating an organic garden. Speaking about the increasingly industrialised approach to farming adopted elsewhere, he said: 'I minded terribly the more I thought about things, the endless use of chemicals and in the long term felt that this was unsustainable. Favourite: . The Sundial Garden is crammed with Prince Charles' beloved delphiniums . in summer as well as traditional British blooms such as Hollyhocks . Wildlife: The wildflower meadow at Highgrove is filled with insect-friendly flora such as poppies and daisies and provides a habitat for local fauna . 'I wanted to restore lost habitats and plant lots of hedgerows and trees and to heal the landscape.' He added: I have put my heart and soul into Highgrove – and I will continue to do so while I can. I find it hard to believe that by the time this book is published I shall have been at Highgrove for almost 34 years. 'My enduring hope is that those who visit the garden may find something to inspire, excite, fascinate or soothe them.' On this showing, finding something to inspire or excite at Highgrove ought not prove too difficult for most of us.

"Thievy Bifouma scored his second goal of the African Nations Cup to set Congo on their way to a 2-1 win over Burkina Faso and propel them into the knockout stages for the first time since 1992. The win, sealed by a second goal late on from substitute Fabrice Ondama, eliminated the group favourites, who had been runners-up at the last finals in South Africa two years ago. Congo finished top of Group A with seven points, followed by hosts Equatorial Guinea, who beat Gabon 2-0 in Bata.

Burkina Faso had to win to have any chance of advancing but were on the back foot after Bifouma scored in the 51st minute. The Congo striker, who also scored on the opening day, slid in to bundle home a square pass from Ferebory Dore. Burkina Faso had a magical run through the 2013 finals but there was no resemblance of that sorcery after yet another limp performance. They had lost to Gabon and drawn 0-0 with Equatorial Guinea in their opening two group matches. They finally scored their first goal of the tournament after more than four hours when Aristide Bance equalised to set up a potentially thrilling final four minutes only for a goalkeeping error to allow Ondama to restore Congo's lead within one minute. Congo manager Claude Le Roy watches on ahead of side's clash against the Stallions . Bance converted a square pass from Issiaka Ouedraogo in the 86th minute but any chance of a grandstand finish ended when Germain Sanou punched his clearance straight onto Ondama for Congo's winner. Congo now play in Saturday's quarter-final in Bata against the runners up in Group B, which will be determined on Monday. Congo last appeared at the Nations Cup finals 15 years ago and have only twice made it past the first round, in Cameroon in 1972, when they won the tournament, and in 1992, when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals.","Thievy Bifouma fired Congo into the lead in the 51st minute .

"Hosts Equatorial Guinea pulled off one of the shocks of the tournament to reach the quarter finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. The National Lightening, as the Equato-Guinean side are known, stunned Gabon thanks to a penalty from Javier Balboa and a late second from Ivan Edu to put their neighbours out of the competition. Balboa scored from the spot to convert a penalty he won himself, having pulled off a lovely step over before bursting into the box where he was tripped by Lloyd Palun.

The former Real Madrid striker stepped up to take it himself, and dispatched it brilliantly to send the Bata crowd into delirium. The winger could have made it two fourteen minutes from time, but after being brilliantly slid through on he fired his shot to close to Didier Ovono, who saved with his legs. However it wasn’t to prove costly, as Ivan Edu rounded off a counter-attack in the 86th minute to secure the victory. It continues the remarkable statistic that no host nation has failed to get out of the group stages of this tournament since 1994, but few have had so many factors against them in the build-up. Disqualified for fielding an ineligible player seven months ago, Equatorial Guinea only found out they were playing again when they took over from Morocco as hosts in November. They then changed manager in January, current boss Estaban Becker only stepping across from the women’s national team two weeks before the tournament began. But, against all the odds, their team, which includes part-timers from the domestic league, showed incredible spirit to hold on against a Gabonese side that post players from all around Europe’s top teams. The hosts had their goalkeeper to thank for the clean sheet that saw them into the last eight. Felipe Ovono (not to be confused with Gabon’s stopper Didier Ovono) was up to the test in the first half, saving well from both a powerful Aubameyang header and then from a stinging Bulot drive in the first half. Equatorial Guinea's Ivan Edu celebrates after sealing his country's place in the last eight with a late goal . Equatorial Guinea's players sprint off the bench to celebrating reach the quarter-finals of the competition . Local fans go wild at the final whistle as the hosts continue to progress at the Africa Cup of Nations . His best stops came in the minutes immediately after half time, when he acrobatically pushed a brilliant Aubameyang free kick over the bar, before denying Bulot from a similar free kick with another excellent save. Equatorial Guinea came into the game knowing that despite two creditable draws in their first two games, they would have to beat Gabon to go through, whatever the result in the group’s other game between Congo and the disappointing Burkina Faso. Perhaps unsurprisingly Gabon, ranked 56 places above their hosts in the World Rankings, were the better side for much of the game, dominating possession and the early chances. With Borussia Dortmund’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Charlton’s Frederic Bulot either side of the dangerous Malick Evouna a threat going forward. But the hosts did create a few opportunities of their own, with Middlesbrough’s Emilio Nsue, scorer of his country’s only previous goal this tournament, a threat in behind. Twice he almost found striker Raul Fabiani with a clever ball across the box, only for the Gabonese defence to clear at the last moment.

Goalkeeper Felipe Ovono dives to stop the ball reaching Gabon striker Pierre Aubameyang (centre) And soon after Equatorial Guinea had taken the lead Nsue forced a save from Didier Ovono on the counter-attack, but the hosts seemed content to sit back and await the Gabonese onslaught once they had their all-important lead. There were nervous moments – Bulot had a cross deflected just over the bar, and moments later the Charlton man fired over the bar from 8 yards out with the goal unguarded. But, remarkably, it was the hosts who looked the more likely to score when they picked off their opponents on the break, as Gabon struggled to shine in the most electric of atmospheres. And with four minutes remaining one such counter produced the goal that sealed it, Nsue’s shot parried into the path of Ivan Edu, who scuffed it home. In the end Congo’s win, thanks in part to a goal from former West Brom forward Thievy Bifouma, meant that they will move away from their fortress in Bata – where they remain unbeaten – to play their quarter-final in Ebebiyin, a tiny town in the north-east of the country. But, on Sunday night in the tiny west African state, that was never going to put a damper on the wild celebrations.","Javier Balboa scored from the penalty spot to give the hosts a 1-0 lead .

"Mark Hughes is hoping to take full advantage of Sunderland's struggles in front of goal as he prepares to take his Stoke side back to Wearside for the second time in under two weeks. While the Potters head north on a high in the wake of Monday night's 1-0 win over Newcastle at the Britannia Stadium, their opponents are looking for their first league win of the season. And Hughes believes his side's counter-attacking style of play is perfectly suited to capitalising on any frustrations felt by the Black Cats as they push for points at the Stadium of Light. Stoke manager Mark Hughes is confident his side can get the better of Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Hughes, who led his side to a 2-1 win over the same opponents in last month's Capital One Cup clash, told his club's official website: 'They seem to be struggling at the moment and drawing a lot of games. If they are a bit blunt up front hopefully we can capitalise on that. 'We're very much in a positive frame of mind after Monday and we're going into a game against opponents we have played quite recently and overcome. 'It's different in the Premier League - they will make changes and we probably will as well - and they will want to make amends but that may help us to a certain extent because we will always be a threat on the break.' Marc Muniesa scored a brace to dump the Black Cats out of the Capital One Cup in September . Potters full-back Phil Bardsley spent six years at Sunderland before leaving for the Britannia Stadium this summer and has already tasted victory against his former club having played a full part in the cup success. And the Scotland international wants more of the same this time. 'We have already been up there once this season and managed to win the game, so hopefully we can use that to our advantage in this game too,' he told Stoke City Player. Former Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley celebrates with Ryan Shawcross after beating Newcastle . 'It was a little bit strange when we went up there last week for the cup game because I spent so long up there, and still have a lot of people I am close to at the club. 'I'm a professional footballer though and I am a Stoke City player now. My only priority is doing everything I possibly can to help us record the three points from the game.' Monday's win over Sunderland's north-east neighbours came at a price with Mame Biram Diouf limping off with an injury which will keep him out of Saturday's clash. Mame Biram Diouf (R) will miss the Sunderland clash through injury but is expected back soon after .

"The delay in Raheem Sterling signing a new contract with Liverpool coincides with big changes at Impact Sports Management, who represent the England star. Agent Aidy Ward is in the process of leaving Impact to set up his own business and is taking Sterling and West Brom striker Saido Berahino with him. Another England international, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain of Arsenal, may follow. There has been speculation for some time that Ward, who works closely with that trio, would break away from the Rob Segal-run operation. Ward’s new company will also have athletics and boxing clients. Rising British heavyweight hope Anthony Joshua, an Olympic gold medallist, was linked with Ward before he turned professional. Raheem Sterling's Liverpool contract talks have been delayed due to his agent Aidy Ward . There will be short-term complications in any new deal involving Sterling or Berahino because of their current representation contracts with Impact, who look after nearly 200 players. But Segal said: ‘Everything is being worked out between myself and Aidy in a very amicable fashion, despite some in our industry suggesting otherwise. Aidy wants to go it alone and I can understand the reasons but we will continue to work together when it suits us.’ West Brom striker Saido Berahino (right) is another player who shares the same agent as Sterling . With most of the negativity about Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup coming from the powerful UK press, the organising committee hope a British candidate emerges from the global recruitment search for their World Cup communications director to be based in Doha. UEFA look to be playing a highly tactical game over the FIFA presidential election since Michel Platini declared he was not going to challenge Sepp Blatter. But instead of supporting another candidate, UEFA are happy both Dutchman Michael van Praag and Prince Ali of Jordan  are standing as they want as much anti-Blatter noise as possible over the next four months. Meanwhile it is likely that Blatter’s stooge candidate Jerome Champagne will get the five nominations he needs to contest the race because the Swiss will want one friendly rival in the mix whom he can control. The FA are expected to support Prince Ali even with Van Praag deciding to stand and Chile’s Harold Mayne-Nicholls another possibility.

Sky deadline revamp . Sky Sports News are making much-needed changes to their transfer deadline day coverage after the fiasco of the last window. Two reporters had to seek sanctuary inside grounds from fans’ protests, while sex aids were brandished by mischievous supporters in front of the cameras at two other chaotic venues. This time around SSN, who go ludicrously over the top at the end of the transfer window, intend to make next Monday more of a studio-based day. This will involve many of their leading pundits analysing the day’s events, plus more news of deals across Europe. Sky are asking clubs to allow their reporters to deliver their frequent updates from inside the grounds so any demos or exhibitionist behaviour can be avoided. However, Sky will not say how many Premier League outfits have agreed to let them in. Meanwhile, with Sky believing they invented deadline day TV coverage, BT Sport are sure to antagonise them with their ‘mellow yellow’ promo featuring Robbie Savage that lampoons Sky’s colour motif on the day.

"It's a Saturday night in Sisaket, a small town in Thailand's Isan province, and huge crowds have gathered around a makeshift boxing ring ahead of the big fight. But the two promising fighters about to take to the ring aren't your average boxers: Instead, they're an 11-year-old boy named Nat Thanarak and his opposition - a 12-year-old called Nong Em. Muay Thai is one of the toughest martial arts in the world and children as young as seven are paid to compete in vicious bouts that attract bets which run into thousands of baht. Scroll down for video . Painful: A little boy grimaces during a bout. Thai boxing allows strikes with the feet and elbows as well as fists . Professional: Despite his lack of years, Nat Thanarak, 11, is a professional Thai boxer . Thailand has an estimated 30,000 child boxers but the impact of beginning a fighting career so young can be severe, with brain damage comparable to that seen in car accident victims and early onset dementia among the risks. Despite the risks, it is not illegal for children to fight provided they have their parents permission. But although young fighters are supposed to wear padded clothing, in practice, they rarely do. Even if it means the chance of serious injury to their children, in poverty-stricken regions such as Isan, the lure of prize money can prove too much to resist - with or without pads. One such fighter is Nat Thanarak, a boy from a poor family whose main source of income is the pittance his mother, a nanny working in Bangkok, sends them each month. The money he makes is the difference between eating and starving and so, the little boy lives a life that involves four hours of training each day, a strict diet and little time for play. 'I do it because I get money,' he explains in his childish treble. Asked what he'd do should he manage to win one of the more lucrative fights staged in Bangkok, he replies: 'Buy a motorbike!' Tiny: Despite risking brain damage, dementia and serious injury, children as young as seven compete . Fighter: Nat Thanarak and his father Watchara who says he worries about what might happen to his son . His . upcoming fight with Nong Em is an important one and has attracted huge . bets, including a 50,000 baht (£1,000) flutter raised by his village - a . vast amount in Thailand, where £1,000 is more than the average person . earns in a year. But . to win it, he needs to weigh 25kg and is currently 3kg overweight. As a . result, his father Watchara has cranked up his regime, which already involves . push-ups, lifting oil cans and building up his neck muscles courtesy of a . chunk of concrete attached to his hat. 'This is the most important fight of his career,' explains Mr Thanarak. 'But he needs to lose three kilos before he can fight.' His solution is drastic. Daily 8km runs in 30 degree heat, all while sporting a sweat suit in a bid to get rid of excess water and help him lose weight. The competition: Nat will face 12-year-old Nong Em who won his first fight with a knock out aged seven . Working out: In a bid to lose weight, Nat does 8km runs in 30 degree heat while wearing a sweat suit . Despite the dangers, unemployed Mr Thanarak says he has no choice. 'Sometimes we can't make ends meet,' he explains. 'We are broke and have to borrow money. 'If he didn't fight, I would go to work in Bangkok with my wife and send . money back to my kids,' he continues. 'Sometimes Nat realises how much is riding on his boxing but sometimes he doesn't . because he's too young. He wants to play - he misses his friends.' But not being able to play is the least of Nat's concerns. As researchers at Bangkok's Ramathibodi Hospital have revealed, the child risks far more than limited playtime. 'Their brains are still growing,' explains Professor Jiraporn Laothamatas. 'When you do damage to a child, it's much more severe than in an adult. Education: Children who show promise in Muay Thai are sent to boxing camps with fees paid from winnings . Brutal: Children taking part in Muay Thai bouts can kick and elbow their way to victory as well as punch . Known as 'the art of eight limbs' Muay Thai involves using the arms, shins, fists and feet to overcome opponents. Invented in Thailand, the sport became widely popular after being incorporated into military training by King Naresuan in 1560. Until recently, bonds made from knotted rope were used to protect the knuckles and damage the opposing fighter but after several deaths, they were exchanged for padded gloves in the 1990s. 'There . might be some lower intelligence level compared to normal standard . kids. Some dementia might happen. Some don't think well, don't feel well . but they don't know how to tell what's different to them.' Mr Thanarak is not unaware of the risks and says he does worry about the risk of brain injury. 'I am worried about damage to his brain . but my son loves boxing,' he says. 'He wants to fight. I told him to stop after the . last fight. He refused. If he doesn't fight, our money will go . down and that's a problem because the money is supporting our family. 'The fact is, I don't want him to fight. He's still so young.' For his own part, Nat says he wants to carry on. 'I will continue training,' he insists. 'It makes me strong and it will make my village famous.' It might also leave him with brain damage but for now, little Nat and thousands like him will continue to risk life and limb in the boxing ring.

"The Football Association will investigate Manchester United manager David Moyes' latest outburst against referees following Tuesday night's defeat to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup. The 2-1 first leg loss was United's third defeat in a week - the first time this has happened since 1992 - and Moyes claimed afterwards his team are 'playing referees as well as the opposition.' It follows on from Moyes saying it was 'scandalous' that United were not awarded a late penalty against Tottenham in a league defeat at Old Trafford on New Year's Day. An FA spokesman said: 'We are looking into David Moyes' comments to the media following the match at Sunderland.' Scroll down for video . Not a happy man: United boss David Moyes said his side had to play against the officials as well as Sunderland . Andre Marriner had no choice but to award Sunderland a penalty after his assistant Peter Bankes flagged that Tom Cleverley had tripped Adam Johnson just inside the penalty area. A referee can over-rule his assistant but given the relative positions of the two officials that was not credible. Although Cleverley’s contact was at most minimal, it was a silly challenge in a critical area and that forced Bankes to make a decision. Perhaps it was harsh but Manchester United’s reaction was over the top, with Ryan Giggs shouting at Marriner and Rafael picking up a yellow card for his protest. The Brazilian might well have seen red minutes later when making a rash tackle but Marriner wisely decided that the two offences did not merit a dismissal and left United with 11 players. After Fabio Borini's penalty consigned United to another defeat, Moyes . said: 'After the first 15 minutes I thought we were very good. We . defended a terrible free-kick, but how the referee has given a free-kick . for that is way beyond me. 'I . just cannot see how that is a free-kick. 'And the penalty? We had a . player booked for that theother day against Tottenham. The  referee is . in a great position to look  at it, down the line, 15 yards, and the . linesman gives it from behind and he cannot see through Patrice Evra. ‘That is what we’re finding at the moment. The performance was good without having the last bit. ‘I have experience and I can sense it’s on the verge of turning. I sense we’re about to get a bit better.’ More . than 5,000 Manchester United supporters were in the 31,547 crowd and . Moyes paid tribute to them and Ferguson, who left the Stadium of Light . through the Press room carrying a bottle of red wine. Moyes . added: ‘I can only see Alex as a great sounding board, a great help, . and so is Sir Bobby Charlton, he is  terrific. Bryan Robson is at the . training ground regularly. Spot of bother: Tom Cleverley brings down Adam Johnson and concedes a penalty . Making the call: Referee Andre Marriner points to the penalty spot . Not impressed: Patrice Evra argues with referee Marriner . ‘It’s . great 5,000 came up tonight and they were fantastic throughout the . game. They recognised how well their team had done for most of the game. ‘This . hasn’t happened at Man United for a long time. I thought the support . were great for sticking with their club, sticking with their manager and . that is exactly what you need when you are not doing so well. ‘We . need a couple of fair decisions. We had a couple of penalty kicks . against Tottenham and we have one given against us tonight for that. My . goodness, give me strength.’ Moyes will hope to have strikers Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie fit for the second leg. Not going to plan: United defender Nemanja Vidic looks dejected as his side lost for the third time in a week . All going wrong: Ryan Giggs gave Sunderland the lead with an own goal . But . there is more concern for the manager with United captain Nemanja Vidic . set to leave Old Trafford this summer after his agent said he is . unlikely to sign a new contract. Vidic’s . four-year deal runs out at the end of the season and talks over a new . one have stalled, with  Italian clubs Inter Milan, Fiorentina and Napoli . monitoring the situation. His . agent Silvano Martina said: ‘At the moment, I would rule out an . extension with Manchester United. Vidic, given his contract situation, . has several teams looking at him.’ Not going to plan: Danny Welbeck and United struggled at the Stadium of Light . Tuesday . night’s win for Sunderland was their first over United for 20 games. And manager Gus Poyet, whose side are bottom of the league, was at a . loss to explain their excellent cup form. He . said: ‘It is something I need to find out why we beat top teams and are . so clinical in the cup and can’t do the same in the league. That’s my . job. ‘Are we favourites? No . chance. They have Rooney and van Persie to come back. We are in a better . situation but playing Man U away, anything can happen and we need . another very good performance.’","United suffer third defeat in a week after losing to Spurs and Swansea .

"Greece was teetering on the brink of political and economic meltdown last night as attempts to form a coalition government collapsed. Fears increased that the country could fall into the hands of extremists after anti-austerity fascists and communists polled strongly in Sunday’s General Election. Conservative New Democracy leader Antonio Samaras, whose party took the largest share of the vote, 19 per cent, admitted he could not form a new administration. Scroll down for video . Extremism: Supporters of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party raise flares as they celebrate winning seats in the Greek Parliament for the first time. They are set to have 21 deputies . ‘We did everything we could but it was impossible,’ he said. Samaras had been given three days to form a coalition after Sunday’s vote. Any hopes disappeared within 24 hours. The political vacuum could now be filled by the extreme Left-wing party Syriza or the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, both of which bitterly oppose austerity measures. Syriza was the second-largest party at the polls, gaining 17 per cent, and now has three days to form a coalition. Its leader Alexis Tsipras called the EU bailout of Greece a ‘tragedy’ and Sunday’s election an ‘anti-austerity vote’. He has said he wants to lead a coalition of the Left and could talk to the leaders of the Centre-Left party Pasok, which was in power when Greece first negotiated a £88billion bailout in 2010. It won just over 13 per cent of the votes at Sunday’s election. Should Tsipras fail to form a coalition after three days, the mandate will then go to Pasok. If the deadlock is not resolved three days after that, then the country will face new elections under a caretaker government in mid-June. In total, more than six in ten Greeks voted against austerity measures. Lurking in the background is Golden Dawn, which won 7 per cent of the vote. Turmoil: Supporters of the Left Coalition party applaud as they watch exit polls last night. However, the two governing parties will fall two seats short of winning an overall majority . Its leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos yesterday warned: ‘The time for fear has come – we are coming.’He said his party, whose supporters wave flags which look like swastikas, would spearhead gains for the far Right across Europe. ‘Greece is only the beginning,’ he told a press conference yesterday in which Greek journalists were forced by shaven-headed supporters of the party to stand up as he entered the room. Since the last general election three years ago, the party has capitalised on fears that illegal immigration is out of control. It blames foreigners for thefts, prostitution and drug dealing, and in some areas escorts pensioners on shopping trips to prevent them being mugged. The country now faces weeks of political turmoil after no party won enough votes to govern alone in the general election. Stock markets plunged almost seven per cent yesterday amid the uncertainty as the leader tried in vain to form a Coalition. The stock market fell 6.6 per cent this afternoon as the uncertain result raised fears that Greece could ultimately be forced to pull out of the eurozone. Before his failure to form a coalition Mr Samaras had said: 'I understand the rage of the people, but our party will not leave Greece ungoverned.' If a government cannot be formed, a new election will be held in mid-June as the country is forced to outline how they will push through 14.5billion euros (£11.7bn) worth of cuts. Greece is also due to receive a 30billion euro (£24.2bn) loan from the eurozone and IMF in June so it can continue to meet its debt repayments. Political turmoil: Far-right Golden Dawn party leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos speaks at a press conference as his party secured almost 7 per cent of the vote in elections yesterday . If aid is cut off, analysts at Commerzbank estimated, the country would have trouble paying its debts by autumn. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Athens would still be expected to live up to its agreements.'Of course the most important thing is that the programs we agreed with Greece are continued,' she said. Her remarks were echoed by a European Commission spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, who stressed the need for 'full and timely implementation' of Greece's agreement with its international creditors and underlined that 'solidarity is a two-way street.' Analyst Vangelis Agapitos said protracted instability would threaten the country's eurozone membership. Extreme: A supporter of the far-right Golden Dawn party holds a flare last night as they won 7 per cent of the vote. The party has vowed to kick out immigrants and mine Greece's borders with Turkey . Greece's debt inspectors - the eurozone, IMF and European Central Bank, collectively known as the troika - could turn the screws by halting release of the bailout funds until Athens moves forward with its pledged reforms. 'Europe can live without Greece but I don't think Greece can live without Europe,' he said. 'If the troika is bluffing, Greece will remain in the euro. But if the troika says: ""I can negotiate, but first show me some progress,"" Greece has no progress to display right now.' 'If the troika rattles our bars, then either the people will come to their senses at the next elections or the country will enter an alternative course, and when we open that door we will see what kind of chaos - or paradise - lies behind.' Seats victory: Leader of extreme-right Golden Dawn party Nikolaos Mihaloliakos (C) talks to reporters as he is escorted by followers on his way to a news conference . The big election winner was the anti-bailout Radical Left Coalition, or Syriza, who took second place with 16.8 per cent of the vote - giving them 52 seats. Pasok, which has spent 21 years in . government since 1981 and stormed to victory with more than 43 per cent . in 2009, saw its support slashed to about 13.5 per cent. It will have . just 41 seats, compared to 160 in the last election. Pasok and New Democracy saw their . support plummet to the lowest level since 1974, when Greece emerged from . a seven-year dictatorship. The outcome showed widespread public . anger at the harsh austerity measures imposed over the past two years in . return for rescue loans from other European Union countries and the . International Monetary Fund. Neo-Nazis: Supporters of the extreme far right Golden Dawn party, all dressed in black shirts, brandish flares in the Greek port city of Thessaloniki last night . The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn movement - who . secured 7 per cent of the vote - has been blamed for violent attacks on . immigrants and ran on an anti-immigrant platform, vowing to 'clean up' Greece and calling for land mines to be planted along the country's . borders. Their 21 seats in parliament marks a stunning rise for a group that earned just 0.29 per cent of the vote in 2009.

"Gus Poyet is confident Connor Wickham is playing better now than when his goals helped spark Sunderland's remarkable recovery last season. The 21-year-old striker scored five times in three  Premier League appearances at the end of the last campaign to help drag the Black Cats back from the brink of relegation. Poyet, who recalled the former Ipswich frontman from a loan spell at Leeds to hand him his big chance, has installed Wickham as his first-choice lone striker this time around and although he is yet to open his league account, the manager is convinced he is offering even more to the team. Sunderland striker Connor Wickham has not scored in the Premier League this season . Black Cats manager Gus Poyet has come out in support of his striker ahead of the clash with Stoke . The Uruguayan said: 'I actually think he is playing better than he did last year, but he is scoring fewer goals. 'It's about finding a balance. We don't want him to be the best player on the pitch every week without scoring, but nor do we want him to be awful and scoring a goal every now and then. 'He needs to find the balance between playing well and scoring - and he will get there. 'We need to keep on creating chances for him and it is only when we stop creating chances that he will have a problem. 'There's a big difference between a striker who doesn't score because his team is not creating chances, and one who has chances but is missing them.' Wickham scored five times in three games at the end of the last campaign to save Sunderland from relegation . Wickham is not alone in enduring a barren spell in front of goal with none of Poyet's three main frontmen - Scotland international Steven Fletcher and United States counterpart Jozy Altidore are the others - having yet registered this season. But as he heads into Saturday's home clash with Stoke, which will provide Sunderland with their latest attempt to secure a first Premier League win of the season, Poyet is happy that the youngster has improved significantly as a player during their time together. No Sunderland strikers have scored a Premier League goal this season, including Jozy Altidore (right) The 46-year-old said: 'He is holding the ball the ball up better now, and I think that's due to the way we train and the fact that he knows just what we want him to do. 'It's not just about doing it in games, it's also about taking care of the ball every day in training, and he does that. 'He has been impressive and he has been a massive player for us.

"Was this golf’s biggest-ever collapse? Heck, was this the most shocking capitulation in the long history of sport? ‘Expect the unexpected’ read the banners advertising the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship but no-one expected anything quite so unexpected as what happened on a truly dramatic afternoon in the desert. The facts are Martin Kaymer birdied three of his first four holes to move 10 shots clear in pursuit of his fourth victory in this event. At that point, Ladbrokes rated him 500-1 on to do what he did at the United States Open last June and march relentlessly to victory. Unknown Frenchman Gary Stal, ranked 357 in the world, has won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship . Stal, who shot 65, looked like a man in shock as he was awarded the handsome trophy . To put that into perspective, AC Milan were merely 100-1 on when they went 3-0 up against Liverpool at half-time in the 2005 Champions League final. This was a racing certainly to rank alongside Devon Loch in that Grand National all those years ago. And yet Kaymer, with the winning post in sight, collapsed every bit as dramatically as the Queen Mother’s horse. This being golf, though, the agony went on for more than two hours. ‘I am very surprised by what happened and a little shocked,’ said Kaymer. ‘I certainly didn’t think that would happen.’ He wasn’t the only one. The beneficiary was 22-year-old Frenchman Gary Stal, ranked 357th in the world, who shot 65 and kept his nerve over the closing holes while Kaymer was losing his. He was emotional at the finish, and not just because this was his first win on tour. Stal was on the golf course last May at the BMW PGA Championship when he learned his mother Christine had died from cancer. Martin Kaymer had seemed certain to win and had a 10-shot lead at one stage on the final day . But Kaymer suffered a monumental collapse and didn't even finish second in the end . After falling eight shots behind Kaymer on Saturday, Rory McIlroy said he was playing for second place, and duly achieved his fourth runner-up finish in this event with a final-round 66. Not in a million years, though, did he think he would be finishing second to Stal. Kaymer won both the US Open and the Players Championship last year when leading from start to finish, and did the same when achieving his first win in this event in 2008. All that, however, proved no preparation once his swing began to unhinge following a double bogey at the 9th. The pressure was on by the time he got to the 13th and, quite extraordinarily, the man who once had the hopes of a continent on his shoulders and still holed a 6ft putt to win the Ryder Cup found he could not cope. Just as he had on the 9th, he drove into a bush and had to take a penalty drop. Just as at the 9th he played from a waste area of sand and came up 30 yards short. We knew he was in trouble by what happened next. Kaymer’s old weakness used to be his chipping and weaknesses invariably show when a player is under the cosh. He caught the turf so far behind the ball it barely travelled a third of the intended distance, and he ended up with a calamitous triple bogey seven. Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy eventually finished second behind Stal . McIlroy had predicted earlier in the day that he would come second . The man who had reached 23 under par for his first 58 holes had played the next seven in a bewildering six over. Perhaps the only parallel for this in golf was when Arnold Palmer lost a seven-shot lead with nine holes to play in the 1966 US Open. McIlroy duly seized the moment. He birdied the 13th and the 15th. He knew an eagle was required at the par-five last and found himself needing to hole a bunker shot to achieve it. He played the shot beautifully, but the ball passed agonisingly by the edge of the hole. ‘I thought it had a chance to go in,’ said the world No 1. ‘I don’t think anyone expected Martin to lose his lead but I know as well as anyone what can happen. You make a couple of bad swings and lose confidence and guys behind you start holing putts. Once you lose momentum, it’s hard to get it back.’ Stal was a man in shock long after he was awarded the trophy. ‘What happened seems impossible, but I am very happy to get my first win,’ he said.","Frenchman Gary Stal won the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship .

"As international trade and tourism has grown in China so too has the need for English signs. But while the Chinese are known for their love of learning English, some of their translators need to go back to the classroom. From 'Fresh crap' to 'Horny care', Western travellers in the country are often left lost for words by the bizarre messages on some signs. Strange: This parking sign could lead to embarrassing misunderstandings between drivers with its bizarre message . Keep out: A mix-up at the sign-writer's makes this tourist attraction seem less than welcoming . Warning: English speaking visitors are warned not to tread on 'smiling' lawn in this odd message . A collection of some of the humorous signs spotted around the country were posted on Offbeat China. In some cases the amusing errors were caused by misinterpreting the Chinese characters, such as the peculiar advertisement in a supermarket aisle for 'A time sex thing'. This was caused because the characters for 'disposable products' can also mean 'one' and 'sex' when read separately. Special offer: This Chinese supermarket is left tongue-tied over its offer of disposable goods . Catch of the day: A misplaced letter at a fishmonger's makes the carp look less than appetising . Mixed messages: This spa is offering horny care alongside its more traditional treatments . Recipe for disaster: This menu translator will be left red-faced over this crude interpretation of a duck dish . Similarly, the Chinese character for 'dry' can sometimes be pronounced as 'f***', leading to the unfortunate menu item 'F*** the duck until exploded'. The mistake was repeated at other restaurants as well a shop offering dried goods. Other errors however, such as 'racist park' are caused by misunderstanding the meaning of the word. The sign in this case should have read 'ethnic museum'. Odd: Wine drinkers appear to be warned off throwing their glasses in this sign . Customer service: This sign in a changing room left a holiday-maker baffled as to what the store was offering . Cakes: This garbled sign in a restaurant window in Shanghai is just about legible for foreign visitors . Language barrier: The owners of this restaurant need to hire a better translator . Other signs that have brought a smile to travellers in the region include a cash point that offers to 'recycle currency' and a bank receipt offering 'male service'. And the intriguing sign spotted in a store changing room telling customers 'Don't touch yourself' is likely to have been a misplaced, but well-meaning offer to help fit clothes. Sometimes the signs are just the product of sloppy work, such as the misplaced letter at a fishmonger making the carp on offer less appealing, . In some cases however, the real meaning of the translator's work will remain hidden, such as the spa offering 'horny care' alongside more traditional treatments. And while their work may not be up to scratch, the translators have brightened many travellers' days with their amusing take on the English language. Money laundering: This cash point offers to recycle money for green-minded travellers . Comical: This road warning sign is a comedy of errors following a mistake in translation . Offer: A sign in Chinese and English indicates a room or hotel for foreigners in Shenyang. How many people took up the offer is unclear however .","Odd signs leave Westerners baffled as to true meaning .

"Wouldn't it be great if you had a way of making your wildest wishes come true? Now one 'virtual genie' company is granting hundreds of wishes to users through crowdsourcing technology. But there's nothing virtual about the wishes. Crowdwish.com offers users the chance to ask for anything they want, be it products, experiences, charity or causes, with the most popular wish being granted each day. Ultimately the Crowdwish team want the wishes and the people power behind them to be used to create a force for good, but that doesn't stop one asking for a trip to Bali. So far the start-up has made donations to charities such as the Red Cross, Action against Hunger, Save the Children and The Bill Clinton foundation, surprised NHS staff with gifts, lobbied CEOs for equal pay, and negotiated high street discounts. Make a wish: A new start-up called Crowdwish has launched where users can make any wish they want - and the most popular one will be resolved . Established by 43-year-old . entrepreneur Bill Griffin, the site encourages users to 'like' other . people's wishes through the webpage or via social media. Bill told MailOnline: 'I . kept seeing evidence for groups of people coming together online to . create outcomes for themselves that they wouldn’t have been able to . achieve on their own…from Kickstarter to the use of social media during . the Arab Spring. 'I know this sounds completely . ridiculous, but I wanted to create a site where people could come and . ask for literally anything and get a meaningful and freshly generated . response. That was the brief and it took me a while to figure on how it . was going to work, a bit longer to design, then about six months to . build.' After six months of building, the former marketing director of Comedy Central unveiled a simple website where users can ask for up to ten wishes for anything ranging from products, experiences, or causes. People who have made wishes can ask people to support them via Facebook and Twitter and the more people that ‘me-too’ them, the more chance they have of being granted. Brains behind the operation: Bill Griffin, former marketing director of Comedy Central, wants to use the critical mass of the users to help bring their dreams closer to reality . 'Whatever you’re hoping for, someone else - somewhere - is going to be wanting the same thing; the majority of our wishes are likely to be shared by other people. 'The greater the number of people who want something, the more likely that thing is to be delivered,' reads the site, which is soon to have an accompanying app. 'So Crowdwish exists to link together people’s hopes, dreams, ambitions and desires. It’s designed to bring people together to create outcomes that are more likely to happen if lots of people are asking for those outcomes, rather than a single individual. 'Every 24 hours the most popular wish on the site is taken on by our team of expert deal brokers, researchers and negotiators who then use the power of the combined demand to create results on behalf of that newly formed community,' said Bill. That isn’t to say that wishes will be . miraculously granted; more that the site will work tirelessly to make . this aggregated demand as influential as it can be. This . might involve creating discounts on popular products that have been . selected, it might involve lobbying people who can help change something . unfair, or it might be about creating unique experiences available . nowhere else. 'I think people like it as a notion; wishes have got a childhood iconography that is appealing at quite a deep level, plus they seem to respond well to the way in which the wishes get actioned - which is sometimes quite earnest and serious, then on other occasions is much more light-hearted and irreverent,' said Bill. The simple things: The crowning wish of the day was for free coffee so Bill and his team granted it . Consider it done! One user wished that people who worked for the NHS got the respect they deserve. The team visited a variety of hospitals to take staff some presents . If the most popular wish . of the day is for a physical product - a camera for example – Crowdwish will . use that aggregated demand to create a discount on the users' behalf. If it is a service needed, they will link wishers to the best . supplier, using a trust rating, at the most competitive price. Maybe it is a cause you feel strongly about, then the site will lobby those who could help directly, organise a meet-up or create a disruptive . action to help. If it is advice that people need, Crowdwish promise to commission . an expert or collate the collective experience or wisdom of those who . had dealt with similar circumstances or situations. Perhaps an . experience will be the most popular wish of the day, then they would . create a bespoke one for that community as a unique one-off at the best . possible price or perhaps for free. All in a day's work: Recently the Crowdwish team paid for an elderly couple's shopping for them after 'I wish I could help a stranger' was voted the top wish . Has Bill ever wanted to resolve a wish he couldn't? 'No,' he says plainly. 'And we never will because we just stick to achievable actions. 'We don’t claim to magically fulfill wishes like some Disney fairy-godmother and we stick really clear of those kind of cheesy ""Then Peter Andre jumped out of the cake and everyone started crying"" style resolutions. We just do something positive each day in line with what people want; we are not claiming any magic powers or miraculous abilities; we just do things that are useful, helpful or funny. While he promises he will never carry advertising on the site, he imagines three distinct revenue streams: Charging brands to be involved with the fulfillment of wishes as a PR/activation exercise, a constant offering in the style of Upworthy; now the fastest growing media site of all time, and a premium offering where wishes get actioned more rapidly, almost like a concierge vibe. So where does Bill see Crowdwish in three years time? 'You’re meant to have an insanely ambitious goal, right?,' he said. 'Well, here’s mine; to join together the world's hopes and ambitions, collate and quantify them, then use their critical mass to help bring those dreams closer to reality. I hope three years from now we’ve made significant progress towards that objective.' Read all about it: Users can easily track exactly which wishes have already been granted each day and read the personal stories that accompany them . AND THE TOP THREE, ACCORDING TO BILL... People voted for a gagging order on Katie Hopkins. We managed to dupe her into signing one by posing as obsessive fans (like she has those). That was quite funny. One woman was in a truly desperate situation where she had had to flea a horrendously abusive situation and was living in a half way house with no furniture or toys for her child, whose birthday was the coming weekend. We sorted out things for her that made her cry with happiness.","Crowdwish lets people make up to 10 wishes for anything they want .

"For all the talk about how the young Americans are going to push Rory McIlroy hard this year, it might be someone closer to home who proves the nearest thing to a rival. Martin Kaymer turned 30 on December 28 and will surely emphasise he is a man in his prime by completing an impressive statement of intent in the desert on Sunday. The final round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship was shaping up to be an epic duel in the sun between the winners of the last three majors when McIlroy notched his first hole in one as a pro on Friday, to pull within two strokes of the German. Martin Kaymer holds his ball up to the crowd after sinking a birdie on the sixth hole . Kaymer, who leads by six shots, chips out of the bunker on the 10th hole during the third round . Rory McIlroy, pictured playing a shot out of the bunker, had a frustrating third round in Abu Dhabi . As it was, the traditional ‘moving day’ saw Kaymer shoot 65 to set a new 54-hole tournament record of 20 under par and accelerate six clear of gifted Belgian, Thomas Pieters, while the world No 1 fired a 71 to be stuck in reverse. McIlroy knew where the blame lay for falling hopelessly adrift. He didn’t play badly by any means, indeed he only missed two fairways and one green in regulation. But his pace on the greens was awry all day. ‘I am extremely disappointed,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘Given how well I struck the ball a 65 or 66 was there for the taking but I missed countless opportunities. It was incredibly wasteful, and it looks like I will be playing for second place.’ McIlroy, who ended the day tied fifth, plays an approach shot over the water on the 18th hole . Kaymer, who shot a seven under par, lines up a putt on day three of the Abu Dhabi Championship . The German cemented his place at the top of the leaderboard during an impressive third round . Kaymer in conversation with with a rules official after his ball lands in a bush . Martin Kaymer tees off on the ninth hole during the third round at the HSBC Golf Championship . Going forward, though, there are plenty of positives. If truth be told, McIlroy rarely putts well on this course, so from that point of view it’s been business as usual. But he will be enthused by the quality of his ball-striking, which has been right up there with his best days of last year. Next up is the Dubai Desert Classic in 10 days, where he has putted well in the past, and so will provide a better opportunity for finding his groove on the greens. As for Kaymer, he showed once more that when he’s playing his best golf he is a match for anybody, including Mcllroy. He just needs to do it more consistently to give the Northern Irishman a run for his money in the world rankings. Kaymer won the Players Championship and the United States Open during a month-long golden spell during last May and June — but then registered only one top 10 during the rest of the year. Rory McIlroy plays his second shot on the fifth hole as he bids to surge up the leaderboard in Abu Dhabi . Thomas Pieters of Belgium hits out of the bunker during his third round in Abu Dhabi . The one time he was in serious trouble yesterday came on the par-five 10th. He had to take a penalty drop and found himself facing a tricky greenside bunker shot having played four strokes already. A double bogey there would have given the chasing pack hope. As it was, Kaymer played the sand shot to perfection, holing it for the unlikeliest of pars. He did the same thing on the first day, too. Indeed, on the three occasions he’s found himself in greenside bunkers in 54 holes, he’s taken a grand total of four shots to complete the trio of holes. American Rickie Fowler rides a camel following his round at the HSBC Golf Championship in Abu Dhabi . There’s not much hope for everyone else when someone’s doing that on the odd occasion they’re in trouble, is there? Pieters coped pretty well with the Kaymer onslaught to post a 70. The 22-year-old big hitter from Antwerp must have learned plenty, and will learn plenty more since he leads the chasing pack on 14 under. He will accompany Kaymer today, as the German completes the seeming formality of a fourth win on this course. That, in turn, will take him back into the world’s top 10, where he assuredly belongs.

"Tim Cahill came to Australia's rescue again on Thursday, scoring two goals, one of them among the most spectacular ever seen at an Asian Cup, to lead the host-nation into the semi-finals. With his team mates all fluffing their chances in front of goal, Cahill took it upon himself to calm Australia's jitters and secure a 2-0 win over China in the quarter-finals at Brisbane's Lang Park. Both goals came in the second half but it was the first, four minutes after the re-start, that will be remembered for years to come and go viral on the internet. Tim Cahill opened the scoring for Australia with a stunning bicycle kick against China in the Asian Cup . The home crowd were treated to a fine performance from the 35-year-old, who rolled back the years . China: Dalei; Linpeng, Hang, Fang (Zhipeng 46); Chengdong, Xi (Xu 83), Xiang, Zhi, Huikang, Ke (Hai 72); Lei . Subs not used: Cheng, Ang, Junmin, Junling, Jianye, Lin, Binbin, Hanchao, Lisheng . Australia: Ryan; Franjic, Davidson, Sainsbury, Wilkinson; Bresciano (Troisi 60), Luongo, Jedinak, Leckie (Burns 69), Kruse; Cahill (Milligan 80) Subs not used: Juric, Oar, Langerak, Behich, McKay, Galekovic, Antonis . Goals: Cahill 49, 65 . Referee: Jong-Hyeok Kim . Attendance: 46,067 . Cahill has made a habit of scoring stunning goals for his country -- most memorably his volley against the Netherlands in last year's World Cup -- but Thursday's eye-popper was perhaps his finest. When China failed to clear the ball from an Australian corner, Ivan Franjic innocuously headed the ball into the box in the direction of Cahill, who seemingly had nowhere to go with a defender breathing down his neck. But the 35-year-old, displaying the sort of athleticism of a teenager, leapt into the air and performed a perfect overhead bicycle kick, angling the ball across the six-yard box past the astonished Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei. 'It was instinctive,' he later told a news conference. 'The World Cup was probably a fluke and today was a probably a fluke again. 'I still know I can change games, I still know I can write my own script and at the same time effect football in Australia in a big way. 'I've never ever once not believed in the national team jersey...and when I get my chance then I have to take it.' Cahill celebrates after scoring against China in a game which saw Australia progress to the semi-finals . Mathew Leckie hugs Cahill (front) after he scored at the Suncorp  Stadium in Brisbane on Thursday . It was a moment of theatrical magic that not only revived Australia's title hopes but instantly breathed new life into the tournament. Sixteen minutes later, Cahill scored again, killing off China's hopes of going any further in the tournament, when he neatly headed the ball into the corner of the net after a cross from Mathew Leckie, who also had a fine match. Already Australia's all-time leading score, Cahill's brace lifted his international tally to 39 goals from 80 appearances and saved his country's blushes. The Australians will now play either Japan or the United Arab Emirates in next week's semi-finals. South Korea will face Iran or Iraq in the other semi. The Australians, beaten 1-0 by South Korea in their last group match, dominated possession against the Chinese but squandered a series of clear chances to score with Cahill the lone exception. Cahill gestures to the Australian fans in celebration as he helped his country reach the Asian Cup semis . Australia captain Jedinak waves to the supporters after leading the Socceroos to victory in Brisbane . They also provided their supporters with some heart flutters, carelessly giving the ball away on a handful of occasions and allowing China to threaten on the counter attack. The Australian captain Mile Jedinak, returning to the side after missing the last two group games with an ankle injury, was among the worst offenders and allowed his frustrations to get the better of him when he was booked for a reckless tackle on Ren Hang. China spent most of the first half defending deep inside their own territory but pressed forward after falling behind and came close to scoring with Zhang Linpeng unleashing a rocket from long-range that forced Mat Ryan to make a diving save. Sun Ke and Wu Lei also tested out the Australian keeper but the visitors were unable to respond to Cahill's brace and bowed out of the competition as the Australians marched on.","Mile Jedinak returned from injury to lead his team out at the Asian Cup .

"Rory McIlroy's early difficulties in his opening round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday could best be summed up by the precarious lie facing him on his 12th hole. After another poor tee shot in an increasingly erratic driving display had left his ball stationed just above a fairway bunker, McIlroy found himself with one foot positioned in the sand and the other outside, with his body tilted at a sharp angle. Already four strokes behind his playing partner Rickie Fowler, who was striking the ball with impressive fluency, he appeared destined to fall still further adrift. As McIlroy said later: ‘It was obviously a stroke I rarely practise, and so I was just relying on feel and instinct in the hope of getting the ball somewhere close to the green.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy's sensational bunker shot land 12ft from the hole . Rory McIlroy has his eye on his drive as he tees off on the 18th hole at Abu Dhabi Golf Club . McIlroy tees off during the opening round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday . Rickie Fowler (left) and World No 1 McIlroy couldn't be separated on day one of the tournament . McIlroy and his rival Fowler shake hands following the close of play after the opening round in Abu Dhabi . While it would be stretching things to say what happened next was an early candidate for shot of the year, there will certainly not be many better played this month. Hooding the clubface (keeping the clubface more upright to make the ball travel lower and further), McIlroy somehow managed to cover the 100-or-so yards separating him from the green so effectively he finished 12 feet from the hole. Instead of the likely bogey to dampen his enthusiasm further, he rapped home the birdie putt. That was all it took to shake off the early sloth. He went on one of those thrilling rampages that became so familiar last summer. By the time he finished he had gone from level par after 11 to signing for a 67 after registering four more birdies in the sequence, to leave him three strokes off the pace set by course specialist Martin Kaymer. What must Fowler have been thinking? One minute there was clear daylight between himself and McIlroy and for once it was Fowler who was pressing ahead. McIlroy believes he has 'unfinished business' at this event which he has never won after seven appearances . Martin Kaymer is out in front after the German (right) fired 10 birdies in his opening round of 64 . By the close, the personable American didn’t even have the small satisfaction of a one-shot ‘victory’ over his friendly rival after dropping his only stroke on his final hole for a 67 of his own. Asked about the rivalry afterwards, Fowler grinned and said: ‘There’s just no getting rid of him or shaking him off, is there?’ He knows, however, it’s not all bad news. ‘Rory is comfortably the best golfer in the world and so if I’m playing alongside him all the time, I must be doing something right,’ he added. Actually, he’s doing plenty right, as he continued from where he left off last year to make his debut round in the Middle East a notable one. Fowler acknowledged afterwards that watching McIlroy progress to become the complete player while embracing a global schedule had fuelled his own ambition to pursue a similar itinerary. ‘I like travelling and seeing different cultures anyway but I definitely think a further plus is that it helps you become a more rounded golfer,’ said the 26-year-old. As for McIlroy, he was ‘delighted with the score but less than pleased with how I arrived at it’. Thomas Pieters had a dream round and led in the clubhouse until Martin Kaymer came in one better . Ernie Els plays a shot in Abu Dhabi but the South African had an average opener finishing with a total of 70 . Accordingly, after lunch he was to be found on the practice ground, ironing out what will surely prove to be merely early-season kinks with his driver. For the rest, it must be ominous that even when he has a rare bad day with his most potent weapon, his short game rescues him to the extent he still shoots five under par. US Open champion Kaymer, three times a winner of this event, again showed his liking for these parts with a round featuring no fewer than 10 birdies. Not only is he defending one major this year, but two more will be held on courses where the formidable German has won in the past. ‘I don’t want to put any extra pressure on myself but yes, it clearly has the potential to be a big season,’ he said. Kaymer holds a one-stroke lead over the promising 22-year-old Belgian Thomas Pieters but Henrik Stenson, who signed off last year with a victory in neighbouring Dubai, could only manage a 76. Justin Rose spoiled a good front nine with a flurry of bogeys for a 73, while a tip of the hat to Englishman Tyrrell Hatton, who came to prominence last year while being the only other player after Robert Rock not to wear any headgear. This season, the 23-year-old from High Wycombe has given in to financial temptation, and took to the course wearing a cap emblazoned with the name of his new sponsor. He breezed round in a fine 66. Another happy young Englishman was Tom Lewis from Welwyn. He had a hole in one at the seventh during his 69 to win a £50,000 Cadillac.

"Iraq beat Iran 7-6 on penalties to reach the semi-finals of the Asian Cup on Friday after the two Middle Eastern rivals played out one of the most extraordinary matches in the tournament's history. With police heavily patrolling the stands and the tension escalating with each new dramatic development, Iraq fought back to beat a 10-man Iran after the teams finished tied at 1-1 at the end of normal time and then 3-3 after extra time. Defender Salam Shakir calmly converted the decisive penalty after Vahid Amiry missed for Iran, hitting the post, sending Iraq through to the semi-finals against South Korea. Iraq's players react to the winning penalty being scored to reach the semi-final of the cup . Iran's players were devastated once defeat to Iraq and failure to reach the semi-final was confirmed . The Iraqi players and their fans roared with delight, united in a rare moment of celebration for a country that has been torn apart by war. Eight years ago, Iraq defied the problems in their homeland to win the Asian Cup for the first time and now they are dreaming big again after beating their fiercest foes, who were brave in defeat. Iran initially took the lead when Sardar Azmoun scored a brilliant goal in the first half but were forced to retreat into defence when Mehrdad Pooladi was sent off in the 43rd minute when he was booked for a second time. Aged just 20 and standing 1.78 metres (5ft 10in) tall, Azmoun climbed above two defenders to connect with Vouria Ghafouri's cross from the right and steer the ball past Iraqi goalkeeper Jalal Hasssan into the net. AHmed Yaseen Gheni celebrates scoring for Iraq as his side reached the Asian Cup semi-final . The teams were tied 1-1 after 90 minutes but the score finished 3-3 after an incredible period of extra-time . Iraq, with the advantage of the extra man, drew level in the 56th minute. Alaa Abdul Zahra, returning to the Iraqi team after suspension, broke free down the left and whipped in a cross that beat everyone except Ahmed Yasin, who fired it back through a crowded six-yard box and into the net. Iraq took the lead twice in extra time only for Iran to hit back on each occasion. Younis Mahmoud, who famously scored the winner in the 2007 Asian Cup final, scored two minutes into extra time, but Iran tied the scores at 2-2 through Morteza Pouraliganji in the 103rd minute. Iran's fate seemed sealed when the same player gave away a penalty for bringing down Kasim as he was bearing down on goal. Salam Shakir is mobbed by his team-mates after converting the winning penalty for Iraq . There were several moments in the game where tensions threatened to spill over . Dhurgham Ismail converted the spot kick with just four minutes left on the clock before Iran substitute Reza Choochannejhad tied the scores again two minutes from the end of a classic, heart-stopping match. As expected, there was a heavy police presence at Canberra Stadium for the clash between two nations with a long political history. The Australian referee Ben Williams handed out 10 yellow cards and things briefly threatened to get out of hand when the teams began to push and shove each other near the end of extra time.","Iraq came from behind to beat 10-man Iran 7-6 in a penalty shoot-out .

"US goalkeeper Hope Solo had domestic violence assault charges against her dismissed on Tuesday, ending what she called 'one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life.' The case had been set for trial next week in suburban Seattle, but she can now turn her attention fully to World Cup preparations. The US Soccer Federation had resisted pressure from some to suspend Solo after she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree assault stemming from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in June. Charges dropped: Hope Solo and husband Jerramy Stevens exit the court room at Kirkland Municipal Court on November 4, 2014 in Kirkland, Washington but charges were dropped in court on Tuesday . 'Today's decision brings closure to what has been one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life,' Solo said in a statement, which she posted on Facebook and received 275 primarily supportive comments in the first 55 minutes. 'I always had faith that once the facts of the case were presented, I would be cleared of all charges and I am so happy and relieved to finally have it all behind me.' Solo, who also plays for the Seattle Reign, did not appear at Tuesday's hearing when Kirkland Municipal Court Judge Michael Lambo dismissed the charges. Solo last appeared for the US team on December 21 during a 0-0 draw against Brazil in the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. Solo released a statement on Facebook, describing the ordeal as 'one of the most difficult times of her life' Solo's lawyer, Todd Maybrown, sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that the alleged victims refused to be interviewed about the case. 'We are gratified that, after considering all of the facts and circumstances of this case, the judge has dismissed all charged against Hope Stevens,' Maybrown said in a statement. 'From the beginning, I've stated that Hope was the victim of an assault in this case. With a careful review of the facts surrounding these matters, it is clear that Hope never should have faced charges in the first place. ' 'Hope is very happy and relieved that she can now put this matter behind her. She looks forward to focusing her energies on the game she loves.' US goalkeeper Solo has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team . At a hearing last week, the judge renewed an order for a deposition after Solo's nephew and half-sister failed to appear for interviews. Prosecutors had said the pair didn't appear because they weren't served with subpoenas and there wasn't adequate time to notify them, given the New Year's Day holiday. In court documents, Solo said she was defending herself against her nephew, who is 6-foot-9 and weighs 280 pounds. She claims she was hit over the head with a broom handle. Solo's relatives claimed she attacked first. Messages left with prosecutors and a lawyer representing Solo's half-sister were not immediately returned Tuesday. The 33-year-old goalie has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team. Solo married former University of Washington and Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens in 2012. Stevens was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged. Maybrown also represented Stevens, who has a list of legal run-ins.","US keeper Hope Solo cleared of domestic violence charges on Tuesday .

A new procedure, which includes a 15-second face scan, is being developed which is capable of detecting tiny changes in skin colour. Data gathered from the scan will help doctors determine whether patients are suffering from an irregular heartbeat. Scientists have a new test so that atrial fibrillation, one of the most common heart rhythm problems, can be diagnosed with just a 15 second face scan rather than hooking the patient up to an electrocardiogram machine . With the help of a webcam and new software, the new 15-second test can detect atrial fibrillation (AF), a treatable but potentially dangerous heart condition characterised by irregular heartbeat. The technology records the subtle changes in skin colour which occur due to uneven blood flow caused by AF. These changes are so slight that they are invisible to the naked eye. However the skin on the face is thinner than other parts of the body and blood vessels are closer to the surface, so this is the ideal place to detect AF, say the researchers. AF is one of the most common heart rhythm problems, and affects up to 800,000 people in the UK. It significantly raises the risk of stroke, because it means the upper chambers of the heart do not pump efficiently, potentially causing blood clots. A normal heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute when at rest. But in atrial fibrillation, the heart rate may be over 140 beats a minute. In extreme cases, the condition can cause heart failure and has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease by reducing blood flow to the brain. The technology was developed by the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in conjunction with Xerox. Dr Jean-Philippe Couderc, of Rochester University, in the U.S., said the new technology means AF can be diagnosed without hooking the patient up to an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine, as is currently necessary. He said: ‘This technology holds the potential to identify and diagnose cardiac disease using contactless video monitoring.' A normal heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute when at rest.  In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate may be over 140 beats a minute . He added: ‘This is a very simple concept, but one that could enable more people with atrial fibrillation to get the care the care they need.’ The technology works because sensors in digital cameras record the different wavelengths of light: red, green, and blue. Haemoglobin - a component of blood – ‘absorbs’ more of the green spectrum of light and this subtle change can be detected by the camera's sensor. So the camera can detect the uneven blood flow caused by AF by detecting higher levels of haemoglobin. Scientists were able to verify the technology was working accurately by simultaneously hooking patients up to an electrocardiogram (ECG) so results from the facial scan could be compared to the actual electrical activity of the heart. The study, which was published online in the journal Heart Rhythm, found that the colour changes detected by video monitoring corresponded with an individual's heart rate as detected on an ECG. The study found that the video monitoring technique - which researchers have dubbed ‘videoplethymography’ - had an error rate of 20 per cent, compared with the 17 to 29 per cent error rate associated with automated ECG measurements. Researchers are now in the process of evaluating the technology on a larger study population, including those without atrial fibrillation. However Dr Couderc said that the technology could be developed to be more accurate and accessible. He said: ‘This study was intended to be a proof of concept and, as is the case with many new technologies, we believe that we can significantly improve its accuracy and the usability.’","Patients may soon be able to carry out lifesaving heart tests using webcam .

"Technology that eavesdrops on tweets could warn you of how likely it is to become ill by visiting a restaurant. The system, dubbed ‘nEmesis’, combines machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques to analyse millions of tweets posted by people after visiting restaurants. It then ranks restaurants according to how likely it is for someone to get food poisoning after eating there. nEmesis combines machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques to analyse millions of tweets posted by people after visiting restaurants. It then ranks restaurants according to how likely it is for someone to get food poisoning after eating there . In just four months, the system collected 3.8 million tweets from more than 94,000 unique users in New York City, traced 23,000 restaurant visitors, and found 480 reports of likely food poisoning. According to scientists at the University of Rochester in New York, the technology could also be used  by . authorities to better monitor food safety, by providing more timely . restaurant inspections. ‘The Twitter reports are not an exact indicator – any individual case could well be due to factors unrelated to the restaurant meal – but in aggregate the numbers are revealing,’ said Henry Kautz, chair of the computer science department. If a user tweets from a location that is determined to be a restaurant, the system will continue to track this person's tweets for 72 hours, even when they're not geotagged, or when they are using a different device . The Food Standards Agency has estimated that each year in the UK: . Around a million people suffer a foodborne illness . Around 20,000 people receive hospital treatment due to food poisoning . There are around 500 deaths because of it . It costs nearly £1.5 billion . The FSA claims that each one per cent . reduction in case numbers would mean around 10,000 fewer cases and would . save the economy around £15 million each year. A seemingly random collection of online rants becomes an actionable alert, according to Kautz, which can rapidly help detect cases of food-borne illness. nEmesis 'listens' to relevant public tweets and detects restaurant visits by matching up where a person tweets from and the known locations of restaurants. People will often tweet from their phones or other mobile devices, which are GPS enabled, which means the system knows a person's exact location. If a user tweets from a location that is determined to be a restaurant, the system will continue to track this person's tweets for 72 hours, even when they're not geotagged, or when they are tweeted from a different device. In just four months, the system collected 3.8 million tweets from more than 94,000 unique users in New York City, traced 23,000 restaurant visitors, and found 480 reports of likely food poisoning . If a user then tweets about feeling ill, the system captures the information along with the specific restaurant visited. According to the researchers, around one third of the inspection scores could be reliably predicted from the Twitter data. The remainder of the scores show some disagreement. ‘This disagreement is interesting as the public inspection data is not perfect either, ‘argued co-author Adam Sadilek, formerly a colleague of Kautz at Rochester and who is now at Google. ‘The adaptive inspections could reveal the real risk, which is currently hidden for both methods.’ The Food Standards Agency (FSA) estimates that in the UK there are over a million cases of food poisoning each year, 20,000 hospitalisations and 500 deaths. Foods that are most frequently associated with foodborne illness include meat, fish andpoultry. The FSA claims that each one per cent reduction in case numbers would mean around 10,000 fewer cases and would save the economy around £15 million per year. Overall food poisoning costs the UK economy £1.5 billion each year.","nEmesis analyses posts 72 hours after someone has visited a restaurant .

"Prototype: Scientists have developed a 'smart bra' which can measure the wearer¿s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss . They are already used to lift, boost and enhance – but it seems bras  could soon be doing something else for women’s figures. Scientists have developed a ‘smart bra’ which can measure the wearer’s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss. Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse. MC Schraefel, a professor in computer science and human performance design from the University of Southampton, has helped to design the bra which is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity. The data from the prototype device is . analysed by a smartphone app which can highlight when ‘emotional eating’ is most likely to occur and offer advice to the wearer. The app then provides suggestions, such as carrying out calming breathing exercises, to reduce the user’s stress levels. Professor Schraefel said: ‘Emotional states, habitual practices, like snacking in front of the TV or grabbing  a cookie when stressed, often go undetected by us – that’s the nature of habits – but they have real effects on our wellbeing. ‘Our work in this project, while early, shows that there is potential to design interactive technologies to work with us, to help us develop both awareness of our state, and offer options we’ve decided we’d rather take, to build new practices and support our wellbeing.’ The bra is a result of a study called Food And Mood: Just-in-Time Support For Emotional Eating, written by researchers from the University of Southampton, Microsoft Research and the University of Rochester in New York, United States. The study set out to develop an intervention which is triggered before someone reaches for food as a means of emotional support. It suggested the smart bra and matching apps as possible solutions.

"We’ve cleaned up free kicks with the magic spray, there seems to be less diving, but football has a new evil – wrestling in the penalty area. Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul their opponents and too often referees are allowing it to take place. When the talented young referee Michael Oliver pulled up serial offender Ryan Shawcross two weeks ago, all hell seemed to break loose. His fellow officials should have supported him by following up the bold decision, but instead we had Phil Dowd allowing double headlocks at Old Trafford. Ryan Shawcross of Stoke was rightly penalised for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground during last weekend's match at the Britannia Stadium . Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation in pointing to the penalty spot after Shawcross fouled Bony . But when Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) and John Terry were held in headlocks by Manchester United defenders Chris Smalling (left) and Marcos Rojo in Sunday's match, referee Phil Dowd failed to act . Ivanovic appeals for a penalty as he lies on the ground with Smalling on top of him . Referee Phil Dowd, who later sent Ivanovic off, ignored Chelsea's appeal for a penalty . HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. I have no sympathy for a defender who concedes a penalty for wrestling or throwing his opponent. The headlocks against John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were remarkable and should have resulted in a penalty. Mistakes from Dowd saved Manchester United. Of course, it isn’t easy for a referee when there are five or six match-ups for every corner, so they need to be educated, too. Defenders know a referee cannot see what every camera can and so he will take a risk in the hope of gaining an advantage. Some are more obvious to spot than others – and headlocks are a bit of a clue! I played once against Alessandro Nesta in the Champions League. I had been watching the Italian defender and the way he would face a player – and not the ball. He would then wrestle his opponent in much the same way as we are seeing in the Premier League today. I worked out a way to combat this. I gave myself five yards and ran at him aggressively before the corner came in. He was startled, the referee came over and said: ‘What is going on?’ I explained he needed to watch Nesta, we both got a warning and when the corner came in, all eyes were on us and Nesta couldn’t apply his blocking tactic. It was a small victory. Defenders who do not attack the ball, but face their opponents and focus on stopping… that’s not football. It’s blatant fouling and deserves punishment. If you are obsessed more with stopping your opponent than winning the ball, that cannot be right. Shawcross is a regular offender. I’m convinced Tony Pulis must have shown him how to do it, when he was manager of Stoke. Liverpool’s Martin Skrtel too. Chelsea’s powerhouse Ivanovic is a contact player, using his huge strength and physicality to draw fouls or to invite a reaction. There are different degrees of contact in the box. As a defender, you might feel you want to act as a barrier. Alessandro Nesta (right), seen here with Emmanuel Adebayor in a match against Arsenal, would frequently try and wrestle opponents to the ground . Martin Keown developed a strategy for dealing with players like Nesta when he encountered them with Arsenal . Blocking is part of the game. Basketball is a non-contact sport, but there is an art to blocking and stopping your opponent from getting where he wants to go. It’s the same with football. The odd tug of a shirt was in my make-up, but only when an opponent was close. If he was too far away, it became too obvious to the referee and you risked giving away a penalty. There is no defender in the world who hasn’t tugged a shirt to impact on the balance of his opponent. I would use whatever it took and take more risks further up the pitch, but I didn’t like to concede an advantage to the striker and by fouling in the penalty area, you are at high risk to concede a spot kick. My attitude was ‘I’m here to stop you, but I don’t want to give you anything’. A defender has to stay calm and focused in that moment. That’s where zonal marking and concentrating on your space works better than going man-to-man in the area. Zonal allows you to concentrate on winning the ball in your zone, whereas man marking can invite the temptation to foul. Martin Skrtel of Liverpool has also been guilty of wrestling opponents in the box . I was into judo as a kid and never lost a bout, but I never used a judo throw in a game. Watching some of the recent incidents, such a skill might come in handy! I was never taught to foul. You learn what you need to do. George Graham, at Arsenal, worked on a lot of repetitive defensive work. The back four would work together and he would overload on strikers, coming at your from all angles. It was like being in the land of the giants. We were hard to play against, we defended for our lives and we were aggressive and strong. But we didn’t resort to wrestling and it shouldn’t be allowed now. Referees must clamp down, but strikers will need to be fair, too. If they are diving, trying to con the referee into believing they have been wrestled, then that should result in serious punishment. There will be some strikers who will see this campaign and think ‘happy days, I’ll fall over, win a cheap penalty.’ There needs to be more honesty from them, too.","Wrestling in the penalty area is football's new evil .

"Scientists have unveiled how to make invisibility cloaks that are big enough to hide a human - or even a satellite orbiting the earth. As the interest in creating Harry Potter-style cloaks continues to grow, researchers in America have shown how a simple trick used for years by magicians can create the desired effect. Using conventional lenses and mirrors, the scientists are able to steer light around the region of space they want to hide. While it's not quite the same as the invisibility cloak worn by Harry Potter, scientists have revealed how it is possible to steer light around the region of space they want to hide using lenses and mirrors . Over the last ten years scientists have investigated two main ways of creating invisibility cloaks, according to the MIT Technology Review. 'Transformation optics' involves bending light around an object to make it look as if it wasn't there.Metamaterials meanwhile are synthetic substances which can also achieve the same aim through using certain optical properties. Neither technology is perfect, but John Howell, from the University of Rochester, New York, and Benjamin Howell have now shown how to build a device big enough to cloak a person using an array of lenses and mirrors to steer light around a region of space. Images released by the pair show how they are able to cloak objects - one image shows how half of a chair has been cloaked but the rubbish bin behind it is still visible. The Howells said: 'This volume is sufficient to cloak a human, albeit with not as much convenience as Harry Potter's cloak.' The design has been used for years but the Howells have said they wanted to point out how easily it could be scaled accordingly. The devices could be used to cloak satellites in mid to high-Earth orbit . A major caveat in the design is that they only work in one direction - viewing the cloaks from any other pint of view reveals the device. But the Howells have said: 'The devices may have value, for example, in cloaking satellites in mid to high-Earth orbit.' Earlier this week, scientists unveiled a 'time cloak' which bends light to tear holes in time itself. The device could have important implications for sending secret messages via fibre optic cables. It can hide a continuous stream of events at telecommunications data rates - much quicker than a similar invention unveiled last year. Researchers used equipment known as modulators to make the holes by bending light, Nature reported. Although a long way off the fictional 'invisibility cloaks' featured in Star Trek and the Harry Potter films the concept could have practical applications to conceal messages. At its most basic level, a cloaking device simply guides light around an object as if the object wasn't there. An example of technology that does this is an endoscope which is used to image hollow organs in the human body. Much of the research into invisibility cloaks to date has focused on the use of metamaterials. These are synthetic substances that can guide light using their unique optical properties. Instead of using complex meta materials to steer light, the researchers at Rochester University did the same job with off-the-shelf lenses and mirrors. Their array of lenses or mirrors was shown to steer light around the region of space they want to hide. This means their cloaks were simple to build and easy to scale. Mirrors, in particular, can be made almost any size. The researchers demonstrated cloaking over the visible spectrum with cloaking regions exceeding 106 mm3.","Scientists have shown how to steer light around objects using mirrors .

"Maybe it was that monotone Brummie voice. Maybe it was his bloke-down-the-pub approach to introducing ITV’s coverage of live football. Or maybe it was just the fact that he brought us the World Cup from Brazil last summer while wearing an unflattering pair of shorts on Copacabana Beach. The news that Adrian Chiles has been rather unceremoniously dumped by his employers is unlikely to plunge the country into national mourning. Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London on Friday . Chiles sports shorts and flip flops while presenting ITV's live World Cup coverage in Brazil last summer . At best, he was television Marmite. But the people who were turned off by his chummy — some would say irritating — style in the studio seem to be far greater in number than those who weren’t. Essentially, Chiles always appeared to lack what was required to carry off such a key role. He possessed neither the suave composure of Des Lynam or the presence and professional input of Gary Lineker. It takes more than a stint on Working Lunch and The One Show to achieve that. He took to jabbering at his expert studio pundits, oblivious to Roy Keane’s death stares and the fact that no-one was laughing at his jokes or cared in the slightest that he supports West Bromwich Albion. Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane (centre) left ITV prior to last summer's World Cup in Brazil . Pougatch and Chiles both work for BBC Radio 5 Live, with Chiles being handed an expanded role last summer . There is nothing wrong with trying to establish a rapport with your guests and viewers, but Chiles seemed to want a little too much of the limelight. His move from the BBC to front ITV’s coverage of Champions League football and England internationals in 2010 always felt like a bad plan, not least because it briefly exposed us to his replacement Colin Murray on Match of the Day 2. Murray found a new home and no doubt Chiles will as well. He will be back and we should wish him well until then. After all, far worse crimes have been committed on our television screens in the name of sport. And as the 47-year-old follows his fellow ITV Sport departees Matt Smith and Andy Townsend into the studio sunset, all we ask is that he takes those shorts with him.","Adrian Chiles leaving ITV is unlikely to plunge country into mourning .

"Eugenie Bouchard is being chauffeured across London and is chuckling at how she and her siblings came to be named after members of the Royal family. Despite hailing from Montreal, the child of a French Canadian father and her mother having Irish lineage there is Eugenie, her twin Beatrice, brother William and Charlotte, the latter being a nod to Monaco’s dynasty. 'Maybe it looks like my parents were royal obsessed, it makes me feel a little bit more at home in England among my fellow Royals,' she laughs. 'When I was young my Mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and I still keep it on my bedside table, my brother is Prince William. I think they are just nice names that they liked. VIDEO Scroll down for Stunning Eugenie Bouchard dazzles during Sportsmail photo shoot . Ace: Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard holds a racket for the camera in our exclusive photo shoot . It turns out, en route to our exclusive photoshoot with the fast rising star of the women’s game, that the 20 year-old Canadian laughs quite a lot as she enjoys some downtime ahead of Wimbledon fortnight. Yet when the conversation comes to tennis it is strictly business for Bouchard, whose has enjoyed a rapid ascent from junior Wimbledon champion just two years ago to two Grand Slam semi-finals this year and the fringes of the world’s top ten. She is, by her own admission, a perfectionist who wants to make it to the top as quickly as possible with a game based on taking the ball early, sharp tactical acumen and a natural inclination to fight to the very last point. Within tennis the comparisons to Maria Sharapova have become so widespread to have assumed almost cliché status. It is  less to do with their striking looks than them sharing a ferocious competitive spirit, and she is in the vanguard of an emerging generation of challengers to the established order. Proving a hit: Bouchard is set to take Wimbledon by storm this summer as she competes in the Championships . Another thing they have in common is the ability to compartmentalise their lives. For Bouchard this means dividing off time when she can live like any other twenty year-old and escape from her status as the most sought-after player on the WTA Tour, one who has already attracted a worldwide fan base known as the ""Genie Army"". After reaching the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris, for example, she simply flew off to visit some friends in Switzerland. 'I went to near Lausanne. I just went to get a whole different scene,' she says. 'Sometimes you just want to get away and be normal for a few days. It’s a treat to travel without your racket bag.' What usually happens is that within a few days, suitably refreshed, she is ‘itching’ to get back onto the practice court. Glamorous: Bouchard has attracted a worldwide fan base known as the ""Genie Army"" She is plainly driven, very articulate and talks in brisk, slightly clipped tones as she considers what has brought her to the point where she appears to have the world on the tip of her racket. She has travelled a long way from the predominantly English-speaking Montreal suburb of Westmount. 'Even when I was much younger whatever I did I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities. When I came home from school I would be the one doing my homework while my siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later. I was always very determined, and to excel at this sport you have to be really disciplined and motivated. I guess I’m just like that. 'Both my parents were athletic, they did recreational sports. My mum was at the WTA tournament in Montreal and she remembers watching Mary Pierce and thinking ""why do my kids have to be figure skaters or skiers?"" 'So Beatrice and I went to tennis groups aged five and we’d spend most of the time just doing games and only get to hit tennis balls at the end of it for ten minutes. I hated the stuff with balloons, I just wanted to hit balls. I asked my parents if I could play more so they put me in groups where there was more actual tennis and it went from there. Anyone for tennis? Bouchard has reached the semis in both Grand Slams so far this year . 'I travelled to Europe for the first time at 9 to a 12 and under tournament. I found it incredibly exciting, I knew I wanted to do this. I know nine is very young to decide what you want to do in life but that is pretty much when I decided.' She bursts out laughing again: 'Meanwhile my twin retired at age six. We are very close but opposite in many ways. I never needed to be pushed.' It is also clear that Bouchard is, like a surprising number of high achieving tennis players, formidably smart: 'I loved school. I would have to miss it for tennis and then I would start to do it online. I loved maths and science, maybe I would have ended up a doctor. 'When I was 12 I went to go and train in Florida so I stopped doing regular school, doing it online was tough to motivate yourself and it almost felt like you were doing two full time jobs I learned from it. Who knows, I might go back to college when I’m 30.' New friend: Bouchard poses with a baby wombat from Melbourne Zoo earlier this year . The steeliness to her character is evident, and while few outside observers believed she would progress so rapidly from 2012 onwards, she sounds like she expected it. 'To me it doesn’t seem so drastic because I’m always trying to get better. We have a short career, it’s not like you can let the years go by and wait for things to happen. It’s a small window of opportunity so it seems completely normal. '2013 was when I first played full time on the professional circuit and I really saw what it was like week in week out, what the top players in the world were like, how tough it was having to battle every single match. 'I realised how mental the sport is and I think playing so many matches and tournaments helped me improve mentally and toughen up. I’ve never really focused on my ranking per se because it’s out of my control. I try and do the right thing each week and the ranking will look after itself.' Another thing she quickly figured out was that it was going to be difficult to have intimate friends on the circuit – Laura Robson was among those she was close to when younger – and it drew a lot of attention in Paris when she bluntly spoke of life in the locker room not being a popularity contest. 'I feel like it’s my job and my profession, I’m a bit surprised I get asked about this. I wonder why I get asked about it and if the men are asked the same question. I’m friendly with everyone, probably more with the English speaking players, but I wouldn’t say I’m really good friends with anyone or best friends with anyone because to me it’s tough to have true friend and then go out and play against them. Pumped up: Bouchard celebrates reaching her second Grand Slam semi-final at the recent French Open . 'I want to win so much that I don’t want to have any distraction in the way. I have my team around me, we hang out and I’ve got friends at home, friends around the world outside of tennis. 'If you’re playing someone you care about it’s tough and I don’t want to be in that situation. We are playing big matches for big points and prize money and I take it very seriously. I relax when I’m outside tennis.' This involves trying to sightsee wherever she goes, going shopping and to the cinema. It is getting much harder to be while going unrecognised or having requests thrown at her, but there is a happy acceptance of all that, at least for now. 'I knew what I signed up for with my tennis. It’s a good sign if people want to talk to you off court,  it’s part of the job.  I learn from each photo shoot and interview. I’m a bit of a perfectionist, I try to do my best.' You can see Wimbledon being another Grand Slam in which she excels, as the grass should suit her game, which she demonstrated in 2012. There may also be the strange sight of furry animals being lobbed onto the lawns of SW19, which has become something of a trademark this year thanks to her ""Genie Army"". Red carpet: Bouchard arrives for the WTA pre-Wimbledon party at Kensington Roof Gardens on Thursday . She explains its origins: 'I showed up in Australia, I was on court 15 which is the most remote court there,  I walk on and start hearing this screaming and singing. They have these songs about me, they are basically students and decided to create this army. 'I got to the semis and every time they were there they were at my matches and started this tradition of throwing stuffed animals on the court. I’ve collected them,  I probably have about 70 of them now. 'Most cities there’s a franchise of the Genie Army and they seem to speak to each other through social media. It feels so special. The only problem is my bags are always overweight with these animals.' Passionate: Bouchard celebrates after winning a match for Canada in the Fed Cup earlier this year . At Wimbledon she is also looking forward to seeing her extended family. 'They are from Cork, some are coming to watch me at Wimbledon so hopefully I can get to meet them.' Will it be another Slam where the new generation, which also includes Simona Halep and Spain’s Garbine Muguruza, make up more ground on the established hierarchy led by Serena Williams? 'I think it’s a normal evolution. It’s great because it’s more interesting. Personally I don’t feel young or that this is happening too soon, there are players who by my age had won multiple Grand Slams. So it’s not like there is time to waste.'

"Suddenly it feels a little like Springtime in women’s tennis, that the game might be starting to bloom again after a long spell spent in the the long shadow cast by their male counterparts. It seems we may be arriving at a point in the cycle when renewal is setting in with some exciting new blood about to reinvigorate what has remained, despite a relative lack of stars in recent years, a hugely successful form of women’s sport. Over on the men’s tour you sense a slight trepidation about how things will be when, inevitably, the golden generation of present starts to fade away in the next few years. All set: Serena Williams leaves Aorangi Park following a practice session with coach Patrick Mouratoglou (left) Not so with their female counterparts, which is welcoming an assortment of new names and personalities who are going to challenge for the highest honours, quite possibly as soon as this Wimbledon. It was a huge blow for women’s tennis that as intriguing a figure as Marion Bartoli immediately retired after last year’s Championships, going the same way as marquee figures such as Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, who have been hard to replace. There are a host of relative newcomers to look out for this year with different playing styles and blessedly barely a grunt between them. While not all will make it to the very top, some are sure to go all the way in the next few years. And, unlike in the men’s game, a healthy handful of the brightest represent what is still the game’s key market, North America. Canada has the startlingly grown-up Eugenie Bouchard while America has the long identified Sloane Stephens, the fresh new talent of teenager Taylor Townsend and the player who some cognoscenti feel could be the best of all, Eastbourne champion Madison Keys. Coming to the fore: Canada's Eugenie Bouchard has reached the semi-finals at the Australian and French Opens . Rising star: American teenager Madison Keys celebrates after winning the AEGON International in Eastbourne . Bouchard excelled at the recent French Open, as did beaten finalist Simona Halep of Romania and the athletic Spanish-Venezuelan Garbine Muguruza. France’s Caroline Garcia is another of whom great things have been predicted and we might be saying the same of  Laura Robson, if only she could manage a sustained spell free of injuries. Opportunities will be coming with the top two seeds – Serena Williams and Li Na –  both 32, while there is plenty of mileage on the clock already for Maria Sharapova, despite her being only 27. Bartoli was the second surprise Wimbledon champion in three years, after the triumph of Petra Kvitova in 2011. Eight of the last fourteen Grand Slams have been won by different women, a situation that contrasts sharply with the locked-out men’s game - only six on the victor’s podium from the last 37 Majors. On form: Romania's Simona Halep recently reached her first Grand Slam final at the French Open . The most dominant player has been the younger Williams sister and there is no question that her best level is still superior to anyone, even Sharapova, who she could meet in the quarter finals in the tougher top half of the draw. However there are signs that the surge she has enjoyed following her 30th birthday, which coincided with her hooking up with French coach Patrick Mouratoglou, may be running out of momentum. In three of the last four Majors she has gone out of the fourth round or earlier, having won three out of the four that preceded them. Perhaps it has been physical or a fractional drop in motivation –  quite understandable as, like her almost direct contemporary Roger Federer, she approaches her 33rd birthday. Major win: Serena celebrates with the US Open trophy after beating Victoria Azarenka in the final in 2013 . The tendency to implode is making the biggest titles harder to come by, and serves only to encourage the others. As one leading coach observed of her: 'Sometimes it seems as if she cannot really beat up an opponent then she gets frustrated and is not prepared to hang in there like she used to.' Last year saw some rare carnage in the women’s draw with many of the big names struggling with their footwork early on. By the time we got to the semi-finals the players left were ranked 4 (Agnieszka Radwanska) 15 (Bartoli), 20 (Kirsten Flipkens) and 23 (Sabine Lisicki). The weather has been warmer and drier in this year’s build up and this may add up to more assured performances from the top eight seeds. Any slips ups this time and there is a queue formed of the younger generation itching to take advantage. 1. CHARLOTTE DOD (1887) The youngest ever ladies singles champion, ‘Lottie’ won the title aged 15. 2. MARTINA HINGIS (1997) At 16, the youngest Wimbledon singles champion in the modern era. Also the youngest ever winner of the girls title, aged 13. Young gun: Switzerland's Martina Hingis won Wimbledon at the age of 16 in 1997 . 3. MARIA SHARAPOVA (2004) The 17-year-old Sharapova beat Serena Williams in the final. Bouchard remembers watching that day: ‘I thought what she was doing was so cool, and I wanted to do the same thing.’ 4. VENUS WILLIAMS (2000) A 20-year old Williams dropped only one set on the way to the first of her five Wimbledon crowns. First-time triumph: Venus Williams celebrates after winning the first of five Wimbledon titles in 2000 . 5.

"And so at lunchtime on Monday comes what could be the last formality in the life of Andy Murray, reigning Wimbledon champion - opening up the Centre Court programme at the allotted time at 1pm. Save for the traditional set played on Saturday between four lady members it will be a pristine new grass court, reserved for last year’s winner and free of the dusty ruts that will develop between now and a week on Sunday. Come July 6 there is, genuinely, the chance that Murray will be holding the trophy aloft again and taking us back to that extraordinary afternoon 50 weeks ago, the memory of which even now has a surreal tinge. VIDEO Scroll down for Murray, Nadal, Sharapova and Djokovic Wimbledon warm ups . Up for the challenge: Andy Murray returns to Wimbledon this year looking to defend his title . Back for more: Andy Murray walks off after a practice session at Aorangi Park on Sunday . One huge change will be the composition this year of his player box, with the vastly contrasting figure of Amelie Mauresemo replacing Mr. Inscrutable himself, Ivan Lendl, who today will be at his Conneticut home playing golf. This fascinating alteration of personnel apart, in most ways Murray’s reign as champion has been more notable for what has not happened during it rather than what actually did. The 27 year-old Scot did not sweep all before him on the court, he did not multiply his personal fortune many times, his victory has not led to a wider upturn in British tennis fortunes, he has not changed discernibly as a person. He did not even go out and treat himself to something special as a reward for achieving his life’s dream, although he did buy and renovate a hotel near his hometown of Dunblane. Mentor: Murray shakes hands with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) following the practice session . Last time a British man successfully defended a Grand Slam. Fred Perry won Wimbledon from 1934 to 1936. He also won the US Open in 1933 and 1934. Murray himself is pleased, even relieved, that this is the case. It may have been the most unexpected bonus that came with ending Britain’s 77-year drought in terms of a male champion. 'Nothing has changed. Maybe abroad I get recognised more than I used to but in terms of what I do on a day-to-day basis, nothing is different,' he says. 'For me, that has probably been the nicest part about it because that was something I was worried about. I had spoken to psychologists before and told them that was something that concerned me. I spoke to Ivan about it. 'What is nice is coming back and seeing your name on the wall because there's great history attached to the tournament. Most of the greatest players who have ever played have won here -  it’s something no-one can take away from you. The wait is over: Andy Murray became the first British man for 77 years to win the Wimbledon title in 2013 . 'Nowadays it is a place I like going to because it is quiet. I like to go to Wimbledon to practise sometimes, or just to be there. It is quiet. It is a place where I can go and I don’t get bothered. I can think here.' Murray’s kit from the final now sits on show in the Club’s museum, although he has never been to inspect it, while the trophy is in a room at home he rarely enters. You sense that he does not want to allow himself too much reflection until retirement, partly due to the admission that winning sapped his determination for several months afterwards. 'It was different, not having motivation, that’s not a nice feeling because I’m used to being extremely motivated, so there are parts that made me happy and there were some things like struggling to get up for practices and training - that wasn’t that nice. When I decided to have surgery (in late September), that was when I moved on.' The existential feelings after Wimbledon and three-month hiatus caused by surgery are clearly major factors in why he has not even reached a final since Wimbledon last year. All set: Murray hits under the watchful eye of coach Mauresmo (centre) and assistant Dani Vallverdu (left) The reluctance to put himself out for the corporate world and a lack of enthusiasm for material gain are among the factors why he has barely cashed in on last year’s triumph (although he has still chosen to chase beefed up appearance fees on occasion.) In fact, until signing a patch deal last week with Standard Life he was looking the most undersponsored superstar of any sport. Asked if this has cost him much money he sheepishly nods. 'There have been quite a few offers but for me it about doing the right stuff and working with people who understand what my goals are and what I am trying to do. It is very easy to sign five or six deals but I want to play tennis and concentrate on trying to win more. 'This past week, for example, it is incredibly important for me to prepare properly and train properly and practise and stuff and I don’t want to give up loads of my time. For a lot of those companies, that is a bit off-putting as this is the time of the year that they want to be doing loads of things. 'Some players are fine doing a lot the week before a Slam, but that’s not for me.' Focused: Murray will open the play on Centre Court against Belgian David Goffin on Monday . One other thing has not happened since last year: despite him pledging to do so Murray has not declared his thoughts on Scottish independence, opting instead to drop subtle hints of pro-union tendencies. Another of those may be his choice of new sponsor – Standard Life being among the companies who have warned they may move south in the event of a Yes vote. Of more relevance to this fortnight is the fact that the name ""Mauresmo"" is likely to be used more than that of ‘Perry’. If there is ever to be a matching statue at Wimbledon bearing the name ‘Murray’ he wants it to be earned. 'I don’t know if there will ever be one. Fred Perry won Wimbledon three times. I’ve still got a long way to go. I never met him but he is a very relevant person in my career because I got asked about him for a long, long time.' With history out of the way, it should in theory be easier to add to his two Grand Slam titles. 'I feel ready. I feel good. I am moving well and my body feels good. It is not sore, so it is down to me to perform and to play well. I have prepared pretty much the best that I could.' Meeting the press: Murray speaks to the media during a press conference at the All England Club on Sunday . This is just as well because there is no sign of the competition going away and after some wobbles and injury concerns the old ‘Big Four’ are still the quartet to beat. For Novak Djokovic it is a case of needing to lift himself after yet another Grand Slam disappointment when he lost in the Roland Garros final to Rafael Nadal. The Serb has reached two semis and three finals in his last five Majors and not converted one into a title.  That may be more relevant than concerns last week over his wrist. Nadal’s latest win in Paris had all his traditional hallmarks, publicly expressing fears about form and fitness early on and then brilliantly building up to a crescendo of form by the end. On the lawn; Rafael Nadal takes a seat during a practice session ahead of the Wimbledon championships . That kind of pattern suggests he will not fall flat again at this year’s Wimbledon, although his grass court defeats in recent years have come often enough to have left some mental scar tissue. Should he get through some awkward-looking early opponents he will be hugely dangerous, the clear favourite to me as he is the man who best knows how to win when it most matters. Roger Federer looks threatening again this year, and this is the one place he may be able to sustain a run of seven matches. The clearest outside threat to the Big Four – and potentially Murray in the quarters - may be Queen’s champion Grigor Dimitrov, or the gargantuan-serving Milos Raonic. You suspect this Wimbledon will go more to form than was, gloriously, the case in 2013, with better weather a factor. Expect to see three of the main four joined by one interloper in the semi-finals.","Murray takes on Belgian David Goffin in the first match on Centre Court on Monday at 1pm .

"Wigan coach Shaun Wane will give youngster George Williams 'all the time he needs' to secure the club's famous number six spot. The 20-year-old, born and bred in Wigan, will get the first chance to fill the boots of Australian playmaker Blake Green, who left the Warriors at the end of last season to return to the NRL with Melbourne. Wane says he never contemplated bringing in a replacement from outside the club as he puts his faith in the home-grown Williams, playing alongside England scrum-half Matty Smith. Wigan coach Shaun Wane will give youngster George Williams 'all the time he needs' to find his feet . 'I didn't look at anybody (else),' Wane said. 'I'm quite stubborn, once I go with something, I stay with it, I stick with my convictions. 'He's not under any pressure from me because I know he can play. Whether it happens in the next 10 or 20 games, I'm not that bothered, I'm willing to keep working with him. 'It took Blake Green and Matty Smith a long time to work together and now we're asking a 20-year-old kid to do that. 'There's a lot for George to learn - he's still only very young - but he defends tough and he will learn. He's finding his feet at the minute and I'm willing to give him all the time he needs. There is no doubt in my mind he's going to be a top player.' The 20-year-old will get the first chance to fill the boots of Blake Green, who left at the end of last season . Williams is grateful for the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of such famous Wigan stand-offs as Brett Kenny and Shaun Edwards. 'Shaun whispered it in my ear at the end of a training session in our first week back,' Williams said. 'It was a shock but I am really happy. He's put his trust in me and I've got to repay him and show he made the right decision. 'It could be seen as daunting because so many great players have worn the six jersey but I want to make it my own now.'

"Ched Evans: Would your team sign him after he was snubbed by Oldham Athletic? Steve Bruce has risked sparking outrage by publicly questioning the conviction of rapist Ched Evans. The Hull City boss, who admits he was among the three Premier League managers to support Oldham in trying to sign Evans this week, challenged the unanimous verdict of the jury and the three judges at the Court of Appeal by saying he thought the 26-year-old had a strong case to have his conviction overturned. Evans’s case has gone to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. But Bruce delivered his own verdict after Oldham became the third club to step back from signing a player released from prison after serving half a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. VIDEO Scroll down to see Steve Bruce lend support to Ched Evans appeal . Steve Bruce says he contacted Oldham to give them support over their move for Ched Evans (above) A deal has since been called off but Bruce believes the former Sheffield United striker deserves a chance . ‘I might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he’s been convicted by a jury,’ said Bruce. ‘When you look at the evidence, it is there for appeal. It has divided opinion. When you look at the case in detail then Ched has a case.’ Bruce made an important mistake in his remarks. The Evans case is not there for appeal. It is up to the CCRC whether the case is referred to the Court of Appeal, and so far only three per cent of the 18,753 investigated have been referred. Bruce confirmed he had spoken to Oldham chairman Simon Corney — an old friend — and offered his support to the League One club prior to the chaos that erupted at Boundary Park this week. ‘Simon has looked at the case and evidence and he was of the opinion to give the kid a chance,’ Bruce said. ‘I’m a big believer that if you have done your time, you’ve done your time. Everyone deserves a second chance.’ Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey on Thursday, is still without a club . Ched Evans affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob . The Evans case could now lead to the introduction of a Code of Conduct for professional footballers in England. Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, said yesterday he would ‘encourage the game’ to look at that option. The FA introduced a code for the England players in 2012, but a wider code would need approval from Premier League and Football League clubs as well as the Professional Footballers’ Association. ‘Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable,’ said Dyke. ‘This cannot be overstated. ‘We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in detail at the FA and we have examined the legal requirements and our rules and regulations and there is no basis for us to intervene directly. ‘That said, it is important we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognise the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a (player). ‘I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. The FA will certainly be considering it.’ Oldham Athletic chief executive Neil Joy reads out a statement in relation to Evans on Thursday . Currently, the FA do not have the legislative powers to intervene but they can push for the introduction of a code, even if the clubs would ultimately remain the moral arbiters. The governing body would want any code to focus less on the idea that players are role models but instead that they should recognise that it is a privilege to play professionally and the need to protect the game. The PFA’s main concern was to calm the storm created by ill-advised comments from chief executive Gordon Taylor. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday Taylor made the mistake of comparing Evans’s plight to that of the Hillsborough families, which sparked calls for him to resign. Evans was signed by Sheffield United for £3million back in 2009 and impressed at Bramall Lane . Oldham boss Lee Johnson directs his squad during training on Thursday, and (right) at Boundary Park . Evans was released from prison in October, with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate . Taylor was branded ‘a disgrace’ by Hillsborough family members, while Sheila Coleman, for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said his comments were ‘insensitive and crass’. Taylor apologised on Friday but succeeded only in causing further offence and was forced to issue a second apology on the PFA website. Dr Phil Scraton, primary author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, said: ‘Taylor apologised for any offence he may have caused. He then proceeded to compound yesterday’s crass, insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that, “Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence”.’ Taylor, 70, responded by offering to telephone each family to apologise personally. ‘The last thing I intended was to upset anybody connected to the Hillsborough tragedy. I can only apologise,’ he said. Asked if he had considered resigning, Taylor said: ‘Not all, not while I’m trying to do my job with the PFA.’ PFA Chairman Gordon Taylor insists he will not resign over comments relating Evans' case with Hillsbrough victims' families .","Oldham announced on Thursday that they won't be signing Ched Evans .

"Right, I've polished my battle helmet, retrieved my columnist armour from the garage and positioned the ear plugs within easy distance. I'm ready for the flash-flood of hysterical responses but here we go. Breastfeeding: you don't have to do it. It's not just me saying it, this week a GP - yes, that's right a medically qualified grown-up with two children of her own - said so too. Scroll down for video . Breast is best? Lorraine doesn't always think so (posed by models) Author and parenting guru Dr Ellie Cannon believes breastfeeding doesn't always work, and for some the best decision is not to do it. You can give the newborn formula instead. Good God, I can't believe I wrote that. Sirens must be going off all over the city. But really, I'm telling you, you don't have to do it - it's not the law. I breastfed all four of mine so I'm not flag-waving for the newly formed 'Fearless Formula Feeders' group - I'm not on one side or the other. I'm just depressed that, 11 years after I first breastfed my eldest and two-and-a-bit years after I finished breastfeeding the youngest, the vitriolic war between those who do and those who don't doesn’t appear to have abated. A new mum and journalist friend of mine wrote a piece at the weekend revealing she had stopped feeding her now ten-month-old at three weeks. The unpleasant, ignorant and frankly illogical abuse she got online (and via the post) left me dumbfounded. Bottle feeding is fine: Lorraine thinks mums shouldn't feel guilty about it (posed by model) Come on, team, we have got to get our act together on this soon. At a time when women are truly at our best (when we've just made another human  forgoodnessnakes, as my son says) we show ourselves at our worst. The acerbic and acidic response to my friend's honest memoir of new motherhood baffles me. Why are some breastfeeding enthusiasts so obnoxiously fanatical? Why are some bottle-feeding mums so ridiculously defensive? Where is that nutritious glow of support other women generally offer in almost any other circumstance? Why not nourish each other as we nourish our babies instead of justifying our choices and needs by rubbishing the women who make an alternative choice? The relentless breastfeeding row is 'stupidy stupidy stupidy' as my middle child is prone to say when you disagree with one of her more illogical schemes (naked trampolining, the formation of the musical knicker ninjas, umbrellas indoors). I had two fantastic breastfeeding experiences and two truly awful experiences. Everyone has a different tale to tell so I won't bore you with mine except to say it's peculiar how something so natural can feel so unnatural at times. Of course, you're free to ignore me because obviously I am not an expert on anything (apart from doughnuts), but I feel the need to offer advice because I know that tonight, in the bleak small hours before sunlight rescues them, an army of exhausted new mums will hunch over howling newborns with their heads full of half-truths and tangled statistics, trying and failing to breastfeed. The dark depth of their misery will know no bounds, they'll be tortured by failure and those incredibly  precious moments they spend with their new child, which should be all velvety and soft, will be painful and pointless. After one such night I remember taking my still howling six-week-old for a walk as the world woke up, just to escape the scene of my disaster. The proportion of British mothers who breastfeed increased from 76 to 81 per cent between 2005 and 2010 . A kind older woman stopped me in the street to ask if I was OK. 'I'm really struggling with the night feeds,' I said apologetically. 'Give her a bottle,' she said, 'just go home and do it now. Or get your husband to give her one at midnight so you can sleep and not be too tired to feed later.' At no point had any of the midwives, breastfeeding counsellors or NCT experts said this. They just kept telling me I would get the hang of it soon. So I'm saying to you what that lovely lady said to me. Do it, give the baby a bottle now. Give yourself a break. Don't explain and don't apologise. Given you'd step in front of an out-of-control car for your newborn, you can trust yourself to make the right decision. And hear this: at no point today do I ever look at my now happy, healthy, A-grade 11-year-old and say: 'Oh man, if I hadn't given her that formula she'd be at Cambridge University by now.' Not once. Nor do I ever look at my seven-year-old son and say the reason he is a world champion hula hooper who never gets ill is because I breastfed him.

"Bradford's joint chairman Mark Lawn revealed three good reasons why he hopes his club gets paired against Manchester United in Monday night's FA Cup draw. The Sky Bet League One club pulled off one of the biggest upsets of all time when coming back from two goals down against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to book their place in the fifth round with a remarkable 4-2 win. Two years after becoming the first club from the basement division to reach Wembley in a major cup tournament - Bradford lost to Swansea in the Capital One Cup final - Phil Parkinson's side are at it again and Lawn said he was still trying to make sense of it all. Bradford co-chairman Mark Lawn is dreaming of a fifth round FA Cup tie against Manchester United . Bradford's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full-time whistle at Stamford Bridge . Lawn, whose wife Yvonne has been winning her own battle against bowel cancer, said: 'I want Man United for my wife, she's a big Man United fan, (co-chairman) Julian (Rhodes) wants them for the money and Phil wants them just from the playing point of view.' Bradford beat Championship side Millwall in a third-round replay and Lawn said the club's latest giant-killing run was worth around £700,000 in financial terms. Bradford upset arch-rivals Leeds in the Capital One Cup earlier in the season and the two results have helped repay the club's £1million deficit in its overall playing budget.

Chelsea's players are left dejected after Bradford staged a stunning comeback on Saturday . Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Petr Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . 'Phil pushes me and Julian very hard,' Lawn said. 'We've overspent nearly every season with him and have taken a risk - and he's repaid it to be honest. 'This year we gave him a million pounds more than we could afford (on playing budget), but he's repaid it. 'Julian and I aren't stupid, we know we haven't got that kind of money to put in. 'We were hoping Man United would sell Tom Cleverley and that the sell-on clause would help wipe out our deficit, but that's not happened yet. 'But Phil got us Leeds United in the Capital One Cup and we beat them, so we made in-roads with that, and now Chelsea. Phil Parkinson has repaid the club's money given to his for transfers, according to co-chairman Lawn . Bournemouth co-chairman Lawn would now like a tie against Manchester United in the fifth round of the Cup . Louis van Gaal still has plenty to ponder though, as United are set for a replay against Cambridge United . 'This current FA Cup run is worth £700,000 to us and so the two together have wiped out the deficit. 'So Phil can keep all his players now and look forward to building on the success we've had to make us even stronger.' Lawn ordered champagne to be sent to the dressing room at Stamford Bridge and joked he was now waiting anxiously for the bill. 'Has it all sunk in?,' he added. 'Well I still can't think of an upset in the FA Cup that's bigger than this. 'Two-nil down against the team who will become Premier League champions, among the favourites for the Champions League? 'To come back and score four goals? Let's face it, it's not as if any of those goals were scuffed or bouncing in off our a****. We played great football. 'When you consider how much the game has moved on, I think this is the biggest upset. 'In Ronnie Radford's day some of those Newcastle players were probably having a smoke at half-time. It's a different game now. 'Chelsea's second team cost them £98million against our's, which cost £7,500 and never mind the wages.'","Bradford City chairman Mark Lawn wants Manchester United in the FA Cup .

"Jose Mourinho said it would be a ‘disgrace’ if Chelsea lost their FA Cup fourth round tie against Bradford on Saturday. Chelsea have two cup games in four days, including the second leg of their League Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Tuesday, but the Blues manager insisted he would play strong teams despite resting John Terry, Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa on Saturday. ‘To help the title race the best thing is to lose against Bradford, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain (in the Champions League) and play only Premier League until the end of the season,’ said Mourinho. Jose Mourinho said it would be a ‘disgrace’ if Chelsea lost their FA Cup fourth round tie against Bradford . Chelsea will host Bradford, who beat Millwall in the third round after a replay . ‘This is the perfect situation. But not with us, not with the Chelsea DNA. ‘The other day, a coach of a big team was knocked out of the Cup and he was saying, “Very good, now we can focus on other competitions”.

"Jack Wilshere will hand Arsene Wenger a boost when he returns from his injury lay-off next month. But the Arsenal manager may be hesitant to rush the England international back into first-team action if these statistics are anything to go by. Arsenal's win record with Wilshere in their side this season is a lowly 37 per cent, whereas without the midfielder, the Gunners have a win percentage more than double that number. Jack Wilshere, pictured at the O2 Arena earlier this month, has been sidelined since November through injury . Tomas Rosicky was on target for Arsenal in their 3-2 FA Cup win against Brighton on Sunday . Wilshere hasn’t featured for Arsenal since he limped off in their 2-1 defeat against Manchester United at the Emirates on November 22. And of the 16 matches he played in prior to sustaining that injury, Arsenal won just six matches, drew five, and suffered five defeats. In contrast, the 18 games that he hasn’t played for Arsenal, the Gunners have won 13  – a win percentage of 72 per cent. Wenger’s side also have a greater average goals per game without Wilshere; 2.2 in each match without, compared to 1.6 with him in their side. Their defensive record is also better. It should be noted that Wilshere’s three-month lay-off has coincided with the return of Theo Walcott, Mesut Ozil and Laurent Koscienly to first-team action. Tomas Rosicky and Francis Coquelin have also been inspired in Wilshere's absence, the former starring in Arsenal’s 3-2 FA Cup victory on Sunday. Coquelin meanwhile, was a kingpin in Arsenal's 2-0 victory at Manchester City earlier this month. Wilshere has been out of action since November after he sustained an ankle injury against Manchester United . The England international sustained the injury following this late tackle by United defender Paddy McNair . Mesut Ozil opened the scoring for Arsenal as they secured their fifth-round spot with a win over Brighton . Wilshere is slightly ahead of scheduled in his rehabilitation from the ankle injury he sustained after a late challenge from Paddy McNair in Arsenal's 2-1 defeat. The 23-year-old is expected to be back in time for his side's Champions League last-16 tie against Monaco in mid-February.","Jack Wilshere has been out of action since November with ankle injury .

"‘We started the World Cup in our shorts and that’s how we’re ending it.’ Adrian Chiles had a different take on how to present football on television and those words delivered in his opening to ITV’s coverage of last year’s World Cup final in Rio summed it up. He and his beach-side ITV pundits, all shorts and smiles, navigated a minority of viewers through Germany v Argentina. The vast majority had chosen the BBC, their studio and sensible suits. Adrian Chiles sports shorts and flip flops while presenting ITV's World Cup coverage in Brazil last summer . Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London on Friday . Chiles will be replaced at ITV by BBC broadcaster and commentator Mark Pougatch . But at the end of the evening, when Chiles told us it had been an ‘absolute privilege’ to present a World Cup from Brazil, you knew he meant it. He is a genuine fan. Don’t let Chiles’ taciturn style kid you — he is a very capable live TV presenter but he has looked an uncomfortable match for ITV’s portfolio of broadcast rights. Chiles is a non-conformist and he can’t ‘sell’ a big TV match as hard as others can. That’s an issue for a commercial channel. The great Tony Hancock had a lovely phrase to accentuate his ‘me against the world’ standpoint and I half-expected Chiles to borrow it and open a programme with a morose look accompanied by: ‘Stone me, what a life!’ And, of course, when it came to those dreaded head-to-heads with the BBC, he had a World Cup Golden Boot winner in Gary Lineker to compete with on the other channel. What Chiles did bring were refreshingly different questions, many that could have come straight off the terraces. It made for interesting responses. And throw him an unusual camera shot and he could conjure up a quirky line. Chiles after England's game against Honduras in Miami was suspended for an electrical storm . Chiles is hit by a sprinkler in Switzerland alongside colleagues Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Glenn Hoddle . He was also thrown pitch-side presentation and Roy Keane’s moods — not easy to handle. Sadly, he hadn’t done a deal with the weather gods. A downpour in Poland saw a World Cup qualifier postponed, giving Chiles two hours to fill. Then an electric storm in Miami last summer halted England’s friendly against Honduras and left Chiles and his colleagues sweltering. ‘I’m off to the dry cleaners!’ said a sweat-sodden Chiles as the match resumed. Chiles is to be replaced by broadcast journalist Mark Pougatch. This is a big break for a polished radio performer who now has the chance to forge a more substantial TV career.","Adrian Chiles had different take on football presenting, says Brian Barwick .

"Michael Carrick has revealed his dream Manchester United five-a-side team - and it doesn't include a goalkeeper or any of his defensive team-mates. The Manchester United midfielder has become the latest Old Trafford star to pick four of his colleagues to play alongside him in what would be his ideal five-a-side team. And Carrick, speaking to Manchester United's official website, has said he would go 'all-out attack'. Red Devils vice-captain Michael Carrick has named his dream Manchester United five-a-side team .

England ace Rooney has also recently selected his five-a-side team with the United captain also failing to select a defender or goalkeeper. Rooney said: 'Do you have to have a goalkeeper? If not, I’ll go for Angel [di Maria], [Radamel] Falcao, Robin [van Persie] and [Juan] Mata.' Summer signings Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao appear to have made a good impression on Carrick .

"A new road has been unveiled in the Netherlands that could change the way we drive in future. This isn’t just a regular road – it’s a proof of concept for Studio Roosegaarde’s innovative ‘Smart Highway’ design. Using glow-in-the-dark paint, it could lead to interactive and sustainable roads without streetlights. Scroll down for video . Blurred lines: Dutch company Studio Roosegaarde unveiled its glow-in-the-dark technology two weeks ago (pictured) that could be used to light up roads in the future and create interactive 'Smart Highways,'  - but have admitted that the lines fade in the rain . The technology was first unveiled in 2012, when it scooped ‘Best Future Concept’ at the Dutch Design Awards. Now it’s been deployed on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) section of the N329 road near Oss, Netherlands. And, if it proves successful, their ‘Smart Highway’ could soon be making its way to a road near you. With many energy-conscious governments switching off streetlights, this technology could be a green solution to lighting our roads. Special lines are painted along the sides of roads. These lines contain a ‘photo-luminising’ powder that charges in the day. At night, the powder releases a green glow. After absorbing daylight the paint can glow for up to ten hours, all through the hours of darkness. The lines are bright enough that future roads could use them in place of streetlights. It absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night, providing drivers with clear markings on where to go. The company says the paint is a sustainable alternative to modern roads. This particular test is a pilot project for the technology. Ultimately, they say the same paint could be used to make interactive roads. For example, weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level. And Roosegaarde Studio, in collaboration with Heijmans Infrastructure, also has plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes. The technology has now been rolled out on a section of the N329 road near Oss in the Netherlands, but the company hopes it could be deployed internationally soon if the pilot proves successful . The stretch of road near Oss is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow-in-the-dark paint, pictured here glowing at optimum levels . The technology is currently being tested on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) stretch of the N329 near Oss . Despite teething problems, it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature, giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads . Studio Roosegaarde's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged . The designer behind the project, Daan Roosegaarde, is notorious for his somewhat wacky designs including the dress that turns transparent when it detects you're aroused, as recently reported by MailOnline. ‘Instead of focusing on the car to innovate the driving experience, Daan Roosegaarde and Heijmans are innovating the highway,’ the companies say in a release. ‘Innovative designs such as the Glow-in-the-Dark Road, Dynamic Paint, Interactive Light, Induction Priority Lane and Wind Light will be realized within the following five years. ‘The goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights, smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations.’ While the paint is designed to a small section of road in the Netherlands for now, the companies hope to roll it out internationally. Dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane . Studio Roosegaarde also has plans for interactive lights that only turn on when they detect cars .","Dutch company has begun testing their glow-in-the-dark roads .

"Travel and technology company Teague have created an innovative new airplane interior which could revolutionise the way football teams and athletes travel around the world. Football managers across the globe have often complained about the amount of air miles their players have to clock up during different spells of the season. There's little doubt that long journeys can hamper the performance of athletes, but Teague, in conjunction with Nike, have developed an idea that they claim will 'preserve peak performance'. Innovation: Travel and technology company Teague have unveiled an airplane cabin to help professional athletes preserve their peak before and after performance . Recover: The 'Athlete's Plane' has been designed with the effects of air travel on professional athletes in mind and features a variety of post-match necessities . Rest: Teague claim the airplane will help players' recovery, circulation, sleep and thinking all while they travel to and from destinations . The 'Athlete's Plane' is designed to provide pre and post performance necessities which could make air travel an ideal place for injured or tired players to begin their recovery on the way home after the game. The Teague mode of travel would have been ideal for football players during the recent international break as top European clubs had to watch on as their players travelled thousands of miles to play in friendly matches. For example, Brazil have played two games in Miami over the past five days meaning the Premier League, La Liga and Bungesliga's Brazilian contingents will have clocked up over 8,000 air miles before attempting to be available for selection in their domestic leagues this weekend. Future? Amenities include lie-flat seating to accommodate athletic builds, compression sleeves to ice sore muscles and biometric testing and analysis in-flight . Vital: The lie-flat seating has been designed to accommodate athletic builds as players look to rest while clocking up the air miles . Globetrotters: Top European clubs will no doubt be interested in such a design as players and staff travel across the globe so often . Teague aim to make such journeys easier for the players with lie-flat seating, compression sleeves for sore muscles, a seperate cabin which cancels out any noise and an area to enable in-flight analysis and testing. Such an idea could also stop the constant battle between international teams and domestic clubs as managers often look to keep their players at home if possible. Teague's creative director Philipp Steiner said: When professional athletes travel across multiple time zones their team is statistically more likely to lose - the Athlete's Plane essentially levels the playing field'. Knowledge: Teague have worked closely with sports manufacturers Nike as well as former athletes to discover what is needed during a post-performance flight . Chance: Teague's creative director Philipp Steiner believes the 'Athlete's Plane' levels the playing field for away team having to travel long distances . Tired legs: Brazilian players will clock up around 8,000 air miles each as they travel from international duty in Miami back to their teams in Europe .","Teague have designed an 'Athlete's Plane' which will provide pre and post-performance necessities .

"A woman was landed with a £12,500 mobile bill after she accidentally used her phone to download repeats of sitcom 'My Family' while on holiday. Patricia Al, 23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy via her O2 phone. Miss Al was on holiday in Bodrum in Turkey and using the hotel Wifi to download the series from iTunes onto her laptop. But the Wi-Fi connection cut out and her phone - which was hooked up to her computer while it was charging - took over the download. Scroll down for video . Patricia Al,  23, from Chelsea, London, was hit with a £12,000 bill after downloading just two episodes of the BBC comedy My Family  via her O2 phone while in Turkey . The My Family Complete Boxed Set is priced £32.86, which contains all 120 episodes of the BBC One show, which ran for 11 years from September 2000 . The glitch meant that the intern property consultant was charged an incredible £5,156, 97 for one episode and £5,453.80 for another - a total of £10, 611. Ms Al was also charged over £2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday, and returned home to a total bill from O2 of £12,520.87. The figure could buy 323 complete box sets of the all 11 series of the hit show. Luckily for Miss Al her father has offered to foot the bill. She said: 'I'd bought the entire series on iTunes and wanted to download them so I had something to watch on the plane on the way home. 'I didn't want to download all the episodes at once, so I set up my laptop to download them one at a time. 'Every day I would plug my phone into my laptop to charge, set up the downloading on the hotel Wi-Fi and go off for a swim. 'I had no idea what had happened until I got a message from O2 on my last day of my holiday, saying my phone may have been stolen, because my bill was so large. She was charged £5,156, 97 for one episode and £5,453.80 for another - a total of £10, 611. Ms Al was also charged over £2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday . 'I had a look online at my bill, and I couldn't believe my eyes - it was more than £12,000. 'From the looks of things, the free hotel Wi-Fi must have cut out twice and my phone automatically took the internet access. 'It's quite scary really, I didn't press anything - I had no idea something like this could happen, and I want to warn others. 'It's really quite embarrassing - I had to ask my father to bail me out.' Her O2 bill shows that on August 21 and August 23, two blocks of around 900mb of data were used by Patricia's iPhone working as a modem. She added: 'Nobody in their right mind would deliberately use such large amounts of data on their mobile - I can't believe that O2 actually sent me the bill. 'I admit that I was using my phone quite a lot while I was away, checking emails and such, so I was expecting a larger than normal bill. 'I take responsibility for that - taking off my data cap. But the size of the final bill is just ridiculous. Surely nobody would deliberately run up such big charges? 'I tried ringing O2, but they were very unhelpful. The money is due to come out of my account next week, so I'm having to beg my dad for help. 'I can't believe O2 didn't even have the courtesy to send me a message saying I was using such astronomical amounts of data - I bet they were just rubbing their hands with glee.' The total came to more than 40 times her usual bill amount. Luckily for Miss Al - who lives in Chelsea, her father has offered to foot the bill . The bill total, running from August 20 to September 20, came to an astonishing £12,520.87 more than 40 times her usual bill amount. She added: 'I just wanted something to watch on the plane home, My Family isn't even my favourite show. 'I realised I hadn't seen the eighth series, so bought it on iTunes. Now I've ended up paying for the most expensive television episodes ever.' O2 say Ms Al's bill was allowed to escalate to over £12,000 because she had opted out of the 50mb roaming data cap and the £120 overseas bill limit. Contact your network operator before you leave: Often they have cheaper bundles or tariffs available if you know you're going abroad . Ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use, to stop your bill spiraling. Turn off auto-updating of apps or email retrieval: Again this means you won't use any data allowance . Use mobile websites instead of full desktop view: This will save data per page . Turn off data roaming all together: If you don't want to use the internet when you're away . Mobile network Three has scrapped roaming charges altogether for UK customers using the company's 'Feel At Home' service. It is now available in a total of 16 countries. Others on the list include USA, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark and Republic of Ireland. O2 said they texted her on August 24 to let her know her bill had reached £5701.86 on the day she accidentally downloaded the first episode. The phone giant has since reduced her bill by £6,644.97 - for the data she used after August 24 until the end of her holiday. An O2 spokesperson said: 'We are clear with customers on the charges they can expect from overseas mobile phone usage. 'Our O2 Travel service caps this usage and we advise customers to think carefully before they ask us to remove it. 'We would also advise customers to be careful when using their mobile phone as a modem for their laptop while overseas. 'If your hotel WiFi signal drops out, the data charges will be carried over the overseas mobile phone network and as a result be added to your mobile phone bill. 'As a gesture of goodwill, we have applied a £6644.97 credit to her account - the additional usage charges she incurred while using her mobile phone in Turkey.' But Ms Al said: 'They told me they sent me a text, but when I told them I didn't receive it until the end of my holiday, they said there must have been a problem with the Turkish service provider. 'There quite clearly wasn't any problem with the Turkish phone company signal, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to accidentally download the show twice.'","Patricia Al, 23, was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes .

"The daughter of singer Eartha Kitt has revealed that she never got over not knowing who her white father was. Kitt Shapiro, 51, described how her mother 'carried the scar of her rejection' throughout her life by both black and white people. Even when she died in 2008 she did not know who her father was because his name had been censored on a birth certificate given to her 10 years earlier - the first time she learned of her real date of birth. Eartha Kitt, pictured performing in 1968, never knew her father . Kitt was 71 when she was given the document but broke down in tears when her lifelong dream of knowing the identity of her father was shattered. This, Shapiro believes, was because he was white and officials wanted to protect him. 'It was approaching the 21st century and yet they were still . protecting the name of the father even though he was clearly dead,' Shapiro, Kitt's only child told the Observer. 'To some extent, I think my arrival completed her because it gave her a family that she never had,' she says. Kitt's mother abandoned her when she was a young child and she was raised by various brutal aunts and . never forgot 'the beatings, the domestic drudgery, the constant . hunger.' Eartha pictured with her daughter Kitt and then husband William McDonald . On one occasion, she was tied to a tree and whipped by Aunt . Rosa 'till the blood ran down her legs.' Soon afterwards, her mother, . Annie Mae Keitt, mysteriously died after eating food 'sprinkled with an . unusual pepper', although there was never any mention of who might have been responsible for the poisoning. The . next we know, like an episode in a torrid novel, 'a miraculous event' occurs and an Auntie Mamie invites Eartha to live with her in New York. At school in Harlem, Eartha 'acquired a reputation for her singing . ability' - and this was the era of Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway and . 'the swanky Cotton Club,' of speakeasies and bars, with 'its mix of . Latin, West Indian and African-American cultures.' Eartha . soon quarrelled with her guardian, and after another routine beating, . moved out. 'She found herself a job in a sweatshop as a seamstress and a . room with a Cuban family in the Bronx.' She was soon engaged by a dance . troupe, where she gained notice. After dance school, Kitt sought to make a solo career for herself and Britain became a second home for her and her daughter. It was only when Kitt was invited to give a speech at Benedict College in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, in 1997 that the singer managed to come to terms with her original home. Kitt sought to make a solo career for herself and Britain became a second home for her and her daughter . During that same speech an attendee asked Kitt about her past and about her parents, as she was from that part of town. Kitt then confessed she had tried to find her birth certificate in the 50s, but had no luck. This re-ignited Kitt's curiosity about herself. After some digging around, a piece of information led her back down to the South. In the next seven months, Kitt and Shapiro hired a lawyer and started a petition to get the court to open her records. They finally allowed Kitt to see them, but only for 15 minutes. The pair flew down. 'She was very nervous and outside the judge's chambers she went quiet. She was visibly nervous about what she was going to see... It was a female judge who stepped aside while we read the records on her desk. The father's name was blacked out. My mother shed a few tears and then the 15 minutes was up,' says Shapiro, who worked for her mother for more than 20 years. The singer with her model daughter Kitt in 1999, a year after the pair found Eartha's birth certificate . On that day it was also revealed Kitt had never known her birth date. While she has always put January 26 1926 on her passport, the certificate revealed she was actually a year younger, born January 17 1927. Shapiro says her mother never really . felt comfortable in her own skin because she never really knew who she . was until then. She believes that this failure to find out her mother's . origins explains her tortured relationship with the South and her own . identity. Eartha Kitt passed away on Christmas Day 2008, never knowing her father's name . At that time, . being a light-skinned black person in the black South was 'just as bad' as black person in the white South. Kitt was not accepted by the black . community and was referred to as a 'yellow gal' (someone who thought they were better than everyone else) from a child. For Eartha, born in 1927 in 'a . ramshackle arrangement of backwoods shacks' in the South Carolina cotton . fields, being born black or of mixed race was like being a Jew in Nazi . Germany. You were not quite human. Eartha, . indeed, had not thought of herself as 'coloured' until she was made to . enter restaurants by the back door. Even in the Sixties she had . difficulty buying property in Hollywood, because Bel Air and Beverly . Hills were neighbourhoods that 'didn’t welcome African-American . home-owners.' When her close . friend Sammy Davis Jr. used a hotel swimming pool, it was 'drained and . scrubbed by a cleaning crew the next morning.' Eartha’s . parentage was uncertain. Her father was white - but who was he? Possibly one of the Keitt family, 'the former slave owners,' or, far . more likely, a recently bereaved local doctor called Daniel Sturkie. Indeed, John Williams, the author of a biography called America's Mistress: Eartha Kitt, Her Life and Times, believed Kitt's father was Sturkie, though Shapiro says 'there were a lot of names'.","Singer and actress Eartha Kitt never knew who her white father was .

"Cristiano Ronaldo will have yet another record in his sights after moving up to sixth in the all-time list of top scorers in the big five leagues on Sunday. Ronaldo's penalty in Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat by Valencia at the Mestalla  - which brought an end to their 22-game winning run - was his 28th La Liga goal this season. And it was also his 287th goal in the Spanish and English leagues combined, which took him level with Gordon Hodgson in sixth position in the table of scorers across Europe's biggest leagues, which also includes the Bundesliga in Germany, Italy's Serie A and the French top flight, Ligue 1. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Valencia at the Mestalla on Sunday . Ronaldo scores from the penalty spot to give Real Madrid the lead against Valencia . Hodgson, who played for both South Africa and England, scored 287 league goals during his spells with Liverpool, Aston Villa and Leeds United from 1926-1939. Next in sight for 29-year-old Ronaldo is Delio Onnis, an Argentine born in Italy, who scored 299 goals in France from 1971-1986. Top of the table is English legend Jimmy Greaves, who scored 366 goals between 1957 and 1971 - 357 in England and nine during his time in Italy. Greaves finished just one goal ahead of Germany's Gerd Muller, who hit the back of the net 365 times for Bayern Munich from 1965-1979. Ronaldo later shows his dejection as Real Madrid lose 2-1 to Valencia after 22 straight wins . England's Steve Bloomer and Dixie Dean take up the fourth and fifth positions respectively. In all, there are five English players in the top 10 with Alan Shearer sitting in eighth, having scored 283 league goals for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United from 1988-2006. Ronaldo is 30 goals ahead of rival Lionel Messi, with the Barcelona 27-year-old scoring 257 goals in the league for the Catalan club since 2004. Ronaldo's next opportunity to further add to his total will come on Saturday when Real Madrid host Espanyol at the Santiago Bernabeu. 1. Jimmy Greaves (England) Jimmy Greaves started his career at Chelsea in 1957 but it was his nine-year spell at Tottenham Hotspur from 1961 which proved to be his most successful as he became the White Hart Lane club's highest ever goalscorer. Greaves also spent six months with AC Milan in 1961 and played for West Ham from 1970-1971. Jimmy Greaves looks to pass the ball during a match between Spurs and Sheffield Wednesday in 1967 . 2. Gerd Muller (Germany) Gerd Muller is the greatest German striker ever, scoring 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga games during his 15 years at Bayern Munich from 1964-1979. His international record for West Germany was phenomenal, scoring 68 goals in 62 appearances. Gerd Muller waves to the crowd after winning the World Cup with West Germany in 1974 . 3. Steve Bloomer (England) Steve Bloomer is regarded as Derby County's greatest ever player. The club anthem is called Steve Bloomer's Watchin' and he has a bronze statue situated next to the team dugout at Pride Park. He started playing with the Rams in 1892, moved to Middlesbrough in 1906 for four years before returning to Derby to end his career there. A picture of Derby County legend Steve Bloomer who remains a hero at the club to this day . 4. Dixie Dean (England) Dixie Dean is quite simply an Everton legend. After moving from Tranmere Rovers in 1925, Dean scored 349 goals in 399 appearances over 12 years for the Toffees. A statue of the great centre forward is located outside Goodison Park. Dixie Dean runs out on to the pitch holding the ball under his arm before a match in 1933 . 5. Delio Onnis (Argentina/Italy) Delio Onnis was born in Italy and has Argentine citizenship but it was in France where he made his name. Onnis played for Stade Reims, AS Monaco, Tours FC and SC Toulon, scoring 299 league goals from 1971-1986.","Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty against Valencia on Sunday took him to sixth .

A long way from Liverpool: The LA mansion, which is on the market for $3.1million, was rented by The Beatles in 1965 . Acid experiment: The plush surroundings of the villa in the Benedict Canyon was where The Beatles threw LSD parties in the Sixties . A day in the life: The luxurious home was owned by actress Zsa Zsa Gabor when the Beatles rented it but also belonged to Cary Grant at one time . Fab life: The Beatles holed up at the mansion for a week, inviting celebrity friends Peter Fonda, Joan Baez and the Byrds to party with them . With four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two wet bars, a wine cellar, hardwood floors, five fireplaces, six car garage, pool - and 2.53 acres - there is plenty of room for rock and roll excess. The decor - heavily-patterned couches, wooden panels and a faux French chateau vibe - appeared to have had little done to it since the Fab Four paid a visit. Realtor Roger Perry told MailOnline that the home was put on the market on August 23 by current owner Pamela Juhos. The mansion was rented in late August 1965 by the band's manager Brian Epstein to give them a break from touring. The address of 2850 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills spread like wildfire among fans and was besieged by devoted followers who blocked roads and tried to climb the steep canyon to reach their idols. Finding themselves trapped behind the property walls, The Beatles invited famous friends to join them including Eleanor Bron (who co-starred in Help!), Peggy Lipton and folk singer Joan Baez.. Psychedelic: The Beatles experimented with LSD before the release of the 1966 album Revolver . Secluded: The compound in Beverly Hills was besieged by Beatles' fans in 1965 keeping the Fab Four trapped inside . Fellow musicians the Byrds and actor Peter Fonda also stopped by, leading to the moment the  Beatles - minus Paul McCartney - took LSD. Genius: The Beatles 1966 album Revolver . The song She Said, She Said was later described by Lennon as an 'acidy song'. It has been suggested that he was inspired by comments Fonda made while the band and their guests were sitting in a huge empty bathtub in the master bedroom, high on hallucinogenics. She Said She Said features on the 1966 Revolver album - added by the band because they were a track short. Ringo Starr said of the album's recording: 'We . were having more fun in the studio, from Revolver Rubber Soul as it was . building up, it was getting more experimental, the songs were getting . better, more interesting. 'So that’s where we were going.' Revolver entered the British and U.S. charts at number one, staying there for seven and six weeks respectively. Expanding horizons: The Beatles invited fellow musicians and actors including Easy Rider star Peter Fonda to their rental home in the Californian hills . Hidden: The Beatles had achieved global fame by 1965 and that year's North American tour included dates at the Hollywood Bowl. The villa was supposed to allow the Fab Four privacy... but fans found them . Inspiration: John Lennon said that Peter Fonda's comments while on an acid trip at the house led to the lyrics for She Said She Said . Vivid: The band were trapped in the mansion after fans found out the address and besieged the property . The band's seventh studio album is considered one of their greatest musical achievements and regularly is included in lists of the best albums of all time. When asked about the influence of drug-taking on their music, John Lennon told an interviewer in 1972: 'They don't make you write any better. I never wrote any better stuff because I was on acid or not on acid.' The property is listed on Hauteliving.com, a cluster of some of the most opulent homes on the market around the world.

"As Alan Thompson approached his 40th birthday his life was in flux. There were front pages on his private life. Lurid news tales on drink driving. The loss of his job as Celtic's first team coach five weeks after a 3-0 victory over Rangers in the last Old Firm match led him towards a dark tunnel. 'Aye, I was in a bad place,' he tells Sportsmail. 'I had hurt people, I felt hurt and I just wanted to move on. Alan Thompson admits he was in a bad place when he was sacked as Celtic coach in 2012 . Thompson celebrates with Neil Lennon after winning the title with Celtic in April 2012 . 'I admit it took me a while to get over what happened at Celtic. It took me 12 months to get over it. I had 12 months of doing virtually nothing. 'I just felt I didn't want to get back involved in football for a long time. 'I took time out after that. I needed it. 'It was the first time since I left school I'd been out of football. That's what, twenty three years? I'd always been in or around a football club. And then….' For a wet and grey city Glasgow sustains a thriving grapevine. For weeks before his sacking word had it Thompson was living a fuller, more colourful life than Celtic might have liked. The gossip, he says now, was exaggerated. Friends with Neil Lennon since pairing up at Parkhead at the outset of the Martin O'Neill era the pair socialised together. Thompson was the man to whom the Northern Irishman first confided his battle with depression. Yet when the telephone call came telling him his job was going, Thompson took possession of his own black cloud. 'I took time out back home in Newcastle with the family. I needed that to get myself sorted. 'I felt I couldn't trust many people. Thompson, now a coach at Blackpool, talks to Sportsmail's Stephen McGowan . Thompson took time away from football after his Celtic sacking before linking up with Lee Clark at Birmingham . 'You start asking questions of yourself as well. 'I stayed clear of the game completely. I was invited to a lot of clubs to watch training and stay involved, but I just didn't want to do it. 'I didn't watch Sky, I didn't lift a paper. I stayed well away from everybody except my family. 'I took some nice holidays, I had some nice breaks. I had lads' golf trips, I did stuff I hadn't had the luxury of doing for a long time and suddenly had the time to do. 'I went to New York for my 40th last Christmas. I couldn't have done all that if I had jumped back in to the game. I needed that time.' After family, football had been his second love. A father of three Thompson compares the loss of his Celtic job to a break-up. It took the lure of his hometown club to persuade him to dip his toe back in the water. 'A mate of mine has a box at Newcastle and I started going to back to St James' Park,' he remembers. 'I watched them and started doing the things I hadn't done for a while. 'I went to see friends in the game, I got around training grounds. 'Then a chance came up to work at Birmingham with my mate Lee Clark and I felt I couldn't turn it down. The midfielder scored a goal against Ranger every season that he played for Celtic . 'I asked myself the question and thought about it. Then I said, ""you know what? I'm ready now"".' Sipping cappuccino in a restaurant off Blackpool's Bloomfield Road Thompson has stability in his life once more. The pitch outside is barren and bare, but he has his family back and a job in English football. His own grass is greener than since his sacking two and a half years ago. 'I'm back in the game now and loving the day to day involvement at Blackpool and passing on the knowledge of everything I've learned.' He will watch Sunday's League Cup meeting between Celtic and Rangers with his 15-year-old son, a curious bystander in the circus of Glasgow life. 'He remembers little bits of life up there and has seen the clips on You Tube, but he has been asking me a few questions recently about it. Why it is how it is, the bigotry and stuff. It's difficult to explain.' Thompson won four Scottish league titles, three Scottish Cups, two League Cups and reached a UEFA Cup Final. He spent seven years at Celtic, scoring a goal against Rangers for every season at the club. Uniquely, he also racked up three red cards. All of them at Ibrox. The 41-year-old was sent off three times against Rangers, all at Ibrox, during seven years at Celtic . 'There was a red in my very first Old Firm game,' he grimaces. 'The gaffer (Martin O'Neill) nearly ripped my head off after the game. 'He was physically trying to get at me. We were in the game – Rangers had just gone 2-1 ahead and I got sent off and it went 3-1 then 4-1 and finished at five. 'He came at me and I thought, ""s**t my Celtic career is finished before it's begun"". 'Honestly, the way he was talking to me after the game. Martin could be ruthless when he wanted to be. 'Thankfully I redeemed myself in the next Rangers game at Celtic Park. I scored the only goal of a 1-0 win.' He pleads guilty to two of the reds, but has a well rehearsed defence for the other. 'The Lovenkrands one (in 2004) was definitely not a red card, I never made contact. 'We didn't even come together and he went down as if someone had taken him out with a sawn off shotgun. Thompson (right) scraps with Rangers' Fernando Ricksen in the Scottish Cup in 2003 . 'Funny enough, we ended up working together at Newcastle. We sorted it out.' The first man to be capped for England while a Celtic player Thompson scored seven goals in Glasgow derbies - as many as Chris Sutton and John Hartson. 'I'm quite proud of that,' he admits. 'I remember smashing one in off the bar over Stefan Klos. Great memories. And Sutty chipping one into the far corner, that's my favourite that one. 'You go into this coaching side of things and people talk about systems, but you realise in teams like that it's not systems that win games. 'Players win games, not systems. We just had good players who knew their roles. 'Chris Sutton's partnership with Henrik wasn't something we worked on in training. It was just two top football players who knew each other's games. 'We had a chemistry as a team. 'You would turn round in the tunnel before a game and say, 'I trust him, I trust him, I trust him.' 'We all lived in and around Glasgow, be it Bothwell or Newton Mearns. You could meet in the city centre. We were a close bunch.' Thompson is shown a red card by referee Stuart Dougal during Celtic's 3-1 defeat by Rangers in 2005 . The bond of trust with Lennon was broken for a time. As his best mucker, trips to the city centre could be a fraught affair. 'It's quite unique in Glasgow,' says Thompson matter of fact. 'There is no place quite like it. 'The importance of football is amazing, it's a massive part of people's lives. 'Sometimes now I miss it. 'I'll sit and watch the Old Firm game on Sunday and think, 'I'd love to be playing in that today.' 'Then you think about the stick and the grief after it and feel relieved you're not involved any longer. 'You have to be careful what you do in that city, there is no hiding place. You have to know that when you are there. 'I never got it like Neil did. There were a few isolated incidents, but what Neil went through was on a different scale. I would have hated that. 'Here in Blackpool it's totally different.' On a blustery, grey January day there is little pleasure to be had on the legendary beach, yet Thompson's outlook is bright. He left Celtic as player and coach under a cloud, but can speak readily about both now. It's progress of a sort. (Left to right) Johann Mjallby, Gary Parker, Alan Thompson and Neil Lennon celebrate winning the title in 2012 . 'The way it ended for me first time was horrible. 'But, you know, I won four titles and the two I lost was on goal difference and by a point. How bad can that be?' He wouldn't swap his current existence at the foot of England's Championship for that of Ronny Deila. Thompson looks at the Norwegian and sees an Old Firm novice cursed by a Celtic team with no Larssons, Suttons or Lennons to speak of. 'It's evident to see the fixture doesn't have the same players now. It doesn't take an expert to see that. It's a shame. 'People down here would struggle to name many players at Celtic and Rangers now. 'Gary Hooper is down here now. Victor Wanyama, Fraser Forster, Kris Commons might be looking down here as well. I'm guessing it's been a while since anyone significant at all has come down from Rangers. 'But there's no football place quite like Glasgow. It's a unique city and a unique game for the simple reason that people still care.'","Alan Thompson was sacked from Celtic coaching role in 2012 .

"Actor Sacha Baron Cohen has infuriated local politicians and residents of Grimsby with his portrayal of the town in his upcoming football-based film. The British star, who is famous for his characters Ali G, Borat and Bruno; has caused fury among many within the seaside resort for his portrayal of the opposite sex. Titled Grimsby, the comedy depicts the Conference Premier side's female supporters as 'revolting' 20-stone women. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sacha Baron Cohen . Sacha Baron Cohen (left, on set) has been criticised for casting 'revolting' 20-stone women for his film Grimsby. Among women cast as football fans from the British seaside town is Rebel Wilson (right) According to an extra in Cape Town, where the film was partly shot, the women chosen by Baron Cohen are 'enormous'. 'The gang of supporters from Grimsby are all enormous and revolting,' Maurice Maree, who worked on the film, told the Sunday Times. Local politicians have been outraged by the casting and the film's negative portrayal of the town. 'Why pick on us? There are other places where obesity is a problem where they've got a rough deal. Why is Grimsby picked on all the time,' Austin Mitchell MP told MailOnline. 'I know it's a joke but I haven't seen these fat ladies anywhere - if they were so fat they wouldn't fit through the turnstiles at the stadium. 'You can find fat ladies anywhere, we don't have an accumulation of them. We have the problems of a town which needs more development and jobs and its lost its basic industry. Local politicians have complained the film suggests Grimsby football fans are violent and overweight . The actor (left) who shot to fame as Ali G visited the town in Lincolnshire before filming began abroad . Critics said the portrayal of residents and football fans as violent and obese created a 'very damaging image' A local MP condemned Baron Cohen naming the film after the town, saying: 'You can find fat ladies anywhere' 'That's something to be helped and not made fun of. It creates a very damaging image.' Previously, councillor Matthew Brown told MailOnline he was 'disappointed' with the film. 'It is using the town's name in potentially a poor light. What also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town's name. 'Anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative, but I hope people will be open-minded when they watch the film. He added that depicting Grimsby as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong. 'My view is quite simple. We don't have a massive issue with hooliganism. There is very good stewarding at the ground. In general we are not in the same category as other clubs like Millwall who have a history of it.' A local councillor has also criticised the film of the film's portrayal of the seaside town . Besides claims Grimsby is  picked on due to its name, critics asked why the film was  shot in Essex and abroad . Among the women chosen to depict fans of Grimsby Town FC is Rebel Wilson, famed for her roles Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect in which she plays a character called Fat Amy. The Australian actress is seen locking lips with Baron Cohen in one scene, while his real-life wife, Isla Wilson, reportedly fills another on-screen role. Grimsby is scheduled for release in 2015 and see Sacha take on the role of a dimwit supporter of lower league team Grimsby Town. But while the town's representatives have been left disappointed by the way it is portrayed, residents have taken a more lighthearted approach. 'Should be good, there's no such thing as bad publicity,' one said online, while another said Mr Mitchell 'had no sense of humour'. Local MP Austin Mitchell said the town's problems were no worse than in  other British areas . While representatives for the town said they were disappointed by the film, residents saw its comedic value .","Actor Sacha Baron Cohen's football-based film 'Grimsby' is out this year .

"The Taliban murdered five women polio health workers in a series of attacks in Pakistan today. The victims were shot in the head at close range, two of them as they administered vaccine drops to young children. The killings halted a polio campaign that international health officials say is vital to contain the crippling disease but which the Taliban claim is a cover for US spies. Rescue workers move the bodies of two of the polio vaccination workers to a mortuary after four of the aid workers were killed in Karachi, Pakistan . Attack: Unknown armed men killed four female workers who were on a three-day polio vaccination campaign funded by UNICEF in Karachi . Rukhsana Bibi mourns over the body of her daughter, polio worker Madiha Bibi, at the morgue of local hospital in Karachi . The government is in the middle of a three-day vaccination drive targeting high risk areas of the country as part of an effort to immunise millions of children under the age of five. Four of the women were gunned down in the southern city of Karachi, and the fifth in a village outside the north-west city of Peshawar. Yesterday a man working on the anti-polio campaign was shot dead down in Karachi. The Taliban also killed three soldiers in an ambush of an army convoy escorting a vaccination team in the north-west. The attacks in Karachi were coordinated and occurred within 15 minutes in three different areas of the city that are far apart. In each case, the gunmen used 9mm pistols. Two of the women were 18 and 19, and the other two were in their 40s, he said. Polio campaign: Female health workers give polio vaccines to a child during a three-day nationwide vaccination campaign in Peshawar, Pakistan . Rescue workers move the body of one of the Polio vaccination workers to a mortuary . Local religious clerics and pro-Taliban lobby are reportedly trying to convince residents that the U.S.-manufactured polio drops were designed to sterilize Pakistanis and reduce the Muslim population . Two of the women were killed while they were in a house giving children polio drops. The other two were travelling between houses when they were attacked, he said. Taliban opposition to the polio campaign grew last year after it was revealed that a Pakistani doctor ran a fake vaccination programme to help the CIA track down Osama bin Laden. Officials in Karachi responded to the attacks by suspending the vaccination campaign.Janbaz Afridi, a senior health official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the fifth woman was killed, said the shootings would not stop the local government from continuing its vaccination program in the province and the neighbouring tribal region, the main sanctuary for Taliban militants in the country. Rukhsana Bibi, center, is supported by a friend after visiting the body of her daughter, polio worker Madiha Bibi . Pakistani relatives transport the dead body of a female polio worker who was killed by gunmen at a local hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan . Conflict: The Taliban argues that the polio drive was just a cover for U.S. spies . 'These incidents are depressing and may cause difficulties in the anti-polio drive, but people should not lose heart,"" he said. 'The government is very serious, and we are determined to eliminate polio despite all odds and difficult conditions.' The shootings in Karachi all took place in areas mainly populated by ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban are a Pashtun-dominated movement, and many militants are reported to be hiding in these communities in the city. Polio usually infects children living in unsanitary conditions, attacks the nerves and can kill or paralyse. Most of the new cases in Pakistan are in the north-west, where the presence of militants makes it difficult to reach children.

Simeone, who played with Riquelme for the Argentina national team, reflected on his team-mate's career as a supporter rather than a fellow professional by saying: 'Riquelme, I wish him well. 'He gave a lot to football, he built an extraordinary career. As a fan, I thank you for all the nights you gave us.' Juan Roman Riquelme has retired from football at the age of 36 . Riquelme, pictured with Carlos Tevez (L) and Lionel Messi, was named Argentina Player of the Year four times . The Argentina playmaker will be remembered in Europe for his time with Barcelona .

"For astronauts struggling to get up in the morning, it could be a welcome relief. Researchers say they have perfect a zero gravity espresso cup that can deliver the perfect shot in orbit. It uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink. Scroll down for video . six of the 3D-printed cups are scheduled to fly to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2015 aboard a SpaceX rocket. Micro-gravity conditions inhibit the production of 'crema,' the defining feature of a decent espresso shot. A shot of espresso is composed of a complex, low-density colloid of emulsified oils. The earth's gravitational pull causes these oils to rise to the surface producing the aromatic foam enjoyed by coffee aficionados across the globe. Created by the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University, six of the 3D-printed cups are scheduled to fly to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2015 aboard a SpaceX rocket. 'Its geometry is the 'smart' part, which provides the fluids-control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces,' said Drew Wollman, who developed the system . 'The shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts—exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension.' The new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low-gravity environments of spacecraft. It is the second such innovation to be announced by PSU, following the zero-gravity coffee cup unveiled last summer. Without the pull of gravity, fluids behave very differently than on earth. Instead of 'pouring,' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension. This phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee. A series of channels simulates pouring needed to create the perfect shot . The 3D-printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low-gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically-calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring. Micro-gravity conditions inhibit the production of 'crema,' the defining feature of a decent espresso shot. A shot of espresso is composed of a complex, low-density colloid of emulsified oils. The earth's gravitational pull causes these oils to rise to the surface producing the aromatic foam enjoyed by coffee aficionados across the globe. Experiments related to the development of the zero-gravity cups have been officially dubbed the Capillary Beverage Experiment by NASA. The cup was unveiled at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting in San Francisco. 'I thoroughly enjoy involving college and high school students in research,' said Weislogel. 'It's also enjoyable to see how the low-gravity work supported by NASA and performed at PSU using the Dryden Drop Tower has developed--spawning a company, patenting IP, designing advanced systems for spacecraft, and now hoping to benefit the daily routine of astronauts aboard the ISS—with a simple drinking cup of all things.' Experiments related to the development of the zero-gravity cups have been officially dubbed the Capillary Beverage Experiment by NASA. Related tests to be performed onboard ISS next year include simple drinks such as clear juices, to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies. Last year one Italian astronaut took an ISSpresso machine with her to perk up the crew. An Italian astronaut is bringing an ISSpresso machine (pictured) with her to the ISS. It is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth . The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. Air Force Captain Samantha Cristoforetti is set to be not only be the first Italian woman to go into space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic espresso in orbit. She was blasted to the space research laboratory in November, together with the drinks machine. as part of The Futura Mission. It will be the second long-term mission of the Italian Space Agency (ISA) aboard the space station. Coffee company Lavazza worked with engineering firm and space food specialists Argotec, as well as the, ISA to build a coffee machine to bring Italian espresso to the ISS. It is befittingly called ISSpresso, and is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the ISS, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth. The prototype machine is currently being tested. It uses a 'capsule system' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea. The machine can also be used to rehydrate food.

The drinks will be made using this specially-designed machine. A typical model weighs 29lbs (13kg), but this model weighs around 44lbs (20kg) In order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment, the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The ISSpresso machine uses a standard coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The machine is much heavier than a normal model, which typically weighs 29lbs (13kg). The space-bound machine weighs around 44lbs (20kg) because there are backups of all the critical components, for safety reasons, and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the ISA. Hovering up to 270 miles (435 km) above the Earth, the International Space Station (pictured) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer . 'ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts' menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid dynamics and conditions in microgravity,' its makers said. 'Italian coffee is a beverage without borders and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into space for some time,' said Giuseppe Lavazza, vice president of Lavazza. Ten years ago the company produced artwork designed to look like its coffee was in space, and 'today we are in a position to overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso ... on board the International Space Station,' he continued. David Avino, managing director of Argotec added that the firm is also taking care of the European astronauts' training and nutrition. 'Food provides an important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to home.'","Series of channels simulates pouring needed to create the perfect shot .

"A dim-witted drug dealer has been jailed for more than three years after he asked a friend to take a picture of him in the act. Police found the incriminating photo on 22-year-old Peter Shaw’s phone after arresting him on suspicion of drugs offences at his home in Radford, Nottingham. The image, which showed him wearing a mask and gloves and measuring out drugs in neat rows on a kitchen worktop, was just one of a string of boastful photos - including some posted on Facebook. Not too bright: Peter Shaw was convicted after police seized this photo of him with drugs - from his own phone . Caught in the act: The images on one of three mobile phones showed Shaw with gloves, a mask and a scalpel . 'Tis the season: This image - which appears to show a tiny Christmas tree made out of cannabis - was posted to Shaw's Facebook page, where he described himself as having studied narcotics at Harvard University . Show-off: Another image posted on Facebook showed wads of banknotes perched on top of a man's crotch . Images seized by police from three mobile phones showed large quantities of cash and illegal substances - as well as Shaw handling and preparing drugs. And the drug dealer was not shy about showing off on Facebook, where one of his main profile images was a wad of banknotes perched on top of a man's crotch complete with a Louis Vuitton belt. The photo posted in January this year - six months after his arrest - was accompanied by one of a tiny Christmas tree which appeared to be made out of cannabis and was uploaded on December 24. Shaw's profile boasted of studying 'narcotics at Harvard University' and said he worked at a 'hyperbolic time chamber'. In June last year, weeks before he was arrested, a photo was uploaded of a hand holding what appeared to be cannabis in the street. The images had still not been removed today. Rich man: This photo found by police on one of Shaw's phones showed a cardboard box full of cash . Another image showed him handing small packages of drugs, with a distinctive tattoo on his hand clear to see . Measured: Police had almost everything they needed to conduct an investigation - including the drugs' weight . Nottingham Crown Court heard Shaw was arrested in July last year after officers stopped and searched him outside his home in Radford, Nottingham. A search of the house revealed equipment used to prepare drugs including scales, bags, rubber gloves and Rizla papers. They also discovered 33.4 grams of crack cocaine which he had hidden in a wheelie bin outside the house. But the clearest evidence was on Shaw's phones - where images showed him in a kitchen preparing drugs, surrounded by scales, bags, a kitchen knife, a scalpel and a bottle of Lucozade. Another photo showed him measuring out what appeared to be 12.3 grams of crack cocaine rocks on a set of scales, while one more showed a cardboard box full of cash. Faced with the evidence, the 22-year-old pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and was jailed for three years and five months. Evidence: Shaw's profile picture on Facebook. He has now been jailed for 41 months for intent to supply . Own goal: In June last year, weeks before he was arrested, a photo was uploaded to Shaw's Facebook of a hand holding what appeared to be cannabis in the street. The images had still not been removed today . Detective Constable Steve Fenyn of Nottinghamshire Police said: 'The case against Shaw was helped by his own ego which saw a friend photographing him committing the crime. 'He was literally caught in the act on camera.' He added: 'Drugs cause misery to communities, fuelling other crimes such as burglary and violence to feed a habit. 'People like Shaw don’t think about the consequences for others, they just see it as an easy way to make money. 'We are pleased to see that this time Shaw’s selfish actions have caught up with him and landed him with a jail term.'","Peter Shaw, 22, arrested when police stopped him outside his house .

"EU chiefs have set up an office on the Caribbean island of Barbados employing 39 staff and costing taxpayers £2 million a year. The headquarters on the exclusive west coast of the island where pop mogul Simon Cowell holidays, has breathtaking views of the white sandy beaches and the sea. Officials have £230 million of funding to dole out on projects which include retraining banana growers. Idyllic: The sun-kissed Caribbean island of Barbados where the EU has set up a headquarters to hand out money for projects . Barbados branch of the European Commission.jpg . The offices on the paradise island, 4,400 miles from Brussels, have been criticised as money wasting by Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party. Critic: UKIP leader Nigel Farage . He said: 'The EU fails to understand we don't want their officials sitting in luxury offices in tropical countries handing out our money on projects we have no say over. 'That includes not funding Eurocrats' luxury lifestyles when taxpayers in the UK can't afford to take their families abroad.' Apartments with balconies overlooking the beach, have reportedly been rented out to two senior EU officials. There is a a swimming pool for residents and well-kept gardens. At the office just outside the capital of Bridgetown, staff hand out cash for projects in 10 Caribbean countries - Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Anguilla, Monserrat, the British Virgin Islands, Grenada and Dominica. An EU spokesman agreed the office cost £2 million a year, but said the HQ was set up on the west coast because it was close to the island's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British High Commission. A spokesman said: 'The . EU office administers £230million in funding, like helping to build . hospitals and schools for the many in the region who live in poverty.' British holidaymaker Ken Emery, 76, told the Sun of his 'amazement' when he saw the EU had such luxurious office space so far from their own borders. He said: 'We don’t need unelected European mandarins trying to set up their own diplomatic corps and spreading their tentacles around the globe using our money. 'It smacks of empire building by those determined to push a federal European superstate.'","UKIP leader Nigel Farage criticises 'luxury' office as money wasting .

"Real Madrid could face the same transfer ban imposed on Barcelona after FIFA opened an investigation into their signing of under age players. The club will on Monday present Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva just three days after making a huge financial commitment to sign 16-year-old Martin Odegaard. And, according to AS, the suspicion in Spain is that the club are preparing for the worst after FIFA's merciless exclusion of Barcelona from the transfer market for the next 12 months - scuppering any potential Real move for Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. Real Madrid's new teenage signing Martin Odegaard was presented at Valdebebas training ground last week . Lucas Silva could be the last signing Real Madrid make in a while as FIFA investigate their transfer activity . Silva arrives at Barajas airport before his official unveiling as a new Real Madrid player . The investigation into Madrid focuses on two 12-year-olds brought from Venezuela in 2012. Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach River Plate and Milan, Madrid snapped them up via an intermediary who has a soccer school in the Spanish capital. The first was signed by Madrid in 2012 and the second of the two players signed aged 14 in 2013. He is currently in the youth system of Rayo Vallecano. Gareth Bale sealed three points and a 2-1 win for Real Madrid at Cordoba on Saturday . The victory kept Madrid one point in front of Barcelona at the top of the Primera Liga . Madrid have a month to file all relevant paperwork to FIFA and demonstrate they have not contravened the governing body’s Article 14, which only allows the signing of Under 18s from outside the EU if the player’s parents have had to move to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons. The rule is in place to prevent clubs relocating families from non-EU countries in order to sign a young player. In a statement released by the club on Monday evening, Real Madrid added context and clarified the reports and their position on the issue that has seen Barcelona handed a two-window transfer ban as a result. The ban could scupper Madrid's reported transfer bid for Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . Luis Suarez signed for Barcelona while the club were appealing the transfer ban handed out by FIFA . Barcelona appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport when they were hit by the transfer embargo for breaching rules on signing young players but the FIFA sanction was upheld and they will not be able to sign any players in 2015. They were also fined 450,000 Swiss Francs (£293,000). The players concerned were registered and turned out between 2009 and 2013. While the appeal was pending, Barcelona signed Luis Suarez from Liverpool. Real remain top of the table, one point better off than Barcelona with a game in hand, after Gareth Bale's late penalty sealed a 2-1 win over Cordoba on Saturday. In view of the reports that have appeared in some sections of the media concerning the request for information that FIFA has carried out in recent months with different Spanish clubs in order to verify that the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP, Ed. 2009) on the first registration and international transfer of foreign minors have been adhered to, Real Madrid would like to outline the following. 1. Real Madrid defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence, without exceptions, to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end. 2. Real Madrid have responded diligently, supplying all the information required by the Committee within the established deadlines and in complete documentary detail. Both Real Madrid and the RFEF, through which the informative investigation is being processed, have been left totally satisfied with the information supplied and have verified the strict adherence to the registration regulations in absolutely every case. 3. For the purpose of clarifying to the full the contents of the informative investigation, this club would like to highlight that the information required by FIFA refers to 51 players, of which: . – 1 player appeared twice on the list. – 10 players had Spanish nationality at the time they were registered, for which reason they are exempt, as the regulations in question deal exclusively with foreign players under 18. – 6 players were 18 or over at the time of their registration, for which reason they are also excluded for the reasons outlined in the previous section and, in addition, because they had obtained the mandatory FIFA authorisation (ITC, International Transfer Certificate). – 2 players under 18 were registered after the obtaining of the mandatory authorisation from the Sub-committee to FIFA’s Players’ Status Committee . – 2 players were registered prior to the RSTP Ed. 2009 coming into effect, without prejudice to the consideration that, being sons of an ex-Real Madrid first-team player, they fulfilled the exceptions subsequently contained in article 19. – 23 players (24, if the player who appears in duplicate in the information request is taken into account) were registered in second or subsequent registrations as they came from other RFEF member clubs, for which reason they are also exempt as these were not international transfers or first registrations. – 2 players have never belonged to Real Madrid as they were rejected by the club because it considered in its reasonable judgement that their registration contravened the provisions of article 19 of the RSTP, Ed. 2009. Real Madrid regrets and profoundly rejects that the identity of these minors was revealed today by any section of the media, with no responsibility attributable to the club concerning this. – 1 is not recorded as being registered at the club, given that the Sub-committee rejected his registration and the case is pending a final resolution in the CAS. It should be underlined that whatever the final resolution, Real Madrid has complied conscientiously with the regulations, having requested this registration via the legal channels without the player having been registered for the time being. – And, finally, 4 players under the age of 12 were registered via first registration in compliance with both the regulations of the RFEF and the regulations of FIFA, in accordance with the exceptions contained in article 19 of the RSTP, Ed. 2009. 4. Additionally, and for the purpose of clarification, Real Madrid communicates that it has passed on to FIFA all the Collaboration Agreements signed with amateur clubs, whose only aim is to avoid the abuse of its position of superiority over these clubs via the search for balanced agreements with absolute respect for the rights of the players, and fair and equitable compensation for the club that has trained the player, working as a mechanism of solidarity in recognition of this work. As FIFA are already aware, these agreements, 40 in total, have in no case been used to contravene any regulations. 5. All the above shows the extraordinary diligence that Real Madrid has maintained at all times in the transfer and registration of foreign minors, and the unfounded and purely speculative nature of certain reports published on the matter.","The investigation focuses on the signings of two youngsters in 2012 .

"I'm very glad and grateful to be the No 1 seed at Wimbledon this year. I always try to perform at my best here. It was the tournament I always dreamed of winning and in 2011 my dream came true: I won Wimbledon and became No1 in the world in just a matter of days. Hopefully I can go for a second title this year. The highlight of my career is that 2011 Wimbledon final. I went back home and celebrated with my people and I will never forget it. They are memories that will be ingrained in my heart forever. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail meeting Novak Djokovic ahead of Wimbledon . Leading the pack: Novak Djokovic, last year's runner-up, will return to Wimbledon as the top seed . After the French Open I went to Ibiza, took five or six days of complete rest and spent some time with my friends and family as I tried to recover from a difficult emotional loss in the final against Rafael Nadal. That’s sport, though. It’s not the first match I’ve lost in my career so I got over it and now I’m ready to focus on Wimbledon. Some players like to take part in tournaments to adjust to the transition from clay to grass but I didn’t plan to play any tournaments on grass courts prior to Wimbledon. Then, because of the fact I spent so much energy - both physical and mental - at Roland Garros, I just felt like I needed more time to rest and recharge my batteries. I’ve spent the last week in London, practising on the grass to get ready for the most prestigious tournament in our sport. I love this city because of the access to nature and the great parks. On the ball: Djokovic's batteries are recharged after a break in Ibiza following the French Open . Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park are walking distance from the house we rent for The Championships and suddenly you’re there, seeing nature. I even saw deer the other day. I couldn’t believe it: a wild safari and yet so close to town. London’s a very international city and the more I come back, the more I like it. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll live here! I drive a sports car right now but I think I’m going to have to give it up in a couple of months because I’m going to become a father. My days of driving two-seater cars are over although I rarely get to drive it because I’m travelling all the time. Between matches at Wimbledon I eat a lot of carbohydrates: pasta, rice, potatoes and vegetables and maybe some kind of protein, like fish, chicken or turkey. It’s nothing spectacular. I just keep it simple to avoid any problems with digestion. Big year: Djokovic (left) pictured with fiancee Jelena Ristic at a dinner for his foundation in London last year . SINCE World War Two, 10 players have won the men’s singles title after losing the final the year before. Ashley Cooper – lost 1957/won 58 . Rod Laver – 1960/61 . John Newcombe – 1969/70 . Stan Smith – 1971/72 . John McEnroe – 1980/81, 1982/83 . Boris Becker – 1988/89 . Stefan Edberg – 1989/90 . Rafael Nadal – 2007/08 . Roger Federer – 2008/09 . Andy Murray – 2012/2013 . I like being in the kitchen, but I like to be the consumer rather than the cook. My parents still have a restaurant in the mountains back in Serbia, which the family has had for 20 years. We serve mainly Italian food and I spent a lot of time in the restaurant so I know how to prepare the most basic things, but if I see there is somebody who has more expertise then I leave it to them. The beauty of Wimbledon is you have so many houses around the All England Club for the players to use. I’m staying in a house with my fiancee Jelena and the rest of my team. We have a chef and fresh, organic food every day, which is great. I’ve stayed in the same house for the past five years but we’ve changed this time. When we have free time we’ll take a walk. I also like listening to Serbian music, and songs from the 1980s and 1990s. I’m a bit old school when it comes to that. But before a match I listen to DJs’ remixes of commercial sounds to get the adrenaline flowing. On the court: Djokovic speaks with his coach Boris Becker (left) as they prepare for Wimbledon . Over the years you gain the experience to deal with the stress of playing, particularly at Wimbledon. After all, it’s the most important tournament we have and the pinnacle of the sport. As the tournament progresses and the matches get tougher the tension rises and you feel that. Mentally, it drains you. You have to conserve energy off the court and be around people that you care about and make you feel relaxed. It’s very important when you’re in the middle of a Grand Slam. I practise yoga, although not every day. Each day I do certain types of breathing exercises to help me relax and focus. The matches at Wimbledon are so important that you can easily get carried away, so you have to constantly work on yourself and try to get yourself in the best positive shape, physically and mentally. New wheels: Djokovic pictured with the new Peugeot 508 at a launch in London last week . I like the tradition of Wimbledon and England in general; the way culture and history is nurtured. Not many countries have succeeded in maintaining that sense of tradition. You feel it here the most. We still have to wear all-white on the court and it gives Wimbledon that special sensation and flavour of being the oldest tournament we have.

"In many ways the current Government has been highly successful. It has begun the long process of restoring sound money, made major reforms to a number of public services and managed to begin restructuring the bloated Welfare Bill. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the opinion polls. Between them, the (small ‘c’) conservative parties have nearly 50 per cent, while the two major forces of the Left are on 42.5 per cent. Scroll down for video . Give Clegg's job to Nigel Farage: Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured) comes out fighting in today's Mail on Sunday . About two-thirds of Ukip supporters are former Conservatives. Thus the split in the Tory family – demonstrated by Douglas Carswell’s defection last month – makes it difficult for the Coalition to win an Election, potentially paving the way for Ed Miliband to win despite having little more than one-third of the vote. The obvious answer is for the Tories and Ukip to do a pre-Election deal. In a first-past-the-post system there is no prospect of doing a post-Election pact; each party takes too many of its voters from the same pool so there would not be enough combined MPs to form a coalition. Now there are obstacles in the way of a pre-Election pact, but these are more emotional than rational. It is said that the two leaders do not like each other, but Coalition has shown that Ministers from separate parties can work effectively with each other, and there is no obvious personal animosity between David Cameron and Nick Clegg or George Osborne and Danny Alexander. It is in the nature of politics that leaders attack each other, but that ought not unduly to upset a thick-skinned statesman. Bombshell: The defection of Clacton MP Douglas Carswell (right) has sent ripples through Westminster Tories . Despite being held back by Coalition, the Prime Minister has still delivered some important Eurosceptic gains. He vetoed the fiscal compact, voted against Mr Juncker, managed to cut the EU budget and enshrined in law a referendum lock on future treaties. Against this he is idiosyncratically supporting the European Arrest Warrant, which is a notable aspect of the creation of a federal Europe. Nonetheless, this leaves the balance in his favour even if he seems sometimes to have responded to pressure. Battling the EU: Cameron is at loggerheads with Europhiles such as Germany's Angela Merkel . What is certain is that his promise of an in/out referendum if returned in 2015 is sincere and can only happen if he wins. This means that Ukip can achieve its main policy objective only if the Tories win the Election – yet it is the principal obstacle to this happening. Sheer bloody mindedness is stopping the conservative family from dominating the UK political scene to achieve what all of us want. Regrettably, the Clacton by-election will make it worse, as positions become more entrenched. Therefore, some people have started suggesting that nothing can be done until after an Election at which point there will be some re-alignment of the Right. This seems a defeatist view. David Cameron has the opportunity to solve the problem now if he is generous. The undoubted talents and charisma of Nigel Farage should be recognised. He appeals to not only traditional Conservative members but also to those who have felt disenfranchised, people who feel that politicians are part of a too-cosy establishment while Ukip is shaking it up. In some respects he appeals in a way that Boris Johnson does to those with Conservative values who are not necessarily Tory. Prior to the Election such an offer needs to help Ukip in its ambition to win parliamentary seats. This could start with the House of Lords where, in spite of its recent electoral success, no new Ukip peer has been created. It needs to be followed by deals in individual seats. There are a number vacant because of retirement, which may be suitable, as well as the ones where the Conservatives cannot expect to win and where Ukip is making inroads against Labour. After the Election, if this strategy were adopted, there would be four Cabinet posts available through the removal of the Liberal Democrats. Universal appeal: London mayor Boris Johnson appears to have a lure for those who have never voted Tory . Nigel Farage would be a much preferable Deputy Prime Minister to any true Conservative than Nick Clegg, while replacing Vince Cable with someone from Ukip would have a pleasant irony. Perhaps as a sign of good faith even the Minister for Europe could be a Ukip MP. Charisma: Nigel Farage has undoubtable talents, writes Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg today . If the Prime Minister were to do this he would suddenly have taken charge of events, no longer could his critics say – as Sir Walter Raleigh said of Elizabeth I – that he ‘did it all by halves’. He would have gone further than he needed to go, rather than leaving the impression of being pushed unwillingly into something, and it would provide the launch pad for a General Election. In the current atmosphere where politicians are so distrusted, it would act as a guarantee of how a future Conservative Government would be run because it would be beholden to a second party. The promise of a referendum would clearly be of an unbreakable nature in coalition with Ukip, while the tone of the EU renegotiation would be considerably stronger. It would have to be taken more seriously within the EU if a party that wanted to leave were in the Government. It would also be a recognition that all political parties are coalitions covering a range of views. Historically, one of the strengths of the Tory Party has been its ability to stretch from Rab Butler to Enoch Powell in so civilized a way that Powell supported Butler’s leadership ambitions. Narrowing the base with a third of potential supporters in another similar party is a sure way to defeat. Generosity, courage and sense pave the path to victory. Sadly, I doubt this will be done in time, so I am looking forward to some fair weather in Clacton for a spot of canvassing against a respected erstwhile colleague. It is the district in which my wife grew up, so it could be something of a family outing to join fellow Conservatives opposing someone with whom they agree on most policy issues.","Stark warning issued in this article published in today's Mail on Sunday .

Will Reeve, 22, is joined by comedian Reese Waters and social media correspondent Sarina Morales. The trio have been tasked with carrying out special reports that will help the show tap into a younger demographic than it presently does. Scroll down for video . Will Reeve, right, the 22-year-old son of Christopher Reeve is one of three new on-air reporters joining ESPN's SportsCenter team as the show looks to increase its appeal with millennials . 'I'll be different from a traditional SportsCenter reporter because I won't be behind a desk in a suit,' said Reeve, who bears more than a passing resemble to his famous father, told TheWrap. 'These stories are not going to appear on air and then fade off — they are going to get an extended life digitally and on social media.' Will was just a toddler when his actor father Christopher became paralyzed in a riding accident in 1995. He grew up helping his mother, Dana, care for him. Christopher became a dedicated campaigner after he was paralyzed in a horse riding incident in 1995. With his wife Dana by his side, the star raised millions of dollars, investing heavily in stem cell research. Sadly, almost 10 years after his accident, Christopher found himself constantly battling infections, and after a reaction to an antibiotic, suffered a heart attack before slipping into a coma. Will was just a toddler when his actor father Christopher became paralyzed in a riding accident in 1995. He continues to keep his father's charity work going via the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation . He later suffered another cardiac arrest, passing away on October 10, 2004, when Will was just 11 years old. A few months of his father's death, Will lost his maternal grandmother, Helen Morisini, who died of complications following cancer surgery at the age of 71. And 17 months after losing his father Will's mother, Dana, who had won worldwide admiration for her devotion to her husband through his decade of near-total paralysis, died of lung cancer at the age of 44. The singer-actress, who cut short her career to care for her husband, was a non-smoker. Will, who was 13 when Dana died, was raised by family friends after his mother's death. He said he is confident both of his parents would be extremely proud about his new job. 'Hopefully they would get a kick out it,' he said. 'The things I am interested in and passionate about are similar to what they were. My parents definitely define who I am. Courtesy The Reeve Foundation . Reeve, 22, is joined by comedian Reese Waters and social media correspondent Sarina Morales . 'My dad and I had a huge bond and shared a love of sports. I hope they would be proud and say, ""Great job,"" no matter what. Then my dad would probably tell me to straighten my tie!' he laughed. As a youngster Reeve had dreams of becoming a professional athlete or an actor like his father until internships at ABC and 'Good Morning America'. Since graduating from Vermont's Middlebury College he has been working at ESPN on various writing and reporting gigs. 'ESPN was like a member of the family because it was always on,' he said. 'It is not only a dream job, it is my dream job … I just hope I don't screw it up! I don't want my dream to be taken away from me.' Together with his older half siblings - Matthew and Alexandra - he also keeps his father's charity work going via the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. Matthew and Alexandra are Christopher's children from his long-term relationship with Gae Exton and were 25 and 21 respectively when their father died.

"Handoko Njotokusuma’s pet dogs are a pair of real ruff riders. His beloved golden retrievers – Ace and Armani – cruise through Surabaya, Indonesia, while perched on the handlebars or the pillion of his motorised scooter. Wearing helmets and red- or green-framed sunglasses, the dogs and their owner have become local celebrities – drawing curious stares and stunned looks from passers-by. Handoko Njotokusuma has trained his pet golden retrievers to ride on his motorised scooter . The dogs, Ace and Armani, ride through Surabaya, Indonesia, while perched on the handlebars or pillion . Handoko’s four-legged companions sandwich him on the bike as they cruise through the streets of Indonesia’s second-largest city. They attract plenty of attention and often stop to pose for photos with onlookers. Ace and Armani – two of Handoko’s four dogs – have been riding since they were just a few months old and now at the age of three they jump onto the scooter whenever they think their owner is heading out. The 59-year-old businessman takes the two pooches for 30-minute journeys around the city. He said: ‘When they were four months old I taught them to sit on the front of my motorbike. And then at eight months they started to learn to sit on the back seat. Ace and Armani – two of Handoko’s four dogs – have been riding since they were just a few months old .

Handoko said: ‘Armani is the one who can only sit on the back but Ace can sit on both the front and the back. ‘I think it is because I was late to teach Armani how to sit on the motorbike. When I taught them, I taught them one by one. ‘After they learned how to sit I took them both at the same time.’ Due to their talents Handoko has received a number of expensive offers for his pet dogs, but he insists he will never sell them. He said: ‘For me, they are my children. I love them so much, just as much as I love my wife and my biological children. ‘There are some people that come to me to ask whether I can sell the dogs.

"Tasered: Ryan Colclough, a winger with Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra, taunted officers sent to arrest him after he allegedly attacked a bouncer . Police tasered a young League One football ace who bellowed 'You won't get me now!' at them after climbing a tree in a drunken bid to escape arrest. Ryan Colclough, a winger with Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra, taunted officers sent to arrest him after he allegedly attacked a bouncer during a night out in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. But the 20-year-old League One player's bravado came to an abrupt end. Police tasered him after he leapt down from the tree, then pepper sprayed him when he continued to resist arrest. This morning he escaped a jail sentence despite admitting resisting two police officers in an earlier hearing and having a previous conviction for violence. Magistrates were told police wanted to detain the 20 year-old father in connection with an alleged attack that took place during a night out. Colclough had been due to stand trial accused of assaulting bouncer Adrian Chell by beating, but the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence. Prosecutor Sue Hayers told North Staffordshire magistrates police also had to use a PAVA spray during the struggle to incapacitate Colclough, who was 19 at the time. She said: 'Police were set to arrest Colclough in connection with an alleged assault. He made off from officers who attempted to detain him. 'The defendant climbed a tree and was heard shouting ""you won’t get me now"". 'After coming down, he entered a compound. The defendant was described as hunching his shoulders and clenching his fists. 'Police used their taser and he went to the floor. He struggled and did not allow his wrist to be handcuffed.' Colclough, of Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent, was ordered to pay a fines and costs totalling £580 following the incident on November 23. Simon Dykes, defending, said his client committed the offence during a 'difficult period' in his career when he was not playing due to injury. 'These are actions he regrets. This isn’t the normal way which he would behave,' Mr Dykes told the court. 'He had been drinking and it had an effect on him. He was out in Burslem with friends. He was drunk on the occasion and it wasn’t an excuse but we need to put his behaviour in context. 'He was clearly fearful of what would happen if he was arrested. 'He is a professional footballer for Crewe Alexandra and he did not want to have to explain his actions. 'He realises it could jeopardise what he hopes to be a long and successful career. 'He had suffered a stomach injury and had to have an operation. He was injured for months and unable to play. He had a lot more time on his hands than normal. 'He normally has a quiet life. He has a partner and child and he takes his profession very seriously. 'It is fortunate his club remain supportive of him and although they aren’t happy about the fact he has appeared before the court, they continue to assist him to make sure nothing like this happens again.'

Court: Colclough escaped jail despite admitting resisting police at an earlier hearing and having a previous conviction for violence. Charges relating to his alleged assault were dismissed due to lack of evidence . Mr Dykes told the court Colclough had been involved in another incident where he received a community order. He added: 'He has completed all the hours of unpaid work in relation to that matter and has taken anger management courses. 'This has been a difficult experience for Mr Colclough and one he wishes to put behind him. 'He knows how close he could come to losing everything if he behaves like this again. He does realise he is in a privileged position.' Chairman of the bench Sue Corfield told Colclough: 'This is the second similar offence within 12 months. You could put your career in jeopardy if you keep appearing in court. 'You are to continue with the community order especially anger management.' Today Crewe Alexandra refused to comment on the matter.","Crewe Alexandra ace Ryan Colclough fled police after an alleged assault .

"John Carver has told Newcastle’s hierarchy they will have no chance of finishing in the top half of the Premier League if they sell Moussa Sissoko. United have insisted it would take an ‘exceptional’ bid for them to consider letting the France midfielder leave the club this month. But fans fear they are courting such an offer from the likes of Arsenal or PSG, to whom they sold Yohan Cabaye for £20million 12 months ago. Moussa Sissoko joined Newcastle from Ligue 1 side Toulouse in 2013, but has now hinted he wants to leave . Sissoko has twice given interviews in his homeland in recent weeks in which he speaks of his respect for both of those clubs, and it is thought the player who cost the Magpies just £1.5m from Toulouse two years ago will move on, be it now or in the summer. It was confirmed earlier this week that Carver will remain in caretaker charge until the end of the season, and he was immediately handed the remit of returning a top-10 finish. The 50-year-old, however, has made it clear to managing director Lee Charnley that losing star player Sissoko would all but extinguish those hopes. Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver is to stay in charge of the Magpies until end of season . Newcastle are currently 11th in the table but have lost five of their last seven and are still searching for a first win under Carver, who could land the role on a permanent basis if he impresses and No.1 target Steve McClaren decides to stay with Derby. But many supporters believe the club have written off the remainder of this campaign and are threatening to cancel their season-ticket direct debit for next year before tomorrow’s deadline. Carver, though, has rejected the claim that this term is as good as over. 'Everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but I am not going to allow that to happen,’ he said. The French international is reportedly attracting interest from Paris St Germain . 'Those who are saying that don't know me, don't know the people around me and don't know this group of players. 'We're much more professional than that. We can't afford to let the season drift away and I won't allow it to happen. 'I'm too demanding and I won't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of May.' Newcastle have reacted to supporter concern by announcing yesterday that season-ticket prices will be frozen this summer. But the club also warned that tickets for higher-category games – such as the Tyne-Wear derby and matches against the top four – would be restricted for members only. Top scorer Papiss Cisse could return for Newcastle at Hull after Senegal went out of the Africa Cup of Nations . Meanwhile, Carver has confirmed that Dave Watson – former Everton defender and FA Cup-winning captain – has been promoted to his backroom staff, but will also continue as Under-18 coach. Watson will be in the dugout when Newcastle travel to Hull City for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. So, too, could Papiss Cisse. United’s nine-goal top scorer has been eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and is due back on Tyneside this week.","Moussa Sissoko cost Newcastle £1.5million from Toulouse in 2013 .

"Swansea City are considering a move for Blackburn striker Rudy Gestede. The 26-year-old Benin international is valued at £6m by the Championship side and so far no club has matched their valuation. Palace had a £3.5m offer rejected over a week ago. Swansea target Rudy Gestede scores the winning goal for Blackburn in FA Cup clash . Blackburn Rovers came from behind to beat nine-man Swansea City 3-1 in their FA Cup fourth round clash . Manager Gary Bowyer admitted Gestede could leave after beating the Welsh club in the FA Cup. ‘It would be a huge blow, of course it would,’ he said. ‘Personally, we have to try and keep all our players in this window. But if they were to go I’m sensible enough. I’ve been brought up the right way to not throw my toys out of the pram and get on with it. ‘That is all I can do. If they were to get sold I would go out and find the next one. ‘Gareth Bale went to Real Madrid, Ronaldo goes to Real Madrid. Eventually it seems to happen to every player these days. All you do is dust yourself down, wish them all the best and crack on. ‘I would obviously put my opinion forward but at the end of the day the owners of the club are there to make the financial decisions. Gestede helped Blackburn reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, but may not be at the club to play that game .

"Amelie Mauresmo could be found the other night sitting on the floor outside the men’s locker room waiting for her player to emerge after his Australian Open fourth-round win. Of all the uncertainties and backstage undercurrents surrounding Andy Murray’s semi-final against Tomas Berdych on Thursday morning, one thing is for sure: his coach will not gain access to the inner sanctum to offer advice. While Dani Vallverdu’s presence in Berdych’s box gives this encounter a fascinating dynamic, it should not be overlooked how important the match is for Mauresmo — still in some senses the outsider. Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo have a chat during their practice session on Wednesday . Andy Murray celebrates after setting up a last four clash with in-form Tomas Berdych in Melbourne . A win for Murray and a return to a Grand Slam final will silence many doubters, who question whether he made the right decision to hire her as Ivan Lendl’s long-term replacement. Defeat, though, will leave the Mauresmo appointment open to debate, and it will be all the more galling to have had the long-term ally he split with sitting in the opposition box. Murray is aware of all this and has become protective of his coach, going out of his way to sing her praises after a run when he has looked much more his old self. Andy Murray works on his serve under the watchful eye of his coach Amelie Mauresmo . He is also persisting — to the puzzlement of Vallverdu — with his line that everyone in his slimmed-down team is now working together. ‘When everyone is pulling in the same direction, then things are going to improve,’ he said. ‘I feel like I made some big improvements to my game and physically in the off-season, and I think that has showed so far in this event. ‘I enjoy working with Amelie. She’s fantastic. She gets on very well with my team, too. She has a good personality to coach and a lot of experience, so I’m happy with the way it’s working. I’ve got some things to look forward to later in the year with Kim (his fiancee), and when you’re content with things and happy in the people you’re surrounding yourself with, that’s a positive.’ Murray training on the Margaret Court Arena ahead of his match with Tomas Berdych on Thursday morning . Murray is set to come up against his long-term friend Dani Vallverdu, who now coaches Berdych . He felt the need for change late last season, especially after the drubbing he took at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the hands of Roger Federer. ‘Clearly the way things ended at the O2 wasn’t the best way to end it. Maybe there were some reasons for that. I think things right now are much smoother and calmer, and everyone’s a lot less stressed than was the case at the end of last year.’ It must be said that his excellent results, bar Federer, in the post-US Open period do not talk of a team held back by disharmony. There is the sense that Murray is using his loyalty to his coach, and the conflict-by-proxy with his old friend Vallverdu, as motivational fodder. While Mauresmo was keeping her counsel, Vallverdu talked publicly on Wednesday in a way that he was never allowed to do when working with the 27-year-old Scot. The Venezuelan is now his own man, but still knows better than to wind up Murray. The Scot was in fine form to defeat Australian hope Nick Kyrgios in straight sets in the quarter-finals . ‘Last year he might not have been as fit,’ said Vallverdu. ‘He went through back surgery. It’s normal that it takes time to get back to where you were before. ‘I don’t see it as any different to where he was two or three years ago. I think he’s at the same level when he was winning Slams and I’m happy for him.’ He does not recognise the issue Murray raised about not pulling together, and added: ‘To be honest, I don’t know what he means, at least from my side.’ What he and Murray do agree on is that Vallverdu’s inside knowledge is not going to be the defining factor in this semi-final. ‘I don’t think so,’ said Vallverdu. ‘They know each other’s games very well. I don’t think I am the advantage. Andy and Tomas are the ones playing against each other. If at the start of the tournament you’d asked Tomas or Andy if they’d like to be in this situation, they would have said yes.’ The other semi-final sees a re-match of last year’s classic quarter-final between Stan Wawrinka and world No 1 Novak Djokovic. On that occasion Wawrinka won 9-7 in the fifth and went on to claim the title.","Andy Murray faces Tomas Berdych in Australian Open semis on Thursday .

"Whisky drink advert starring David Beckham is cleared of encouraging underage drinking after the star agreed to front the stylish TV advertising campaign. Campaigners at Alcohol Concern argued that the former footballer in the Haig Club Whisky advert would appeal to youngsters and make drinking alcohol appear essential to social success. They pointed out that Beckham has traded heavily on his appeal to children, not least by supporting the Sainsbury’s Active Kids campaign to boost participation in sport. David Beckham, pictured, has been cleared by the  Advertising Standards Authority of encouraging underage drinking after he starred in an advert for Haig Club Whisky as he is no longer a role model to children . Beckham starred in the stylish advert for Haig Club which was directed by Guy Richie . Consequently, they argued that his association with the drinks brand, which is owned by drinks giant Diageo, sent the wrong message to youngsters that drinking was cool and sexy. However, advertising watchdogs have rejected the complaint after deciding Beckham could no longer be viewed as a role model or hero for the nation’s children . The father of four’s decision to appear in the Haig Club commercial was the first time he has promoted alcohol and he claims it reflected his own change in tastes as he got older. The expensive commercial was directed by Guy Ritchie, who previously directed the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Robert Downey Jnr, and played heavily on the theme of Beckham as a style icon. He was seen as an action man in leathers riding a motorcycle through a spectacular and craggy Scottish landscape before meeting up with friends carrying a bottle of Haig Club. Then, wearing a green velour suit jacket with a black bow tie, he was seen pouring the drink into tumblers before the group was shown posing for photographs. The ad ended with a shot of the product and the caption ‘Haig Club single grain scotch whisky. Welcome.’ Alcohol Concern complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), highlighting concerns that David Beckham was promoting any form of alcoholic drink. They said the commercial, seen on TV and on websites, implied that drinking was a key component of social success or acceptance, and that refusal was a sign of weakness. And they also argued the commercial broke industry rules by implying drinking was a key component to the success of a personal relationship or social event. Anti-alcohol campaigners argued that Beckham promoting the whisky implied that alcohol was a key component or social success or acceptance . The group pointed out Beckham’s partnership with the Sainsbury’s Active Kids campaign, which he is no longer associated with, plus his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and the fact he won a Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Sports 'Legend' award earlier this year. However, the ASA rejected the complaint, saying in its view Beckham had not played for a British team for more than ten years and therefore had no special appeal to children. The watchdog said: ‘We noted that he had not played for a UK club in the last decade and was therefore unlikely to have particular resonance for children on the basis of his sporting career alone, or have strong appeal on that basis.’ That decision has been slammed by Alcohol Concern, whose deputy chief executive, Emily Robinson, said: ‘Given his other roles promoting sport and the importance of a healthy lifestyle, we think the public will be amazed to hear the ASA doesn’t think David Beckham is a role model for children. ‘How can we take the ASA seriously when they deem that a global icon doesn’t appeal to young people and that having one of the most famous people in the world in a whisky advert is not linking the promotion of alcohol with social success?’ She added: ‘This ruling shows why we need tighter restrictions on advertising regulations to ensure children and young people have far greater protection from alcohol advertising.’ At the time the commercial was made, Beckham explained his involvement, saying: ‘The House of Haig has a rich history and I’m proud to be working at the heart of a home-grown brand which has built an incredible heritage over 400 years. 'Working closely with Diageo, we look forward to collaborating on Haig Club, valuing and treasuring the Haig traditions while reinventing this whisky for years to come.' He added: 'I am starting to enjoy whisky and have done for the last few years. This is a natural movement - but there has had to be a movement.' Diageo defended the advertisement and campaign on the basis that the footballer was no longer a hero to children in this country. Rather, the firm said it had chosen Beckham because he had a strong appeal to its target group of men aged 25-40. The ASA said: ‘They stated that his appeal was predominantly to those in this age range and that he did not have strong appeal to children and was not a person whose example children are likely to follow. ‘Diageo stated that Beckham was primarily known for his role as a former professional footballer and that he had limited resonance with young people in the UK, particularly in comparison with current players and other cultural youth icons. They noted that he had not played in the Premier League for over 10 years, retired from professional football in 2013 and had only lived in the UK for two of the last 11 years.’ They provided a list of Beckham's commercial partnerships, including Breitling watches, Belstaff, Jaguar and Las Vegas Sands, as evidence of his appeal to adults rather than children.","David Beckham is starring in lifestyle advert for Haig Whisky .

"While it is not correct to pre-judge a player you are about to referee, it is essential to prepare.

I would make sure that John Terry, as his captain, was present. Costa is a gifted player but feels hard done by. Referee Michael Oliver talks to Chelsea striker Diego Costa during Tuesday night's Capital One Cup tie . Costa doesn't trust referees and there needs to be a mutual respect established between him and officials . He believes he has not had the rub of the green from referees when he has been fouled in the penalty area but booked for diving instead. Because of this, he feels the need to protect himself — that is why he squares up to people. He will not back down in a stand-off and he reminds me of Roy Keane — a player I refereed more than 50 times. While I cautioned Roy numerous times, I never sent him off. We established mutual respect and he trusted me to deal with him fairly. This is what Costa needs now.

"Most dogs would be happy with long walks, a cosy basket and a steady supply of Bonios but that's not enough for spoiled pug, Mr Darcy. Instead, the pampered pooch enjoys a luxury lifestyle and feasts on steak, organic chicken and salmon, and boasts a wardrobe of designer clothes. And come Christmas Day, the pet, who loves to snack on Victoria sponge cake, will find a specially-knitted Nordic woolly jumper in his stocking. Luxury: Pampered pug Mr Darcy feasts on steak suppers and enjoys snacking on Victoria sponge cake . The indulged canine even has his own version of a personal gym and is allowed to sleep in his mistress' queen size bed. But owner Julia Ashton, 48, from Kilmarnock in Ayrshire, says he's not spoiled - she only gives him the luxurious lifestyle that pugs expect. 'I suppose some people might have the perception he's a bit spoiled, but I guess all dog owners spoil their pets to some degree,' Julia explains. 'I love my pets and I like to make sure they're looked after to a high standard. And it has to be said, pugs are a breed that love their luxury!'Julia has several dogs, but confesses show dog Mr Darcy is her pride and joy. She takes her prized pooch to shows up and down the country, meaning he has to eat, exercise and sleep well and get lots of pampering to ensure he's in tip top condition. 'He eats steak and organic chicken and salmon - in fact he probably has a better diet than me,' she laughs. 'And he loves Victoria sponge cake and cinnamon sticks too - but only gets these as a treat.' Tucking in: The pug, pictured with owner Julia Ashton, also travels first class and boasts a wardrobe of clothes . Champion: When not feasting on steak, Mr Darcy travels with Julia to shows all over the country . Indulgent: Julia, who runs a doggy B&B, says that pugs expect to be given a life of luxury . Mr Darcy goes to the groomers each week and has a whole host of jackets and jumpers to keep him warm during walks in the winter. And he likes to work out at home, using his treadmill and agility course. 'Pugs hate the cold and wet, so he has plenty of outfits to keep him cosy,' adds Julia. 'And he loves exercise so gets plenty of use of his agility course at home and treadmill. 'It's not a substitute for walks because he gets plenty of those. It's more to work on building up his muscles which is important for the shows.' Julia has been an pug breeder for five years and admits she's 'completely hooked' on the adorable breed. 'Pugs are charming, adorable, intelligent and affectionate creatures - and make fantastic companions,' she reveals. 'And they're so cute they seem to get away with murder - well, mine do most of the time! But I always ensure there's a balance with discipline.' Julia, who runs pet holiday retreat Bed and Biscuits and is set to launch Barkers and Bones selling clothing for smaller dogs, added: 'Mr Darcy is certainly up there with the most pampered pets in Scotland. 'He gets plenty of steak, plenty of exercise, plenty of attention - what more could a dog ask for? I've had dogs all my life. I grew up with a menagerie of animals, from rabbits and ponies to cats, chickens and guinea pigs. 'So I'm very used to having pets around and knowing how they like to be treated. People sometimes laugh at the life of luxury Mr Darcy has but having a dog is a serious matter. 'You need to be there to look after them round the clock and be prepared for the expense a pet brings - and be careful when buying one. 'There is a huge amount of back street puppy breeders who are looking to make a buck. The best and safest way is through a breed club or the Kennel Club. 'Buying from someone who does not care or understand their breed can be a minefield of heartbreak.'","Pug Mr Darcy enjoys steak feasts and has a wardrobe of designer clothes .

They were rewarded with a home tie against the winners of Sunderland and Fulham's replay but TV chiefs at the BBC and BT Sport have chosen not to screen their fifth-round game. Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Petr Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . Yeates celebrates scoring the winning goal as his Bradford team-mates enjoy the moment . West Brom vs West Ham . Crystal Palace vs Liverpool or Bolton . Aston Villa vs Leicester . Arsenal vs Middlesbrough . Preston or Sheffield United vs Cambridge or Manchester United . The club’s official Twitter feed simply posted ‘#nomagic’, while Bradford joint-chairman Mark Lawn said: ‘BBC and BT Sport have let themselves down with this. They’ve really shot themselves in the foot. We’ve scored the most goals of any club in the FA Cup this season, we’ve just pulled off the biggest shock in history and they don’t come and get us. It’s absolutely ridiculous. ‘I’ve had calls from everywhere since we beat Chelsea. I was talking to Radio Ulster in Northern Ireland and to Radio Cumbria — everyone wants to know about what we’ve achieved. ‘The whole world is looking at us at the moment and the TV broadcasters don’t put us on. You’ve got to wonder if the people who decide these things actually know about football.’ Instead, the West Bromwich v West Ham tie, Crystal Palace v Liverpool or Bolton, Aston Villa v Leicester, Arsenal v Middlesbrough and Preston or Sheffield United v Cambridge or Manchester United will be shown live from February 14-16. Lawn added: ‘Who picks these games? West Brom v West Ham, is that really what the FA Cup is all about? They all promote the FA Cup’s magic and romance, but where’s the magic gone now? How can they justify it? It’s a disgrace.’ Bantams joint-chairman Mark Lawn has blasted the television snub, calling it absolutely ridiculous .

He said the club felt further aggrieved over losing the windfall they would have received through television revenue. ‘That goes to the Premier League clubs, because they really need the money, don’t they?’ he added, sarcastically. The BBC said they had considered the draw carefully before choosing the fixtures to show live and hope to present Football Focus from Valley Parade. A BBC spokesman said: ‘TV match selections have to be decided before the outcome of replays and for that reason we have selected what we believe to be the best fixtures, given all the potential scenarios.’ A BT Sport spokesman said: ‘We aim to cover the teams and stories that appeal to as wide a number of fans as possible, while staying true to the traditions of the competition. ‘Fixture selection is a complex process involving multiple parties including broadcasters, clubs, the FA and local authorities.’","Bradford City beat Chelsea 4-2 in the FA Cup fourth round .

"Gary Cahill has spoken of his disappointment at being benched for Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Chelsea emerged successful after an enticing tussle with their Premier League rivals, with Branislav Ivanovic scoring four minutes into extra time for a 1-0 win on the night and a 2-1 aggregate triumph. But England defender Cahill, who has been a mainstay in Chelsea's imperious back line since Jose Mourinho's return, was replaced by Kurt Zouma after Saturday's shock 4-2 defeat to Bradford in the FA Cup. Gary Cahill was disappointed to be replaced by Kurt Zouma against Liverpool on Tuesday . Zouma (left) put in an impressive display for Chelsea, limiting the influence of Raheem Sterling (right) 'I don't need to tell you how disappointed I was I wasn't playing,' Cahill said to talkSPORT on Wednesday. 'But the bigger picture is the team and getting to the final. It was a fantastic result.' Cahill discovered on the morning of the game that he was to be replaced by Kurt Zouma, who offered an assured display alongside John Terry. The centre-back has not held court with Mourinho to find out specifically why he was excluded but knows he will always be able to have an honest discussion with the Portuguese manager. 'It was the morning of the game we found out. It is not about me, it is about the final, the team. 'Every game is different in his (Mourinho's) mind. We find out (the team) sometimes a couple days before, sometimes on the day. Cahill said he Mourinho's door is always open if he has an issue to discuss with him . Zouma's (left) display will give Mourinho another big decision to make ahead of the Manchester City game . 'As professional players you deal with it, his door is always open. I don't think he feels the need to explain every single decision but he is approachable in that way, his door is open.'

"Chelsea's extra-time hero Branislav Ivanovic was singled out for special praise by Jose Mourinho after the Serbian defender's display during the Blues' Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool. Ivanovic headed past Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet to settle a thrilling contest at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho claimed Ivanovic has the mentality of a champion and will tell the Chelsea defender to present his blood filled boot to the young academy players to show them how to be a winner. Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to head home the only goal of the game for Chelsea against Liverpool . Ivanovic's right boot was cleary bloodied at the end of the game . It was an eventful night for Ivanovic - who didn't have blood on his boot after this knock earlier in the match . The defender's effort settled the second leg at Stamford Bridge and sees Chelsea advance to the final . ‘He has lots of blood and the boot is completely full of red blood and it should go straight to the academy,' Mourinho explained.

"Diego Costa was very lucky to avoid being sent for an early shower during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Tuesday evening after his clear stamp on Emre Can. But the provocative Chelsea striker didn't escape the punishment on social media as the Twittersphere reacted to his aggressive behaviour at Stamford Bridge.

Costa shares a name with a chain of coffee shops so he was pictured filling up loyalty cards with stamps . Costa as a stamp collector - simple gag but effective nonetheless . As Blues boss Jose Mourinho chose to sidestep any definitive answers surrounding the incidents, viewers of the ill-tempered contest put their creative heads together to produce some amusing results. The obvious choices were all there to see, with various viewers using the 26-year-old's name similarity to coffee shop chain Costa Coffee as an opportunity to mock him up with loyalty stamp cards - one tweeter even claimed they would be able to get a free coffee thanks to all of Costa's stamps. Others photoshopped him in a wrestling ring and also on the front of a first class stamp while he was also mocked up as a collector by Twitter user Wio. Hilarious stuff. Bookmaker Paddy Power was also tweeting about the Costa stamp. Having scored 17 goals already this season for the Blues, he's shown he has what it takes to let the football do the talking. Yes, he has an aggressive side, which is handy in the Premier League, but let's hope he can start stamping his authority in a more positive manner after tonight's bad behaviour.

"Whether a young Victor Valdes dreamed of one day pulling on the No 1 shirt of Manchester United as he grew up in a town south west of Barcelona is unknown. That he thought he would be doing so in the compact settings of Leigh Sports Village, however, is unlikely. But the 11,000-capacity home of rugby league's Leigh Centurions, complete with terraced end and next to a giant Morrison's supermarket, is exactly where the 33-year-old three-times Champions League winner pulled on the gloves for his new club for the first time. Manchester United keeper Victor Valdes was virtually a spectator until he was beaten by Jerome Sinclair's rasping drive . (from left) Victor Valdes, Joel Castro Pereira, Anderson, Andreas Pereira, Jesse Lingard and Saidy Janko celebrate United's win . Manchester United: Victor Valdes, Patrick McNair, Tom Thorpe, Tyler Blackett, Marrick Vermijl, Anderson (Liam Grimshaw), Andreas Pereira (James Weir), Reece James, Nick Powell, Jesse Lingard, Saidy Janko . Goals: Powell 34, McNair 47 . Liverpool: Lawrence Vigouroux, Ryan McLaughlin (Madger Gomes), Joe Maguire, Conor Randall, Jordan Williams, Pedro Chirivella, Sergi Canos, Cameron Brannagan, Jerome Sinclair, Jordan Ibe, Oluwaseyi Ojo. Goal: Sinclair 42 . Everything has to start somewhere. For Valdes this was his first outing since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury for the Catalan giants against Celta Vigo in March. Being back between a set of posts, albeit ones that looked they were from the 90s with loops in the top corners, was the important thing. Despite rumours he would start in Friday's FA Cup tie at Cambridge United it was this Under 21 clash with Liverpool that Louis van Gaal chose to blood the veteran. On a chilly evening in front of 5,102, Valdes could have been forgiven for thinking about the sunnier climes of Catalonia - especially when he was a spectator for the first 42 minutes as his side dominated. And perhaps his mind was on the beach when he was called into action for the first time - and could not prevent Jerome Sinclair's rasping drive from passing him on its way into the roof of his net to cancel out Nick Powell's opener. Criticism is may well be harsh. The highly-rated Birmingham 18-year-old might not hit a sweeter shot all season - although Valdes will not have enjoyed being beaten at his near post. World-Cup winning Spaniard aside, United had fielded a strong line-up for the clash with their old rivals which included Paddy McNair, Tyler Blackett, Powell and Anderson. With three over 21s permitted, these are often nights for the forgotten remind us of their talents and the unwanted Brazilian gave us a glimpse of a past that promised so much when he dinked a looping ball over the Liverpool defence to set Powell clear. The former Crewe man, whose loan spell at Leicester City was cut short earlier this month amid rumours of attitude issues, fired wastefully wide. Powell, however, would make no mistake moments later - rising unmarked to head Andreas Pereira's free-kick into the turf and in.

Jesse Lingard has recently returned to action after suffering a knee injury on the opening day against Swansea . Jordan Ibe started for Liverpool after being recalled from his successful loan spell at Derby County . Following Sinclair's driven leveller United re-exerted control. Two minutes after the break they were ahead again when McNair fired into the bottom corner following good work from Powell, who looked keen to impress, and Swiss midfielder Saidy Janko. As his side dominated Valdes again had little to do. He may well have glanced at the advertisement hoardings and wondered why he should 'try Leigh Market' as one advised, or made a note to look out for Kingstone Press Cider next time he is at the bar of his local. Nick Powell (left) was keen to impress after failing to shine during a loan spell at Leicester City . Swiss midfielder Saidy Janko set up McNair for Manchester United's winning goal . If nothing else, he will have picked up the words for a few of United's favourite anti-Liverpool chants from a small group behind his goal who, among ditties, belted out the Steve Gerrard/Demba Ba song. Joking aside there were positives. His distribution, on the rare times he had the ball, was decent and he sent more than one clearance thundering into the Liverpool half. A win, and 90 minutes without injury will have given him plenty of reasons to be cheerful as the team bus headed past the local retail park. The mines may have long left this part of Lancashire, but Valdes will have enjoyed his night back at the coalface.","Nick Powell put Manchester United ahead with a 34th-minute header .

"As Andros Townsend walks into Tottenham’s plush training ground reception on Monday afternoon, he is surrounded by scouts. There’s an Under 21 match against Leicester about to kick off; spies from across the country have made their way to Spurs’ Enfield HQ with a view to picking up a little gem ahead of next week’s transfer deadline. There was a time, not too long ago, when Townsend would have been the subject of such attention. Andros Townsend is gearing up for Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Sheffield United . Townsend has come a long way from the player who appeared to be on his way out at Spurs . The winger scored the only goal of the first leg against Nigel Clough's League One Blades . Having spent no less than nine loan periods away from White Hart Lane, there was a time when this talented winger wondered if he would ever make the grade at the club he supported as a boy. Now he is on the brink of a Wembley cup final as Tottenham take a slender 1-0 advantage to Sheffield United tonight in their Capital One Cup semi-final second-leg clash. He’s certainly come a long way. Heralded as England’s next superstar in October 2013 after scoring on his international debut against Montenegro, Townsend is now desperate to make his first Wembley appearance as a club footballer. And as we sit, after Monday’s training session, looking ahead to Wednesday's encounter the topic of his progress since that dazzling international debut is broached. How does Townsend feel about his development since the euphoria of a man-of-the-match display on his England bow? Townsend - photographed by Sportsmail on Monday - has struggled with injuries throughout his career . His response: ‘I’ve spoken a lot about this before, and I don’t really want to go through it again. ‘I’ll go through it briefly. I got injuries at the worst times - I got injured three or four games after making my England debut. ‘Hopefully now I’m on the road back. I’m back in the Spurs side, playing reasonably well and back to where I want to be.’ It was a somewhat frosty reply. But to be fair, he has a point. An ankle injury cruelly denied him the chance of going to the World Cup in the summer, while this season has been disrupted by thigh and further ankle problems. Likewise, he was a peripheral figure during the opening weeks of Mauricio Pochettino’s reign; in and out of the Argentine’s plans. Slowly but surely, though, he has proved his worth to his manager and is back in the side - a shock start against Manchester United last month proving the catalyst in a resurgence. ‘The biggest confidence booster for me was against United, when the manager threw me in,’ revealed Townsend. Townsend scored Tottenham's goal during the FA Cup fourth round defeat against Leicester on Saturday . ‘We have a meeting in the morning of games where the manager says the team; it was unexpected so I couldn’t wait to get going. ‘I hadn’t started in the Premier League for a month or so and we did well that game. After that we beat Chelsea so that gave me a big confidence boost.’ But what does he have to do to ensure he stays a fixture in Pochettino’s starting XI? Despite his rapid progress over the past 18 months, doubts over Townsend’s end product continue to linger. ‘Of course there are areas of my game I still need to work on,’ admitted the winger. ‘It’s no secret I have to improve my assist and goal ratio - that’s what I’m solely focusing on. ‘I don’t listen to critics but you know in yourself what you need to improve. I analyse every match I play so I know my good points and bad points. ‘I don’t take notice of stats, in a game you could put five great crosses in but no one gets on the end of it and you don’t get an assist.’ An area of his game that doesn’t need improvement, however, is his accuracy from the spot. Townsend impressed and scored on his England debut against Montenegro last season . Townsend's progress at international level was curtailed by injury somewhat . All five of his goals this season have come from 12 yards and he looks to have taken over from Roberto Soldado as the club’s first-choice penalty taker. ‘You have to zone out,’ said Townsend. ‘Pick your side, don’t change your mind, focus on what side you want to put it, don’t look at the keeper - just solely on the ball.’ His penalty in the first leg at White Hart Lane could yet prove the pivotal moment in his side’s semi-final against the Blades. But Townsend is refusing to allow himself to dream of Wembley ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup showdown. Townsend says he picks a spot and sticks with it when taking a penalty for Tottenham . ‘We can’t think about Wembley. It’s great to be in the semi-final, but being a semi-final loser is the worse place to be. ‘I’ve never played there as club player. I was part of the 19-man squad for the FA Cup semi-final against Portsmouth in 2010, but they wanted me there for the experience. ‘I went there as a fan in the 2008 League Cup final we won and the one we lost the year after. ‘I’d go with my dad, brother and sister, it was a great occasion for the family. ‘So to have the chance to go as a player is a dream come true.’ ‘Andros Townsend was speaking ahead of the second leg of the Capital One Cup Semi-Final on behalf of Capital One – the card in your corner.

"Tomas Rosicky is 34 years old. He has been at Arsenal for nine years, but has averaged just 19 Premier League games a season under Arsene Wenger. Yet, when the ‘Little Mozart’ is at his best, Wenger’s fluid style of play is rarely encapsulated more. His individual masterclass at Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday typified the type of performance Arsenal fans have grown to love, full of energy, pressing on and off the ball and flair. Phil Neville may want to ‘two-foot him’, but really, we must saviour the moments when the Czech star lights up a football pitch with his touch. Tomas Rosicky gives a 'no look' pass during the build-up to his spectacular goal against Brighton . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton . ‘If you love football, you love Tomas Rosicky,’ Wenger gleamed after the 3-2 victory. Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott returned for the Gunners, but were dictated by the midfield maestro on the South Coast. Rosicky is an odd footballing creature, someone who can go missing when he’s not found his rhythm, someone who is more likely to put in the performance of the season than nail down a position in the starting XI. In fact, he looked set for a January departure before injuries played their part in north London. Rosicky celebrates his goal while Aaron Ramsey (centre) rushes over to congratulate him . Former Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale dived too late to keep out Rosicky's perfectly executed strike . ‘The lack of match practice has been absolutely terrible and, naturally, it makes me very sorry that I haven’t been given a chance yet,’ Rosicky said back in September. A limp outing in his first start of the campaign against Southampton in the Capital One Cup did nothing for him, and even had some sections of the Emirates Stadium crowd booing. This was not the Rosicky they knew and loved. But Rosicky is always a man Wenger rates so highly, and is perhaps his most trusted member of the first team squad. Year in, year out, he comes into form when Arsenal need him most, from December to May. The French boss has always been firm with players aged 30 or older when it comes to new deals in the past, but not with Rosicky, who has signed on in March in two of the last three seasons. He will get a testimonial next year if he opts for a contract extension at the club. Rosicky (left), despite his inconsistent form, is rated very highly by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger . At Manchester City, when Santi Cazorla ran the show, faith was placed in Rosicky to come on for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and steer the ship home. His knowledge of where to run with the ball when defending a lead, and when to bring out the flicks and tricks, is all so important. He mixes the experience of a 34-year-old with the exuberance of a young teen trying to make a point. You might say it’s the perfect combination. Rosicky has had to change his game over the years. A career-threatening injury back in 2008 kept him out of action for almost two years. He insists his ‘football age’ is 32 because of it, while some call him Peter Pan. Before that hamstring problem, the playmaker was one of the few in the Arsenal squad who seemed keen to pull the trigger, with a ferocious shot from a short back-lift. Rosicky (left) was a calming influence from the bench as he helped Arsenal close out a 2-0 against City . Now, his burst of pace from midfield is more evident, his selflessness and weight of pass usually to perfection. At Brighton, we got to see all sides to his game. The ball through to Ozil for the Gunner’s second goal of the game was effortless, the no-look pass and subsequent volley past goalkeeper David Stockdale sublime. Rosicky earned his ‘Little Mozart’ name back in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, but the nickname has never been more suitable than for the man we see today. The game Wenger tries to play is all about finding angles and avenues in and around the opposition midfield. Different trajectories and speed of pass is ‘the Arsenal way’. In Rosicky, he has a player that will always look for the forward pass, finding miniscule gaps to thread balls through, eager for one-twos and runs beyond the defence should they be needed. Rosicky earned his ‘Little Mozart’ nickname during his younger days with Borussia Dortmund . The midfielder has come through a difficult era with Arsenal, often a barren one, to become the player he is today, an intelligent technician to compliment the likes of Cazorla. The duo, best friends off the pitch, have both been praised in recent weeks, and Ozil, Walcott and Aaron Ramsey will struggle to oust them from the side on current form. However, Rosicky for one will know the time will come this season when he plays second fiddle once again. Not usually one for the limelight, more one for the highlight reel, there aren’t many left like the Czech Republic captain. We should appreciate this conductor while we still can. The likes of Mesut Ozi (left) and Theo Walcott will struggle to oust the in-form Rosicky .","Tomas Rosicky starred in Arsenal's 3-2 FA Cup victory against Brighton .

"Former Lions and Wales forward Andy Powell once was once dubbed a 'scrumbag' after his wife accused him of cheating, gambling and lying, but the Newport Gwent Dragons No 8 has spoken of his joy as the reunited couple showed off their newborn son. Powell's wife Natasha tweeted  his sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes following the couple's split last year. But she later took back the Welsh forward after he promised to change his ways. Andy Powell has spoken of his joy as he and his wife Natasha showed off their son, Henry . Powell (right) represented Wales on 23 occasions and was part of the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad . Powell's career highlight was making Ian McGeechan's squad for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour . The couple were all smiles this week as they posed for pictures with their son Henry Harman Gascoine-Powell, who was born two weeks early on New Year's Day. Powell, 33, said: 'I'm a real hands-on dad. I don't mind changing Henry's nappies and doing late night feeds. 'It's a mad feeling, absolutely crazy but completely enjoyable. 'I've got a few days off now to spend time with Tash and Henry and then I'll be back training. The boys have been great and sent us a top with Powell on the back for little Henry.' The couple looked to be heading towards divorce after Natasha accused Powell of cheating on her . On the day Henry was born, Powell called his team mates at the Newport Gwent Dragons to say he wouldn't make their afternoon match against Cardiff Blues. But Natasha's labour - which lasted just an hour and a half - was so quick he managed to get there in time to see his side lose 11-9 at Rodney Parade. Prolific tweeter Powell has also been sharing pictures on social media of his new experiences as a dad. The latest photos show the incredible turnaround for the couple, who looked to be heading for a divorce last year. The couple reunited when Natasha announced she was pregnant after a public falling out where she posted explicit pictures Powell sent to her (right) and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes . Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her. She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested. She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him. At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.'

"As Steven Defour found out the hard way, it seems a bad idea to leave Standard Liege and later join their bitter rivals Anderlecht. On Sunday, former Liege captain Defour was treated to an incredible display ahead of their derby match, showing his decapitated head alongside the words, 'Red or Dead.' After five years at the club, Defour left Standard Liege for Porto in 2011, spending two years in Portugal before heading back to Belgium.

To the dismay of Liege fans, his move back home was not to them, but to their fierce competitors Anderlecht. For a hero of their club to join the enemy is a betrayal of the highest order when it comes to football fans, and Liege were not going to let it slip. The sole aim of the display will have been to rile Defour, and their mission was accomplished on two fronts. Liege won the game 2-0, and their former captain did not last the 90 minutes. With 53 minutes on the clock, Defour reacted to an offside call he didn't agree with, smashing the ball with pace into the Liege supporters.

"Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan came across each other again in a tumbledown corner of south east London and began informal man-to-man discussions about an alternative superbout in case Floyd Mayweather fails to call either of them for his next megafight. Khan and Pacquiao are friends and sparring partners and they met up at the century-old Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club which is squeezed in a tunnel of bricks and aluminium that forms part of a railway-line archway in Lambeth. They did stand in the old ring which has produced some of Britain’s finest prizefighters but declined the suggestion of swapping a few punches. Manny Pacquiao (left) was in London on Friday to discuss a potential future fight with Britain's Amir Khan . Pacquiao's (left) arrival was greeted enthusiastically by fans who wanted the boxer's signature . Pacquiao met up at the century-old Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth to discuss a possible megafight . The visit of ring royalty to this dusty but hallowed corner of boxing came at the end of Pacquiao’s visit to London which included Thursday night’s dinner with boxing fan Prince Harry at Buckingham Palace. Khan prefaced the reunion by visiting Wembley stadium which has been mooted as a venue if he ever agrees to a battle of Britain with Kell Brook. But this engagement has an eye to him meeting Pacquiao here. If that is to happen, Mayweather would have to pass on the two leading contenders to face him in Las Vegas on May 2. Khan is aware that Mayweather versus Pacquiao is the $300million spectacular which most of the world wants to see and that global audience would have been excited to hear Pacquiao telling me: ‘I think now that Floyd and me is going to happen. It looks like it.’ Khan, pictured getting out of his gold Rolls Royce, had hoped to fight Mayweather in May . Khan gave a beaming smile to the camera as he arrived at Fitzroy Lodge Amateur Boxing Club . This is the closest either Mayweather or Pacquiao have come to predicting a real likelihood of the barriers blocking the way of the richest fight of all time are as good as removed. Even so, the PacMan is putting Plan B in place with Khan. As Pacquiao continued his state visit to London his advisor Michael Koncz told me: ‘Just in case Floyd doesn't come through we regard Amir as the best possible alternative. He and Manny would make for a very exciting fight and Manny would be more than happy to do it at Wembley stadium. ‘We are looking at that possibility and also Abu Dhabi as another potential venue. ‘But of course we are still working on Mayweather.’ Khan said: ‘I’ve been looking at Wembley which would be a great stage for me and Manny and Abu Dhabi is very much in the running. ‘It was great seeing Manny again. We talked a bit about old times and also about the future. Although we have this friendship, if fighting each other makes sense then it can certainly happen.’ Khan (left) beat Devon Alexander in Las Vegas to win the WBC Silver welterweight title last December . Khan set a mid-January deadline for Mayweather to deliver on his long-standing promise of giving the young man from Bolton the biggest fight of his life. That has passed but with Mayweather still deliberating khan would obviously respond eagerly if the offer was still to come. Mayweather has a third option in one of his former victims, Miguel Cotto, who would bring plenty of Hispanic interest to a Las Vegas on the weekend of a major Mexican state holiday. Pacquiao set his own Mayweather deadline as January 31 but he was more confident then at any other time so far that it will be met as he arrived at Fitzroy Lodge. He was greeted by dozens of cheering young London boxers and their trainers as he came through that creaking old door. There was also a rousing rendition of the Lambeth walk as Khan arrived a few minutes later. Pacquiao (right) defeated Chris Algieri easily on an unanimous points decision last November . Pacquiao said: ‘The dinner with Prince Harry was very enjoyable and I am really pleased to come to a boxing place like this.' He also confirmed a fight with Khan could take place. 'Yes, there's a big possibility, nothing personal, we're just doing our job in the ring,' he said on Sky Sports News HQ. 'It's not difficult for us because we respect each other and we're just doing our job in the ring.' As for his hopes on fighting Mayweather, Pacquiao maintained he has done everything in his power to make the bout happen and it is now in the American's hands. 'We're waiting for the answer from them, the signed contract from them, probably next week we will know if the fight (can be) pushed through or not,' he added. Khan was greeted just as enthusiastically and then said to Pacquaio: ‘Great. Now lets talk.’ Mayweather (left) is widely regarded as the pound-for-pound king and beat Marcos Maidana in September .","Manny Pacquiao defeated Chris Algieri easily on points last November .

"Lindsey Vonn had 'I'm the best' written on her bib but a big mistake wrecked her hopes of adding a 64th World Cup victory to her record tally in a downhill won by Switzerland's Lara Gut on Saturday. The American, who became the most successful woman skier of all time last weekend, lost her line at the start of the lower section and narrowly avoided crashing to finish 2.08 seconds off the pace. 'It's unusual for me to finish 23rd but things like this happen from time to time and I knew it would be hard for me to stay in contention after such a mistake,' she said. Lindsey Vonn lost her line and ended up finishing 23rd, finishing 2.08 seconds off of the pace . Ironically, Vonn had 'I'm the best!' written on her bib but the error meant she was not near the top . Gut continued her love affair with St Moritz by winning her first downhill of the season on home snow in a time of one minute and 43.82 seconds. The 23-year-old made her Swiss team debut in a European Cup race in St Moritz at the age of 15, earned her first World Cup podium in the smart Swiss resort two years later and clinched her first World Cup win, a Super-G, on the same course in 2008. 'It's always special in St Moritz. I came here since I was a kid and it's always very emotional to win here,' she said. 'Everybody was talking about me but I hadn't been on the podium here for five years. Now it's a great boost to go to the world championships in such shape,' she said. The world championships start in Beaver Creek, Colorado, next month. Winner of a Super-G in Lake Louise earlier this season, Gut collected her 12th World Cup success ahead of overall World Cup defending champion Anna Fenninger of Austria, who missed her second victory of the winter by 0.32 seconds. In third place, Edit Miklos became the first Hungarian skier on a World Cup podium, 0.58 behind Gut. Lara Gut, of Switzerland, made the most of Vonn's mistake to emerge victorious on Saturday . Born in Romania 26 years ago, Miklos already made an impression at the 2014 Sochi Olympics when she finished seventh in the downhill ahead of the Austrian skiers with whom she trains. 'It might be a surprise but I've been close in the past, finishing fifth in Crans-Montana and also in Sochi. I skied well and I'm not sure my bib number made a difference,' said Miklos, who started early in better wind conditions. Overall World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia made too many mistakes to be in contention and finished 18th, 1.74 adrift.","Lindsey Vonn lost her line but managed to avoid crashing .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has apologised to Cordoba defender Edimar for the kick that saw the Portuguese sent-off for the ninth time in his career on Saturday. The three-time World Player of the Year kicked out in frustration at Edimar in the 83rd minute but he was bailed out by Gareth Bale's last-gasp penalty. Afterwards he tweeted: 'I apologise to everyone and especially Edimar for my thoughtless action in today's game.' Cristiano Ronaldo lashes out at Cordoba's Jose Angel Crespo as the frustration begins to boil over . Ronaldo aims a personalised boot in the direction of Edimar Fraga's shin in the lead up to his red card . Ronaldo appears to protest his innocence as Fraga clutches his face on the floor... but Crespo pushes the Portuguese . Referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez had little choice but to show Ronaldo a straight red card following the incidents . It was a miserable afternoon for Ronaldo in which he was overshadowed by former Manchester United winger Bebe for much of the game. His frustration got the better of him in the second half but when he was given his marching orders for kicking Edimar and striking Jose Angel Crespo it meant Bale was allowed to take both free-kicks and penalties. He won a spot-kick with a free-kick that was handled by Fede Cartabia - who was also subsequently sent off - and he stepped up in Ronaldo’s place to score from the spot. Ronaldo could face a three-match ban for violent conduct but Bale looks more than capable of picking up the baton. The former Tottenham winger ended up deciding the match but for a long time it seemed another winger might grab the headlines. Gareth Bale comforts Ronaldo after Real Madrid's talisman was sent off for his attack . Cordoba: Martin Corral, Gunino, Pantic, Crespo, Fraga, Rodríguez Barrera, Rossi, Bebe, Nicolas Cartabia, Ghilas, Andone (Vico Villegas 80).Subs not used: Saizar, Lopez de Silva Sánchez, Lopez Garai, Gomez Moreno, Pinillos, Agullo Sevilla. Goal: Ghilas 3 (pen) Booked: Rossi, Nicolas Cartabia . Sent off: Nicolas Cartabia . Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo (Fabio Coentrao 72), Khedira (Illarramendi 64), Kroos, Rodríguez (Jese 80), Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo. Subs not used: Navas, Hernandez, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Goals: Benzema 27, Bale 89 (pen) Booked: Carvajal, Ramos, Khedira . Sent off: Ronaldo . Ref: Alejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez . Att: 21,822 . It was five years ago that Sir Alex Ferguson signed 19-year-old Bebe from Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal without having seen play. Many hoped he would be the next Ronaldo signed three years earlier from Sporting aged 18 but beyond nationality and position there turned out to be few similarities. Bebe played seven games for United and four for Besiktas on loan before heading back to Portugal to rebuld his career on loan first at Rio Ave and then at Pazos Ferreira. It looked as if he’d bounced back when he signed permanently for Benfica in the summer but after one appearance he was sent out on loan again, this time to Cordoba who were 14th in La Liga going into this weekend’s fixtures. He was back on the same pitch as Ronaldo and in the battle of the former Manchester United wingers Bebe was winning hands down at the end of the first half. He crucially won the spot-kick that gave Cordoba the lead. His shot from the right smashed against Sergio Ramos and referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez gave a penalty and booked the Real Madrid defender. After a slow, straight run-up Nabi Ghilas beat Iker Casillas for his sixth goal of the season. Bebe had only just started, however. He raced away down the Cordoba right and crossed for Florin Andone but his centre was just behind the Romanian striker. He burned up Marcelo again only to his time over-hit his cross, sending it behind the goal. The quality of the final ball left a lot to be desired but the threat was most definitely there with a pace, power and purpose missing in most of Real Madrid’s lethargic attacking play. Bebe’s next effort was a shot that shaved Casillas’ far post and he then tried his luck from distance with the keeper this time making the save. Ronaldo finally responded with a free-kick at the other end but the set-piece was high and wild never troubling Juan Carlos in the home side’s goal. As players from both teams prepare for a set piece, Ronaldo has other, more violent, ideas on his mind .

When Real Madrid finally got back into the game it was the other two parts of their front-three that produced the goal. Karim Benzema turning in James Rodriguez's corner after Gareth Bale had flicked the kick on. There was no sign of any Cordoba players looking for shirt swaps when the half-time whistle went. Much had been made before the game of striker Andone admitting – like Cambridge United’s players – that Cordoba would have to pay to replace any shirts they swapped with Madrid. The home side had shown the visitors no deference in the first half. Madrid had not played at Cordoba’s stadium in 43 years but Real’s record here has never been great, losing one and drawing four of the eight games played. Now they were at 1-1 at half time struggling to look anything like league leaders. It had been such a trying first half that Carlo Ancelotti had finished it arguing with the fourth official. He sent the same players out for the second half but there was no real change in the pattern of the game and Bebe continued his one man show with the winger going on another mazy run only to disappoint with a weak shot. Ronaldo had the chance to respond from another free-kick at the other end but again his range was off. Nabil Ghilas gave Cordoba a shock early lead as he converted a penalty after Sergio Ramos' handball . Gareth Bale is held off by Edimar Fraga as the Welsh winger tries to make an impact on the game . Cordoba defender David Rodriguez competes for the ball with Colombian ace James Rodriguez . On minute 68 Cordoba should have taken the lead when Varane dithered with a header back to Casillas that Andone intercepted and headed over the goalkeeper. Time seemed to standstill in the Nuevo Archangel as the ball looped goalwards only to come back off the bar. With the clock ticking down Ronaldo stung Juan Carlos’ hands from distance with a long shot and he then saved a Benzema shot from the edge of the area. Ramos headed the resulting corner over the bar as Ronaldo swung wildly at Crespo and was lucky the referee never saw the swipe. When he did it again moments later everyone saw it. Another corner came over from the right and he caught Crespo again and was shown a straight red. It was not the last red of the match though. Cartabia was sent off for a second yellow when he handballed Bale’s free-kick and, in Ronaldo’s absence, the Welshman scored from the spot to give Real Madrid the points.","Ronaldo was shown a straight red card in the 83rd minute for striking Jose Angel Crespo .

Sturridge and Balotelli last played together for Liverpool in a 3-0 victory over Spurs on August 31 . Despite the  recent resurgence at Anfield, Brendan Rodgers' side has struggled for goals - especially from their strikers with Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini netting only three league goals between them all season. Balotelli has not scored a goal in the Premier League since his £16million move from AC Milan in the summer, although Rodgers has ruled out selling the 24-year-old in January. The manager will be hoping that playing as a foil to Sturridge will help the Italian firebrand rediscover his touch, although Rodgers is determined not to rush the England international back. Speaking last week, Rodgers said: ‘Daniel Sturridge is back and working well. Obviously he’s not ready to play as of yet but hopefully he’ll be ready in the near future.

'His pace is frightening, his touch, his movement, and he's also improved the defensive part of his game in order to press the ball. 'If he can just sustain that fitness, he's shown what he can do. We're hoping that he can stay fit and lead the charge for us over the next few years.'

Bouchard laughed as she twirled for the interviewer to show off her outfit after her straight-sets victory . The interviewer continued to speak to Bouchard after she twirled for him after her second round match . 'This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well.' The 12-time Grand Slam singles winner, now 71, added: 'Let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks.' Bouchard looked slightly bemused by the request, which followed her straight-sets win over Kiki Bertens, admitting in her post-match press conference the question had taken her by surprise. 'It was very unexpected. I mean, yeah, I don't know. An old guy asking you to twirl, it was funny,' said the seventh seed.

Williams, a second-round winner over Vera Zvonareva on Thursday, revealed she had also had the same request and not enjoyed the experience, but would not be drawn on whether it was sexist or not. The American said: 'A commentator asked me to twirl. I wouldn't ask Rafa (Nadal) or Roger (Federer) to twirl. Whether it's sexist or not, I don't know. I can't answer that. 'I didn't really want to twirl because I was just like, you know, I don't need all the extra attention. But, yeah, it was fine. 'I don't think and look that deep into it. Life is far too short to focus on that. We have so many other problems we want to deal with that we should focus on. 'Whether I twirl or not, it's not the end of the world. It's about being positive and just moving forward.'

"He may have made his name at Tottenham but Gareth Bale has admitted he grew up supporting their north London rivals Arsenal. The Welsh winger joined Spurs from Southampton in 2007 and spent six years at the club before his world-record £86million transfer to Real Madrid. Despite a slow start at White Hart Lane, Bale's remarkable development over his last three years in England saw him become a favourite with the club's fans. Gareth Bale revealed his past as an Arsenal fan on Spanish radio  station Cadena Ser on Tuesday night .

Bale gets stuck in against Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere during the north London derby in 2013 . Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry celebrate winning the Premier League at White Hart Lane in 2004 . But on Tuesday evening the 25-year-old jeopardised that status with Spurs supporters after comments he made regarding rivals Arsenal. Speaking on Cadena SER radio show, he said: 'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot. 'But when I went to Tottenham I went away from Arsenal. Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira were amazing footballers.' Bale has enjoyed a mixed relationship with the fans at new club Real Madrid, and was recently accused of being selfish after failing to pass the ball to Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo. But Bale brushed the issue aside, saying it had been blown out of proportion. 'All I can remember is going for the ball and feeling very focused on trying to score,' said Bale. 'I didn't see him, I think it would have been a difficult pass. I haven't spoken to Cristiano about not passing the ball. 'I don't know how much importance was given to it (by the media) but I'm sure people talk a lot about it. But it happens all the time on the football pitch in every team.'

'Most of the plan is in, now it's about refining it. There are only 65 plays left in the season, or 70 plays left in the season, so every play that you call is paramount.

"Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo appears to have moved on from former long-term girlfriend Irina Shayk, with reports suggesting he has begun dating Spanish TV reporter Lucia Villalon. Ronaldo was pictured celebrating  with Villalon after he beat off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win his third Ballon d'Or. The Portuguese forward only recently confirmed he had broken up from  Shayk in an official statement. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo's rumoured new lady on a road trip to the Bernabeu . Cristiano Ronaldo is allegedly dating Spanish TV reporter Lucia Villalon after his split from Irina Shayk . The 26-year-old sports journalist is a state broadcaster who graduated with law and journalism degrees . Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr was wrapped up warm as he made his way home from school on Monday . 'After dating for five years, my relationship with Irina Shayk has come to an end. We believed it would be best for both of us to take this step now.' Ronaldo showed no sign of being down after his split from Shayk when he was spotted picking up his son - Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr - from a school in Madrid. A couple of admirers had waited nearby and asked the sportsman for a selfie, and he happily obliged, appearing to be in good spirits. He became a father back in July 2010 and has previously admitted that being a parent changed him. 'Of course something like this affects you. It's a different type of responsibility,' he said . 'Maybe I feel more comfortable. I'm comfortable when things are going well: my family, the club, my friends, that gives me important support for everything else. 'I would love him to like football, for him to be my successor, but we'll see what happens. 'My son will be whatever he wants,' he added. Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo, pictured with his son, split from Shayk in early January . Ronaldo happily posed for a selfie with a fan while making the journey to pick up his son . The identity of the mother has never been revealed, but it was reported in 2011 that she was a 20-year-old British student who was paid £10million to give up her parental rights. Ronaldo's split from the stunning model, whom he'd been with for five years, was confirmed at the weekend, after days of speculation after she unfollowed him on Twitter. She was also notably absent at his third prestigious Ballon d'Or win celebration on January 12. However, in her absence was a sports journalist Villalon who was also pictured celebrating with him on the day in Irina's absence. 'There are 3! Golden ball congratulations! Zurich 12/01/15,' she wrote in the caption. The popular star was approached by another admirer who was keen on speaking to Ronaldo . Victoria's Secret beauty Shayk's spokesperson revealed on Saturday: 'We can confirm Irina Shayk has ended her relationship to Cristiano Ronaldo of five years.' A massive argument between his mother and his long-time love may have resulted in the demise of their romance. Ronaldo's alleged new flame, who is an avid follower of his successful sports career, is a state broadcaster who graduated with law and journalism degrees. The 26-year-old noticeably braved the plummeting temperatures and sat in the stands at Real Madrid's game against Getafe on Sunday, cheering on the world-famous star with a couple of girlfriends.

"Tiger Woods will be looking to prove he can still be the force he once was against two of golf's young rising stars when the  Phoenix Open gets under way on Thursday in Arizona. Woods will be making yet another comeback from injury at TPC Scottsdale in his first event of the 2015 season and first tournament since he finished joint last at the Hero World Challenge in December. He will play the first two days paired with 21-year-old world No 9 Jordan Spieth and 15th-ranked Patrick Reed, 24 - the two players who probably left Gleneagles with the most credit after the United States' third straight Ryder Cup loss last year. Tiger Woods will compete in his first tournament of the year at the Phoenix Open  in Arizona . Woods says he is driving better than ever and feels confident in his technique . Woods was all smiles as he addressed the media after a practice round in Scottsdale on Tuesday . Woods could not compete in Scotland as he continued to recover from the effects of back surgery, but the 39-year-old is confident those problems are behind him. And Woods also believes his driving, which was notably erratic even at his peak and has been put in the shade by the game's new big-hitters, is as strong as when he last played this event 14 years ago. 'My driving has come around a lot faster,' he told a press conference. 'I'm a lot longer than I thought I ever could be again. My speed is way back up, and that's fun. I'm touching numbers that I did 15 years ago, so that's cool.' He added: 'I'm driving it. It felt great, driving my ball.' Woods' disappointing week at the Hero World Challenge was notable for his poor chipping, and the 14-time major winner feels he has now adjusted to his new methods with swing consultant Chris Como. Woods says he has adjusted to a new chipping technique after working with new coach Chris Como . Woods gestures as he goes around the TPC Scottsdale during a practice round . 'I was caught between techniques, between my old release pattern and body movement when I was working with Sean (Foley) and then my new release pattern,' he added. 'We had to basically just hit thousands upon thousands upon thousands of chips and just get it out of there, and now it's better.' Woods was clearly more relaxed facing the media in the desert than he often is and, while he seemed confident, he admitted he had some obstacles to overcome over the 7,152-yard lay-out. 'I think I need to work on a little bit here, getting the speed of these greens, because in your head, you assume hard greens with a lot of spring to them are going to be fast, but they're not fast,' he said. 'They spring, but they putt slow. So I need to do some work to try to overcome the mental hurdle to make sure I can hit the putts hard, even though I know coming into the greens I have to throw the ball straight up in the air, play for a big hop, chips, play for two big hops before the ball starts thinking about stopping.' Patrick Reed (in action at the Humana Challenge) will partner Woods at the Phoenix Open . Robert Allenby will play in his first tournament since his alleged kidnapping and beating in Hawaii . Woods may be the main attraction at TPC Scottsdale, but he will have competition from a strong field including world No 4 Bubba Watson, last week's Humana Challenge winner Bill Haas and FedEx Cup champion Billy Horschel. Defending champion Kevin Stadler will not be playing due to a wrist injury, but Robert Allenby returns to action following his alleged kidnapping and beating in Hawaii, and the notoriously raucous crowds will be backing Arizona State alumnus Phil Mickelson. Jamie Donaldson and Francesco Molinari lead the European charge, with Scottish duo Martin Laird and Russell Knox, England's Brian Davis and Irish veteran Padraig Harrington also in the field.","Tiger Woods to play in first tournament of 2015 at Phoenix Open in Arizona .

"It was perhaps asking too much of this season’s FA Cup to give us another fourth-round shock after a weekend of upsets. There were to be no more League One heroics at Spotland to go with Bradford’s humbling of Chelsea. They tried. Goodness knows Rochdale tried, and at times in the first half Stoke were certainly rocking. But the Premier League side already had the cushion of a stunning early strike from Bojan Krkic, and they smoothed their passage with second-half goals from substitute Stephen Ireland and Victor Moses. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Sats: Rochdale 1-4 Stoke City . Bojan fired home a stunning volley in the opening minutes to put Stoke in front against Rochdale . Bojan celebrates the opening goal as Stoke took a firm grip on the FA Cup tie right from kick off . Rochdale (4-1-4-1): Lillis 6; Rafferty 6, Eastham 6.5, Lancashire 6, Tanser 6.5; Bennett 7; Vincenti 6.5 (Noble-Lazarus 58, 6), Camps 6.5 (Allen 63, 6), Dawson 7, Henderson 6.5; Done 7.5 (Andrew, 55, 6).

Stoke (4-2-3-1): Butland 6; Bardsley 5.5, Shawcross 6.5, Wollscheid 6, Wilson 6; Nzonzi 5.5 (Sidwell 46, 6.5), Whelan 6; Arnautovic 5.5, Bojan 7 (Ireland 32, 7), Moses 8; Walters 6. Subs not used: Muniesa, Adam, Cameron, Crouch, Sorensen. Scorers: Bojan 4, Ireland 52, Moses 61, Walters 90 . Booked: Bojan, Wilson, Sidwell, Bardsley . Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) 5 . Star man: Victor Moses . It did come at a cost, however, with Bojan limping off before half-time with a knee injury. Stoke’s inspirational playmaker left the ground on crutches and was driven away long before the game had finished. The draw for the fifth round was made before kick-off, handing the winners of this tie a trip to Blackburn Rovers where both managers, Keith Hill and Mark Hughes, played earlier in their careers. Hughes also went on to become manager at Ewood Park, leading Blackburn to the semi-final in 2007. Hill requested that news of the draw was not broadcast over the matchday tannoy beforehand to prevent his players from finding out as they prepared for their biggest match of the season. Considering Manchester City’s capitulation to Middlesbrough after a few days in Abu Dhabi, Stoke fans must have wondered if it was a wise move their team going to Dubai ahead of the precarious visit to Spotland. Hughes certainly wasn’t taking this tie lightly, however. Having seen his side go behind to Conference club Wrexham in the third round, he named a strong line-up with Bojan Krkic a surprise inclusion. Stoke and Rochdale players were involved in a melee in the first half with both teams getting invovled . Rochdale's Peter Vincenti grabs hold of Bojan's jersey after a heated exchange between the pair . And the little Spaniard justified the decision as he took the wind out of Rochdale’s sails after just four minutes. Olly Lancashire’s clearance headed looped towards the edge of the box where Bojan was waiting, curiously unmarked. He never took his eye off the ball for an instant and set him himself before despatching a magnificent left-foot volley into the top corner, giving goalkeeper Josh Lillis no chance whatsoever. If the underdogs were stunned, they didn’t show it. They roared back at the Premier League side with the pace of 14-goal striker Matty Done causing Stoke all kinds of problems. Jack Butland rushed out of his goal to save at the striker’s feet several times, and on the one occasion that Done got there first he rolled the ball agonisingly wide of the post with a clutch of Stoke defenders trailing in his wake seven minutes before half-time. Bojan receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the Rochdale goal . Bojan had to be replaced by Stephen Ireland and the Spaniard was later seen leaving the ground on crutches . Done was inches away from connecting with wonderful right-wing cross from Joe Rafferty with only Butland to beat, and the Stoke keeper also came out to deny Ian Henderson after another pass had split Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross. Stoke were able to hang on until half-time but by then the inspirational Bojan was already back in the dressing-room with a yellow card and a sore knee to show for his troubles. He was infuriated by a challenge on Victor Moses by Peter Vincenti in the 25th minute and let the Rochdale midfielder know how he felt. Play had continued, however, and Bojan ploughed into the back of Vincenti right under the nose of Martin Atkinson. Both sets of players became involved in the flare-up and Atkinson booked Bojan and Vincenti while Moses received treatment on his ankle. Matt Done breaks through the Stoke defence as Rochdale create a rare chance . Done sees his shot saved by Jack Butland and Rochdale would go on to rue the missed opportunity . The Rochdale fans who had applauded Bojan’s strike immediately turned on him and jeered with delight when he went down in the home penalty box moments later. There was no apparent challenge on the Stoke player but Hughes took no chances, sending on Stephen Ireland while Bojan was booed all the way as he walked around the perimeter of the pitch and down the tunnel. Hughes also exchanged words with some of the Rochdale fans behind the dugouts during the half as he became increasingly animated over some of the decisions and, one would presume his team’s performance. They only managed three shots on target in the first half compared to Rochdale’s eight. The difference in class was reflected in the finishing, however, and Stoke scored a second goal seven minutes after the restart. Ireland doubled Stoke's advantage in the second half to leave them firmly in the driving seat . Victor Moses squeezed a shot in from near the byline to add gloss to Stoke's victory at Rochdale . There appeared to be no imminent danger when Moses took possession on the left-hand side of the box, but he produced a sudden turn of pace to create the space for a cross and guided the ball in low for Ireland who had timed his run perfectly to score from close-range. The former Manchester City midfielder has been something of a lucky mascot for Stoke in this season’s competition, having scored his only other two goals in the 3-1 win over Wrexham. Moses added a wonderful third as he jinked his way into the box again and this time beat Lillis himself with a curling effort into the top corner. Rhys Bennett got a consolation 12 minutes from time when he capitalised on Stoke’s failure to clear the danger and side-footed in from 10 yards but Jonathan Walters restored the visitor's three-goal lead with seconds remaining. So no more shocks. But no shame at all for the underdogs either. Rhys Bennett fired home in the final minutes to score a consolation for League One Rochdale .

"At least they weren’t knocked out. Liverpool’s fans can be thankful for that at least on arguably the grimmest day for ‘giant’ teams in FA Cup history after their team played out this stalemate to keep themselves in the competition, pending a replay at Bolton of the Championship. The club from the lower level thoroughly deserve a second shot at a scalp, not least because of the multiple heroics of goalkeeper Adam Bogdan, magnificent as he thwarted the hosts time and again. Referee Kevin Friend made two poor decisions just after the break, first giving Liverpool a free-kick after Manquillo tripped Darren Pratley. Then he failed to give Liverpool anything when Mills tripped Markovic running into the box. Whether this was to even things up quickly, or because Mills was already on a yellow card, or just in error - who knows?

Then his shot deflected off Moxey for a corner, leading to a double attempt from Coutinho in the 57th minute, both blocked. Moments later Coutinho shot again; the excellent Bogdan saving before Manquillo blasted wide a follow-up. Heskey, meanwhile, was subbed off to warm applause from all, a few minutes before Gudjohnsen skied an effort in sight of goal. Bogdan kept frustrating Liverpool, saving wonderfully from Fabio Borini. Before kick-off, neutrals might reasonably have expected this match to provide one of the more eyebrow-raising outcomes of the day. No Premier League club since the top-division revamp in 1992-93 has been knocked out of the FA Cup by opponents from a lower division more than Liverpool: eight times. Bolton themselves did it in 1993, winning 2-0 at Anfield, and were followed by Bristol City in 1994, Blackburn in 2000 and Crystal Palace in 2003 (all at Anfield), then in 2005 by Burnley (at Burnley), in 2008 by Barnsley and in 2010 by Reading (both at Anfield) and by Oldham at Oldham two years ago. So an upset of a team without their rested talisman Steven Gerrard, being kept fresh for League Cup duty against Chelsea on Tuesday, by Neil Lennon’s revitalised Bolton, wasn’t totally out of the question. Emile Heskey shows a clean pair of heels to Mamadou Sakho as the 37-year-old striker makes an unexpected return to Anfield . Heskey has a smile on his face as he is substituted by boss Neil Lennon in the 56th minute for Conor Wilkinson . Former Chelsea team-mates Glen Johnson and Eidur Gudjohnsen were on opposing sides as they scrap for possession . But on a day of some of the most seismic shocks in the grand history of the world’s oldest football competition, not least at Chelsea and Manchester City, whatever happened here was never likely be more surprising. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers made five changes to the starting XI who drew 1-1 in the first leg of their League Cup semi last midweek, replacing Martin Skrtel, Lucas, Alberto Moreno, Lazar Markovic and Gerrard with Glen Johnson, Jose Enrique, Javier Manquillo, Adam Lallana and Joe Allen. Lennon made changes to the Bolton line-up who won 2-1 away at Sheffield Wednesday last weekend, with Adam Bogdan, Dean Moxey and Eidur Gudjohnsen coming in for Andy Lonergan, David Wheater and Mark Davies.

Jordan Henderson battles for the ball with Neil Danns and Darren Pratley as the contest begins to heat up . Northern Irishmen Brendan Rodgers and Neil Lennon are close and the pair share a moment before kick-off . Gudjohnsen, 36, whose first English club was Bolton when he arrived from Reykjavik 17 years ago, was partnered up front with another blast from the past, Emile Heskey, 37, who almost 15 years ago was Liverpool’s most expensive ever purchase to that point, costing £11m from Leicester. Both forwards have had long and winding careers, Gudjohnsen at Chelsea and Barcelona among 13 clubs on his CV, and Heskey at Birmingham, Wigan, Aston Villa and Newcastle Jets in Australia before an unlikely comeback - having been playing Masters football for Liverpool’s old boys. Heskey’s last goal at Anfield was in May 2004 for Liverpool in a league win over Middlesbrough while Gudjohnsen last scored here for Barca in a Champions League win in March 2007. The away fans let off a smoke bomb during the game in the hope of providing a background for another FA Cup upset .

The Kop was in good voice ahead of the game with flags and banners unfurled by the home fans . Bolton started well, dominating the early possession and keeping the hosts mostly in their own half before Matt Mills’ 11th-minute shot, laid on by Heskey, was the first clear sign of danger. At the other end Bogdan then saved from Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho before a strong run from Jose Enrique down the left, holding off Liam Feeney, ended with a cross that flew woefully high and wide. Raheem Sterling took a while to grow into the match but by the half hour was buzzing on the edge of the Bolton box, running and shooting, with Mills blocking. Bolton best first-half chance came from a Feeney cross from the right, headed down to Dean Moxey, who hit thunderous shot that swerved just wide of the left post. Glen Johnson had his own powerful strike held by Bogdan minutes later, as did Lallana shortly after. Another former Liverpool old boy, Jay Spearing, might have conceded a penalty for a push on Jordan Henderson, who was bearing down on goal in the 81st minute.

"As Tomas Rosicky made his way off at the final whistle, two security guards hurried out of the tunnel and placed a shiny FA Cup on a plinth by the side of the pitch. The temptation for Arsenal’s captain, after this dreamy individual performance, was to be done with it and raise the trophy aloft in front of 4,000 travelling supporters. Rosicky dragged the holders through, steering Arsenal in to the fifth round after this hard-working Brighton team had twice threatened to make a real Cup tie of it. Arsenal’s 34-year-old midfielder had a cigar on out there, playing this fourth round tie as if it were an exhibition match.

Attendance: 30,278 . *Match ratings by Neil Ashton at the Amex Stadium . ‘If you love football, you love Rosicky,’ purred Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger and he was right. Some of his passing was from a future era. There were five goals at the Amex Stadium and it makes sense to start with the best. Rosicky, rightly, was responsible for it. Before the 59th minute, when Rosicky scored their third, this had been a majestic run through of flicks, backheels and turns that you would expect to witness as part of a training ground warm down. Instead the Arsenal captain was playing for real, starting the move for his volleyed goal with an unfathomable backheeled reverse pass into the feet of Olivier Giroud. It was a Billy Bremner ball with bells on, a glance one way to fool the opposition defence (not difficult with Gordon Greer and Lewis Dunk at the back) and a pass in another direction. Giroud, outstanding again up top for Arsenal, responded with a dinked chip into Rosicky’s field of vision on the edge of the area and he volleyed spectacularly beyond David Stockdale. Rosicky was always one step ahead here, always a fraction quicker to the ball, always able to lift it over the outstretched legs of Sam Baldock, Rohan Ince, the Brighton captain Greer or his central defensive partner Dunk. We are not worthy. The challenge for Arsenal, after keeping Chris Hughton’s team at arm’s length down on the south coast, is to win this trophy for the sixth time in Arsene Wenger’s spell as manager. You cannot put it past them, particularly after Chelsea, Manchester City, Southampton and Tottenham all exited the competition on Saturday. They are just two games away from another Wembley semi-final. The scoreline suggests something a bit tighter, but truth be told Arsenal had slipped effortlessly through the gears in an impressive opening spell. Theo Walcott scored for the first time in a year, syncing up with Calum Chambers when the Arsenal right back burst down the right with just over a minute on the clock. Chambers cut back for Walcott and the Arsenal winger gained a yard or more on Dunk before he drilled an effort beyond Stockdale. They scored again when Rosicky drifted in from the left and allowed time and space to pick out Ozil, unmarked, inside Brighton’s penalty area with his first reverse pass. Midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) turns and shoots to make it 2-0 while under pressure from Brighton defender Lewis Dunk .

By the time Dunk reacted, Ozil had scored for the first time since his return from injury earlier this month. Rosicky had made it, though. To underscore the gulf in class there was a moment between Arsenal’s opening two goals when Mathieu Flamini, Aaron Ramsey and Giroud left Brighton’s players eating grass as they combed through their defence. Beyond that Walcott, who temporarily traded wings with Rosicky, could have had a penalty towards the end of the half when Bruno Saltor raised his hands inside the area. For some reason referee Michael Oliver waved play on, something which became a feature of this Cup tie. The Amex Stadium, bursting at the seams with a record attendance of just over 30,000, had fallen flat. Those blue and white scarves needed a lift and they got it when Brighton’s journeyman forward Chris O’Grady scored five minutes after the break. Arsenal failed to clear, with Nacho Monreal’s awkward, skied clearance making its way over the other side of the penalty area towards Chambers. The Arsenal defender failed to deal with it and O’Grady finished sweetly inside Wojciech Szczesny’s near post. Game on, we thought.

Finally the Amex stirred, with those Brighton fans belting out their Sussex by the Sea melody as they went after this Arsenal team. Instead, Wenger’s team pulled clear again when Rosicky scored Arsenal’s third with that volley in the 59th minute in front of their approving fans. To their credit Brighton responded again, scoring for a second time when Sam Baldock combined with Danny Holla to clip his effort beyond the onrushing figure of Szczesny in the 75th minute. Wenger sent for protection, bringing on Alexis Sanchez to stretch the Brighton defence (again, never difficult) and adding Francis Coquelin to screening duties in front of Arsenal’s back four. They survived when Chambers handled, but it was inconceivable for the defender to move his left hand out of the way when Adrian Calunga kicked the ball straight at him. The tie was still well within Arsenal’s grasp and with a little help from Rosicky, they ran down the clock and made sure they are in the draw for the fifth round. Crazy as it seems but he has only won the FA Cup once since his move to the Emirates in 2006, but Arsenal are favourites to retain the FA Cup now.

'It was a great performance, definitely no complaints,' he added after beating Raonic in exactly two hours. 'I returned very well, tried to get as many balls back in play. Some games I had to just let it go and wait for the opportunities and when they are presented obviously try to use them and that's what I've done. 'There are not many tournaments where I have just dropped serve once so I should enjoy it. It feels like Boris Becker on the court. Now I know how he feels.' That was a reference to Djokovic's coach, who nevertheless came in for some light-hearted criticism for leaving the court to answer a call of nature in the first game of the third set. 'Like everyone he has a need to go to the toilet which I understand... but in the moment I had a break point and I thought he was guilty for me not using that break point,' Djokovic joked. A subdued Raonic added: 'He just didn't allow me to organise my game. Even when he was returning well, by the end of the match he was doing a good job of playing deep and never allowing me to go forward. 'Obviously if you watch the footage, he was pretty much on the baseline the whole time and I was further back.'

Djokovic raises his hands in the air after completing a comprehensive victory but can expect a tougher time against Wawrinka . Earlier in the day, Wawrinka defeated fifth seed Nishikori 6-3 6-4 7-6 (8/6) in two hours and four minutes and has dropped just one set in making the last four. Nishikori had won their previous encounter, also in the quarter-finals of a grand slam, in five sets on his way to the final of the US Open at Flushing Meadows last year. But fourth seed Wawrinka dominated Wednesday's match from the outset and his only nervous moments came when Nishikori saved five match points from 6-1 down in the tie-break. Wawrinka eventually took his sixth match point with his 20th ace and believes he is a better player with more belief than when he won here 12 months ago. 'I'm more aggressive. I have more confidence with my game when I come to the net,' Wawrinka said. 'I know that now I have a grand slam at home. I won the Davis Cup also (with Switzerland). 'I have the confidence from that. I know I can make it. I trust my game. I trust myself on the court even when we start to play semi-final or final in a grand slam.

Nishikori admitted he paid for a slow start and could regret an audacious attempted drop shot which gave Wawrinka his sixth match point. 'I was struggling on my serve and that's why I couldn't get a good rhythm in the first and second set,' he said. 'The tie-breaker was really close. If I could get that one, it might change the whole thing. But, you know, he was serving really well until end of the set. 'So I think I have to give him credit. He obviously played really aggressive and played great tennis.'","World No 1 Novak Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open with 7-6 6-4 6-2 defeat of Milos Raonic .

"Faced with the explosive talent of Nick Kyrgios and his wall of Australian support, Andy Murray was so calm and clinical. Whatever was thrown at him he soaked it up, like a seasoned football team executing its plan away from home and carving out the result, in this case a 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 quarter-final win over the local hero. Having slain the Australian teenager to make his fifth semi-final at Melbourne Park, Murray was gracious in his on-court interview, impressing the crowd with warm words about Kyrgios’s future.

Kyrgios covers himself as Murray strikes down on him at the net during a dominant display in Melbourne . Murray looks to the sky and points his fingers upwards after reaching the Australian Open semi-finals . The No 6 seed performs a typical fist pumping celebration after winning a decisive point in the match . It was only later, when facing questions about his next opponent Tomas Berdych and his new coach Dani Vallverdu — Murray’s long-time friend and former chief lieutenant — that he became slightly prickly. Vallverdu’s presence on the Czech’s team, just two months after he finished five years with the 27-year-old Scot’s team, provides a fascinating subtext to Thursday’s match. Privileged inside information will be traded. But Murray is trying not to see it that way and disingenuously claimed that in other sports people do not talk about opposition coaches and managers. ‘My goal isn’t to beat Dani, my goal is to beat Berdych, so I don’t think about that,’ he said. ‘We’ll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are. But I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych’s game because he’s told me, so it works both ways. I’m happy to talk about Berdych and what his strengths and weaknesses are, but I don’t want to discuss what Dani does well and doesn’t do well, because I’m not playing him.’ Thereafter he reeled off the world No 7’s attributes, such as his height, strength and flat ballstriking ability, and how he must be playing well. That is true, for the newly-engaged Berdych has made it through without dropping a set and dismissed Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, although the Spaniard — short of matches and possibly injured — was woefully out of touch in the first two sets.

Berdych's coach Dani Vallverdu is Murray’s long-time friend and former chief lieutenant . Vallverdu (right) will be in Berdych's corner for his Australian Open clash with Murray . Murray showed admirable fortitude against the youthful zest of Kyrgios but, whatever the circumstances, will feel more vulnerable against Berdych. The 29-year-old holds a 4-2 career record against him, and there have been matches in which he has found his easy power difficult to handle. Now there is the emotional dimension of having his one-time ally plotting against him, the Venezuelan boy who befriended him as an adolescent at their tennis academy in Barcelona and who knows him, warts and all. In his exclusive interview with Sportsmail last week, Vallverdu went out of his way to stay classy, declaring that he would ‘always be in Andy’s corner, except if I am coaching against him’. He also endorsed the hiring of Amelie Mauresmo as head coach last summer, even though he was hurt at not being kept informed about the hiring. The one thing he has taken exception to is Murray’s suggestion that not everyone in the team was pulling in the same direction towards the end of last year.

Amelie Mauresmo is Murray's new coach and will be in his corner for the Australian Open match . What you know is that the gloves will be off as he sits at opposite ends of the stadium to his former colleagues on Thursday (at about 8.30am in the UK), and Murray will need to show the same resolve as he did against Kyrgios. It could be argued that, for all its breathtaking skill and athleticism, the rivalries in the men’s game can be a little too cordial at times. The untamed demeanour of the 19-year-old Australian has been a welcome blast of refreshment here. He had no option but to come out blasting against Murray and try to feed off the crowd, though they are fundamentally well-disposed towards Murray here. Instead he found his game brilliantly neutered by the master tactician on an evening when at least the chill temperatures will have made the Scot feel at home. Murray slowed down his opponent’s quick tempo between points, and prevented him from teeing off with a subtle mix of pace, angles and slices, including some feathered drop-shots. Not only that but the Scot’s serve was outstanding, and his 13 aces outscored by four the man who came into the match having hit the most in the tournament. Kim Sears celebrates wildly as Murray takes control of the match in blustery conditions in Melbourne . Murray's girlfriend Sears takes her seat for one of the more comfortable afternoons of watching her boyfriend . Judy Murray will also be backing her son when he faces Berdych in Melbourne . To add to his deflation, at 2-5 Kyrgios was given an audible obscenity violation, having cursed his way through his previous match without punishment. There was inconsistency in that, and the way he escaped censure when smashing his racket in the tiebreak. Memorably, Murray had played an exquisite running lob to stop his momentum in that, and then he performed another on set point to clinch it 7-5. It was a glorious example of touch and technique, and clarity of thought, under enormous pressure. Kyrgios, whose brief charge in the third set was undone by some extraordinary flicks from Murray off the baseline, will come again. Asked where he would like to be when he returns here next year he responded drily: ‘Melbourne.’ Nadal, who denied he was injured, needs more matches, and he will get them next month when he heads to clay-court events in South America. But his defeat will still have served as a boost to the sometimes brittle Berdych, who had lost to him 17 consecutive times. For all sorts of reasons Murray will have masses of motivation when they meet, and so will he.

"This week, a tournament here on one of his favourite courses; next week, a Dublin courtroom for an explosive legal battle. For the next four days, Rory McIlroy is the star attraction at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic. Next Tuesday he is suing his former management company and being countersued, with millions of euros at stake. For months McIlroy has insisted he has had no problem separating these two worlds: that what might happen in court has been no distraction. Rory McIlroy plays a shot during the Pro-Am event ahead of the Dubai Desert Classic . World No 1 admits his legal battle with former management group has been a 'nasty process' The Northern Irishman insists that performing in Dubai is more important to him than his dispute . His stunning sequence of results rather bears that out but with the court case now so close, he admits it is becoming harder not to let the mind wander. ‘It is not really something you want hanging over your head,’ said the world No 1. ‘It is a shame it has gone this far but it’s hard when two sides see things completely differently. ‘The only way seems to be to get a judge to sort it out and tell us what to do. Hopefully it will not take too long and that it will be all over and done with and we can all move on. ‘It has been a very tedious and nasty process at times. I’m looking forward to heading to the States with it off my mind and not having to deal with it or think about it.’ After Dubai, McIlroy will head to the US with the chance of completing a career Grand Slam at the Masters . Can he go four days here without thinking about it? It should help that this is a place filled with happy memories. ‘I first played in this event as an amateur 10 years ago, which is hard to imagine,’ he said. ‘Then I had my first pro victory here, so I guess this was the place where it all began. I think when you get your first win you move to a different level and that victory proved the basis for what I have gone on to achieve in the last six years. ‘So let’s see what we can do this week. It would certainly be nice to return to the victory trail. It does feel like a long time since my last win. McIlroy lines up with a collection of Europe's finest golfers ahead of the tournament . ‘But I am comfortable on this course and so hopefully I can head off to America with a win under my belt.’ McIlroy will play three events in the States in the build-up to the Masters, when he will be trying to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth golfer to complete the career Grand Slam. ‘This feels like the week when the golf season has well and truly begun,’ he said. ‘In Phoenix you’ve got Tiger playing and Phil Mickelson, while here we’ve got a great field with Henrik (Stenson), Martin (Kaymer), Sergio (Garcia) and G-Mac. And it won’t be long before the Masters rolls along.’ He’s right about that. But it might feel like a long time next week.

"Hashim Amla and Rilee Roussow scored centuries in a mammoth third-wicket stand as South Africa wrapped up their one-day series with West Indies with a convincing 131-run win. Amla made 133 and Roussow 132 with the pair combining to put on 247 for the third wicket, a record for South Africa in one-day internationals. Despite only having 42 overs following a rain delay, South Africa made 361 for five, a target which proved way out of reach for West Indies who made 230 all out; the tone of their innings set when Chris Gayle went first ball. Hashim Amla (left) and Rilee Roussow (right) both scored centuries as South Africa beat the West Indies . Denesh Ramdin (left) of the Windies looks on as Roussow helped South Africa to post 361 for five . They plodded on, but when Wayne Parnell took four wickets in two overs, they were blown apart. Consequently, South Africa take the series 3-1 and head to the World Cup in good heart. After a rain delay that cost a little over two hours of play and eight overs a side, West Indies won the toss and put South Africa into bat, hoping for some difficult batting conditions early on. It appeared they had got their wish as they picked up early wickets thanks to some extra bounce. Quinton de Kock went in only the second over, caught at point off Jason Holder for just four, and South Africa were at 59 for two when Faf du Plessis went to another short ball, caught by Sheldon Cottrell at deep fine leg off Andre Russell. But that brought Roussow and Amla together, and they punished the West Indian attack repeatedly with some huge shots. Roussow's 132 - his second international century after his 128 in Johannesburg 10 days ago - included eight sixes and came off just 98 balls while Amla had six maximums in his 133, which came off 105 balls. Windies' captain Darren Sammy (left) shakes Amla's hand after his side were bowled out for 260 runs . The partnership was finally ended in the 39th over as Roussow pulled a short ball to deep midwicket where Jonathan Carter snared the catch to give Russell a second wicket. Two overs later, Russell got Amla too as the Proteas opener dragged the ball on to his stump. David Miller made a quick 23 off 16 balls - including two sixes - before edging Holder behind while JP Duminy contributed an unbeaten 18 and Farhann Behardien five before the 42 overs were up. Faced with a huge target, West Indies were going to need a big hand from Gayle - but instead saw their hopes effectively ended when he was out to the opening delivery from Kyle Abbott. The ball was initially ruled a wide but South Africa reviewed it, finding the delivery to be legitimate and Gayle to have got an edge. Without him, the West Indies were struggling to keep up with the required run rate. Quinton de Kock (left) of South Africa looks on as Narsingh Deonarine plays a shot during the ODI . South Africa believed they had Narsingh Deonarine out in the 12th over when he ducked under a short ball from Parnell and reviewed the decision, but replays showed it struck the elbow guard and not the glove. They had a wicket to celebrate soon enough however, with Dwayne Smith out in the next over, lbw to Aaron Phangiso for 31. Deonarine then lost his wicket to a horrible run out, going for 42 with West Indies on 81 for three. Marlon Samuels got a huge inside edge but though it missed the stumps, Deonarine was wildly optimistic in calling for a single and paid with his wicket when sent back by Samuels. Samuels at least made amends as he hung around for a stand of 91 with Denesh Ramdin, their partnership ending when he was cleaned up by Abbott for 50. South Africa batsman Francois du Plessis plays a shot into the open field during the match . Ramdin followed four runs later, giving Parnell the first of his four for 42, with the same bowler removing Jonathan Carter - caught at third man - for a duck in the same over. The wheels were coming off now and Russell nicked Parnell behind for 24, with the bowler's hot streak then wrapped up by his snaring of Holder. Darren Sammy - dropped on his first ball - at least clubbed a late 27 to take the score to what it was, but after Carlos Braithwaite edged De Lange behind and Sammy was bowled by Farhaan Behardien, the game was up.

"It was by any standards an unlikely and quite bizarre foray into the turbulent world of Twitter. So what could possibly have prompted Stuart Broad to pass comment on the minimum wage? Who could he be referring to? Already on this tour we have had the Eoin Morgan blackmail plot and now came another unexpected twist to life with the England cricket team when Broad found himself having to defend comments on the worldwide strength of English pay levels. Yes, really. Stuart Broad tried to calm the Twitter storm over his unlikely comments on the minimum wage . England bowler Broad walks with his partner Bealey Mitchell in Perth, Australia, on Tuesday . There was only one conclusion to be reached here in scorching hot Western Australia and that was that Broad, one of the players attacked by Kevin Pietersen in his controversial autobiography, was having a subtle dig at his bête noire. It was Pietersen, of course, who caused another rumble here last weekend with his comments about the need for changes to the structure of the domestic game and his belief that only the fittest should survive in county cricket. ‘Muppets that only earn £15 to £18 grand should either get better or get out and do something else,’ Pietersen had said. So was that what caused Broad, who was accused of bullying by Pietersen in his book and of ‘not being the sharpest,’ to have a dabble in the world of financial politics? No, insisted Broad, who had tweeted ‘I’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in England you’re in the 10 per cent top earners in the world. #Stay #Humble. ‘It was genuinely innocent,’ said Broad at the end of another long and gruelling England training session in temperatures touching 40 degrees. ‘I heard that stat and I was quite surprised and amazed at the size of the world. Broad takes part in a fitness drill and a nets session at the WACA with England on Tuesday . ‘That was all that was in it. I put two more tweets out to try and clarify and emphasise that I didn’t meant any offence if anyone took it that way. He even came to Pietersen’s defence over what were, to be fair, constructive comments about the best way forward for Twenty20 cricket in England. ‘To back him up a bit he does use that word (muppet) about himself sometimes,’ said Broad at the WACA. ‘But the development role in the county game is very important. No-one’s going to come in and start on big wages. ‘You have to earn your stripes. I think that figure Kevin used is a bit below the minimum earned anyway so it was a bit off the mark. I don’t think he meant any offence by it. It was just a little bit misguided I think.’ At times like this you do wonder why on earth any public figure would get involved in Twitter. All it seems to bring them is a torrent of abuse when they attempt to say anything even vaguely different. But Broad has not been put off. ‘I don’t look at my mentions on Twitter so I didn’t see the response,’ he said. ‘I only heard second hand. There’s a notification thing where you can only see it when people you follow mention you. The people I follow weren’t that bothered about it to be honest. Bowler Chris Jordan (left) and Broad get put through their paces in the Australian sun . ‘We’re quite lucky in the abuse we receive compared to footballers. I’ d hate to see Wayne Rooney’s Twitter mentions after he’s lost a game. It’s part and parcel of the world now. You’re more open to everything, aren’t you? It wasn’t a mistake. It was just a genuine comment and I didn’t think about the other side of it. The stay humble hash tag was aimed at myself to remind us how lucky we are. Maybe I misjudged it a bit but hopefully it will die down a bit now.’ Broad was far more comfortable talking about his return to the England side after knee surgery that caused him to miss the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas. He has appeared to be easing his way back here in the tri-series which precedes the World Cup. ‘Four and a half months is a long lay off and I think when you get back you grow with every game,’ he said. ‘I’ve got a lot of experience but there’s nothing like getting out in the middle. Realistically I can look at my performances and say I’ve bowled one or two too many bad balls and given away cheap fours which you can’t afford to do in one-day cricket now. ‘I also know that I’ve gone through games where I haven’t taken wickets and then picked up a handful so hopefully come semi-final and final time in the World Cup it will be my chance to shine.’ His pace has been down here so now, with Broad bowling at no more than 81 or 82 miles per hour for the most part, and that man Pietersen for one said at the weekend that he was a bit concerned about England’s match-winning bowler. Broad insists there is no cause for alarm. ‘A bit of extra pace comes with the rhythm and the match feeling I suppose. I feel like I’m running in nicely and I’ve had no problems with the knee whatsoever. And I’ve had quite a decent workload. It’s been good to be involved again. Broad, pictured during England's recent ODI against Australia, has come in for criticism for his tweet . Broad bowls during England's defeat to Australia in their Tri-Series match in Hobart last week . He is looking forward to tomorrow’s match here against India which will see the winners take on Australia on Sunday in the tri-series final. ‘Perth is where you want to bowl as a tall bowler so hopefully we can do to India what we did to them in Brisbane. I’ve not taken the wickets I want to up to now but I feel I’m delivering what’s in my mind. The way one-day cricket is, wickets will come to you when it’s your time. When it’s your day you have to cash in.’ While Broad and Jimmy Anderson are easing their way back after injury, Chris Woakes and Steven Finn have impressed for England. ‘You only need to look at the amount of wickets Woakes has taken in the last 15 or 20 one-day internationals,’ said Broad. ‘He’s done fantastically well and I think from watching him in the nets he’s developed a bit more of a snap at the crease. That has given him a bit more pace and I hope he can take that form into the World Cup. ‘But the biggest change in confidence is in Finny. Just the way he’ s been around the group. He’s more chirpy. His head is up a lot more. He’s a lot clearer on what he wants to work on in the nets and it was great to see him get that five-for in Brisbane. It was just rewards for how he has been improving.’ It is the lack of variety in England’s attack that worries onlookers. ‘Teams have won World Cups without left-armers before,’ said Broad. ‘You can see from Twenty20 stats that they have good records in white ball cricket and every team would want one in their side. But there is enough variety in our attack with the different heights and each bowler has different slower balls and that sort of thing. We’re just looking to put a complete game together.’ And stay humble in the process.","England bowler Stuart Broad posted a controversial message on Twitter .

"Former England and British and Irish Lions winger Mark Cueto will bring his 14-year playing career to an end this season. The long-serving Sale player, who turned 35 on Boxing Day, announced his decision at a press conference at the Sharks' training ground in Manchester on Wednesday. 'The time has finally come to end my career and I would like to thank the owners, the coaches, backroom staff and the office staff who down the years have helped me in my career,' Cueto said. Sale Sharks winger Mark Cueto (centre left) will bring his 14-year playing career to an end this season . 'When I made my debut at Bristol back in 2001, I could hardly have dreamed that I would play for Sale Sharks for 14 seasons, represented my country all over the world and played with and against some of the all-time greats.' Cueto has so far made 294 appearances for Sale and is the all-time leading tryscorer in Aviva Premiership history with 87 tries, having overtaken former Sharks team-mate Steve Hanley's previous best of 75 in 2013. He scored 20 tries in 55 appearances for England, including the World Cups of 2007 and 2011, and toured with the Lions in 2005, playing in the final Test against New Zealand. Cueto has enjoyed success as a England and British and Irish Lions player throughout his career . Cueto will remain with Sale as part of the club's commercial department and will become their first ambassador. Sale chief executive Jonny Kennedy said: 'Mark has been an outstanding player for the club throughout his career. 'A professional sports club rarely experience having the pleasure of retaining a player for their entire career so I'd like to thank Mark for his sterling commitment for the last 14 years. 'His commitment to both club and country are an inspiration to all and are values that will greatly assist him in his business career. 'I'm delighted that Mark is continuing his involvement with the club as an ambassador. He is popular with the sponsors and the fans and will hopefully play a big part in the club's progress in the years to come.'","Mark Cueto will call time on his career later this year .

"Tomas Berdych will face Andy Murray in the Australian Open semi-finals after a hugely impressive takedown of Rafael Nadal. The 29-year-old Czech is the prospective Australian Open semi-final opponent for the winner of the Murray-Kyrgios clash after dismissing the world No 3 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 in two hours and 13 minutes. That brings into play the fascinating prospect of Murray being pitted against his long-time friend and former coach Dani Vallverdu, who has taken over the lead role guiding perennial nearly man Berdych. Tomas Berdych celebrates his straight-sets win over Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open . Nadal was shocked by Berdych as he was beaten in straight sets in the quarter-finals . The 28-year-old Venezuelan had left the employ of Murray in November after nearly five years working together, a decision that he told Sportsmail last week was 'genuinely mutual'. Explaining that the relationship had 'run its course' he added: 'I will always be in Andy's corner, except when I am coaching against him.' Afterwards a delighted Berdych praised his new mentor, saying: 'It has been going really well and I'm really happy with the way we are working together. He has given me a good plan and I'm sticking to it. Berdych started quickly and raced into a two-set lead dropping just two games on the way . Berdych played some excellent tennis - especially in the first two sets . Berdych's box celebrate as their man dominates Spaniard Nadal in their Aussie Open quarter-final while Andy Murray's former coach Dani Vallverdu (bottom right) had his best poker face on . 'Rafa is a great fighter but I stayed focused and kept calm, I was ready for everything.' Just how much impact he has made since they started working together last month – on the recommendation of Ivan Lendl – was evident in the way the Czech tackled his long-time nemesis Nadal, who he continually pushed way out of the court. They had faced each other 21 times before this with Berdych winning only three. Nadal had won the previous seventeen, a remarkable streak going back nine years that included the 2010 Wimbledon final. Nadal did threaten a comeback during the third set - but Berdych held on . Nadal went through a range of emotions through the match . Despite taking the third set to a tie break, Nadal was unable to force his way back into the match . So there was going to be an enormous psychological hurdle to clear if he was going to dismiss the Spaniard and take advantage of his relative ring-rust coming into this event. By finally managing to defeat him again he joined Jo Wilfried Tsonga as the only player to have beaten all of the 'Big Four' (Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Murray) in grand slam play. It helped that Nadal was totally off his game in the most bizarre way during the first two sets, seemingly bereft of energy and losing his first 'bagel' set since 2011. However, he roused himself in the third to give Berdych's notoriously frail nerve a real test. Berdych remained strong in the third-set tiebreak to see it out and progress to the last four . Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova looks relaxed as she watches her boyfriend beat Nadal . But the Czech, who last week became engaged to model Ester Satarova, kept up with those flatly struck groundstrokes executed with his easy power. After missing two match points at 6-5 in the third he went 5-1 up in the tiebreak, was pulled back to 5-4, but just about closed it out 7-5. Should he face Murray then there will be some fascinating dynamics at work. But no extraneous factors will alter the fact that he has made it into the last four without dropping a set, so he will be very formidable and supremely confident. As for Nadal, he clearly needs more matches under his belt – and will probably start getting them next month when he heads to clay court events in South America. Nadal could be seen taking a tablet early in the third set but he denied, despite his early sluggishness, having any physical issues, saying it was ‘nothing important’.","Tomas Berdych beat Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 at the Australian Open .

"Russia's Ekaterina Makarova reached her second successive grand slam semi-final on Tuesday, defeating third seed Simona Halep in straight sets in the Australian Open. Makarova, who lost to eventual winner Serena Williams in the last four of the US Open last year, needed just 69 minutes to overpower Halep 6-4, 6-0 in the day's first quarter-final on Rod Laver Arena. Neither player had lost a set in the previous four rounds but it was Makarova who always looked the most likely winner, racing into a 3-0 lead with two breaks of serve as Halep committed a string of unforced errors. Ekaterina Makarova celebrates beating Simona Halep and booking her spot in the semi-finals . Halep was blown away in the second set and was beaten 6-4, 6-0 . The 23-year-old Romanian did recover one of the breaks to register her first game and held to trail 2-4, but could not find another breakthrough as Makarova made the most of her swinging left-handed serve. The No 11 seed Makarova, 26, then cruised through the second set to set up a semi-final with either second seed Maria Sharapova or seventh seed Eugenie Bouchard. Makarova was in dominant form as she blasted her way into the semi-finals in 69 minutes . Halep had no answers as she was comprehensively beaten by Makarova . 'It's a great feeling, I'm so happy that I came through,' Makarova said in an on-court interview. 'She is a tough opponent and I lost to her (in their only previous meeting) two years ago. She never gives up, she is always fighting and every point is long. 'It was really tough and I am happy that I stayed solid and in my game. 'I was used to being in quarter-finals (in grand slams) so now I have to get used to being in semi-finals.' Makarova and Halep shake hands at the end of their quarter final match . Makarova looks happy as she signs autographs for fans at the end of her quarter final . Halep admitted she lost belief in the second set, adding: 'I practised very well in the morning, but maybe I was a little bit too stressed before I started the match. I had a bad day but she played well and everything was in for her so she deserves to win. 'I'm really sad a little bit now that I could not play my tennis, my game, but that's tennis and I have to look forward to the next tournament. 'I cannot say (it was) pressure. Just I was a little bit stressed. I don't know why. I had experience from last year of playing quarter-finals, so it doesn't mean that I felt pressure. 'But sometimes you cannot manage the situation, just mentally because during the points maybe I didn't fight very well today. I just lost my concentration to win the points, to win the match. So I didn't believe any more in the second set, and that's maybe why I lost 6-0.'","Ekaterina Makarova beat Simona Halep 6-4, 6-0 .

"Sebastian Vettel thought about quitting Formula One last year, according to his then Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. The 2014 season was Vettel’s annus horribilis – he failed to win a race and was outscored and outshone by his new team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who won three races. And on Tuesday Horner  spelt out the extent of Vettel’s dejection, saying: ‘Sebastian didn’t like the regulation change. He didn’t enjoy the new engine, the feel from the power unit or the lack of downforce. Sebastian Vettel finished last season's Formula One season empty-handed after four years as champion . Team-mate Daniel Ricciardo won three races, while Vettel did not pick up a victory for the whole campaign . ‘It was like someone had taken his toy away and it took him a while to get to grips with that. Then his team-mate delivered, and that wasn’t something he was used to. ‘He went through a period of disillusion about the direction Formula One was going and he was outspoken about that. 'There was probably a stage last year when he thought about whether he wanted to stop or not, whether he was getting the same level of enjoyment and whether he wanted to continue.’ Vettel, 27, decided to join Ferrari, leaving Red Bull to pair Ricciardo with Toro Rosso’s 20-year-old Russian Daniil Kvyat. They will both take to the track next week in Jerez for the first pre-season test. ‘Sebastian’s boyhood hero was Michael (Schumacher) and the lure of Ferrari for any driver – the brand and the mystique – is immensely powerful,’ added Horner, whose once rock-solid relationship with Vettel weakened last season. ‘He is still a young guy and a tremendous amount has gone on his life in a short period of time. It was question of giving him the space to come to his own conclusions.' Vettel was used to winning (pictured in October 2013) and it was as if he 'lost his toy' last season, said Horner . Christian Horner revealed that Vettel had considered quitting F1 after not enjoying his last season at Red Bull .","Sebastian Vettel ended last season empty-handed, after being champion for four years in a row and winning 13 Grand Prix in 2013 .

"Williams have handed promising British driver Alex Lynn a boost in his bid to become a Formula One driver. Lynn last season was crowned champion of GP3, one of the main feeder series to F1, and this year will drive in GP2 with one of the primary title-contending teams in DAMS. To further assist the 21-year-old from Essex, Williams have appointed Lynn as their development driver for this season. Williams have handed promising British driver Alex Lynn a boost in his bid to become a Formula One driver . Lynn, pictured here in 2013, won last season's GP3 and will race in GP2 next season . In the role Lynn will focus on using the team's simulation tools to help with the ongoing development of the new car, the FW37, as well as assist in its setting up ahead of each grand prix. Lynn will also get behind the wheel of the car for one day's testing in Barcelona following the Spanish Grand Prix in May. A delighted Lynn said: 'I hope with a strong year in GP2, while also helping to develop the F1 car throughout this season, I can follow in the footsteps of Valtteri Bottas who joined Williams in exactly the same development driver role. 'Through hard work and determination, he has gone from winning the GP3 title to earning his place as a Williams F1 race driver. Williams have become the first team to unveil images of their 2015 Formula One challenger . Valtteri Bottas (above) and Felipe Massa have both been retained for the upcoming campaign . 'Working with people like Sir Frank Williams and Pat Symonds is an incredible opportunity for me. 'There is so much experience here at Williams and I hope to be able to use the knowledge gained from these people to further develop my skills as a racing driver and respected member of this team.' Highlighting Lynn's potential, deputy team principal Claire Williams said: 'As a British team we are always on the lookout for emerging home-grown talent and Alex has caught our eye with his impressive performances in GP3. 'He has been chosen on merit, and we are confident alongside Felipe (Massa), Valtteri and Susie (Wolff), Alex will help play an important role in making sure the FW37 shows continuous improvement over the course of the 2015 season.'","British youngster Alex Lynn won GP3 last season .

"Jason Roy smashed a stunning century to set England Lions on course to take a 2-0 lead in their one-day series against South Africa A, although they were given a fright by the home opener Reeza Hendricks. Roy, who had top-scored in the low-scoring opening match in Bloemfontein with 43, piled into the South Africa A bowlers on a Kimberley pitch which justified its reputation as a batsmen's paradise, hitting 13 fours and six sixes after the Lions had been put in. The Surrey opener made 141, his first Lions century and his highest score in 50-over cricket, from only 110 balls before he was dismissed in the 40th over, ending a second-wicket stand of 198 in 26 overs with his captain James Vince. Jason Roy top-scored for England Lions with 141 as they beat South Africa A by 141 runs on Wednesday . Roy's innings helped England on their way to posting 376 for nine as they claimed a 2-0 one-day series lead . Vince fell agonisingly short of his second century of the tour six overs later, adjudged lbw for 99 from 95 balls, and although wickets tumbled late in the innings, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes maintained the momentum for an imposing total of 376 for nine. There seemed a real danger that would not be enough as Hendricks and Dean Elgar responded with an opening stand of 142 inside 18 overs under the Diamond Oval floodlights. It was Lancashire left-arm spinner Stephen Parry, making his first appearance of the tour, who dragged the Lions back into the match with a tidy spell which earned him the wickets of Elgar, for 66 from 59 balls, and Dane Vilas. Liam Plunkett then claimed one wicket and Mark Wood a couple, but it was Stokes who finally removed Hendricks, driving to cover in the 37th over after making 141, the same score as Roy, from four balls fewer with 14 fours and five sixes. Alex Less readies himself to hit the ball during the match in Kimberley on Wednesday . Harry Gurney also took two wickets before Plunkett returned to claim the last two and end with three for 73 as South Africa A were dismissed for 306 in the 45th over, but Parry remained comfortably the most economical bowler. The Lions now have the first of three chances to clinch the series in Potchefstroom on Saturday, when South Africa's World Cup wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is expected to boost the home team as he looks for match practice after an ankle injury. Tim Bresnan could come into contention for the Lions, as the Yorkshire all-rounder flew into Johannesburg on Wednesday, and Sam Billings hopes to recover from the nasty illness which ruled him out in Kimberley.

"Premier League teams envied Milan's giants. Now Italians are poor relations . Louis van Gaal now knows what it is like to be an English manager. He is suffering from the same issue that affects his contemporaries from these shores: familiarity. Breeds contempt, you know. That’s why whenever an English-born manager’s name is put forward for a job, the phone-ins and message boards come alight and folk armed with a hundred negatives discuss the candidate’s uselessness. A foreign name, not so much. A poll in the Newcastle Chronicle on Tuesday suggested 97 per cent of Newcastle United fans would be happy if Frank de Boer got the job. That’s a bad result for Steve McClaren. Yet McClaren was well regarded at Manchester United by Sir Alex Ferguson, won a trophy and got Middlesbrough to a European final, won the league in Holland and is doing an excellent job at Derby County. He is clearly a talented coach. Frank de Boer (centre) got the seal of approval from Newcastle fans in a local newspaper poll . The problem is we know too much. We know that he failed to get England to the European Championships in 2008, that Middlesbrough’s UEFA Cup run had more than an air of good fortune, and that he lost a play-off final with Derby last May. We know every flaw and mis-step. It is not the same with De Boer. The odd Dutch football obsessive aside, what we know is what we read: a record four consecutive Eredivisie titles with Ajax. And that is impressive. But it’s a line in a c.v. We do not have intimate knowledge of De Boer’s career. We might catch Ajax in the odd Champions League tie, or on a highlights package, but we do not know every nuance or twist in the plot. Did Ajax have more money to spend than their rivals? Were they already well set up when De Boer inherited the team? Did other teams have complications, injuries or money issues? And why are Ajax now trailing PSV Eindhoven by six points? For all we know, McClaren’s title win at FC Twente may be regarded as a greater achievement than a manager claiming another prize for mighty Ajax. No English manager will ever get a 97 per cent approval rating coming into a job because we have familiarity, and Van Gaal is suffering from that now. Former England manager Steve McClaren led unfashionable FC Twente to the Dutch title back in 2010 . He arrived at Manchester United as a genius because of his work at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich — some of the greatest clubs in the world. Yet we only have half an eye on those games — we hear Van Gaal is top of the league again and the excellence of his performance is presumed. We thought the same of Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich last season — right up until the moment his team were swept aside by Real Madrid. That one tie didn’t make Guardiola a failure — but it did demonstrate that no manager stands up to incessant scrutiny. Not even the very best. Now we are watching every minute of every game, it turns out Van Gaal is human, too. His team can’t break down Cambridge United away; his defence is unconvincing; he is not getting the best out of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria’s first season is inconsistent; occasionally, of late, his record has been compared questioningly with that of David Moyes. A British manager would be under siege by now — with every past mistake and failing exhumed and examined for clues. Louis van Gaal commiserates Robin van Persie after Manchester United were held to a 0-0 draw by Cambridge . When Moyes took over from Ferguson, he did so dragging a whole heap of baggage. We knew he had never won a trophy, or managed beyond the qualifying round of the Champions League. We knew his Everton teams had a reputation for caution and that he was not renowned for his decisiveness in the transfer market. So when the odd flaw appeared, it was instantly seized upon, the critics armed with a filing cabinet of prior knowledge. At Real Sociedad, Moyes has the benefit of being the foreign coach. Few will have studied Everton’s games, or even seen much of what went on at Manchester United. They will have been sold a c.v. that showed Everton as perennial relegation candidates when he took over, and as a strong, established club near the top of the table when he left. They won’t have all the footnotes and clarification available to an English football fan. Go back to 2000 and Sven Goran Eriksson was hailed as a master tactician, on the back of his record at Sampdoria and Benfica. It turned out he liked the ball chased into the channels and was as married to 4-4-2 as any son of Barnsley. Sven-Goran Eriksson was heralded as a tactical genius on his arrival in England from Lazio . Would he get the same offer now? No, because we know him. We’ve seen that he fell short with a gifted group at the 2004 European Championship, we’ve witnessed his subsequent work at Manchester City, Leicester City and Notts County. He’s not a mystery any more. Neither is Pepe Mel, nor Felix Magath. They all flew in, though, with reputations far in advance of their English counterparts, and levels of indulgence that would never be afforded a local. The record suggests Van Gaal will get it right at United. De Boer would no doubt make a very good manager of Newcastle, too. But so, quite probably, would McClaren — yet while one has an approval rating of 97 per cent, the other barely registers. There cannot be so many Chronicle readers with inside knowledge of Ajax; but plenty of us are willing to take the same test on Hull City, Crystal Palace or Derby. We know about the managers at those clubs. They’re useless.","Louis van Gaal finding things tough at Manchester United .

"When I revealed in this column last year that Dame Helen Mirren was the new face of L’Oreal, I had hundreds of letters from readers, ecstatic that beauty giants are celebrating older women. As these exclusive pictures show, from next week (February 5) Helen will be appearing in her first television advertising campaign for the company. The 69-year-old actress will be seen championing the role of the older woman — and the candid, unretouched shots from the advert show that wrinkles, ageing hands and natural make-up can be beautiful. Scroll down for video . Dame Helen Mirren photographed for the L'Oreal Paris age perfect campaign. In this shot Helen wears the Age Perfect day cream, the candid, unretouched shots are a refreshing change and champion the beauty of the older woman . I suspect this approach will sell more products than the glossier, airbrushed campaigns that many women feel don’t relate to them and their real lives. During the filming of the advert, Dame Helen took time out to speak exclusively to us about what she really thinks about beauty — and reveals she doesn’t even like the word! She told us: ‘I used to worry a lot more about my looks than I do now. ‘I think the great advantage of getting older is that you let go of certain things. Having said that, I think all women worry to some degree — and I don’t think men are exempt. ‘I don’t really like the word “beauty”. There are physically beautiful people in the world (David Beckham, for instance, is unbelievably beautiful), then there are other people that are not beautiful, but are very attractive because of their personality, energy, brilliance, genius: all kinds of things. Helen (pictured for the L'Oreal campaign) says she used to worry about her looks but as she's aged she's learnt to let go of certain things . ‘So I have a resistance to the word “beautiful”. I wish we could find another word that takes it away from physical beauty and brings it more into the world of true attractiveness.’ Dame Helen also told of her shock at being asked to be the face of L’Oreal. ‘I was surprised — but flattered as I am a fan of the brand and its products. ‘I love make-up. I’m often seen prowling the aisles of various chemists all over the world looking for a new lipstick or a new mascara, so to become a spokesperson for a major cosmetics firm is very exciting. ‘I think L’Oreal’s slogan “Because I’m Worth It” really strikes a chord with women. Self-esteem is such a hugely important thing and it’s so difficult for all of us. Dame Helen's much admired hair colour is now maintained by L'Oreal Excellence Age Perfect . ‘Everybody has moments of massive insecurity and I think anything that makes you feel more confident and more secure in yourself is a great thing. It’s tough for a lot of women with busy schedules or limited resources: they are incredibly busy and have difficult lives. To stop for a few seconds to say: “You know what, I can sit down, have a breather, a cup of tea or a bath and think “Yes, I’m worth it, my life is worth it” is so important. ‘People say to me “Oh, you’re so self-confident” but I am not naturally self-confident, I just have had to be in my work and my life. If it’s a problem, it’s my problem — I’ve got to deal with it.’ It’s this refreshing honesty that makes Helen the perfect figurehead for older women. So was there an age at which she started to feel differently about the way she looked? ‘My whole life has been slightly different from most people’s in the sense that I’ve always had to look at images of myself from when I was 21 years old,’ she said. ‘I’ve either been in front of a camera or in the theatre, being photographed, having my picture in the paper, so I’ve grown up with what I look like and ageing has never sort of come as a shock. ‘I’m not obsessive when it comes to looking after my skin. I have always used moisturiser at night and in the morning — it makes me feel better and to me that’s what I want from it. ‘It doesn’t have to make me look ten years younger: it’s all about how it makes me feel better that day. ‘My biggest beauty advice is just to make sure you clean your skin really well and don’t smoke. I also have to have my eight hours of sleep a night.’ While her new role as an ambassador for the beauty brand hasn’t changed Helen’s skincare regime, what has changed is her hair. Dame Helen is pictured here at the Golden Globe awards two weeks ago, accompanying her stylist dress with a slash of bold red lipstick . For the initial print campaign, she was given a stylish crop, and her much-admired bright blonde is now maintained using L’Oreal’s new Excellence Age Perfect hair colour. ‘I have very fine hair so I’ve always been quite careful not to overtreat it. I don’t normally colour or dye it, I like it to grow naturally, but this dye is fantastic. It really does what it says on the box, allows my hair to grow out naturally and is also very easy to use. It’s my new favourite product. ‘Yes, I know it sounds like I’m saying it because of the advertising, but it’s true! The brilliant thing is that it has layers of colour, it’s not one colour that you then need to add highlights on top of.’ So what hair advice would she give to somebody who, like her, is in their 60s? ‘Be bold! Be bold with your cut, really look what young people are doing and copy them — don’t copy what old people are doing. Seen here last year, Helen is clearly a fan of a statement lip. She says her advice to women out there is to look at what's happening now style-wise and 'go with the flow' ‘I loved it when I dyed my hair pink. A lot of women get stuck at what they are good at and what they did between the ages of 18 and 28 and they never have the courage to change that. ‘You see women from the Sixties still with their beehives and now they’re in their 70s. You see women from the Eighties who still have those Eighties hair-dos. My advice is to look at what’s happening now and go with the flow — don’t do what you did when you were 24. ‘Some people have a classic haircut and it works for them and that’s great, but it’s much better to accept how you look now and then be modern.’ The Age Perfect range is available nationwide.

There have been many moments of controversy and drama in the Premier League over the last two decades, but Eric Cantona's kung-fu kick remains as one of the most astonishing incidents ever seen in English football. The Manchester United striker was given an eight-month ban after fly-kicking a spectator at Selhurst Park having just been dismissed. Jonathan Pearce was commentating for Capital Gold Sport in London that night, and his animated reaction, almost in disbelief, summed up the thoughts on everybody's mind who had seen the incident. After Cantona was sent off, Pearce said: 'The mad side of genius. Cantona is dismissed! Can there be a place in the game for a man with such extravagant talent and such wicked temperament? A man who has quite rightly been dismissed. A man who has now…' Eric Cantona launches a a kung-fu kick at Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons in 1995 .

Cantona reacted angrily to abuse from a Palace fan after he was sent off during the match at Selhurst Park . Pearce then interrupted his own sentence after watching Cantona fly-kick Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons. 'OH MY GOODNESS ME,' Pearce shouted. 'He just kicked… He’s punched a fan! Eric Cantona has jumped in and scissor-kung-fu-kicked a fan! 'I have never seen as disgraceful an incident as that in all my years in football. Eric Cantona should be thrown out of the game for that sort of incident. Stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the Palace supporter . The French forward was found guilty of assault at Croydon Magistrates Court as a result of the incident . He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service . 'I care not one jot about his supreme talent. He launched himself six feet into the crowd and kung-fu kicked a supporter who was, without a shadow of doubt, giving him stick.' Pearce began his broadcasting career with BBC Radio Bristol before moving to London and joining Capital Radio. He later went on to work for BBC Five Live and Match of the Day. The 55-year-old from Hassocks in Sussex is also notorious for having been the lead commentator on BBC's Robot Wars series, but his Cantona commentary will live long in the memory.","Eric Cantona kung-fu kicked a Crystal Palace fan 20 years ago .

"Brazilian scientists have discovered a protein in coffee that gives people a buzz similar to the pain reliever morphine. The 'previously unknown protein fragments' had morphine-like effects that also had 'mildly tranquilising' qualities, the scientists said. Morphine is a drug that acts directly on the central nervous system to relieve pain. It also has a high potential for addiction. Scientists have discovered a protein in coffee that gives people a buzz similar to the pain reliever morphine . Tests on laboratory mice showed that the opioid peptides, which are naturally occurring biological molecules, appeared to have a longer-lasting effect on the mice than morphine itself. The state-owned Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa, along with University of Brasilia said the discovery has 'biotechnological potential' for the health foods industry. It could also help to alleviate stress in animals bound for the slaughterhouse, they claim. The discovery came when the two organisations were collaborating on how to improve the quality of coffee grains by combining coffee genes in new ways. Tests on laboratory mice showed that the opioid peptides, which are naturally occurring biological molecules, appeared to have a longer-lasting effect on the mice than morphine itself . They studied the coffee's genome sequence and uncovered proteins that shared properties with those in humans. 'This genetic library has been extremely important for our research and we are already looking for other results with different public and private partners,' said Vinecky's research supervisor Carlos Bloch Jr. The work is the culmination of ten year's worth of research by the teams. It was originally patented in 2006 and published in the journal Plos One in 2012. The team have now applied to the Brazilian government for patents for the seven proteins they have identified. For millions a strong coffee is the perfect start to the day. But in November, new research suggested coffee could also protect against dementia. Drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to 20 per cent, scientists said. Nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills, especially during the phase of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms of dementia occur. This is according to a report published by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, who are funded by major European coffee companies such as illycaffe, Nestlé and DE Master Blenders. However, experts from leading charities Alzheimer's Research UK and Alzheimer's society today warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent Alzheimer's, because no clinical trials have been carried out. The number of cases of dementia is set to triple by 2050, totalling 115.4 million worldwide, and Alzheimer's disease will make up the majority of these cases, according to World Health Organisation predictions.","Tests on mice showed the effects lasted longer than morphine itself .

"Obsessed with football and striving to become the best player he could, Danny Walsh silently slipped into the grip of a vicious eating disorder. His weight plummeted to just six stone. The then 22-year-old was suffering anorexia - one of around 176,000 men in the UK battling an eating disorder. But in just four months, Mr Walsh  turned his life around, taking control and learning how to beat his illness. After being admitted to The Priory in July 2012 he underwent regular therapy, channelling his energy into eating healthy meals. But it is body-building that he credits with fuelling his recovery and his parents for saving his life. Danny Walsh, now 24, from Preston, fell victim to anorexia after becoming obsessed with being a better football player. At the height of his illness, his weight plummeted to just six stone, left. But within four months he beat his illness, gaining weight thanks to body-building, right . After being admitted to The Priory, Mr Walsh underwent therapy, channelling his energy into eating healthy meals. But it was body-building that drove his recovery, he said . Weighing in at just over 10 stone, the now 24-year-old is a healthy weight for his height, having completed his recovery. 'Looking back now is scary, I looked like a skeleton,' he said. 'I'd been quite dumpy at school and because of my asthma could never play footy. 'Once I stopped suffering with it I got really into it and joined my local team. 'I convinced myself that the slimmer I was, the fitter I became so I really cut down on my eating.' Despite eating much less than before, Mr Walsh, from Preston, continued a punishing regime of exercise, leaving him exhausted. The result was that half-way through his second year as an electrician's apprentice, he was let go having become so weak. Concerned, his father John Walsh, convinced his son to visit a GP. He was referred to hospital and at the end of 2007, Mr Walsh, then aged 18, was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire. There, for the first time in a year, he ate a proper meal of sausage and mashed potato. Steadily his weight rose to a stable 9st 7lbs. And six months after being admitted, Mr Walsh got a new job at a bookmakers. But just as he appeared to have a grip on recovery, two tragic losses in Mr Walsh's life sent his weight spiralling down again. 'My colleague had  become a second mum to me, and her death, coupled with my nan's knocked me for six,' he said. 'I didn't know what to do - everything felt out of control. 'Anorexia felt like the only thing I had any power over.' Mr Walsh's weight became so low his health took a turn for the worse. He was suffering a high blood pressure and heart problems because of his anorexia . But now, the 24-year-old has beaten his illness. He said: 'Now I'm putting about 3,500 calories in my body every day to make sure I'm fuelled.'I feel so much healthier now - fit as a fiddle. I know how lucky I've been' It was Mr Walsh's obsession with football, left, that triggered his eating disorder. Now he is fully recovered, he is planning to travel to Poland for a nose job, to complete his transformation and boost his confidence . As Mr Walsh's weight plummeted again, his health took a turn for the worse. He was suffering a sky high blood pressure and heart problems. Mr Walsh was admitted to the Priory as an outpatient where he received regular therapy to address his depression as well as the eating disorder. When he was discharged Mr Walsh forced himself to stop running for two months while he increased his calorie intake. A few months later he took up body-building. Within four months his weight had shot up as his muscles toned and stepping on the scales revealed he was a healthy 10st 3lbs. He said: 'I had all the knowledge to make body-building work for me. 'At my worst I could recite the calories off every packet in the supermarket - I was obsessed. 'I turned that sort of obsession on its head, making sure I knew I was getting all the right nutrients. 'I bought a bench and set of weights and focus on body-building, doing a bit of cardio and eating healthily. 'Now I'm putting about 3,500 calories in my body every day to make sure I'm fuelled. 'I feel so much healthier now - fit as a fiddle. I know how lucky I've been though. 'If I hadn't had my mum and dad at my worst I know I'd have died. 'They were the only thing keeping me going.' Having fully recovered his anorexia, Mr Walsh is set to travel to Poland to have rhinoplasty to complete his transformation and increase his confidence. Adam Kalecinksi from Europesurgery said: 'Having seen Danny's incredible recovery I'm more than happy to help him complete his transformation. 'Confidence is a big issue for him and I hope by having this surgery that will make him feel even more comfortable in his skin.'

"Dieters trying the Palaeolithic or Stone Age diet, where you follow an eating regime similar to the one we enjoyed in prehistoric times — all animal and plant products, nothing manufactured — have discovered a surprising side-effect to the eating plan. Before the experiment, Sarah picked up a pack of Kerrymaid lard (pictured) for just 54p at Waitrose . Handling the large quantities of meat the diet includes left them with noticeably softer skin on their hands. As a result, women have been inspired to apply animal fat directly to their faces, in the same way as our great-great-grandmothers might have done before the advent of the industrialised cosmetic industry. It sounds absolutely revolting — not to mention what it must smell like — but, intrigued, I set myself the challenge of moisturising once a day for a month with pure animal fat... WEEK ONE: I SMELL LIKE A BUTCHER! The week before Christmas, I visit the Cosmetic Imaging Studio at Harvey Nichols for a Visia face scan, which will show the state of my skin. I’ll have a second scan after four weeks of slapping on lard. Then, I head to Waitrose, which is teeming with shoppers lunging towards tubs of goose fat in which to roast their potatoes. I reach for a 250g packet of Kerrymaid lard — pork fat — costing 54p. The woman next to me casts a glance at the scrum around the goose fat and winks. Scroll down for video . Sarah Chalmers (pictured) usually cleanses and tones her face every night before bed, but instead switched to rubbing room temperature lard on her cheeks in the evening to test the benefits . I’m pretty sure she has no idea my lard will not be going anywhere near a turkey or potatoes, but straight onto my face. That night, I remove the packet from the fridge, but find the fat too solid to rub on my hands. After 45 minutes at room temperature, it has a malleable consistency, so I take a deep breath and scoop some up with my finger. I have cleansed and toned my face before bed, as usual, but instead of applying my shop-bought moisturiser, I rub a blob of lard on my cheeks. The smell is stomach-churning — like the floor of a butcher’s shop — and I expect to wake up the next morning covered in spots. To my surprise, the following day there is no discernible damage to my complexion. WEEK TWO: MY PILLOW IS COVERED IN FAT . After seven days, I can see no difference to my skin — but at least I haven’t had an outbreak of teenage acne. The biggest hurdle is the psychological one. But I gradually stop thinking about it and, at times, almost forget it is not my normal moisturiser, but some pig fat. After all, the consistency is little different from a thick night cream and I find I need only a tiny amount as it spreads so easily. Sarah (pictured) says the biggest hurdle she faced during the experiment was the psychological one of actually applying pig fat to her skin each night . Because I am using such a small quantity, it appears to be absorbing into my skin and I stop noticing any smell. The downsides are that when I try to wash my hands after application, it takes a lot of soap to get them clean. And I can see greasy smears on my pillowcases every morning. Yuck! WEEK THREE: I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORKING . Just when my resolve is beginning to wane, because I am tired of scrubbing my fingernails every evening to remove lard traces, I receive an unexpected boost to my confidence. My husband tells me how good my skin looks. I dismiss his flattery as trying to keep my spirits up, but as I get ready one evening to go out to a party, I am thrilled to note how smoothly my make-up glides on. Often in the winter, my skin can be dry and my make-up doesn’t seem to ‘sit’ properly. Perhaps this is working after all! Sarah found the lard smears on her pillow cases frustrating but was shocked when her husband complimented her on how smooth her skin was looking . But the smears on my pillowcases are reappearing as fast as I can wash them. And, although I may have got over the psychological barrier, I am not sure, despite his compliments, my husband has. He has never before given me any beauty advice, but has become strangely insistent that the application of lard is the very last thing I do at night. I can see why the Victorians (who used to make face masks from lard and bone marrow) had separate bedrooms. WEEK FOUR: HAVE MY WRINKLES GONE? With only one week of the experiment left, I am beginning to wonder if I will actually miss my cheap and effective lard moisturiser. I have barely made an indent in the 250g packet, and get a thrill from knowing I have not only saved money, but also have a smoother complexion. Sarah says that January is not normally a good time of year for her skin but has been pleasantly surprised by the positive effects of the lard, especially the money she's saved and the confidence it's given her . I typically look at my worst in January, when I am run down and exhausted after the festive season. But on my new regime, my skin is thriving and the confidence it gives me seems to be having a knock-on effect on the rest of my looks. Am I imagining it, or do I even look a little less wrinkled than the 40-something mum-of-three who started this experiment a month ago? There is only one way to find out — and so I head back to Harvey Nichols for my follow-up scan. THE RESULTS . My initial scan to assess skin texture, tone, redness, blocked pores and UV damage, showed I had more redness than you would expect for someone of my age, but fewer wrinkles and better texture. Between the two scans, Sarah's skin redness had improved by a massive 43 per cent . When my face was scanned again, some of the results were startling. My redness had improved by an incredible 43 per cent, putting me in the top quartile. My skin tone had improved by 30 per cent, my fine lines and wrinkles reduced by a further 10 per cent and my skin texture was 7 per cent better than before I started applying the lard. But my enlarged pores had increased. My left side also showed slightly more improvement than my right. Nick Sinclair, the Cosmetic Imaging Studio founder, suggested this may be because I sleep on my left. ‘When you are moisturising hands or feet, you are encouraged to wear linen gloves or socks to keep the moisture in and not let it rub off. The same may be true of your pillowcase.’ I showed the results to cosmetic dermatologist Dr Anita Sturnham, founder of Nuriss Skincare and Wellness Centre in London. She agreed there had been an astonishing improvement in the redness of my face. ‘I think you may have an inflammatory skin condition called rosacea, which can cause redness, sensitivity and thread veins,’ she tells me. ‘It’s possible you may also have been suffering from changes in environment, such as moving from heated rooms to the cold outside. This dries the skin and leads to redness. But, as the lard creates a barrier, moisture is no longer being lost and you’re protected against fluctuations in temperature.’ The redness might also have been caused by a reaction to my normal beauty products. ‘Things such as glycolic acid, found in lots of skincare, can cause irritation,’ says Dr Sturnham. So, am I convinced animal fat is the way forward for skincare? While I am thrilled with my skin tone and reduced redness, I am not keen on the idea of more blocked pores. The smell was also off-putting. But I will pay closer attention to the ingredients in over-the-counter skin products, as I may be sensitive to some. And if I run out of moisturiser, I’ll know I have a substitute in my fridge!","Forget fad diets, how about rubbing lard on your face each night?

"Indiegogo has become the go-to place for startups to raise funds for weird and wacky products. But, the site's latest move lets everyday people ask strangers for money to help pay for personal projects such as weddings, operations, buying a house, paying tuition fees and more. The site is called Indiegogo Life and it lets users set up campaigns for free - effectively scrapping the fees charged to businesses on the original site. The California-based site (pictured) lets users ask strangers for money towards weddings, funerals, operations or other personal projects. Indiegogo  typically charges up to 9% for listings, but fundraising on Life is free and the site is divided into categories such as Emergencies, Community, Sports and Celebrations . The traditional Indiegogo site charges businesses between four and nine per cent fees to launch a campaign, but listing a campaign on Life is free. However, payment providers may still charge a fee, or around three per cent. All campaigns on Indiegogo Life are public, and like with traditional campaigns, are monitored by Indiegogo staff to make sure that the service isn’t being abused or that donors aren’t being duped. Indiegogo Life is the latest in a rising trend of crowdfunding sites set up for personal projects. These are similar to fundraising sites such as JustGiving, and offer a level of security that traditional social media can't provide. LendInvest.com, for example, is a peer-to-peer money lending service. It lets people pool their money and act as a lender to a buyer, and people can invest as little as £100 in a person’s mortgage. Repayments are then made monthly, with interest, and investments are typically governed by the P2P Finance Association. Elsewhere, ZeroBound was set up to help people raise money to pay back their student loans. One campaign on the site is currently asking for money to help a family move home following the husband suffering a serious cycling accident, for example. Another needs money to pay for a litter of kittens that was dumped by the side of the road in France. All donations are made as gifts. ‘Indiegogo Life takes the idea of human empowerment even further - helping individuals fund what matters most,' said the site. ‘Whether it’s tuition, veterinary bills, celebrations, or a medical emergency, Indiegogo Life is there to help through all of life’s challenges and celebrations. ‘We understand that sometimes it’s necessary to seek extra support, and we believe no one should have to do it alone. 'Indiegogo Life makes it easier to raise funds and make a difference -one life at a time.’ Campaigns can run for up to 120 days, and the money is usually received within 15.

"Flying a military drone in a warzone or other dangerous locations currently requires a team of human operators. But this could be about to change, as the US military looks to enable drones to hunt in ‘coordinated packs’ with minimal human supervision. The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) will host a number of meetings in March to discuss how aircraft could work together to find, identify and engage targets with fewer humans controlling them. Darpa is hosting meetings to discuss how aircraft could work together to find, identify and engage targets with fewer humans controlling them (illustrated). Its 'Code' programme is also designed to  cut the number of operators needed to control a single unmanned vehicle, allowing one person to operate six simultaneously . The meeting is being called under the programme name ‘Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment’ (Code). Darpa has invited ‘participants with capabilities, methodologies, and approaches that are related to Code research and focused on revolutionary approaches to unmanned aircraft systems, autonomy and collaborative operations,’ to attend the discussion in Arlington, Virginia. It said that the programme offers experts the opportunity to ‘help develop groundbreaking software enabling unmanned aircraft to work together with minimal supervision’. Darpa said that the programme offers experts the opportunity to ‘help develop groundbreaking software enabling unmanned aircraft to work together with minimal supervision’. A current MQ-9 Reaper drone used in Afghanistan is pictured . Last January, the US Department of Defence (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap for the next 25 years. It said that drones may be able to deviate from set missions, carry stronger chemical weapons and hunt in swarms in the years to come. At the moment, drones follow precise commands to complete a predetermined step-by-step mission, but the unmanned aircraft of the future could deviate from tasks, informed by ‘laws’ that govern their behaviour, laid out in algorithms and machine learning, as well as advanced sensors. They currently use GPS to navigate war zones and remote areas, but the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily, so Darpa is working on jam-proof ‘inertial guidance systems’. The DoD's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by the bots’ on-bard cameras. Thanks to the unmanned mothership, the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles (463km) the roadmap said. The weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans, as researchers are working on ‘energetic nanoparticles’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion. The technologies combined are intended to help the US military be ‘more effective through greater automation and greater performance,’ the report says. It seems to envision a time when groups of drones can work intelligently together under one human operator, who still makes big decisions, such as whether to attack a target, based on information gathered by the group. Jean-Charles Ledé, the program’s manager, said: ‘Just as wolves hunt in coordinated packs with minimal communication, multiple Code-enabled unmanned aircraft would collaborate to find, track, identify and engage targets, all under the command of a single human mission supervisor.’ Noting that while current drones have proved ‘invaluable’ for gathering intelligence and tactical strikes, Darpa said that most of them require constant control by a dedicated pilot who steers the craft and a sensor operator, as well as a large number of analysts. It takes a lot of manpower to control each craft and sift through information, which is expensive and can pose challenges in remote war zones with highly mobile targets. The experts think this problem can be overcome by using algorithms and software to ‘extend the mission capabilities of existing unmanned aircraft well beyond the current state-of-the-art,’ and make them more autonomous. It’s hoped that experts can create software that can survive communications disruptions, and electronic warfare, while working with current drone designs. Last January, the US Department of Defence (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap for the next 25 years, including plans for more automous drones that could work in packs. It said that while drones currently use GPS to navigate war zones and remote areas, the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily, so Darpa is working on jam-proof ‘inertial guidance systems’.

Last year, a Dutch designer penned the Drone Survival Guide, which like bird watching charts, shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes. Ruben Pater’s guide, however, details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war, as well as survival tips of how to hide from them. The majority of the drones selected for the chart are from Nato member countries, including the UK, France, Germany, US and Canada. This is because these countries have used drones in wars such as Afghanistan and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots, such as their wingspan. It uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle. The chart, which Mr Pater describes as ‘21st century bird watching’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft (37 metre) wingspan of the Global Hawk drone to the petite Parrot AC quadcopter, which measures just 23 inches (58cm). He said: ‘Most drones are used today by military powers for remote-controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing. 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30,000 drones flying over US soil alone. ‘As robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future, we should be prepared to identify them.

"Most of us are experts at recognising people's identity, gender and age just by looking at their face. But much of what we see is based on the context we see it in – and our brains are masters are tricking us into perceiving things that aren’t there. You can test this by staring steadily at the top red square in the below image for just fraction of a minute. Scroll down for video . Stare at the top red square in the above image for just fraction of a minute. Shift your gaze to the bottom red square – what do you see? Out of the corner of your eye, you are likely to see Bill Clinton on the left and his successor, George Bush, on the right. Shift your gaze, without hesitating, to the bottom red square – what do you see? Most people see George W Bush in the left image on the left and Clinton on the right. But blink several times and take a step back. A closer look at the photos reveals that both photos are the same morphed image of the presidents. This illusion is an instance of a phenomena, called sensory adaptations, according to a report in Scientific American. It was created by Leicester University in an attempt to understand the process going on in the brain when people mix up faces. Pictured are face-selective regions in the brain. Face-selective regions (yellow) are defined as regions that respond more strongly to faces than houses, cars and novel objects . They believe that while neurons register an image of the outside world, they are also actively constructing the image based on its context. To test their theory, researchers at Leicester, along with the University of California, implanted wires in the brains of patients at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. This illusion is an instance of a phenomena, called sensory adaptations. There are of visual cells in the occipital lobes that process the vision of objects based on their contect. These cells can undergo sensory adaptation, as seen in the 'waterfall illusion'. If a person views a moving picture of a waterfall for several minutes and then looks at a still picture of the same waterfall, the picture of the waterfall will appear to be moving upward. This is because the visual cells have adapted to the downward motion. To prevent motion sickness, the other visual cells must counteract that motion. They recorded from a cell that fired selectively to a picture of Clinton. When they next asked the patient to look at a photograph of Bush, the cell was silent. This showed the cell preferred the sight of Clinton over that of Bush. Immediately afterward, a blended picture was shown, and the patient had to decide which president they could see. The patient was more likely to see Clinton when previously exposed to four seconds of Bush, and vice versa. ‘In 62 neurons from 10 patients, the response to the morphed picture was significantly stronger when the patient recognized the neuron's preferred face, compared with when the patient reported the face that the neuron did not care about,’ wrote Christof Koch, Chief Scientific Officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. ‘Indeed, statistically, the strength of the neuron's response to a pure Clinton could not be distinguished from the response to Clintush, as long as the subject reported seeing Clinton.’ The results, he says, prove that the brain has a powerful process from which it constructs images based on its surroundings – and sometimes what you are seeing could just be in your imagination.","Stare steadily at the top red square for just a fraction of a minute .

"Not appy: Traffic app Waze warns drivers when police are nearby . Google is being put under pressure to turn off  a police-tracking function in its traffic app Waze, following fears it might put officers' lives at risk. Waze is a GPS navigation app that also warns drivers about congestion, car accidents, speed cameras, and when the police is nearby . Waze, which Google purchased for $966 million in 2013, has 50million users in 200 countries, a number which is growing. However, several police officers say the app is being used to stalk and plan attacks on law enforcement. There are no known connections between any attack on police and Waze, but senior officers have said it's only a matter of time and are seeking support among law enforcement trade groups to pressure Google. Sheriff Mike Brown of Bedford County, Virginia, said the police-reporting feature presents a danger to officers. 'The police community needs to coordinate an effort to have Google act like the responsible corporate citizen they have always been and remove this feature from the application even before any litigation or statutory action,' Sheriff Brown told the National Sheriffs Association (NSA). Sheriff Brown, chairman of the NSA technology committee, and Sergio Kopelev, a reserve deputy sheriff in California, raised concerns during the meeting of the NSA's winter conference in Washington. They pointed to the Instagram account of the man accused of fatally shooting two New York Police Department officers last month. Ismaaiyl Brinsley posted a screenshot from Waze along with messages threatening police. Investigators do not believe he used Waze to ambush the officers, in part because police say Brinsley tossed his cellphone far from where he shot the officers. The executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, Jim Pasco, said his organization has concerns.

Users see a police icon, but it's not immediately clear whether police are there for a speed trap, a sobriety check or a lunch break. A Waze spokeswoman, Julie Mossler, said the company works with the New York Police Department and others around the world. 'These relationships keep citizens safe, promote faster emergency response and help alleviate traffic congestion,' Mossler said. Google has declined to comment. Google has a complicated relationship with government and law enforcement. The company is regularly compelled to turn over to police worldwide copies of emails or other information about its customers. Last year, after disclosures that the National Security Agency had illicitly broken into Google's overseas Internet communication lines, Google and other technology companies rolled out encryption for users, which the U.S. government said could hamper law enforcement investigations. Nuala O'Connor, head of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group, said it would not be appropriate for Google to disable the police-reporting feature. 'I do not think it is legitimate to ask a person-to-person communication to cease simply because it reports on publicly visible law enforcement,' she said. She said a bigger concern among privacy advocates is how much information about customers Waze shares with law enforcement, since the service monitors their location continually as long as it's turned on.","Waze helps drivers avoid congestion, accidents and traffic cameras .

"Security officers at US airports seized a record number of firearms – most of them loaded – from passengers’ hand luggage last year while screening nearly two million travellers a day. The Transportation Security Administration said inspectors found 2,212 firearms in carry-on luggage at checkpoints across the country, an increase of 22 per cent from 2013, when 1,813 were discovered, and a staggering 235 per cent from 2005 (660 firearms). An average of six were seized every day. Of those, 83 per cent were loaded, causing delays for passengers, the TSA said on its blog. TSA officers at US airports found a record 2,212 firearms in hand luggage in 2014, up 22% from 2013 . One of the most stunning finds was an assault rifle with three loaded magazines  at Dallas Love Field . Five flights were delayed more than two hours when an Mk 2 hand grenade was discovered in a carry-on bag . Source: TSA . Most of those caught with a firearm and ammunition at security claimed they simply forgot to leave their gun at home or place it in a checked bag. TSA officers had an extremely busy year in 2014, screening more than 653 passengers (approximately 1.8 million per day), an increase of 14.8 million from 2013, and 1.7 billion carry-on bags. The guns were found at 224 airports, up from 203 in 2013, with the most being discovered at Dallas/Fort Worth (120), followed by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (109) and Phoenix Sky Harbor (78) airports. George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston (77 firearms) and Denver International Airport rounded out the top five. The TSA said a new single-day record was set on June 4, 2014, when officers stopped 18 people from taking guns onto planes. That broke the previous record of 13 set in 2013. Officers intercepted a loaded folding-stock rifle with two loaded magazines at Dallas/Fort Worth airport . Firearms can travel as checked baggage in the US if they are unloaded and packed in a locked container . Last year's find is an increase of 22 per cent from 2013 and a staggering 235 per cent from 2005 . Some of the most stunning finds included an assault rifle with three loaded magazines at the Dallas Love Field checkpoint. In another incident TSA officers seized a loaded folding stock rifle with two loaded magazines at Dallas-Fort Worth airport. At New York’s LaGuardia Airport a 94-year-old man was stopped by security when he attempted to enter the checkpoint with a loaded .38-calibre revolver clipped to his belt. In a similar incident a loaded .380-calibre firearm was found strapped to a passenger’s ankle after walking through a metal detector at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. This speargun was found in a passenger's hand luggage at Henry E Rohlsen Airport in the US Virgin Islands . An average of six firearms were seized every day. Of those, 83 per cent were loaded, the TSA said . Most of those caught with a firearm at security claimed they simply forgot that they were carrying it . In addition to firearms TSA officers also seized a variety of weapons or unsafe items, including an Mk 2 hand grenade at Los Angeles International Airport. The Terminal 1 checkpoint was shut while an explosive ordnance disposal team removed the grenade and transported it to an off-site location to be detonated. Five flights were delayed more than two hours, affecting 800 passengers. In another incident the FBI arrested a passenger after a homemade avalanche control charge was found in a carry-on bag at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. Other dangerous items that were discovered include a fireworks-making kit, live flash bang grenades, more than 700 stun guns and live smoke grenades. Six blocks of inert C-4 explosives were found in a checked bag at Tampa International Airport . The FBI arrested a passenger after a homemade avalanche control charge was found in a carry-on bag . The agency also found a 13-inch cane sword in luggage at Charlotte Douglas airport in North Carolina . Another problem proved to be inert items, such as novelty hand grenades, that appear to be authentic. The TSA said its officers are required to call in explosives experts to determine if the items are real, and that can cause significant disruption for travellers. Often, terminals and checkpoints are closed during the inspection, leading to cancelled or delayed flights. One such situation occurred at Tampa International Airport, where six blocks of inert C-4 explosives were found in a checked bag. Officers found an 8.5in knife  in an enchilada at Charles M Schulz-Sonoma County Airport in California . One of the most unusual items found last year was an unloaded cannon barrel at Hawaii's Kahului Airport . Pictured: (from L-R), a stun grenade, a second stun grenade, a flare gun and a smoke grenade . The TSA also uncovered an 8.5in knife inside an enchilada in Santa Rosa, California, and razor blades hidden in a Scooby-Doo greeting card in Newport News, Virginia. Under federal law, anyone who tries to take a gun onto an airline flight as a carry-on item -- loaded or not -- can face criminal prosecution and a $10,000 fine. Firearms can travel as checked baggage, so long as they are unloaded and safely packed in a locked container.","TSA inspectors found 2,212 firearms in carry-on luggage at checkpoints .

"A husband and wife from Scotland say their dream cruise to the Mediterranean became a disaster when they were confined to their cabin due to severe illness. Robert Clements, from Saltcoats in North Ayrshire, said he experienced gastric symptoms, including diarrhoea, stomach cramps and spasms, while travelling on board the Thomson Spirit cruise ship in April 2014. He and his 71-year-old wife, Rona, booked the two-week tour of the Mediterranean to celebrate his 67th birthday and see Rome’s Colosseum, but were unable to disembark when they arrived at the Italian capital. Robert Clements fell ill while celebrating his 67th birthday on a Mediterranean cruise with his wife, Rona . The Clements, who are grandparents of five, visited the cruise ship’s doctor, who they say diagnosed Robert with ‘severe gastroenteritis’. They said they were confined to their cabin for 48 hours due to his illness and were unable to get off the ship to visit the Colosseum on Robert’s birthday. The retired couple has hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate the conditions on the ship. Robert said on occasion it seemed to them that some of the food on the ship had been served lukewarm and one particular occasion some of the chicken they ate ‘had not been cooked properly’ and had an unusual taste. The retired couple has hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate the conditions on the ship . The Thomson Spirit is the tour operator's oldest ship, boasting three restaurants, five bars and two lounges . He continues to suffer from illness and has had to alter his diet because of ongoing symptoms. He said: ‘I feel very disappointed that I could not celebrate my birthday properly or as planned. ‘The whole trip was ruined by the pain and discomfort I have suffered. ‘Having to stay in my cabin whilst being so close to the Colosseum of Rome – a wonder of the world – was a truly terrible and disappointing experience.’ Robert Clements said he hoped to visit Rome's Colosseum but was unable to leave the cruise ship . Irwin Mitchell said it continues to investigate claims from 12 people who said they suffered similar symptoms while travelling on board the Thomson Spirit in 2013. It is the oldest member of Thomson’s fleet, and the tour operator says it is still a ‘firm favourite with customers thanks to its warm, home-from-home atmosphere.’ The cruise ship boasts three restaurants, five bars, two lounges, a nightclub, casino and two swimming pools for guests. Holidaymakers watch the Thomson Spirit cruise ship as it departs the port of Agios Nikolaos in Greece . Jennifer Downing, a travel law expert from Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Gastroenteritis can cause huge discomfort and very unpleasant symptoms. ‘We are now looking into the conditions on the ship in order to establish why Robert developed gastric illness. ‘We are concerned at the couple’s reports that other passengers fell ill and we hope that Thomson will assist in our investigations and work with us to help provide the answers our clients are desperately seeking.’ In a statement, Thomson said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr and Mrs Clements’ experience on board Thomson Spirit. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'The ultimate priority for Thomson Cruises is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers. We operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards.'","Robert and Rona Clements went on the cruise to celebrate his birthday .

"It is just two months since Kilee Brookbank was engulfed in a fireball that razed off 25 per cent of her skin. But the 16-year-old has made an incredible recovery. On November 10, while home alone in Georgetown, Ohio, a freak explosion burned off her finger tips, hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, and obliterated the skin from her arms, back, legs, face, and stomach with third-degree burns. Incredibly, she has survived - and this week she took the ultimate step: going back to school. Transformation: Kilee Brookbank, 16, pictured left in September 2014 before the fire; center in November 2014 in Shriner's Children's Hospital; and right in January 2015 as she prepares to go back to school . Before and after: The freak explosion in her house left Kilee (pictured left and right) with life-changing burns . 'I guess I'm just lucky,' Brookbank said to WCPO in a stunning tone of bravery that even shocked her doctors. 'It makes you stronger. You don't take anything for granted. It's life changing. I know there's worse things that can happen.' Few could imagine anything much worse than lighting a candle to get rid of a foul smell, then almost burning to death. The fire was so aggressive it went right to the fat beneath her skin, leaving her hands milk-bottle white. 'It felt normal,' she said. 'My body felt the same, kind of numb. My hands felt different. I remember it was really hot, but it didn't hurt.' Her mother and stepfather were at work when the house exploded and Kilee ran out the half-destroyed walls into the street on fire. Trauma: The 16-year-old was home alone in Georgetown, Ohio, when she lit a candle and the house exploded . Horror: The fire was so aggressive it went right to the fat beneath her skin, leaving her hands milk-bottle white . 'I'm just so lucky': The high school junior said she is just grateful she survived the fireball that engulfed her . Painstaking: Getting ready for school used to take two minutes and now takes a minimum of ten . Neighbors rushed to throw buckets of water over the high school junior, call 911, and call her parents. She was rushed to a helipad with her mother then flown to Cincinnati Children's Hospital 20 minutes away, then transferred to the specialist unit at Shriner's down the road where her father met them. In the emergency room doctors cut open her arms in a desperate bid to reduce the swelling, while she was given oxygen, an IV, and doused in antibiotic solution. After four operations, skin grafts on her hands, and two months of physiotherapy, Kilee has returned to RULH High School, where she is honor student and plays soccer. 'It feels good,' she told WCPO as she sat beaming in her bandages at the school's opening assembly. Battling through: She has had to endure hours of physiotherapy a day such as picking up toothpicks . Effort: Every little task is difficult after the fire on November 10, 2014, razed all the skin from her fingertips . Happy to be back: Kilee said 'it feels good' to return to RULH High School, where she is an honor student . Moving on: She has pushed herself to go out in public despite the scarring experience and marked injuries . Investigators are still working to understand the cause of the fire, which is likely to have been a propane gas leak. 'She had told us she arrived home and went into the house and smelled a strange odor, and lit a candle to combat the odor, and the house exploded,' Georgetown fire chief Joe Rockey said. 'There was propane provided to the home from a tank around back. Not sure if that was it or not, we'll have to do some investigating to figure out if that was the cause.' He added: 'Propane is heavier than your oxygen level, your normal oxygen, so it's going to build up in the floor, under the floor, anywhere it can until it meets an ignition source. 'And that may very well have been the candle. Not saying that's what it was, but it could have been. 'The blast was very significant. So the young girl is very lucky to be alive today.'","Kilee Brookbank, 16, lit a candle to get rid of sewage smell at home .

"A group of women sitting outside Costa coffee look shocked. They’re turning around to see who is screaming at the top of their voice, disturbing their quiet lunch. I would look around, too, but I’m incapable of turning — or stopping for that matter. I also know exactly who is disturbing the peace — it’s me, hurtling through the shopping centre, gathering speed, narrowly missing pensioners and office-workers on their break. In truth, I’m probably barely hitting 10mph, but that’s how it feels on this hare-brained contraption called the Air Wheel — a kind of electric unicycle. This new must-have has been flying off the shelves at Harrods, has sold out at various outlets online and is, apparently, going to transform the way we travel. Scroll down for video . Marianne Power, pictured, attempts to use the amazing 14mph Air Wheel in a Hampshire park . The device has a range of 24 miles on a single charge and changes direction by the user leaning . The Air Wheel, pictured, costs £429 and can hit a top speed of 14 miles per hour . A bit like a Segway, this little machine is designed to help us zip around town at up to 14mph, but crucially doesn’t have the handlebars of its counterpart. With nothing to hold on to, mastering the Air Wheel is far from easy. Yet the promotional videos show people whizzing through their office reception area or flying along city streets on their wheel, holding a coffee. They’ve sold 300,000 of the Chinese-made machines since the launch last year. Walking, it seems, is so last century. Unfortunately, I don’t have a good track record of being in charge of wheels. When I tried riding a bike for the first time in years, I went flying off after hitting a pothole. I am such a nervous driver that, despite having passed my test 20 years ago, I still won’t go on the motorway. Yet here I am on a wheel, with no brakes, no steering column and no safety belt. What could possibly go wrong? Setting off can be difficult for the new user . My adventure began at the company’s base in Basingstoke, Hampshire, where the team showed me the ropes. The makers say you can get the basics in a couple of hours, and be proficient in a day or two. You turn it on via a button on the wheel. The idea is that you stand your feet on two pedals either side of the wheel and simply lean forward to move, back to stop and left and right to turn. Sounds simple — but it isn’t. Just getting on is impossible. It’s so unstable, I need to lean on Fabio, one of the Air Wheel team. The instructions suggest leaning against a wall at the beginning, but I find a handsome Italian man always works better. And when I say lean, I mean cling on for dear life. Even though the pedals are only three inches off the ground, I am terrified. I feel as wobbly as you’d expect from a novice on a unicycle. Balancing seems impossible and for half an hour I do more squealing than a teenage girl at a Justin Bieber concert. After mastering standing on the Air Wheel, the next ‘step’ is to start moving for a respectable distance. A tiny tilt forward and it starts to move. The more you press the faster it goes. I feel like I’m four years old when Mum took the stabilisers off my bike — I’m trundling along but I just want to get off. Fabio and his friend hold on to me, on either side, as they try to move down the path. I keep shrieking and they keep telling me to ‘relax’. I feel so scared that I keep jumping off. The trick, apparently, is to stand straight and look in the direction you’re going in — but I keep looking at my feet, which makes me wobble. Finally, after 20 minutes, the boys lighten their grip and, bit by bit, I find that I’m doing it on my own . . . it feels thrilling, fast, and dare I say it fun. I get confident enough to up the speed — the faster you go the more steady you feel, like a bike. The cold air is rushing through my hair and actually, I love it. But after a few minutes, it is possible to safely navigate on the high-tech device which is imported from China . There is only one problem: stopping. You’re supposed to be able to slow down enough that you simply step off and grab hold of the wheel before it falls but going slowly means wobbling, so I panic and jump off instead. As for turning, the theory is you simply lean in whatever direction you want to go, but every time I try, I panic and jump off. Fabio tells me it can take a few days to get the hang of that, so for now the Air Wheel and I will be going in a straight line only. Fabio boasts he regularly goes shopping on his Air Wheel and even navigates the London Underground on it. Inspired by his claims, I decide to give the Air Wheel a go on a busy pedestrianised street. There are people, and benches, and broken glass, and I am on edge. There are shop windows to bang into, signs to knock over, children to injure. Fortunately, those in my path are all taking one look at me and stepping far away. And you do get looks on this thing. A bloke munching on a sausage roll says: ‘You’re not gonna lose any weight on that, are you?’ Charming. I’d turn and mow him down, but I don’t know how. I’m like a beginner on a ski slope: I cannot move out of your way, so you’ve got to move out of mine. The Air Wheel will travel up to 24 miles on one charge. And although at 13kg (28lb), it feels like carrying a very heavy brick, it’s about the same weight as a fold-up bike. The makers say people are buying them for dog walking, shop runs and days out. Their youngest user is ten and their eldest is 70. Seventy! Meanwhile, the gadget is getting rave reviews online and I can see why. It’s fun, fast and will get you places quicker than your feet can. But I, for one, will be keeping my feet on solid ground. From £429, theairwheel.com .","The Air Wheel costs £429 and can travel for 24 miles on a single charge .

"It's been a strange weekend: Jose Mourinho put out a team that got a great away win by playing some terrific football, reminiscent of Arsenal circa 2004. Meantime Arsene Wenger put out a team that got a great away win by playing some functional, effective football reminiscent of Chelsea circa 2005. I know which I prefer. Jose Mourinho has replaced his old functional football at Chelsea with something far more spectacular . Diego Costa celebrates one of his two goals in Chelsea's 5-0 rout of Swansea City on Saturday . Oscar, who also scored two goals at the Liberty Stadium, celebrates with striker Costa after scoring . I wrote this about Jose Mourinho in my book Is He All That? (available in pound shops up and down the country): 'It's impossible to knock Mourinho's winning habit…(but) his style is rigid and formulaic. Sometimes it's labelled negative and defensive.' It was right at the time, but even those more critical of Mourinho than myself must surely now stand back and admire the change in this manager, and the style of his current Chelsea team. I have been to see Chelsea on numerous occasions this season. There is of course that defensive efficiency with which Mourinho's teams are synonymous (it went AWOL at Spurs), but further up the field things have changed. In his first spell at Chelsea he had a goalscoring midfielder in Frank Lampard and an out-and-out striker in Didier Drogba, but the rest were asked by the manager to be defenders. Mourinho was successful during his first spell in charge at Chelsea - but the football wasn't attractive . Mourinho's insistence on playing a defensive style infuriated big-name signings like Arjen Robben . Joe Cole was criticised by Mourinho for not having enough defensive discipline in a win at Anfield in 2005 . This is why players like Arjen Robben became frustrated. The Dutchman said this after leaving Mourinho's Real Madrid: 'He puts out a winning team, it does not matter if it's done with nice football or not.' Further evidence is when Joe Cole scored the winner against Liverpool in 2005. Mourinho said this in his post-match interview: 'I needed 11 players for my defensive organization, but I had just 10. Joe…has to improve when the team needs him to be part of a defensive organization.' Things have changed. I made the trip to Wales at the weekend to see a decent Swansea side ripped to shreds by some spectacular, sensational, sexy Chelsea football. Jose's players did their defending when out of possession of course, and Swansea weren't at their best, but Chelsea were a joy to watch. Andre Schurrle is congratulated by John Terry after scoring Chelsea's fifth goal at the Liberty Stradium . Diego Costa fires home Chelsea's second goal at Swansea following a dazzling move . How Chelsea's movement and passing unpicked the Swansea defence in a matter of seconds for 2-0 . It wasn't functional, it wasn't formulaic. It was bright, it was pleasing on the eye, and at the risk of enraging Mourinho, dare I say, it was like watching Pep Guardiola's Barcelona at their peak. Chelsea led 4-0 at half-time with some stunning flowing football and some wonderfully crafted goals. It could have been six or seven at the break. Take the second goal: when Cesc Fabregas receives the ball around 35 yards out, there are nine Swansea players between him and the goal. Four passes and less than six seconds later, Diego Costa has hit the back of the net. They eased off after the interval but still scored a brilliant goal in which Eden Hazard sparkled during the build-up. He won't like being called the new Arsene Wenger, he'll hate being labelled as the next Guardiola, but Jose Mourinho is certainly a manager reborn. Arsene Wenger stormed the Etihad on Sunday and watched Arsenal win ugly against Manchester City .","Chelsea played wonderful football in their 5-0 rout of Swansea on Saturday .

"Rory McIlroy shot a fine 66 in the first round of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday – but still found himself upstaged by his playing partner, Andy Sullivan. Competing for the first time in one of the star groups, the 28-year-old Englishman admitted he was nervous at the prospect of teeing it up alongside world No 1 McIlroy and US Open Champion Martin Kaymer. It certainly didn’t show once he was one the course as he posted a wonderful 65 to set the early lead alongside Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts and Lee Westwood, who demonstrated just why he is looking forward to this season so much. Rory McIIroy started off with a solid 66 at the Dubai Desert Classic . The Northern Irishman plays a shot during the first round of the tournament on Thursday . Sullivan had one eagle and five birdies in a bogey-free round but the best shot he played might have been a deft chip to six feet from a precarious spot at the sixth that allowed him to save par. ‘I was very impressed with his game,’ said McIlroy. ‘It’s the first time I’d seen Andy play and I like the fact he can move the ball both ways from the tee, while his putting stroke is just pure.’ Sullivan first hit the headlines last year with a hole in one that won him a trip into space. He certainly reached the heights when he started this campaign by claiming his first win on tour in the South African Open to fully earn his starting time among the elite. Not that the modest Midlander saw it that way. ‘I thought they’d messed up the draw when I saw that I’d been paired with Rory and Martin but it turned into one of the best days of my life,’ he said. ‘They made me feel so comfortable and to play so well was just brilliant. To be honest, I didn’t look at a leaderboard all day. I was just enjoying watching Rory and Martin play. 'Now I want to play alongside these guys more and more. It brings out the best in my game.’ Andy Sullivan (pictured)  set an early lead alongside Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts and Lee Westwood . Joint leader Colsaerts plays a shot during the first round of the tournament . Kaymer, in his first round since his Abu Dhabi meltdown, showed all his class with a 67 while McIlroy was a little irritated that a blemish-free performance was ruined by a bogey at his final hole, the ninth on the card. ‘It’s not the way you want to finish, obviously, but I’m happy enough with my score,’ he said. ‘I started off slowly and didn’t hit a fairway until my eighth hole. But it got better as it went along.’ It certainly did. The fifth and sixth are two of the hardest holes on the course but McIlroy made them look easy with successive birdies. Westwood told MailOnline in the build-up that he was relishing the prospect of this season more than any other in recent times and certainly made a good start with a flawless 65. ‘One of the joys of living in Florida is you don’t come out in your opening tournament trying to get rid of any rust,’ he said. Westwood takes a break during the first round of the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday . Stephen Gallacher follows his ball on the 13th hole during round one of the Dubai Desert Classic . ‘You get to play a lot of winter golf to keep sharp and that has shown today. I played really well.’ So did the Scot Stephen Gallacher, who is trying to become just the sixth player in European Tour history to win the same event three years in a row. He got his quest off on the right foot with a fine 66, including an eagle three on the par-five 13th. It means in 13 rounds on this course, Gallacher has now played the hole in 14 under par. ‘That’s just mad, isn’t it?’ said the Ryder Cup man. ‘To be honest, I wish I didn’t know that. It’s certainly put the pressure on tomorrow.'","Rory Mcllroy hit an impressive 66 at the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday .

"Mahendra Singh Dhoni admits India's one-day side are not at their best ahead of Friday's Tri-Series decider against England. Whichever side wins at the WACA will go on to meet Australia in the the final 48 hours later, while the losers head into World Cup month on a low note. The ODI rankings favour Dhoni's men, who are second to England's fifth, but that counted for little when the teams met in Brisbane last week. India captain MS Dhoni, pictures in action against England last week, calls for improvement from his side . Dhoni has declared he is not satisfied with the performance of his side leading up tot he World Cup . A springy Gabba deck played into England's hands as India collapsed for 153 en route to a nine-wicket thrashing. And captain Dhoni recognises the need for an improved showing. 'I'm not really (satisfied), but it doesn't always go as planned,' he said. 'I have been in this position quite a few times. We know what needs to be done and ultimately what's important is for the guys to take that extra responsibility because you just need that spark, that 10-15 minutes and everything falls back into the right place.' Dhoni walks after edging a Steven Finn delivery during the nine-wicket defeat by England . Rohit Sharma, India's big-hitting batsman, will again be missing as he recovers from a hamstring injury, placing further spotlight on the misfiring batting order. Star man Virat Kohli's continued deployment at number four and a perceived lack of firepower lower down the order have both been criticised and Dhoni has his own concerns about the line-up. 'The reason why Virat is batting at number four is the strength of the middle order and the lower middle order,' Dhoni said. 'In the middle order we have lost too many wickets and that really hampers the plan because if you get off to a good start and you have a good partnership then you don't want wickets to fall in pairs. Dhoni and Australia's George Baily (centre) out for the toss before Monday's match was abandoned due to rain . 'That is what is happening to us so if we can avoid that then everything will be good. 'If I am batting at six and I am worrying about the batsmen coming after me, whether they can or cannot play eight to 10 overs... if I look to play a big shot and if I get out, whether we will be able to capitalise or not... that's the reason why Virat has to bat four.' Dhoni went on to query England's apparent edge over India, suggesting the previous result and the nature of the Perth pitch would not be factors. 'They had the psychological advantage in the ODIs last year in England as well (when India won the series),' he said with a smile. 'And in Perth is not like the ball comes off 15 or 20kmph faster. Whoever bowls 140kmph bowls only 140kmph.'","England beat India by nine wickets in the Tri-Series last week .

"The Spanish sports papers try to make sense of the basket-case Copa del Rey match between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in their Thursday morning editions. 'They went crazy again' reads the headline on the front of Marca, which features a close-up of the boot Arda Turan hurled at the linesman during the second half. The referee decided a yellow card was sufficient punishment for Turan, despite the impassioned protests of Barcelona coach Luis Enrique. 'They went crazy' runs the headline on Thursday's Marca after the game between Atletico and Barca . It takes about 10 lines on Marca's front page to fully summarise all that happened but the upshot is that Barca's 3-2 win on the night takes them into the semi-finals 4-2 on aggregate. Meanwhile, Atletico defender Cristian Ansaldi, who was on his way to support his team-mates at the Vicente Calderon, was detained after catching a policeman's hand in his car door. Ansaldi was trying to drive closer to the stadium but police had already sealed off the access road. As he tried to move barriers blocking his path, he caught the policeman's hand in the door. Detained during the match at the Arganzuela station, he wasn't released until 12.55am. AS call it a 'crazy game' and feature a photo of Fernando Torres trying to scrap with Neymar during one of the many flashpoints. They pinpoint the 42nd minute as the moment things started to unravel for Atletico following Neymar's goal to make it 3-2. AS reflects on a 'crazy game' packed with bad temper and incident as Barcelona progressed to the last four . Gabi was sent off in the tunnel at half-time following another confrontation and Mario Suarez also saw red late on to compound Atleti's ill-disciplined performance. AS also report that Cristiano Ronaldo will be available to play for Real Madrid in the derby with Atletico on February 7 after being handed just a two-match suspension for kicking out at Edimar in their 2-1 win over Cordoba at the weekend. The Portuguese will miss the matches against Real Sociedad and Sevilla instead. Mundo Deportivo take the Barcelona perspective on things, featuring a picture of Neymar jumping into the air to celebrate one of his goala and the headline 'leap into the semi-finals.' Interestingly, despite Barca's win, they say that the referee killed the game with his decisions to send off the Atletico players. 'A leap into the semis' reads the headline on Mundo Deportivo after Barcelona's 3-2 win on the night . Unsurprisingly, they take a different approach to Ronaldo's suspension, saying that the Spanish League's competition commission has shown leniency. A play on words for Sport, whose headline reads 'La Copa del Ney' in reflection of Neymar's two decisive goals. The paper hails the 'Trident' between the Brazilian, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, which caused Atletico endless problems during the second leg. A 'Copa del Ney' headline for Sport as they mark Barcelona's victory at Vicente Calderon . In Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport have been speaking with agent Mino Raiola, who says Juventus will regret it if they decide to sell Paul Pogba. 'Paul is a Van Gogh, the price will be decided by whoever buys him,' he says. Raiola reveals that his biggest mistake was selling Mario Balotelli to Milan in January 2013: 'With Manchester City he was playing football that mattered.' Gazzetta dello Sport have an interview with agent Mino Raiola, who says Juventus would regret selling Pogba . Corriere dello Sport report that Mattia Destro's move from Roma to Milan will go through on Thursday. Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani made a personal mission to Destro's house in Rome to convince him to sign a loan deal. The paper also suggest that Roma are interested in signing Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano and Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka. Mattia Destro will complete his move from Roma to Milan on Thursday, according to Corriere dello Sport . Tuttosport reflect on Juve's latest win, 1-0 at Parma to reach the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday night. 'Matador' Alvaro Morata scored the winning goal to send Juve through and they will face either Roma or Fiorentina in the last four.

"With polished silverware still in the kitchen drawers and outdated toiletries sitting on a dusty dressing table, these incredible photographs show a perfectly preserved home that was abandoned by its owners decades ago. From the retro patterned wallpaper to the well out-of-date food in the pantry, the dilapidated home in Ontario, Canada, is a remarkable time capsule. An urban explorer called Dave made the stunning discovery while he was looking at abandoned properties in his home province - and documented his findings on his website Freaktography. 'The sight upon entering this house was eerie, breath-taking and weird,' he said. 'There is the usual smell of decay and years of abandonment that one comes to expect in this hobby.' Dave found musical instruments, including a gramophone and a stereo system that would have been state-of-the-art at the time, books and family photographs - offering a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of the former occupants. 'This family loved music': Dave found it 'unsettling' to see so many personal possessions left behind in the living room. An acoustic guitar remains in its case on the coffee table, several record players sit atop an old lift top record player as well as a stack of vinyl records . The worst decayed room, pictured, in the abandoned house in Ontario, Canada, featured a red couch and two plush chairs. Dave says he keeps the locations of his finds secret so they can remain preserved . Dave found an acoustic guitar in the living room as well as a multitude of other music paraphernalia. 'Between the guitar, piano, recorder, harmonicas and the record players and eight-tracks that I found, I could see music was obviously a huge part of this family’s life,' he said . A tiny television sits in the corner of one of the rooms, as well as a wooden bureau and display cabinet full of objects. Dave said: 'Very few of the abandoned houses you will encounter have all of the previous occupant’s belongings' A clock sits atop the desk, permanently stopped at 3.43 and other trinkets include mugs and candles. A china cabinet, left, is stocked with the essentials for entertaining guests with shelves full of plates, bowls, glasses and decorative teacups . Inside the drawers of the desk are two sets of still polished silver, but some drawers on the cabinets would not open after years of remaining closed. 'The sight upon entering this house was eerie, breath-taking and weird,' said Dave . Glasses and floral teacups (one complete with a knitted tea cosy) remain stacked on their shelves ready to be used. Dave discovered the perfectly preserved home while he was surveying abandoned homes in his home state . A shaving kit, once used by the man of the house, remains intact on a dirty dressing table, as well as shoe shine polish and jewelry cleaner . A fully stocked pantry, left, gives a glimpse into the eating habits of the family, with several packets of Jell-O on the top shelf as well as cooking ingredients, including spices and baking powder and right, a china cat sits on a shelf in the kitchen . The main room in the house is dominated by the dining table, still with its table cloth and chairs in place and near it is a hutch with the cabinet and desk stocked with crockery and cutlery . Another living room, with paint and wallpaper starting to peel away, features a piano and a small table and chair set near the windows . In a bedroom, Dave found a dresser, inside which were lots of family albums. On top there with a photo of a small child in an old frame, a comb and a hairbrush. He said: 'It was an interesting scene that I really wanted to capture' He also found a box stuffed with hats, jewelry, pictured, and photo albums. He said: 'I opened some but others I left – over time when things stay in one place, they become a part of that place so moving a photo album meant ruining that photo album' An open drawer shows illustrates tins and a pile of newspapers. Dave said: 'It was as though every single newspaper ever delivered to the house had been kept and placed into a box' Dave said he found the bedroom almost impossible to shoot as it was so full of possessions. The family who lived in the house were clearly well-read as shelves were piled high and in every nook of the house . Dave said: 'Each room upstairs is full of books, books on addiction, books about Jesus,  books about war, books about peace and magazines, and then even more newspapers.' Pictured, a woman's handbook on gynecology and one called 'Pornographics' The study is packed wall to wall with books, papers and trinkets. 'In and around this desk were stacks of magazines and files and binders stacked to the ceiling,' Dave said. 'Underneath and on either side were filing cabinets packed full of paperwork and bills and medical files' A book about coping with death, left, sits on the bed, and right, the gramophone was concealed in a wooden box with a doily draped on it . Dave was amazed to discover an early-20th century gramophone, complete with a turn crank on the side, replacement needles and wipes to clean the records. He said: 'I was so taken aback  that I didn’t even think to drop the needle, turn the crank and let the music play from her speakers one more time – this is my biggest regret' A view from the top of the staircase leading into a bedroom, which contains a small TV, and leads into another bedroom. In one of the bedrooms, Dave said he opened a dresser drawer to find it packed with neatly organized fur scarves and cuffs for coats .","Dilapidated home in Ontario, Canada, discovered by an urban explorer, is a remarkable time capsule of the decade .

"A neo-Nazi party who advocate forcing immigrants into work camps and planting landmines along the border are today savouring unprecedented political success in Greece. Golden Dawn party will enter parliament with seven per cent of the vote after the electorate shunned the main parties who they blame for plunging the nation into austerity. The obscure extreme-right group are one of the biggest winners in a poll which has plunged Greece into a fresh political crisis. Scroll down for video . Rise of the far right: Dressed in black shirts and brandishing flares, these Golden Dawn supporters celebrate after they secured almost seven per cent of the vote . Extremism: A supporter of the far right party waves a Greek flag as they become the most extreme right-wing group to sit in parliament since Greece returned to democracy after the fall of a military junta in 1974 . The party, who deny being neo-Nazis, have branded journalists 'liars' and warned all 'traitors' to run scared. They adopt the Nazi salute and have a stylised swastika as their logo and have . already made inroads into local government - in areas of Athens where . there are large numbers of immigrants. At the last general election they took just 0.23 per cent of the vote. But the group has cultivated a benevolent . image in some Athens' neighbourhoods by dropping off food to needy . families and escorting elderly residents to cash machines. This time they easily passed the 3 per cent threshold to win their first seats in Parliament. Flanked by burly, muscular men in tight black t-shirts, Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Mihaloliakos marched down the street in Athens yelling 'liars' and 'You must be ashamed for all your lies!' at foreign journalists following him. 'Greece is only the beginning,' he shouted at them. When asked what that meant, he said: 'You know very well', wagging a finger at the television camera. Ruling party hit: The coalition saw their share of the vote shrivel as the electorate turned to extremist parties including Golden Dawn . As they strode to the hotel, his supporters began chanting 'Greece belongs to Greeks' and 'Foreigners get out of Greece'. When asked what his first action in parliament would be, Mihaloliakos said: 'All the illegal immigration out! Out of my country, out of my home!' Asked how he planned to carry that out, he angrily said: 'Use your imagination'. As he entered the news conference, party members ordered assembled journalists to stand to attention. Seats victory: Leader of extreme-right Golden Dawn party Nikolaos Mihaloliakos (centre) pledges to 'get all immigrants out of the country' after they secured their first seats in Parliament .

Extreme: A supporter of the far-right Golden Dawn party holds a flare last night as they won 7 per cent of the vote. The party has vowed to kick out immigrants and put mines on Greece's borders with Turkey . 'I'll say one thing: 'Veni, Vidi, Vici',' Mihaloliakos said from the podium, surrounded by his bodyguards sitting motionless with their arms crossed. 'You defamed me, you shut my mouth - I won.' It is the first time such an extreme right party has been in parliament since the fall of a military dictatorship in 1974. 'We will continue our struggle for a free Greece, free from foreign loan sharks and a Greece that is independent and proud, without the slavery of the bailout,' said Mihaloliakos, who was elected to the Athens city council in 2010. He promptly gave the Nazi salute on his first appearance there. 'We will struggle for a Greece that is not a social jungle because of the millions of immigrants they brought here without asking us,' he said. The group - which openly displays books on Aryan supremacy at its party offices - has been frequently linked to racist attacks, but denies beating up migrants. 'This victory is devoted to all the brave boys with the black T-shirts and the white letters reading Golden Dawn,' Mihaloliakos said. 'Those who betrayed the motherland - you should be scared now.'","Right-wing extremists Golden Dawn won 6.9% of the vote and will have 21 seats in Greek Parliament .

"Controversy: LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant has said that he wouldn't necessarily support someone because of the color of their skin and criticized Lebron James and Miami Heat . LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant has been heavily criticized after saying that he didn't think he should necessarily have an opinion on Trayvon Martin's shooting just because he is African American. During an interview for a profile piece in the New Yorker, which will be published on April 4, the 35-year-old said also took the opportunity to pour scorn on Lebron James and the Miami Heat for posting a photo of them wearing hoodies in the aftermath of Martin's death at the hands of George Zimmerman. Asked about that, Bryant said he took exception to any idea that Africa-Americans should hold opinions based on their race alone. 'I won’t react to something just because I’m supposed to, because I’m an African-American,' Bryant said. 'That argument doesn't make no sense to me. So we want to advance as a society and a culture, but, say, if something happens to an African-American we immediately come to his defense? 'Yet you want to talk about how far we’ve progressed as a society? Well, we’ve progressed as a society, then don’t jump to somebody’s defense just because they’re African-American. 'You sit and you listen to the facts just like you would in any other situation, right? So I won’t assert myself.' Tribute: Lebron James and his Miami Heat colleagues posed in hoodies in the aftermath of Trayvon Martin's death at the hands of George Zimmerman. Kobe Bryant has criticized this stance in April's edition of the New Yorker magazine . The comments have provoked a huge backlash and debate and led to accusations that Bryant is out of touch with real African-American issues. Indeed, Bryant, who spent much of his childhood in Italy, where his father was a professional basketball player, has even faced calls for young people to boycott any product he endorses. Civil rights activist Najee Ali, director of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., called for a boycott of all things Bryant. 'African American youth should no longer buy Bryant’s jerseys or shoes and should boycott all products he endorses,' Ali said in a statement according to Fox News. 'Bryant doesn’t identify with the struggle that our African-American youth face nationally. So why should we continue to support Bryant who has never truly identified with the African American experience.' Division: Trayvon Martin was killed on Februaru 26, 2012, as he passed through the gated, Sanford, Fla., community where George Zimmerman lived and served as a watch volunteer . Speaking on Friday,  Miami Heat's Wayne Wade responded to the the piece, called 'The Last Quarter'. He denied that race was the overriding factor in posing for the hoodie picture and said that proximity was the biggest factor. Martin was killed on Februray 26, 2012, as he passed through the gated, Sanford, Florida, community where Zimmerman lived and served as a watch volunteer. 'It was our backyard, and being in our backyard, being something that a lot of guys on this team—not only growing up in the kind of environment that Trayvon was in—but also having young boys,' Wade told Bleacher Report. 'Knowing that he is a big fan of the Miami Heat. That is something that we got behind. As a team. I can't even say the organization. 'It was as a team. We got behind it. And it was more so that than the color of his skin.' Support: Some did not take umbrage with Kobe Bryant's comments and offered qualified support for them . Response: In the aftermath of his comments to the New Yorker magazine being reported, Kobe Bryant clarified his position on the matter in this Tweet . However, hours later, Bryant tweeted support for Martin, saying 'Travon (sic) Martin was wronged THATS my opinion and thats what I believe the FACTS showed. The system did not work #myopinion #tweetURthoughts.' But Twitter was split on coming to the defense of the 16-time NBA All-Star and challenging his support of issues in the African American community. Hall of Fame NFL running back Jim Brown told the New Yorker that Bryant doesn’t understand African-American culture. 'Kobe is somewhat confused about culture, because he was brought up in another country,' said Brown. A piece at The Urban Daily declared, 'Over the span of Kobe Bryant‘s career….we’ve seen him do and say some very smug, cavalier and even cornball things at times but the comments that he made regarding the Miami Heat’s support after Trayvon Martin was killed…by far takes the cake!'","Basketball star Kobe Bryant has been attacked for claiming that he shouldn't be expected to support Trayvon Martin simply because he is also African American .

"The accusation thrown at Arsenal this season has been that they are a one-man team, that the goals of Alexis Sanchez have carried them so far. Well, that’s not strictly true. Statistics reveal that the Gunners have the widest spread of goalscorers of any Premier League team this campaign. While Sanchez has been a revelation at the Emirates since his summer move from Barcelona, scoring 18 goals, there have been 17 other different scorers for Arsene Wenger’s side. Alexis Sanchez has scored 18 goals for Arsenal in his first season in English football . Arsenal have been lucky enough to count of 18 different goalscorers throughout this season . Sanchez, Giroud, Welbeck, Cazorla, Ramsey, Podolski, Koscielny, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rosicky, Ozil, Arteta, Chambers, Debuchy, Gibbs, Mertesacker, Sanogo, Walcott, Wilshere . Compare that to beleaguered Aston Villa, who only record seven different players to have found the net. But, somewhat surprisingly, it is Harry Redknapp’s Queens Park Rangers who hold the dubious honour of having the fewest amount of goal-getters this term at just six. Charlie Austin has scored 59 per cent of their goals. Despite being lauded for their attacking play, Manchester United are in the bottom half in terms of personnel scoring, with only 10 different players having hit the back of the net. Sergio Aguero (here playing against Everton) is one of 15 different Manchester City scorers this term . Ayoze Perez is Newcastle United's top scorer but has only found the net five times . Remarkably, Gabriel Agbonlahor is one of just seven different goalscorers for Aston Villa . Manchester City have 15 different scorers, which looks likely to be added to with the arrival of Wilfried Bony from Swansea City. Tottenham have the same amount as Manuel Pellegrini’s title chasers, with Harry Kane grabbing the most.

"Relative to millions: Mongol warlord Genghis Khan . Hundreds of millions of people are descended to tyrants and despots, according to a study. Laura Betzig, an evolutionary anthropologist from Michigan, has discovered that rulers such as Genghis Khan, Rameses the Great and Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor systematically impregnated women, the latter fathering around 100,000 babies. It means that there are millions of people alive today with genetic traits associated with seeking power and oppressing people. Betzig explains that mass impregnations began around eight to nine thousand years ago when emperors and elites took over from hunter-gatherers. Betzig told The Sunday Times: ‘In evolutionary terms this period of human existence created an enormous selective pressure, with the guys at the top who had the least desirable traits passing on their genes to huge numbers of offspring.’ Her research covered the rulers of the first six great civilisations - Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Mexico and Peru – but it was in China that mass impregnations was carried out the most systematically. Numbers game: Rameses the Great is thought to have fathered around 200 children . Yangdi: The Chinese emperor is credited with impregnating a staggering 100,000 women . One historian believes that Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor, for example, had children with 100,000 women. For more than 2,000 years the system in China, said Betzig, was that women would be taken to the emperor to be impregnated when they were most fertile – and they had to be under 30 and attractive and symmetrical. The 13-century Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, meanwhile, is thought to have 16m male descendants, thanks to his habit of sleeping with scores of women. And Rameses the Great, who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago, fathered 200 children. Some British lords also passed on their genes in a similar manner, with some having sex with hundreds of serfs, according to Betzig. Her research is published in the latest edition of Evolution & Human Behavior.",16m are thought to descend from Genghis Khan .
"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has taken his firmest step yet toward running for president, launching an organization that allows him to raise money for a potential 2016 campaign. While not a formal entry into the race, opening the political action committee is the most definitive sign yet that Christie will seek the Republican presidential nomination. The move comes not long after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced in December he was launching a similar organization, which kicked off an aggressive race to lock down donors and may have drawn 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney into the race. Road to the White House: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched a federal political action committee, or PAC, Monday as he seeks to lay the ground work for a likely 2016 presidential campaign . Preparting to run? The new group, Leadership Matters for America PAC, will allow the 52-year-old to travel the country to raise money and support like-minded politicians, but it can’t specifically advocate on his behalf . 'We believe there's a void right now in leadership throughout the country,' Christie's chief political adviser Mike DuHaime told The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news early Monday. 'We aim to support candidates who are willing to take on tough problems and make tough decisions.' The creation of the political action committee 7/87/8— called Leadership Matters for America — was widely expected. The former federal prosecutor has been in the GOP's presidential discussion since 2012, when he passed on the race and was later considered by Romney as a potential running mate. Can he do it? The launch comes two days after Christie appeared at a conservative cattle call in Iowa, where he sought to prove he could reach out to a skeptical party base . After overwhelmingly winning re-election in heavily Democratic New Jersey in 2013, Christie turned quickly toward laying the groundwork for a 2016 campaign. In the past several months, he has held meetings to court donors, convened late-night briefing sessions on foreign policy and made repeated visits to early-voting states, including Iowa over the weekend. He takes his next step into the race with several advantages, among them having recently completed a banner year of fundraising as chair of the Republican Governors Association. The group raised more than $100 million on Christie's watch and helped Republican candidates win a series of unexpected races, including the nominally Democratic states of Maryland and Illinois. Serving as RGA chief also gave Christie the opportunity to travel across the country and build relationships with donors and activists. He is also one of his party's most talented retail politicians, reveling in the kind of one-on-one interaction that voters in the crucial early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire demand. Thinking it over: Christie is not expected to make a final decision on his candidacy until the spring . Also running? Earlier this month, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a leadership PAC and a super PAC in preparation for his presidential run . But Christie also has challenges to overcome, including the still-pending federal investigation into accusations that former staff members and appointees created traffic jams as political payback against the Democratic mayor of a New York suburb by blocking access lanes to the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan. He's also dogged by questions about the economy of New Jersey, including several recent downgrades of the state's credit rating and sluggish job growth. Christie is also viewed with distrust in certain conservative circles, while other question whether his brash persona and habit of confrontation will play well outside his home state. While Christie has told supporters to 'relax' about the timing of his entry into the race, he has faced mounting pressure to get started after Bush — whose support and donor base significantly overlaps with Christie's — said he would 'actively explore' a run. Christie's campaign is likely to focus on many of the themes he's spent years developing in New Jersey, including a pitch that he can expand the Republican Party's tent by appealing to independent, women and minority voters, who helped him win his commanding re-election victory as governor in the reliably blue state.","Christie, 52, has not declared a bid for the presidency, but has discussed national themes in recent speeches .
He was in Iowa, a key state in the primary elections, this weekend for a summit attended by influential Republican activists .
Christie, who many conservatives see as a moderate, touted his ability to appeal to a broad section of the electorate from Hispanics to independents .
According to a poll released last Thursday, nearly three in five registered voters in New Jersey do not think Christie would make a good president .
Christie's popularity was dented over revelations that officials in his administration ordered closures on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 .
Earlier this month, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush launched a leadership PAC and a super PAC in preparation for his presidential run .
It's expected Christie will make a decision in the spring ."
"Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and the upper chamber's new leader, doesn't blame the majority of Americans for having a poor opinion of the legislative branch. Americans are 'right' to think Congress is doing a lousy job, he said in a joint interview with House Speaker John Boehner that aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes. 'I wouldn't vote to approve this Congress,' he said. 'I can tell you the Senate has been essentially dysfunctional for four years. I mean, it's basically been shut down.' McConnell's own management style has come under scrutiny this week from Democrats who argue that they're being unfairly silenced. Meanwhile, Boehner is taking fire from Democrats over an invite he extended to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu behind their backs. House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sit down for their first joint interview since the new Republican majority Congress convened earlier this month. The Republican leaders defended their management style, which has already come under criticism by Democrats . In power for less than a month, Republican leaders are learning just how heavy the head is that wears the crown. During the first week of Congress, Boehner faced a revolt from 25 members of his own caucus demanding more conservative leadership. Boehner overcame to the siege and successfully won reelection to the speakership, but bad blood between the Ohio lawmaker and the right wing of the Republican Party appeared to linger as the 60 Minutes interview commenced last week. Defending his 'voting record is as conservative as anybody here,' Boehner went after the Tea Party's tactics. 'Frankly, a lot is being driven by national groups here in Washington who have raised money and just beating the dickens out of me,' he told 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley, adding that they do it 'because it works.' 'They raise money, put it in their pocket, and pay themselves big salaries,' he said, calling the effort to keep the Republican Party unified 'a work in progress.' Boehner made himself the target of Democratic scorn this week after he invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress without consulting his colleagues across the aisle or the White House, which typically coordinates visits from foreign heads of state. The gesture, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, was 'inappropriate.' Pelosi, who is Boehner's predecessor, warned that the power of the House Speaker is 'not to be squandered.' President Barack Obama's spokesman called the end-run a breach of 'protocol,' and the White House said Obama would not meet with Netanyahu during the visit, now scheduled for March 3, due to the proximity of Israel's elections. Confronted by Pelley over the blindside, Boehner stated: 'I gave 'em a heads up that morning.' 'But there's nobody in the world who can talk about the threat of radical terrorism, nobody can talk about the threat that the Iranians pose, not just to the Middle East and to and to Israel, our longest ally but to the entire world, but Bibi Netanyahu,' he added. Boehner affirmed his support for new sanctions on Iran, which Netanyahu backs but the White House doesn't, and predicted that the House would approve additional punishments on the Middle Eastern country if it doesn't cease its nuclear program. He also confirmed that the House would pass a measure giving Obama the authority to keeping fighting ISIS. The GOP leader defended his decision to invite Netanyahu to speak to Congress, saying Obama brushed over the terrorist threat that America faces in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. 'The president is trying to act like it's not there. But it is there. And it's going to be a threat to our homeland if we don't address it in a bigger way,' he stated. Prodded by 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley to classify Obama's propositions as dead or alive, Boehner grimaced and said the president's tax proposal is 'dead, real dead' McConnell has had a few run-ins of his own with Democrats since taking the helm of the Senate earlier this month. As the Senate Minority Leader, McConnell campaigned in the last election on a promise to restore order to the deliberative body. But Senate Democrats are now accusing him of taking too heavy a hand to the legislative process. McConnell kept the Senate in session until midnight on Thursday debating amendments to legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline as part of a commitment to have an open debate process. Democratic Senators say that only Republican amendments received fair consideration, though. 'Not only did Senator McConnell go back on his word, he deprived the American people of a critical debate on these important amendments. He also poisoned the well just weeks into the new Congress,' California Sen. Barbara Boxer said in a Huffington Post op-ed, turning McConnell's own words back on him. Both McConnell and Boehner repeatedly cautioned President Obama in November not to act on immigration lest he 'poison the well' before the new, two-year session of Congress even began. Obama acted anyway, and now he and Republicans are tangling on numerous issues from the Keystone XL pipeline - which he says he'll veto - to tax hikes on wealthy Americans - a measure Republicans say they won't even bring up for debate. Prodded by Pelley to classify the tax proposition as dead or alive, Boehner grimaced and said, 'Dead, real dead.' He indicated that Republicans in Congress would be willing to work with Obama on his proposal to triple the childcare tax credit for working families, however. 'We're all for helping working class families around America,' Boehner said. 'I think we'll take a look at this when he sends his budget up, something that could be looked at in the overall context of simplifying our tax code and bringing rates down for everyone.' Obama is set to present his budget to Congress on Tuesday, Feb. 6. McConnell asserted that trade was another issue area that Republicans and Obama could likely meet in the middle on. The Senate leader pointed out that the president's comments on trade garnered a standing ovation from Members of Congress from both political parties during the State of the Union.","McConnell's own management style has come under scrutiny this week from Democrats who argue that they're being unfairly silenced .

"Many of us would run a mile rather than listen to the travel recommendations of friends who have just returned from an exotic part of the world complete with sun tans, very long anecdotes and overly effusive comments about how ‘you really should go yourselves.’ But if we were all to base our future holiday arrangements on the advice of others, it seems that – according to a new study – we would all be packing our bags for Costa Rica. Top of the world: Costa Rica has two coastlines - and proffers beauties such as Drake Bay, on its Pacific side . With scenery like the Arenal volcano, Costa Rica is the destination travellers would most recommend . And we would definitely not be going to Indonesia, China, Russia or Albania. New research conducted by the Global Tourism Monitor Survey asked a total of 23,000 holidaymakers, in 26 different countries around the world, to name the destination that they would most recommend to others based on their own travel experiences. Those questioned as part of the survey were restricted to countries they had visited in the previous 12 months, and asked whether they would or wouldn’t tell others to follow suit. The number of people who criticised a recent holiday destination was then subtracted from the number praising a place as visit-worthy, to produce a net score for each country. And the Central American republic came top of the tree with a score of 63 – finishing a clear five points ahead of Austria and Israel (both 58), New Zealand (57) and Italy (56). Not too shabby: Britain, with the sights of London to the fore, came a respectable tenth in the survey . Although not, perhaps, well known to British holidaymakers, Costa Rica’s appeal is easy to fathom. It is one of only seven countries able to boast coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (the others are Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico), and as such, is home to a wealth of wonderful beaches. Britain performed relatively well in the survey, polling a score of 52, finishing in joint tenth position along with Canada and Greece. Other countries fared less well in this court of popular opinion. Tunisia was the only country in the survey to ‘achieve’ the dubious feat of a negative score, polling a dreadful -7. 1. Costa Rica2.

Tunisia . And the Far East also fell foul of plenty of tourists. Although . it can boast the sunshine island of Bali, and some of the world’s most . pristine areas of rainforest, Indonesia finished second bottom of the . pile with a score of just four. Perhaps surprisingly, China – . home to the exciting cities of Beijing and Shanghai, plus the historic . wonder of the Great Wall – came third last, polling a meagre five. And . Malaysia contributed to a miserable survey for the Far East, slumping . to fourth bottom with an unimpressive recommendation rating of six. Eastern Europe also found itself on the receiving end of traveller discontent. Ukraine was the fourth of over 70 states included in the survey to manage a rating of less than ten, with a score of only eight – a vote of no-confidence from holidaymakers which will not, perhaps, come as the biggest shock in light of the current troubles in the country. But Albania (18 points), Russia (20) and Bulgaria (21) will wonder who they offended. ‘This study is one of the most broadly based assessments of recent tourism experiences and future intentions,’ says Jon Young, on behalf of the Global Tourism Monitor Survey. ‘It looks at destination appeal and the likelihood of recommending a country based solely on personal experience in the last 12 months.’ Beautiful, but at the bottom: Despite the allure of Bali, Indonesia did not fare well as a recommended destination . The results, Mr Young says, make happy reading for Britain. ‘It’s a credit to the UK that it has achieved a high joint tenth position in a league table.of more than 70 countries, especially given the competition of countries with more favourable climates,’ he continues. ‘Overseas visits rose to 32.8million in 2013, up 5.6 per cent on 2012, and the prominence of the UK is good news for our tourism sector and the overall economy.’ Half of the 26 countries consulted as part of the survey were in Europe (Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Russia, UK and Ukraine). Eight Asian countries (India, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) were also involved, with four countries in the Americas (USA, Canada, Mexico and Brazil), plus Australia, rounding out the line-up.","Austria also ranks highly as a place travellers would commend to friends .
Britain fares relatively well in the survey, coming joint tenth with Greece .

"A judge set bail at $1.22 million for a 23-year-old Saudi Arabia air force sergeant jailed on New Year's Eve after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old boy in a Las Vegas Strip hotel room. In Las Vegas Justice Court on Friday, defense attorney Don Chairez says he believes police unfairly questioned Mazen Alotaibi because he was too drunk on cognac to surrender his right to a lawyer after the alleged December 31 attack. Alotaibi stood in court with an Arabic language interpreter and said nothing, while judge Bill Kephart called the allegations against him 'appalling.' Mazen Alotaibi, a 24-year-old Saudi air force sergeant, is seen in his shackles in court during an earlier hearing . Mute: Mazen Alotaibi (right), seen here with his interpreter at an earlier hearing, admitted raping the boy when he refused to have sex with him . Chairez said his client would plead not guilty to all charges but recommended that Alotaibi remain in jail until an evidence hearing on January 31. Prosecutors added two lesser charges . alleging lewdness with a minor to the kidnapping, sexual assault with a . minor, coercion and burglary charges that could put Alotaibi in prison . for life if he is convicted. Alotaibi was . arrested in Las Vegas after police say he pulled the boy, who is younger than 14, into his room at the Circus Circus hotel and raped him. ‘There was a kidnapping and sexual . assault with force,’ Las Vegas police Lt. Dan McGrath said. ‘The victim . said he was forced into the room and sexually assaulted. We have a . strong case based on the evidence.' 'Predator': Mazen Alotaibi, a sergeant in the Saudi Arabian Air Force, was arrested on New Year's Eve for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in a Las Vegas hotel . The boy, who lives out of state, was staying at the hotel with his family, McGrath said. He was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and evidence collection and released later to family members. According to the police reported cited by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, three other men were in Alotaibi's room smoking marijuana. Alotaibi told police he was drinking Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to have sex with him for money. The report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him. McGrath said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, Texas. U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said. Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to improve their English-language skills. Crime scene: Police said Alotaibi was staying at Circus Circus hotel on the Strip while on holiday when he sexually assaulted the teenager inside his sixth-floor room . Chairez of Newport Beach, California, said earlier in the month that he had been in contact with U.S. military authorities at both air force bases and with the Saudi government. He said Alotaibi had come to Las Vegas for the New Year's celebration. Alotaibi also is charged with burglary, which in Nevada can stem from a person entering a building with intent to commit a felony. The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower. Circus Circus has a total of 3,767 guest rooms in three towers and five three-story motor lodge-style buildings dubbed Circus Circus Manor. The arrest was first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It cited a police report saying the boy was 13. Far from home: Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi . Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic, law and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment. Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liqour could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.","Las Vegas judge describes December 31 rape allegations as 'appalling'

"It may be a sensitive topic in the top flights of the NFL - but Saturday Night Live pulled no punches ribbing the New England Patriots over the 'deflate-gate' controversy. The NBC comedy show mocked the way the team has handled accusations it under-inflated pigskins in an ADC Championship game, which some claim helped pave their way to a spot in the Superbowl. The program's opening sketch featured a mock version of coach Bill Bellichick, played by Beck Bennett, offering a flat denial he had anything to do with it, followed by blaming other people. Scroll down for video . 'Allow me to throw my quarterback under the bus': The SNL version of Bill Belichick had no trouble passing the buck . 'Nerd stuff!': The show's take on Tom Brady, played by Taran Killam, played dumb and said physics was above his $26.5million paygrade . The sketch referenced a real-life press conference earlier this week, in which Belichick said he had barely even heard of the effects of under-inflated balls on footballs in his decades in the sport. On SNL, Bennett opened his 'conference' saying: 'I have absolutely nothing to do with deflating those footballs. 'I'd like to spend the remainder of the press conference throwing my quarterback under the bus.' In case the implication wasn't clear enough, he then said of Tom Brady: 'I love him like a son, just more of an estranged son that I wouldn't trust around footballs.' 'Brady', played by Taran Killam, then took the stage and played comically dumb about the allegations - describing the much-discussed science of ball pressure as 'nerd stuff'. Fall guy: Bobby Moynihan, who played an assistant balls and equipment coach, eventually admitted to the controversial act . However, an attempt to rattle off the physics of pigskins as 'above my pay grade' fell apart when a fellow comic pointed out that he earns $26.5million a year. But salvation emerged in the form of the 'assistant balls and equipment coach', played by Bobby Boynihan, who revealed that he deflated the balls as an act of devotion to Brady. After taunting the audience with the accusation that they couldn't 'handle the truth', Moynihan then emerged with an unexpectedly blunt admission. He said: 'Did you deflate the balls? You're damn right I did!', providing the comic NFL scandal with a much more definitive resolution than the real-life league is likely to find.","NBC show mocked controversy over inflation levels of footballs in NFL .

The toast and crumpets were washed down with orange juice and coffee served in black ceramic Barista Latte mugs by Whittards, which are currently reduced from £8 to £3. Lining the Oka shelves visible next to the Camerons' £799 hood cooker by Sigma were saucepans from the Jamie Oliver cookware range, which starts at £43, and a cheaper set from John Lewis which comes with a starting price of £30. Finishing off the Camerons' £25,000 Roundhouse kitchen is a £60 clock from Habitat which can just be seen peeking out from beside the Prime Minister's brushed steel fridge. Chic: Behind them could be seen the Camerons' new £1,615 Flos Arco floor lamp while breakfast was eaten from a £785 marble table . Cheap chic: Not everything was expensive. Mrs Cameron's glass-fronted cabinet is a £250 flat Pack affair by IKEA . Drink up! Coffee was served in £8 (now reduced to £3) black ceramic barista mugs by Whittards alongside crumpets and croissants . Tasty: Also on the table was a bumper tub of butter by Danish brand Lurpak, a 500g jar of Marmite and jam by Tiptree . Dark walnut flooring by Swedish flooring specialist Kährs, which costs £75 per square metre and is handcrafted in one of the oldest flooring factories in the world, can be seen underneath. The Camerons' Oka bookcase is as well stocked as the kitchen shelves, with an eclectic mix of titles just visible. Among them are high end foodie tomes such as The Ginger Pig Meat Book and River Cottage Every Day, as well as political reads such as Jeremy Paxman's On Royalty. Both the Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron appear to be fans of a box set with Star Wars, a Desperate Housewives,  Brideshead Revisited, Band of Brothers, Michael McIntyre Live and Kill Bill among the DVDs on their shelves. Although the Camerons benefit from an £30,000 grant awarded to maintain the No.11 flat, any extras, including the £25,000 kitchen, are paid for out of their own pockets. Mrs Cameron was hosting the breakfast in support of the charity, Contact A Family, which offers support and advice to families with children who suffer from disabilities such as cerebral palsy. She is patron of the charity and has her own experiences of raising a disabled child to draw on. Tragically, the Camerons' 'beautiful boy' Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, unexpectedly passed away in February 2009. 'Contact A Family’s exhibition is a fantastic way to highlight the joys and challenges of raising a disabled child,' said Mrs Cameron, speaking during the breakfast at No.10. 'I am delighted to support such a positive initiative and also to welcome Stevie, Philip and their families to Downing Street for breakfast and to hear how Contact A Family makes such a difference to their lives.'

"Darren Fletcher's move away from Manchester United is set to go ahead despite a dispute over a pay-off. Sportsmail understands the club have told the player's agent that they will allow the long-serving Scotland midfielder, whose contract expires at the end of the season, to leave on a free in this transfer window. They are also known to be happy for Fletcher, who turns 31 on Monday, to see out the remainder of his deal at Old Trafford. Darren Fletcher's West Ham United move is being held up over a payment dispute with Manchester United . However, it is unlikely United will both pay-up the remainder of the contract AND waive their right to a transfer fee. Officials believe that not asking for a fee is a sufficient gesture of goodwill towards Fletcher, who is nearing a 20th anniversary with the club he signed for as an 11-year-old. West Ham United are keen on bringing the player to Upton Park but whether they are able to bridge the gap and pay the equivalent of what he would have earned at United is unclear. Despite the above, however, a move away from the club is likely to take place in the near future. Sam Allardyce is keen on bringing Fletcher to West Ham and adding some experience to his midfield . Fletcher was named vice-captain by Louis van Gaal following the Dutchman's arrival at United but has struggled for playing time. The acquisitions of Angel di Maria and Daley Blind have limited his opportunities and he will not be offered a new deal at the club. This season Fletcher has started just four Premier League matches and was replaced as vice-captain by Michael Carrick in December. Aside from West Ham, West Bromwich Albion and Valencia are interested parties. A return to United in a coaching or ambassadorial role is an option, but this would not happen until his playing days are over.

"Prince Charles and David Cameron arrived in Saudi Arabia yesterday to pay their respects after the death of King Abdullah – despite mounting protests over the country’s ‘appalling’ human rights record. There were also claims that flying the Union Jack at half-mast last week was unnecessary, because the Saudis had not lowered their own flag. The Prince of Wales, Mr Cameron and other leaders were set to meet the new ruler King Salman in the capital, Riyadh. But the visit was dogged by claims that UK tributes – including lowering flags at Buckingham Palace and Downing Street – were inappropriate. Visit: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured left) and Prince Charles (right) arrived in Riyadh on Saturday to offer their condolences following the death of Saudi King Abdullah . Tory MP Sarah Wollaston ridiculed Mr Cameron’s claim that Abdullah, ruler of a strict Islamic country, had fostered ‘understanding between faiths’. She said: ‘That will ring rather hollow for anyone who wanted to convert to Christianity or even carry a Bible in Saudi Arabia.’ She added: ‘Half-mast for all Saudi women subject to enforced subservience . . . half-mast for all those Saudis and migrant workers publicly beheaded, stoned, subject to judicial mutilation or flogging.’ Former Tory MP Louise Mensch claimed Mr Cameron and the Prince were ‘spitting on’ women, gay people and the freedom of expression. However, former Labour Middle East Minister Kim Howells said that maintaining good relations was ‘realpolitik’ because of the oil-rich state’s strategic importance. Flag experts claimed yesterday that the Government had no need to fly the Union Jack at half-mast on Friday in tribute to Abdullah, who died aged 90 on Thursday. Graham Bartram, of the Flag Institute, said: ‘Saudi Arabia is about the only country in the world where we could get away with not flying it at half-mast. 'Saudi Arabia doesn’t fly its flag at half-mast. . . because it contains the Shahada, the [Muslim] statement of faith, and they believe that would be an insult to God.’","Visit was dogged by claims that UK tributes were inappropriate .

"Micah Richards believes Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado has all the attributes to be a huge success in the Premier League and reveals the Fiorentina winger has asked him about England. Chelsea are pursuing a deal for the 26-year-old, who was linked with a host of top European clubs after starring at last summer's World Cup, with it looking increasingly likely that Andre Schurrle will join Wolfsburg this January. The German outfit, who are second in the Bundesliga, are trying to finalise a £23million move for the World Cup-winner, while Mohamed Salah could also leave the club before the transfer window closes.

The inclusion of the Egyptian in the transfer of Cuadrado has also been discussed as the Blues look to tie up a £26.8m deal for the former Udinese wide man. After playing alongside the Colombia international for the last few months Richards can understand the interest in him and has even offered advice about playing in England.

"A teenage Russian girl and her lover both died after they hanged themselves from the same rope in a tree after they discovered that she was pregnant. Irina Korovina, 14, and her lover Anatoly Maslov, 22, were found hanging from the same rope from the same branch. Their hands were still wrapped around each other, as tactile in death as they were in life. Pact: A teenage Russian, 14 (left), committed suicide with her 22-year-old lover apparently after they had realised that she was pregnant . Police said that with no suicide note there were still investigating the cause of death, but confirmed that the teenager was pregnant and, being under-age, the man would have faced an investigation if he was the father of the child. Police spokesman Malik Shcherbakov said: ‘Looking at her social media postings it seems that at least up to shortly before her death she was happy, and one of the last postings was “Life is beautiful”.’ He added that they were looking to see whether the man had put pressure on the girl to commit suicide with him after noting that he had injuries which indicated he had at least attempted to slash his wrists before both of them died from hanging. Tragic: Irina Korovina had left a message on a social media site recently saying that 'life is beautiful' ‘There seems to have been some dispute over the parents' request that she have an abortion because of her age,’ Shcherbakov said. The bodies were found hanging from trees in woodland next to Zmeevo village on the outskirts of the western Russian town of Tver after the pair had vanished, sparking a search by locals and police officers. The girl's mother said that they had discovered she was three months’ pregnant the same day, and that they had tried to stop her seeing her boyfriend because of the age difference. He had reportedly worked as a security guard at a local shopping centre. For confidential support in the U.S., call the National suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-825.

"Sportsmail tennis correspondent Mike Dickson believes that the blustery conditions at the Australian Open this week could favour Andy Murray in his semi-final match with Tomas Berdych. The British No 1 eased past local favourite Nick Kyrgios to set up an encounter with the in-form No 7 seed who is yet to lose a set at the tournament. The pair have met before in a grand slam semi-final with Murray defeating the Czech at the 2012 US Open - in extreme gale conditions - before going on to win the tournament. Dickson believes that Murray's ability to adapt to challenging conditions will stand him in good stead, although he would not be surprised if the match went the distance in five sets.

"The girlfriend of Russian tycoon Roman . Abramovich has dramatically apologised after being accused of racism by . posing in a chair that resembled a bound and semi-naked black woman. Art . expert and fashion guru Dasha Zhukova, 32, said: 'I utterly abhor . racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by . this image.' The photograph showing her sitting in the shocking chair was published 'completely out of context', she said. Outrage: Buro 247 used the horrendously offensive image, pictured, of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage . The . chair - designed by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard - was 'an art work . intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics', . she said. The image appeared . in blog Buro 24/7 run by a leading Russian fashionista, Miroslava Duma, . accompanying an interview with Abramovich's partner, who is the founder . of a leading Moscow art gallery. It . shows 32-year-old Zhukova wearing a white shirt and jeans sitting on a . chair, the seat of which is mounted on a lifelike model of a topless . black woman lying on her back in bondage gear with her legs up in the . air and belted to her body. The image created a storm in Britain and other Western countries. 'Certain things just shouldn't exist,' said Cosmopolitan.com's pop culture editor Alex Rees. 'But . if they must... they really shouldn't be photographed and uploaded onto . the Internet -- and especially not on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.' Wealthy: Zhukova, right, is the wife of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, left . The blog also apologised. 'Buro 24/7 is against racism and everything that may humiliate people,' said an editorial statement. 'We sincerely apologise if the posted photos insulted our readers.' Russian . art expert Andrei Yerofeyev said the chair was inspired by British pop . artist Allen Jones, who created similar sculptures featuring white . women. Zhukova is the founder of Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, a gallery in Moscow's Gorky Park. Cropped version: After an immediate barrage of disgusted comments, Duma deleted the picture from Instagram and cropped out the chair on Buro 24/7, pictured . 'This is incredibly racist,' Organizing for Women's Liberation tweeted Monday, after news of the unbelievable picture spread. Ms Zhukova's publicist blasted the use of the image on MLK day and said her client has a strong record of promoting diversity. She said it was 'regrettable' that the image of the chair by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard had been used on such a sensitive day by the blog, and pointed out that such a use took the work completely out of context. Ms Zhukova herself added: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics. I utterly abhor racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by this image.' Zhukova, staring at the camera, appears the complete opposite of the black woman she's weighing down. Editor: Dasha Zhukova is the editor-in-chief of Garage magazine, pictured, which focused on art and fashion. She is also described as a Russian socialite . Dasha Zhukova, the partner of . Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and editor-in-chief of . bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, was born in Moscow but grew up in California. The 32-year-old's father is a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and her mother was a Russian . scientist. Her parents split when she was 3 and she and her mother moved to the US . when she was 10. She went to a privileged Jewish day school in California and graduated the University of California, Santa Barbara . before returning to Moscow and later moving to London. In . 2008, Zhukova founded the IRIS Foundation, a non-profit organization . dedicated to promoting contemporary culture. A year later, she was . appointed editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Pop but she only . lasted three issues. She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion, have . two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 . April 2013. Abramovich has five other children from a previous . relationship. Zhukova's was previously with Marat Safin, the retired . former Tennis World Champion Number 1 but the couple split in 2005. FashionBombDaily.com . editor Claire Sulmers was among the first to express her disbelief, . claiming the photo's message was startlingly clear: 'White dominance and . superiority, articulated in a seemingly serene yet overtly degrading . way.' She wrote on her blog that racism remained rampant in the art and fashion worlds and this needed to stop. 'The . art and fashion industries are the few bastions of society where . blatant racism and ignorance are given the greenlight in the name of . creativity,' Sulmers complained. Twitter erupted after Duma published the article, presumably not realizing citizens in the U.S. and around the world were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality. User Ric Caric wrote, 'I guess Garage Magazine thought that today would be a great day to advertise their racism,' while Julee A. Wilson tweeted, 'MLK is turning in his grave and I'm cursing these people's stupidity with all my heart and soul! MAJOR fail!' User Nikia tweeted: 'Extremely disappointed in Miroslava Duma and Buro247 for posting this nonsense, especially on a day like today. smh,' and Alex von Tunzelmann wrote, 'Even in the grim, tasteless world of fashion photography, this revolting racist image- pub'd on MLK Day!- stands out.' Zhukova was born in Moscow to a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and a Russian scientist but her parents split when she was three and at 10 she moved to the US with her mother. She went to a privileged day school in California and then attended the University of California, Santa Barbara before returning to Moscow and later moving to London. She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion and known for his luxury yachts, have two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 April 2013. Neither Buro 24/7 nor Dasha Zhukova have yet responded to MailOnline's calls for comment.

"Former President Bill Clinton came to the defense of President Barack Obama over his affection for golf, saying he thinks 'it's a good thing' the current Commander-in-Chief has a hobby and that it doesn't insinuate he's 'lazy.' 'Every mind needs some release,' Clinton told Late Night host Seth Meyers during an appearance on Wednesday's show. 'You’ve got to be sensitive to the visuals. You don’t want to have a play picture at a sad time. You’ve got to be sensitive to that,' he said. 'But the idea of taking time off, I think it’s quite important.' Scroll down for video . Bill Clinton says he thinks 'it's a good thing' the current Commander-in-Chief has a hobby; playing golf doesn't insinuate that a president is 'lazy,' Clinton said . 'Every mind needs some release,' Clinton told Late Night host Seth Meyers during an appearance on Wednesday's show . The frequency of Obama's golfing has been an object of criticism throughout his six years in office. And unlike his predecessor, President George W. Bush, who stopped golfing two years into his tenure because he felt 'playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,' Obama refused to give up the sport, even when the country was in the midst of a crisis. Meyers pointed out to Clinton on Wednesday that  'a lot of presidents golf' and they 'get in trouble' for it. 'How important are vacations when you have that job?' the comedian asked Clinton. 'How important is it to go somewhere, be it four hours on a golf course, to just get away from your job, or is your job too important to try to get away?' Not missing a beat, Clinton replied, to laughter, 'Well, first of all, they can always get you if they need you' and noted that the president is always followed around by an agent carrying the nuclear 'football.' 'And you always have global communication. I've had a lot of international phone calls on golf courses,' he revealed. 'When it was going poorly, did you claim you ever claim you had an international call?' Meyers pondered. 'That never occurred to me,' Clinton reflected. 'Where were you when I needed you?' Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he's been in office. But Clinton said that doesn't say anything about his character, or the character of any previous presidents who often played the sport. 'On balance, none of these people would have had the job if they were lazy,' he said, 'and I think we ought to be tolerant.' Clinton has been out of the White House since 2001. He could find himself living there again, though, if his wife, Hillary, runs for and wins the presidency next year. Meyers tried to smoke out Hillary's intentions asking Bill if he is in the market for a new home. 'I hope not, because 2016 is the election year and I don't have any place to move,' Clinton responded. Hillary Clinton has not formally entered the 2016 contest but she is reportedly interviewing staff and is expected to make her candidacy official in the next several months. President Barack Obama and Bill Daley, White House chief of staff, look on as former President  Clinton, putts during a golf game at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in 2011. Obama's golfing has been the object of criticism throughout his six years in office, but Clinton said Wednesday that people out to be more 'tolerant' of the way he relaxes .","'You’ve got to be sensitive to the visuals,' he told Late Night host Seth Meyers.

"Cesc Fabregas has revealed he 'always writes the team down' to figure out how he will fit in and it was that which made the midfielder realise how good a move to Chelsea would be for him. The 27-year-old moved to Stamford Bridge during the summer's transfer window and has become the first player to have 15 assists or more in two Barclays Premier League seasons. Fabregas is used to adding a creative spark almost week in, week out, but the former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder has spoken of a far more simple method to figuring out his role in a team. Cesc Fabregas has revealed he 'always writes the team down' to determine where he will fit into the squad . The 27-year-old used the trick when he moved to Stamford Bridge during the summer's transfer window . Fabregas realised how good a move to Chelsea would be for him once he'd written down the squad . Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Courtois, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Solanke, Loftus-Cheek, Brown, Blackman . 'When Chelsea came, of course I studied in my mind how I could fit in, but I also wrote down the team. I always write the team down,' Fabregas told The Telegraph. 'I had spoken to the manager and I knew what he wanted from me, but after that I always try to analyse what kind of squad there is, if it's good for my type of football because sometimes you can be as good as you want but you don't fit in some certain styles. 'I felt it was a really good move for me after I wrote down the squad.' Fabregas moved within five of Thierry Henry's all-time record of 20, which was set 12 seasons ago . Fabregas admits he has a 'soft spot' for assists, but does he fancy surpassing his former Arsenal team-mate Thierry Henry's record of 20, set between 2002 and 2003? 'Of course, I would like to beat Thierry's record, but it's not an obsession,' Fabregas continued. 'Sometimes you go five games without any assists and all of a sudden in one game you have three. It's always been a part of my game. I think every year I have good numbers in assists. 'I have a soft spot for assists and killer passes since I am very, very young. I like it.' Fabregas has become the first player in  Premier League history to get 15 assists in two seasons . The former Arsenal star picked up his 15th assist since joining Chelsea from Barcelona during the summer .

"England is dominating the international transfer market in terms of spending on overseas players, a new FIFA report has shown. More than £770million was spent by English clubs on players from abroad - £308m (67 per cent) more than nearest rivals Spain. The figures are contained in the FIFA TMS Global Transfer Market 2015 report which also highlights the fact that Spain continues to be the biggest market for signing players aged under 18 from abroad - a fact given extra relevance considering Barcelona's transfer ban for signing minors in breach of the rules and the FIFA investigation into Real Madrid over similar alleged offences. Angel di Maria was the most expensive transfer of 2014, costing Manchester United £60million in the summer . Alexis Sanchez was a contributing factor to England's £770m spending on players from abroad . 1) Angel di Maria - Real Madrid to Man United,     £60m . 2) Eliaquim Mangala - Porto to Man City,             £32m . 3) Diego Costa - Atletico Madrid to Chelsea,         £32m . 4) Alexis Sanchez - Barcelona to Arsenal,             £30m . 5) Cesc Fabregas - Barcelona to Chelsea,           £30m . The report shows English clubs are the biggest-spenders in the world on international transfers making up more than a quarter of the total 4.06billion US dollars (£2.64bn) spent world wide in 2014. The figures included the £60m British transfer record signing of Angel di Maria by Manchester United from Real Madrid. Brazil is the most active country in terms of international transfers with 1,335 moves (incoming and outgoing) - but it has experienced a seven per cent drop since 2013 and England is closing in with a total of 1,263 international transfers, up 193, with Portugal third with 823. Spain was most prolific in signing players under the age of 18 - Martin Odegaard (left) the most recent . Diego Costa signed for Chelsea from Atletico Madrid in the summer, making the top five overseas transfers . In 2014, England spent more than £770m on players from abroad. Spain, in second place, spent £462m - a massive £308m (67 per cent) less. The report for the first time includes details of the international transfer of players aged under 18. Strict rules govern such transfers, such as the parents of the player involved having moved countries 'for non-football reasons'. The report states: 'In 2014, Spain was the country that engaged the highest number of minors. 400 minor applications were submitted, and 352 were accepted. This is... a much higher number than any other association worldwide.' Portugal made 188 applications and England 135. Mark Goddard, general manager of FIFA TMS, told a conference call: 'It is important to note that the more minor applications the better. We are happy to see they are putting in so many applications - that's what they should be doing.' Barcelona have a transfer ban until 2016 after they breached regulations when signing 10 players under the age of 18 in 2013. Real Madrid said in a statement this week that FIFA had asked for information about 51 under-age players but that they had complied with all the rules. A staggering £155m was paid to agents acting on international in 2014, with the thriving English transfer market making up the highest percentage of fees. £57m was paid out by English clubs alone, an increase of £7.8m on the previous year -  a rise of 80 per cent since 2011, when the overall total was £86.2m.

"Scott Sinclair's on-off move from Manchester City to Aston Villa is back on as the parties look to reach a compromise ahead of the weekend. Villa manager Paul Lambert said last week any deal for Sinclair was dead but it has now been revived, with a loan the most likely outcome. Sinclair has made just three starts since signing for City from Swansea in 2012 and 19 appearances in total. Scott Sinclair fights for the ball with Hamburg's Goetz Ashton during a friendly in the UAE last Wednesday . He has played only four games this season - a total of 25 minutes - and has not featured for Manuel Pellegrini this year. Sinclair spent last season on loan at West Brom, where he made 11 appearances and failed to make an impact at The Hawthorns. The former Chelsea trainee would become Villa’s second signing of the transfer window after Carles Gil joined from Valencia earlier this month. Villa, who go to Arsenal on Sunday, are in desperate need of goals, having scored just 11 in the Barclays Premier League this season, and want to bring in more creative players in January.

"The uncertainty surrounding Mikel Arteta's future at Arsenal appears to have been lifted after the player's agent claimed he had signed a one-year contract extension at the Emirates. The 32-year-old - who is currently sidelined with an ankle problem - arrived on a four-year deal in 2011, which was due to expire at the end of the season. However, the Spaniard's agent Inaki Ibanez has told footmercato.net that his client will still be a Gunner next season.  'Mikel is no longer free next June, because he now has an extra year on his contract,' Ibanez said.

"When biting, diving, brilliant Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona, the Premier League had a vacancy for a bad-boy striker to be revered and detested in equal measures. After a successful six-month probation period, you can safely say Diego Costa has landed himself the job. Chelsea's centre forward has been the single-most newsworthy player of the season. Just like Suarez, and Eric Cantona before him, sports editors can rely on at least 50 back-page splash stories a season from Costa. Chelsea's 1-0 win against Liverpool on Tuesday night to book a place in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley was virtually a footnote alongside the Diego Costa show. Diego Costa is forging a reputation as the Premier League's most explosive striker since Luis Suarez (right) Costa has been deadly in front of goal since his move to Chelsea, as this strike against Swansea showed . Suarez was also a lethal finisher at Liverpool, with this long-range volley against Norwich a highlight . Costa showed his dark side with this stamp on Martin Skrtel, for which he was somehow not sent off . Suarez was never far away from controversy, and he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield in April 2013 . He trod on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel – Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers broke off usual diplomatic protocol to use the term 'stamp' to describe the challenge on Can - failed to win a certain penalty because of his reputation for diving, and was regularly taunted by Liverpool fans. In terms of having the emotions stirred, it was like having Suarez back. Everything Costa does is tinged with controversy, and of course he can play too. Jose Mourinho won't care, of course. He bought Costa from Atletico Madrid not for his silky technical skills but for his goalscoring ability and refusal to back away from a fight. Born in Brazil and honed in Spain, Costa has strength and power, and uses it. He ignored the common consensus that it takes time for outsiders to adjust to the Premier League and banged in seven goals in his first four games, leaving Mourinho to make favourable comparisons with Didier Drogba, a genuine club legend. Costa also appeared to stamp on Emre Can's right leg during Tuesday's feisty Capital One Cup semi-final . Costa is never one to back down from a fight, and he clashed with Can after the incident at Stamford Bridge . Costa and Skrtel also squared up after the other stamp incident against Liverpool . Costa was unlucky not to win a penalty, however, when Skrtel clearly tripped him in the area . Costa also appeared to grab Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's throat in yet another violent incident . Gerrard grabbed Costa after the scuffle and the pair had to be separated by team-mates . The controversial striker celebrates after Ivanovic's winner at Stamford Bridge in extra-time . He irritates opponents in a way Suarez used to. The Uruguayan thought nothing of diving, handling, biting, snarling at officials or abusing opponents in order to win. Costa arrived in England with a reputation. Atletico Madrid fans loved him for clashing with Xabi Alonso, Pepe and Sergio Ramos in a Madrid derby. It was harder to excuse a headbutt on a Viktoria Plzen player that got him a red card in the Champions League. But he arrived with pedigree too. His goals fired Atletico to the La Liga title and a Champions League final last season. The price tag of £32million certainly wasn't cheap but Manchester City paid around the same for Eliaquim Mangala, so it wasn't extortionate either. In only his third game, Costa showed he is different. Following a hard-fought tussle with Seamus Coleman, the Everton defender scored an own goal, and Costa felt obliged to give him an earful about it. Everton weren't happy, Chelsea fans loved it. Their man had been the subject of some rough treatment and was getting revenge. Since then, he's hardly been out of the news. Against Swansea City, Costa scored a hat-trick and lashed out at Gylfi Sigurdsson. Frustrated by Sunderland, he caught Wes Brown with a flailing arm and picked up a fifth booking that got him suspended. He was booked against Hull City for simulation. He's argued with countless defenders including Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta. Scott Parker of Spurs is on the wrong end of some foul play by Suarez at Anfield in 2012 . Suarez was not afraid to cheat to win, as this clear handball before scoring against Mansfield in 2013 showed . He was also not shy of diving, such as when he tumbled over Brad Guzan to win a penalty in January last year . Suarez became infamous across the globe when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup . The Uruguay striker, who has now joined Barcelona (right), gives a linesman a piece of his mind in 2011 . But he is no Joey Barton, Robbie Savage or Vinnie Jones, who deal exclusively in controversy. Like Suarez, Costa is among the best players in the Premier League and should Chelsea go on to win the title he will be a leading contender for Footballer of the Year. When someone is that good, you can get away with plenty. Costa has scored 17 goals in 19 Premier League games and at the age of 26 is just about to enter his prime. Drogba was 26 when he first signed for Chelsea and got better with age. No wonder Mourinho is prepared to defend his star man. The FA are looking to clamp down on stamping incidents, but he has already ruled that Costa's contact with Can was 'accidental'. Asked if the player's aggressive nature could be a problem, Mourinho snapped back: 'I don't agree'. We feared the Premier League would be a duller place without Suarez. With Costa around, the vacuum has been filled. The next headline can't be far away. Costa shows off his ripped shirt following another physical battle against Liverpool in November last year .

"Solving the mystery of how 900-year-old African coins ended up in remote Australia could not only recast the history of foreign contact Down Under, but shed light on Aboriginal rock art. How the ancient Kilwa coins, believed to date from about 1100, came to be discovered on the Wessels Islands off the Northern Territory in 1944 has long posed questions about foreign visits to far off Australian shores. Australian Ian McIntosh, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University-Purdue University in the United States, said rock art found on the islands -- which includes one image which appears to show a type of European sailing vessel -- could hold some clues. The Kilwa coins were discovered lying in the sand by Royal Australian Air Force radar operator Maurie Isenberg during World War II . Isenberg initially tried to sell the coins but was unsuccessful. He put them away for decades and it wasn't until 1979 that he sent them to a museum for identification . 'A big part of the next stage will be documenting, dating and interpreting (the art), together with indigenous peoples,' McIntosh told AFP from his home in Indiana. The Kilwa coins were discovered lying in the sand by Royal Australian Air Force radar operator Maurie Isenberg during World War II when he was stationed on the island as the Pacific conflict raged. He found nine coins in all, five African copper pieces and four Dutch coins of European origin which are not nearly as old. Isenberg initially tried to sell the coins but was unsuccessful. He put them away for decades and it wasn't until 1979 that he sent them to a museum for identification, along with a map showing where he had found them. McIntosh said there were several theories on the coins, including that they were washed ashore after a shipwreck. The coins - believed to have originated in the medieval sultanate of Kilwa- have led to speculation that parts of northern Australia were visited by other mariners from as far away as the Middle East and Africa . One explanation could be that a known Indonesian, a shipwreck survivor who lived his life on the Wessels Islands, could have brought the coins to the area . European sailors are known to have sailed the coast of Australia in the 1600s, but it wasn't until captain James Cook landed in Sydney's Botany Bay in 1770 that the British laid claim to the country. The coins -- believed to have originated in the medieval sultanate of Kilwa, an area which is now in Tanzania -- have led to speculation that parts of northern Australia were visited by other mariners from as far away as the Middle East and Africa. As McIntosh wrote in a recent paper for the journal 'Australian Folklore', in terms of the chain of events in the discovery, 'the argument for the involvement of Kilwa traders and also the Portuguese is quite compelling'. He notes the sea route from Kilwa in east Africa to Oman and then onto India, Malaysia and Australia's close neighbour Indonesia was well established by the 1500s and probably for many hundreds of years before that. The coins were found on a beach on the Wessel Islands. The islands, pictured here at marker A, are off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. They were a key strategic position during the Second World War . Aboriginal Australians are thought to have first arrived on the Australian mainland by boat from the Malay Archipelago between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. However, the first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606. Other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century, and dubbed the continent 'New Holland.' In 1770, British explorer Captain James Cook explored the east coast of Australia. The British penal colony was then first established at Botany Bay in January 1788. During the following century, the British established other colonies on the continent. This reduced the number of indigenous Australians because of conflict with the colonists and new diseases bought over from Europe. Australia fought with the British during both world wars. McIntosh said a number of his team felt the coins had simply been washed ashore but admitted 'we're still toying with a whole bunch of ideas here'. The academic said one explanation could be that a known Indonesian, a shipwreck survivor who lived his life on the Wessels Islands, could have brought the coins to the area. The coins, he speculates, may have represented this man's 'worldly wealth'. McIntosh said an expedition he led in July to the site where the coins were discovered, which involved an intensive search in the harsh terrain, had not uncovered any further coins. 'Over the past couple of years, we've developed a whole series of hypotheses to explain how those coins might have got from East Africa to northern Australia,' he said. 'The whole point of this initial site survey was to try and get enough evidence to push us in particular directions.' What the researchers did uncover was the Aboriginal rock art and some potential evidence of shipwrecks -- a not unlikely proposition given the dangerous reefs off the islands -- in the form of a six-foot piece of timber from a boat. McIntosh said the scientists would work with indigenous people to look at the art and see whether it matches any known ship types, adding that there were multiple stories of interaction in the past with 'different people -- black and white from somewhere else, not Aboriginal.' For now the mystery remains. 'These coins probably remained in circulation for a couple of hundred years but only in the vicinity of East Africa, beyond that they didn't have value,' McIntosh said, adding that other coins of this type had only been found in Zimbabwe and Oman. 'Nowhere else in the world have they been found, except for northern Australia,"" said McIntosh. ""Very unusual. That's had everybody puzzled.' Australian scientist and professor at Indiana University, Ian McIntosh, points to the location where the copper coins were found .","Coins date back to six centuries before Captain Cook claimed the island for the British throne in 1770- but where they came from remains a mystery .
Last month rock art was found that may provide clues about their origin .
Scientists hope to match the ships depicted in the art with known vessels ."
"So Diego Costa stamped on Emre Can. And it was probably deliberate. And he might get charged and banned and it fits with the image of his snarling style, as the centrepiece of a compelling and aggressive Capital One Cup semi-final. Michael Oliver, the referee, missed it, apparently. Cue an explosion of outrage and opinion in support of increasing the use of technology in a HD world where a zillion television cameras scrutinise every move from every angle and everyone’s an expert. And yet the very reason this tie was so exciting and memorable, played at breath-taking speed, with great commitment was down to the fact it was allowed to flow by a referee who tried to keep 22 players on the field. Is that necessarily bad refereeing? Diego Costa may still be charged for his apparent stamp on Emre Can . Costa also appeared to stamp on Martin Skrtel after skipping over a challenge in the second half . Costa and Skrtel square up after the incident, for which the striker avoided a card . Jose Mourinho confronted referee Michael Oliver in the the tunnel at half-time . Oliver did well to keep control of what proved to be a fiery and passionate game . Oliver helped the spectacle. Sure, he was lenient. He might have sent off Costa, more than once. He might have given him a penalty. He might have sent off Lucas Leiva. Or Martin Skrtel. Or Jordan Henderson, for that matter, although this current fixation of passing judgment on what is ball-to-hand or hand-to-ball is simply ridiculous. Arms move when people move. The ball bounces. If football is going to be refereed in super slow-motion by officials sat in a glass box in the stands leafing through imperfect rule-books, then let’s forget thrilling football matches like the one at Stamford Bridge. Let’s forget those who tackle for a living. Or those who thrive on physical contact, who exist on the edge and push the rules; those who inspire and lead others with their desire to succeed. Let’s bid farewell to the relentless pace of the game and those brilliant technicians who can perform with a football in the heat of these fierce contests. Those like Eden Hazard, who produced a fabulous display despite the fact that Emre Can’s first reaction almost every time Hazard received the ball was to grab for him with his hands. Or Raheem Sterling taking on the muscle of Kurt Zouma and John Terry with his pace and trickery. Costa appeared to grab Liverpool captain'sSteven Gerrard's throat during another incident . Gerrard and Costa had to be pulled apart by team-mates after going head-to-head on Tuesday night . Also, while we’re at it, draw a line under the debate and the dissent which fuels the passion which stirs the blood and generates a fantastic atmosphere, even in the modern venues built for corporate dining. Of course, let’s strive for fairness. Let’s stop violence and intimidation. Let’s send off those who don’t deserve to stay on. But don’t sterilise these matches. These are what made the sport the world’s favourite. If football has become too important to let mistakes to slip by then the game is in trouble. There is too much money at stake to allow imperfections. Whose fault is that? Do not change the best game in the world for the sake of money by killing the tempo with slow-motion investigations. Diego Costa stamped on Emre Can. It probably hurt. And it looked deliberate. And he might get charged and banned but only one person truly knows whether it was a pre-meditated attack, an opportunistic strike or a complete accident. Let money take its chance. Let the referees do their best. Relax and enjoy the game. What a game that was.","Michael Oliver could have sent off several players during Tuesday's game .

"Italy captain Sergio Parisse believes Ireland currently boast the strongest team in the northern hemisphere but insists the Azzurri can still win when the sides meet in the Six Nations on Saturday week. Italy open up their campaign at the Stadio Olimpico, knowing their opponents are in strong form after recording wins over South Africa and Australia in the autumn series. Those victories pushed Ireland up to third in the IRB World Rankings and Parisse admits Italy are in for a tough game in 10 days' time. Italy captain Sergio Parisse believes Ireland currently boast the strongest team in the northern hemisphere . 'Ireland are probably the best team in the northern hemisphere - it is a chance for us to play them at home,' Parisse said. 'Everyone saw how Ireland played in November. 'They are a very complete team, they have good backs, good forwards, they are very dynamic especially in terms of defence. 'They are good at the turnover, at building mauls and getting in front of teams - they are a difficult team to play against.

Italy recorded an historic 22-15 win when the two teams last met at Stadio Olimpico in 2013 but Ireland exacted revenge at home 12 months ago with a 46-7 victory. 'As Italians, we are not at the same level as Ireland,' Parisse said. 'We beat them two years ago but last year they won by 40 points in Dublin. 'It is important for us to be competitive and see if we are really, really far from them or if we are able to play a full match at our best and beat a team like Ireland. 'It is important because we are going to play them in a few months' time at the World Cup. 'It is important for us mentally to know we can beat these teams. Brian O'Driscoll of Ireland lifts the old trophy after being crowned champions in 2014 . 'If we play 100 games against Ireland we would probably lose 98 so we have a small opportunity to beat them but we have to play every match with this ambition. 'We have to try to be competitive against every team we play at the 6 Nations.' After a superb 2013 campaign, which also included a 23-18 victory over France, Italy lost all their matches in last year's Championships and finished bottom of the table. 'We have shown we can be competitive and we can win like when we beat very good teams in 2013,' Parisse added. 'But last year we played a poor 6 Nations and that is the difference between a great team and a team who can get a great result, but do not have the same consistency.

"Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from Stamford Bridge . Diego Costa was lucky not to be sent off as Chelsea reached Wembley thanks to a dramatic Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Tuesday night. Branislav Ivanovic’s extra-time header was enough to seal a 2-1 aggregate win for Jose Mourinho’s team after a stormy encounter at Stamford Bridge. But Costa could face action after TV cameras showed him stamping on Emre Can and later clashing with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. The striker could miss Saturday’s clash with Manchester City if the FA ban him. Jose Mourinho has leapt to the defence of controversial Chelsea striker Diego Costa . The striker was criticised after he appeared to stamp on two players in the game (Martin Skrtel pictured) Mourinho defended Costa, saying: ‘He goes to the ball, he chases it, the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there when he is looking at the ball.’ The Chelsea manager also revived his conspiracy theory, this time claiming a Sky pundit, believed to be Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp, is waging a campaign against his team. ‘I don’t know what you understand by a stamp,’ he said. ‘Maybe you are already influenced by the campaign on the television with certain pundits saying Costa has committed a crime — the guy who says that must be nuts. ‘It is a great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea.
