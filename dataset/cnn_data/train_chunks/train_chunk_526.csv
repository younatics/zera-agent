It was a bitter grudge match dubbed the Battle of the Bailout - and, unsurprisingly, it was dominated by Germany. The German football team beat their Greek counterparts 4-2 in a quarter-final at Euro 2012 in Poland tonight. The match in Gdansk, watched from the stands by German chancellor Angela Merkel, pitted Europe's economic engine room against the nation many say it is trying to crush, by demanding . huge budget cuts in exchange for rescue cash. And there was no respite for the Greeks as Germany, tipped as one of the favourites for the tournament, ran out comfortable winners. Euphoric: German Chancellor Angela Merkel celebrates after Philip Lahm scores against Greece in the quarter-final . Eliminated: An unhappy Greece supporter watches as her team goes out of Euro 2012 . Merkel has been regularly . ridiculed by Greek media as a 'Nazi' trying to re-take control of their . country. It refers to Greece's occupation by . Adolf Hitler's army from 1941 to 1945, for which some victims' families . are still trying to claim $100billion from Berlin in reparations. As . would be expected, both sets of national media spent the last week . ramping up the tensions between the three-time champions and the . surprise 2004 winners. Greece's . Live newspaper quipped: 'The referee should give Merkel a fright and . toss a drachma coin at the beginning of the match.' Ridicule: Greek fans play with a blow-up doll with a German jersey with the name of German Chancellor Angela Merkel prior to the match . Celebration: Germany's Marco Reus, left, and Jerome Boateng dance after winning the game . Meanwhile, . Gata sports newspaper joked: 'The first measure that our new government . has to push through on the urging of Merkel: we have to lose against . Germany on Friday.' The German press has also drawn on the eurozone crisis. Bild . newspaper said on Tuesday: 'Be happy dear Greeks, the defeat on Friday . is a gift. Against Jogi Loew, no rescue fund will help you.' Winner: Angela Merkel adjusts her glasses to get a better view of her team . Philipp Lahm gave Germany the lead in the 39th minute before Georgios Samaras equalized for Greece in the 55th. But Sami Khedira, Miroslav Klose and Marco Reus all scored to pull Germany clear. 'We made some silly mistakes but at the end we scored four goals,' Lahm said. 'We had many chances in the first 10 to 15 minutes.' Mrs Merkel stood to cheer every time her team scored in the match, which was played amid the political backdrop between the countries. Germany has been a major contributor to economic bailouts for Greece and was instrumental in demanding unpopular spending cuts. Germany dominated nearly the entire match at the Arena Gdansk, but the Greek defense held strong for much of the first half. Lahm finally put his team in front by controlling the ball with his chest and dribbling toward the middle before sending a long-distance shot into the corner off the hand of Greece goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis. The Greeks looked better at the start of the second half, and even equalized when Samaras knocked the ball past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after a perfect cross from Dimitris Salpigidis. But after that goal, it was back to being all Germany. Khedira volleyed in a cross from Jerome Boateng in the 61st, and Klose headed in a free kick from Mesut Oezil in the 68th as Sifakis was late to punch the ball away. Reus made it 4-1 in the 74th, volleying a shot in off the underside of the crossbar after Sifakis had saved from Klose. Salpigidis added a consolation penalty for Greece in the 89th after Boateng handled. Jumping for joy: German forward Miroslav Klose celebrates after scoring . Bowing out: Dejected Greek footballers leave the field after the Battle of the Bailout went Germany's way . Good luck boys: German Chancellor Angela Merkel meets the players she later cheered on . Carnival: Greek fans gathering in the Old Town of Gdansk in Poland where their team takes on Germany . Colourful: Greek fans getting ready for tonight's match against Germany, billed as the Battle of the Bailout . Nazi! German chancellor Angela Merkel has been depicted as Hitler henchman in Greek newspaper Democracy . Attack: A street poster in Greece has depicted Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform with a swastika surrounded by the EU stars. The accompanying words describe her as a 'public nuisance' And Berliner Kurier printed a cartoon of a government spokesman telling German press: 'Our stance on you remaining in the eurozone depends entirely upon how the match goes.' Twitter was predictably swamped with jokes and comments about the match. @AndrewSimms_nef: 'Its Germany vs Greece in the Euro quarter finals. Odds-on Germany to impose penalties, at least Greece can grow their own half-time oranges.' @iainmartin1: 'Presumably for Germany v Greece the German manager will be able to pick the Greek team and impose tactics?' @bill_easterly: 'Greece at halftime of Euro match asks Germany for emergency loan of 4 players.' @AndrewSimms_nef wrote: 'Its Germany vs Greece in the Euro quarter finals.

And @bill_easterly added: 'Greece at halftime of Euro match asks Germany for emergency loan of 4 players.' Another added worry for Greece was that Merkel has a reputation as something of a lucky charm for her country's football team. Merkel attended Germany's 4-0 win over Argentina at the 2010 World Cup and saw them beat Turkey in Berlin in the most important Euro 2012 qualifier for her team. Already this year she's been to visit the player in the dressing room and at their base prior to the tournament's big kick-off. 'She seems to bring us luck,' midfielder Sami Khedira said. The match was played in Gdansk, near the scene of the first battle of World War II as Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Scrawled: Graffiti on the Bank of Greece's HQ in Athens calls it the Bank of Berlin, in reference to the belief that Germany is now in control of the country . A German football federation delegation laid a wreath at a memorial for Polish defenders at the Westerplatte peninsula on the outskirts of the Baltic city. Germany has two Poland-born players in their squad, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski. GREECE: . Population: 10.8million . GDP: 2% (down 5.5% from last year) Unemployment: 22.6% . World Cup wins: 0 . Euro Champs wins: 1 . GERMANY: . Population: 81.8million . GDP: 27% (up 3% from last year) Unemployment: 6.7% . World Cup wins: 3 . Euro Champs wins: 3 . By winning their group, Germany got to stay in Gdansk and will be spared the stress of travel. Germany are the only team to have won all three group games and go into the quarter-finals as the overwhelming favorites. But Greece were undeterred as midfielder Costas Katsouranis said: 'We are playing for our shirt, our flag and for the people back home.' And striker Dimitris Salpigidis said: 'I don't think anyone on the team believes this will be our last game at this tournament. 'People have so many problems in their everyday lives. We're really hoping that we can put a smile on their face.' Greece has plenty of reason to be thankful to Germany, as it was German Otto Rehhagel who led them to glory eight years ago. Greece will be missing suspended playmaker and captain Giorgos Karagounis, but defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos, one of the many players with Bundesliga experience, said the team had nothing to lose.

In posts easily seen online, he boasted of 'chilling' in his 'pad', as well as 'skinning up' cannabis joints and being stoned or as he called it: 'whiffed out me 'ed'. He also says he is: 'on d book' - slang for Facebook - which is 'jus ow jail shud b'. On Sunday he posted: 'yooo bk on d book! nice! nice! Jus chilin in hmp haverigg! NICE!

Good times: Wibberley added that he was enjoying life in jail . Friends contacted Wibberley asking what he had been up to and he revealed he had been arrested in February and hopes to be released from jail by May. Before his current jail term, Wibberley, 23, of Liverpool, was sentenced to four years eight months in prison for his part in a series of armed raids between March 8 and April 15, 2008. Wibberley’s Facebook page has now been deactivated and although the Ministry of Justice said they were unable to comment on individual cases, it is standard practice for inmates to have time added to their sentence for breaking the rules. A Prison Service spokesman said: “Prisoners have no access to the internet and are barred from updating Facebook while serving their sentence, or asking others to do so from outside prison. If they do, their accounts will be terminated. “It is a criminal offence to have a mobile phone in prison and we work hard to keep them out. Any prisoner found in possession of one will be dealt with appropriately.” A HMP Haverigg spokesman said he was unable to comment on the incident. Wibberley admitted two counts of robbery when he appeared at Warrington Crown Court in January 2009, following raids in Runcorn and Widnes that involved threatening staff with hammers, knives, a metal post, and a wooden plank. In March 2012 armed robber Michael Haggan appealed for penpals using a Blackberry from his prison cell in HMP Haverigg, which resulted in him serving extra jail time.","David Wibberley, 23, will probably have time added to his sentence after boasting to friends online .

When Andrew Knight broke his hip in a bicycle accident, he didn’t expect to be treated like a piece of furniture – but that’s exactly what happened. With no ambulances available, paramedics were forced to bundle him into the back of a commandeered furniture lorry. A response car had arrived on the scene soon after the accident, but an approaching ambulance was rerouted to a more serious incident. Injured: Paramedics commandeered a furniture removal lorry to take Andrew Knight to hospital after he broke his hip in a bicycle accident . The medics asked for an air ambulance to be sent immediately, but it could only land in a field nearly a quarter of a mile away. Medical staff and police officers at the scene decided the quickest way to get Mr Knight, 36, to the helicopter was to rope in a nearby furniture lorry, leaving its driver – and a table being delivered to Apprentice star Lord Sugar – at the roadside in Loughton, Essex. Mr Knight, who also damaged his pelvis and abdomen after slipping on an oil spill at a dangerous junction, was loaded into the lorry using a lift normally reserved for crates. The librarian, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was then driven to the waiting helicopter before being flown to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow. He said: ‘I want to say thanks to the driver of the van and sorry to Lord Sugar if I made his table late.’But he also used the incident to warn against cuts to ambulance services, adding: ‘If George Osborne’s health service cuts go ahead we could all be getting furniture vans to hospital.’ The ambulance approaching the scene of the accident in Loughton, Essex, was rerouted to a more serious incident . The van’s driver, Kirk Jeakins, 40, said air ambulance staff had blamed cutbacks for the lack of ambulances. ‘They weren’t happy,’ he added. A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service denied cuts were to blame, and said that using passing vehicles for the transfer of patients was not unusual. ‘Ambulance crews have to think quickly on their feet,’ he said.","Paramedics commandeered the lorry to take Andrew Knight to hospital after the ambulance en route was diverted to a more serious incident .

Hit with the ladies: One in five Russian women would like to marry President Vladimir Putin . As President Vladimir Putin prepares to turn 60 years old, it appears he is still a hit with the ladies as a new survey reveals one in five Russian women would like to marry him. The active President, who is often pictured horse riding topless, hand-gliding and driving Formula One race cars, turns 60 tomorrow. But that doesn't seem to have had any impact on his charm - with six per cent of Russian women saying they 'definitely would' marry Putin while a further 14 per cent said they probably would. Just 43 per cent said they 'definitely would not' want to walk down the aisle the President, who has ruled the country for 12 years, in the survey by the independent polling station Levada. But while the President may still appeal to a high percentage of the female population, it appears that he isn't as popular with the remaining electorate. Putin has been facing growing pressure as protests continue against Russia's rigid political system and repressive Kremlin laws that have provoked wide-spread discontent. Utilities fees and other municipal payments rose during the summer and look set to continue to rise throughout the winter. Analysts warn that the government would quickly run out of cash to pay wages and pensions if Russia’s energy revenues dry up. Even with the current relatively high oil prices, the Kremlin has been struggling to raise funds for a planned pension reform. Putin has pledged repeatedly to ease Russia’s dependence on energy exports, encourage high-tech industries, create incentives for small and medium business and improve the investment climate. But oil and gas revenues still account for the bulk of the government budget, while red tape, rampant corruption and courts bowing to official orders have spooked investors and stymied economic development. Stanislav Belkovsky, a political consultant with past ties to the Kremlin, said: 'Putin hasn’t moved a finger to change the economic model established during his 12-year rule, and he can’t be realistically expected to make any changes now.' Scroll down for video . Action man: Vladimir Putin is often pictured partaking in various sporting activities - often topless - such as horse riding in southern Siberia's Tuva region . Active: Vladimir Putin swimming in a lake in southern Siberia's Tuva region . During the latest election campaign in March, Putin made generous pledges to raise wages and pensions, as well as boost social programs and the military budget. But even Cabinet officials have acknowledged that his promises can’t be fulfilled without destabilizing the economy - meaning he could face trouble whichever way he turns. After his inauguration, Putin cracked down on his foes with a slew of draconian laws that hiked fines 150-fold for taking part in unauthorized protests, decriminalized slander and required non-government organizations that receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents. Taking down the opposition: Vladimir Putin during a judo training session at Top Athletic School in St. Petersburg . Soft side: Vladimir Putin feeds a Beluga whale named Dasha as he visits Chkalov island, 440 miles northeast of the city of Khabarovsk . Putin has suffered a gradual decline in popularity but he still enjoys majority support largely thanks to the absence of a strong alternative after years of Kremlin efforts to sideline the opposition. But for now he seems safe in his position and his adoring supporters will come out in their masses to celebrate his birthday tomorrow in cities from Siberia to Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, where the ruling party's loyal Young Guard will unfurl a banner on a bridge which they say symbolises Putin's role by uniting Asia and Europe. Opponents will make their feelings known much closer to home, protesting near Moscow's Red Square under the banner: 'We're sending the old man into retirement'.

Multitasking: Vladimir Putin in the cockpit of Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber jet at a military airport, outside Moscow, before his supersonic flight in the cruise-missile carrying bomber jet . The organisers plan to send their own symbolic message by asking protesters to bring gifts suitable for a pensioner - anything, perhaps, from reading glasses to a pipe. The man himself will be relaxing with his close family and plans no special celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Just a few months into a third term as president, he may be reaching retirement age, but has no plans to retire. After 12 years as Russia's paramount leader, opinion polls show Putin enjoys higher ratings than most Western politicians, but they are down from their peak during the oil-fuelled economic boom of his first presidency from 2000 until 2008.

Comedian Freddie Starr today said accusations he tried to grope a 14-year-old girl at a Jimmy Savile sex party 40 years ago are killing him. The 69-year-old madcap comic says he wants 'I told you I was innocent' carved into his tombstone as he fears he could have a massive heart attack and die because of the stress. ‘I have never groped a woman in my life,’ he told ITV's This Morning, and was visibly shaking when he said he was going to hospital after the interview because he was suffering from heart palpitations. Protest: Freddie Starr used a TV interview to say he had 'never groped a woman in my life' and wanted to speak to police . Denial: The comic was joined by his fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, who described him as a 'gentleman' Starr: He told Holly Willoughby And Phillip Schofield that he still could not remember being on the show with Savile . Starr had denied meeting his accuser Karin Ward but a video later emerged of the pair of them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’. She claims he tried to grope her in Sir Jimmy's dressing room. 'I've done hundreds of thousands of shows on television - I couldn't recall doing it,' he said today. Presenter: Starr had denied ever meeting Ms Ward - who claims he tried to molest her in Sir Jimmy Savile's (pictured in 1982) BBC dressing room . 'I've got to go to hospital later today as I've had palpitations on my heart. 'If I do have a heart attack and die it will say ""I told you I was innocent"". 'I would never, ever, ever touch an underage girl.' His fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, sat by him throughout the interview and also defended him. 'The sad thing is that we live in Great Britain and in Great Britain you are innocent until proven guilty. We have not heard from the police and he is being tried by the press. 'Those who know Freddie will know this is not true. 'You get people saying, ""oh he's got a younger partner, it must be true"", but it doesn't mean anything. 'Regardless of our age difference, we were consenting adults when we met one another. 'It should make no difference that Freddie's with a younger fiancee, or there's any age difference. It does not mean that these allegations have any truth behind them whatsoever.' Starr also used the interview to slam Jimmy Savile, who is accused of abusing at least 30 children. ‘I think he has . abused his position. Despicable. There’s no words to say about that, . what the man has done, how he has conducted himself. It’s disgusting,’ Mr Starr said. The comedian was named by Miss Ward first by BBC’s Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was shelved. Together: Karin Ward in yellow, sitting behind Freddie Starr when he appeared on the BBC TV show hosted by Sir Jimmy Savile, 'Clunk Click', in 1974 . Allegations: The 69-year-old funnyman was first named by Karin Ward (pictured) when she spoke to the BBC's Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast . Last . week she told ITV News: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie . Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, . and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my step-father and it . frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him.' The 1974 footage showing Starr and Miss Ward was unearthed by Channel 4 News. It showed Starr appearing on Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was . being filmed the day she was abused. Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair. Miss Ward – who also claimed to have . seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in . Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the . now-defunct Duncroft School for girls. Upset: Freddie Starr at the ITV studios, which he left to go to hospital to have his heart checked . Stressed: Starr holds a cigarette and spoke about his fears that he may die from a heart attack . Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded. Starr has not been contacted by police about her allegations. 'I have not been contacted by the police. I want to be interviewed by them. I want it very badly. 'She should have gone to the police with her complaint, not to the press.' Starr - who suffered a massive heart . attack in April 2010 which left him needing quadruple heart bypass . surgery - last week failed to ban ITV from airing Miss Ward’s . allegations. 'My lawyer advised me to get one to give us a bit of space, to clear our thoughts and look at our evidence.' Denial: Freddie Starr, pictured today after his ITV appearance, insists he 'never groped anyone in my life' Standing by him: Sophie Lea says she believes her fiance Freddie Starr is innocent of any wrong-doing .

A well-organised sham marriage gang staged fake weddings with eastern European brides so Pakistani men could illegally enter the UK, a court heard. Czech and Slovak women living in the UK were paid by Rotherham-based Asian organisers to fly out to Pakistan where 'marriages' were arranged with Pakistani nationals. Supported by false documents, applications for settlement and family permit visas were submitted to the British High Commission in Islamabad by Pakistanis seeking leave to join their 'wives' in the UK, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Sham: 18 people face jail as they await the sentencing hearing at Sheffield Crown Court over their involvement in a sham marriage gang in Rotherham . As overseas nationals they would have been allowed to stay in the UK as 'husbands' of their spouses who were legitimately resident here as EU citizens. But suspicions over the growing number of applications in Islamabad led to the ring being smashed and none of the 62 fraudulent visa applications were ever granted. Prosecutor Sarah Wright said: 'It was a well-run, professional and indeed commercial operation. It was a massive operation over a considerable period of time.' The phoney weddings included brides posing for photographs with their 'grooms' and pretending they were getting married. The photos were then submitted in support of visa applications along with false documents claiming the women could support their 'husbands' in the UK. One 25-year-old Czech woman claimed to have been married three times in the space of four months and another 'bride' was found with £1,000 in her handbag when she returned to the UK. Eighteen defendants are now facing jail when they are sentenced at a later date. In a series of three trials at Sheffield Crown Court which can only now be reported after restrictions were lifted, seven defendants were found guilty after trials of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration to the UK between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011. Another 11 defendants pleaded guilty to the same charge. Two of the alleged main organisers are on the run. Ms Wright told the court: 'The aim of the conspiracy was to try and enable the applicants to enter the UK unlawfully. 'Some of those involved were sponsors of the false applications ie the alleged spouse or fiancee of the applicant. 'Although some of the sponsors took part in what appear to be wedding ceremonies with the applicants in Pakistan they clearly had no intention of living with them in settled and genuine relationships. 'Their marriages or pretend marriages posing for photographs and pretending they were marrying were undertaken solely for immigration purposes and were therefore sham marriages.' She said some of the 'brides' never took part in ceremonies but allowed their details to be used, pretending to be the spouse of the applicant. 'The women were part of the conspiracy because they allowed themselves to be put forward as genuine wives of the applicants when clearly they were not,' said Ms Wright. A total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were linked to 32 addresses in the UK and false documents were traced back to an address in Broom Grove, near Rotherham town centre, the semi-detached home at the time of the organisers, brothers Talib Hussain, 41, and Tariq Mehmood, 27, Rahina Zaman, 32, and Veronika Horvathova, 21. Forged documents were also found across the street in a bag in the attic at the home of Mohammed Ramzan, 59, and his wife Musserat Bi, 31. Bi was cleared of conspiracy. The court heard that Mehmood, of Allan Street, Clifton and Veronika Horvothova, of Lindley Street, St Ann’s, both Rotherham are on the run. The eighteen defendants are: Nikola Horvathova, 25, of St Anns, Eva Holubova, 19, Peter Pohlodko, 19, and Zuzanna Holubova, 25, all of Eastwood, Kristina Popikova, of Masbrough, Mohammed Ramzan of Rotherham and Aftab Hussain of Tinsley, Sheffield.

A 'neighbor from hell' has been arrested after waging a four-year campaign of terror that allegedly included fire-bombing a neighbor's boat. Mitchell Igelko faces jail after terrified neighbors installed high-tech security cameras with night vision to catch him carrying out acts of vandalism. The landscaper is alleged to have poisoned neighbors' gardens, thrown nails on the lawns and even set fire to a boat. Many of the cars in the street have had their tires let down. Scroll down for video . Hell-raiser: Mitchell Igelko allegedly stalked his neighbors and made their lives a nightmare in Kendall, Florida . Terror: Neighbors in the Florida community have installed high-tech CCTV to try to catch their neighbor in the act . Police in Kendall, Florida, arrested Igelko on stalking and criminal mischief charges after studying the CCTV footage. Dr Bob DerHagopian said the harassment began after he hired a rival landscaping company to carry out work on his home. They noticed their property was being vandalised and spoke with other neighbours who said they had experienced similar problems. Suspecting Igelko was behind the attacks, they set up CCTV cameras capable of filming at night. 'He tries to intimidate you to either respect him and if you don't respect him,' said Dr DerHagopian, 'he'll do damage to you'. Crime wave: The spate of attacks, which have been captured on CCTV, include car windows being smashed, nails thrown in the grass and a boat being blown up . Hounded: Several of the residents have filmed Igelko following them in their cars and screaming abuse . 'I don't think any neighborhood should have to live with this type of fear and anxiety.' The CCTV cameras captured him spraying what is believed to be a toxic chemical on their lawns. 'He is in his work truck, driving with the window cracked two to three inches,'recalled Francisco Torres. 'I see a red nozzle. I see a lot of jet stream of toxic liquid getting into my grass. I double check with my camera and I got the proof right there.' In an earlier incident he was filmed tossing bags of nails onto lawns, and launching them from his truck onto the grass and driveways. Neighbours suspect he was behind the vandalism of several cars and a boat being set on fire. Several cars in the quiet cul-de-sac had flammable liquid poured over them. 'His house was the only one untouched,' remembered Kelly DerHagopian. 'It makes us curious.' Igelko's lawyer said he has not had a chance to see the CCTV film.","Mitchell Igelko arrested for stalking and criminal mischief in Florida .

Voyeur: Lee Price, 36, was jailed after using a secret camera pen to spy on female employees as they used the toilet . A factory boss has been jailed after using a hidden camera 'spy' pen to film female employees as they used the toilet. Lee Price, 36, bought the device to secretly watch his young staff as they used the lavatory at the Odeon Furniture Factory in Tredegar, Gwent - where he was production manager. He tucked the pen, which was bought over the internet, at the back of a pipe in the toilet at the plant. A court heard how Price set up the hidden camera half a dozen times over the space of three months. But it was finally found after a woman employee spotted a light flashing on the pen after she had used the toilet. She realised there was a pinhole camera in the top of the pen - and twisted it open to find a memory stick inside. She took it to a local computer store where they discovered the USB stick contained 14 minutes of movie footage. Notices were put up appealing for information at the Odeon Furniture Factory in Tredegar, Gwent. Price handed himself in - admitting he had rigged up the secret spy pen bought for less than £30 on the internet. Prosecutor Lisa James said: 'At . first, Price said it was to try and catch a cleaner who he suspected of . hiding there to avoid her duties. 'But he changed his story, saying he . was trying to spy on a woman and record her texting or phoning a man he . suspected she was having an affair with.' Price, of Blaina, Gwent, was jailed for six months at Caerphilly magistrates after being found guilty of voyeurism. Michael . Hall, defending, said: 'He is deeply embarrassed and ashamed about . this. He accepts that he has caused deep humiliation and anger for all . those concerned. 'This has been deeply disturbing for his family but they are standing by him knowing what he has done.' He later resigned from the factory where he worked for 16 years. Secret: Price positioned a camera 'spy' pen (similar to this one) behind a pipe in the toilet (file picture) District Judge Richard Williams told him: 'You were trying to gratify your perverted sexual lust. 'The effect on the women you filmed is considerable. The word 'horror' was used by one when she found out. 'In some ways this is more instructive than a sexual act - going to the toilet is something people expect to do in private. These were graphic moving images. 'Your evidence was a pack of lies. Because of your perverted wish to gain sexual gratification, you invaded women’s privacy.' Pervert: Christopher Hardie arriving at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court . A council worker who spied on female colleagues by installing a hidden camera to peer up their skirts has been jailed for 16 months. Christopher Hardie, 51, set up recording equipment under his desk at Stoke-on-Trent Council's environmental services department where he worked so that he could secretly film his workmates. Hardie was found out when one shocked co-worker found the device. After his arrest earlier this year it was later discovered that 'obsessed' Hardie had been filming female colleagues for his own sexual gratification for at least five months. He was jailed for 16-months on Thursday after admitting eight counts of voyeurism - which also included installing cameras at a house between 2008 and 2012. He must also sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years. The court heard Hardie threw the . camera in a canal after being uncovered by colleagues while other . equipment was found in skips at the site. Memory cards, USB sticks and three camcorders were also found at his home. The court heard Hardie, from Stafford, had been kicked out of his family home since the allegations came to light. Jailing Hardie, Judge Granville Styler said: 'I understand the devastating effect this has had on you. You have lost your job and family. 'But these are serious matters which give the public and victims great discomfort. 'It was a series of offences which took considerable planning. You have an obsession that gives you sexual gratification.' Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court had heard that Hardie’s actions had impacted on council staff - leaving them feeling humiliated.

New pictures of the surface of Titan taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft show what looks like a giant hot cross bun rising out of the mysterious moon's crust. Steam from baking often causes the top of bread to lift and crack. Scientists think some similar process involving heat may be at play on Saturn's largest moon. Hot cross bun: Scientists observing data from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft discovered this image of bread-like cracks in the surface of Titan, which is the larges moon orbiting Saturn . Deja vu: Scientists have seen similar terrain on Venus, where a dome-shaped region about 20 miles (30 km) across has been seen at the summit of a large volcano called Kunapipi Mons . Similar terrain has been pictured before . on Venus, where a dome-shaped region about 20 miles (30km) across has . been seen at the summit of a large volcano called Kunapipi Mons. Researchers believe the Titan cross, which is about 40 miles (70km) long, is also the result of fractures caused by uplift from below, possibly the result of rising magma. 'The 'hot cross bun' is a type of feature we have not seen before on Titan, showing that Titan keeps surprising us even after eight years of observations from Cassini,' said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. 'The 'bun' may be the result of what is known on Earth as a laccolith, an intrusion formed by magma pushing up from below. The Henry Mountains of Utah are well-known examples of this geologic phenomenon.' The image showing the bun-like mound was obtained on May 22, 2012, by Cassini’s radar instrument. Another group of Cassini scientists, led by Ellen Stofan, who is based at Proxemy Research, Rectortown, Virginia, has been scrutinising radar images of Titan’s southern hemisphere where they found the shorelines of ancient seas. Titan is the only place other than Earth known to have stable liquid on its surface, though the liquids on Titan are hydrocarbon rather than water. So far, vast seas have only been seen in Titan’s northern hemisphere. But now, a new analysis of Cassini images collected from 2008 to 2011 suggests there were once vast, shallow seas at Titan’s south pole as well. This image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows an ancient southern sea that used to sprawl out near the south pole of Saturn's moon Titan. The red outline traces the ancient shoreline. Within this basin is the largest present-day lake in Titan's southern hemisphere, Ontario Lacus . Titan, pictured above in an image taken by the Cassini spacecraft, is one of the most Earth-like bodies in the Solar System. With a thick atmosphere, a diameter between that of Earth and the planet Mercury, and a network of seas, lakes and rivers, it is in many respects more like a planet than a moon like the Earth’s. With surface temperatures at a chilly -290F, researchers believe Titan's environment is too cold for life as we know it, but its environment, rich in the building blocks of life, is of great interest to astrobiologists. The satellite's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen (like Earth’s), and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide, which may have played a role in the emergence of life on Earth. The liquid on its surface is not water, but super-cooled methane and ethane. Last month scientists revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to Titan, which is Saturn's largest moon . Dr Stofan and her colleagues have . found two good candidates for dry or mostly dry seas. One of these dry . seas appears to be about 300 by 170 miles (475 by 280km) across, and . perhaps a few hundred feet deep. Ontario . Lacus, the largest current lake in the south, sits inside of the dry . shorelines, like a shrunken version of a once-mighty sea. Scientists led by Oded Aharonson, another radar team member based at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, think Titan is subject to cycles analogous to Earth’s Croll-Milankovich cycles, which explain climate changes in terms of the way our planet orbits around the Sun. Such cycles on Titan would cause long-term transfer of liquid hydrocarbons from pole to pole. By this model, the south pole could have been covered with extensive seas less than 50,000 years ago. 'The seas on Titan are temporary hosts for experiments in prebiotic chemistry, and we know they are cycling from one hemisphere to the other over 100,000 years,' said Dr Stofan. 'I’d love to get a closer look at the seas of the north or these dry seabeds to examine the extent to which this prebiotic chemistry has developed.' The Cassini team has confirmed some of the stability of Titan’s northern seas by looking at radar images from Cassini taken about one Titan season (in this case, six Earth years) apart. The newer images, from May 22, 2012, on the same flyby as the hot cross bun images, show the shorelines stayed about the same, indicating the northern lakes are not transient weather events, in contrast to the temporary darkening of parts of the equator after a rainstorm in 2010.","Scientists believe cracks on Titan's surface are caused by a similar process to that which makes bread lift and crack .

A band of well-spoken protestors, known as The Intruders, are planning to disrupt black tie events across the City after gate-crashing a private dinner to present an award to outgoing HMRC boss Dave Hartnett for his services to corporate tax avoidance. In a move which could become a new direct action anti-corporate campaign, eight protesters, including two former oxford students, sneaked inside a lavish dinner at a corporate tax planning conference, where Mr Hartnett was giving a speech. Dressed in black tie and carrying a trophy – the Golden Handshake –  posed as representatives of Vodafone, Goldman Sachs and other firms said to have reduced their tax bill after striking deals with Mr Hartnett’s team. The protest group The Intruders presented an award for a lifetime's service to corporate tax planning - otherwise known as the Golden Handshake . Former HMRC boss Dave Hartnett was the targat of the stunt, which was filmed and has just been released on YouTube . The other guests at the dinner were delighted, giving the news a round of applause. But it slowly dawned on Mr Hartnett that the prize was a stunt – and one of the hosts told them to leave or have dogs set on them. The video, posted on YouTube, caused a sensation on Twitter and threatened to embarrass HMRC for its approach to big business. Mr Harnett, who retired in July, was speaking at a dinner at New College Oxford on Thursday when the WeAreTheIntruders protest group stepped in with the trophy, flowers and gushing tributes to his help in cutting tax bills. HMRC was last year forced to defend . claims it had waived interest on major tax bills, although a National . Audit Office report cleared it. The . video reveals that Mr Harnett was due to appear at the gala dinner of . one of the UK’s most notable tax avoidance conferences ‘where the rich . swap tips on how to pay even less tax’. Mr Hartnett initially looks bemused as . the protestors thank him for helping reduce tax liabilities, but when . the penny drops he has a word in the ear of one of the other guests. The group is then told to leave, with one man declaring: ‘You will depart immediately before we set the dogs on you.’ Smile: Unwitting guests at the black tie dinner at first applaud the award . The penny drops: Dave Hartnett tells a fellow diner that the 'award' is a stunt . As the embarrassment continues, the group launches into a rendition of 'He's a lolly good fellow... and so say Goldman Sachs' Dog's house: The group is told to leave or have hounds set on them . The group then launch into a rousing rendition of: ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow… and so say Goldman Sachs.’ As the protestors are ushered out of the door, a man shouts: ‘You are trespassing scum. Go!’ The group are soon dragged from the room by a tax barrister who shouts: ¿You are trespassing scum. Go!¿ . Yesterday, The Intruders were revealed to be a group of eight friends including two former Oxford students, an Oxford Green Party councillor and a columnist for The Guardian newspaper. Members of the group have previously been involved in the UK Uncut and Occupy protest movements. The leader of the group, Stephen Reid, 26, works for the think-tank New Economics Foundation, and is a former student at Wadham College, Oxford. He said the protesters were 'outraged to discover that Mr Hartnett, who was responsible for collecting tax from these corporations, could be found sharing port and cheese with their executives.' Mr Hartnett was speaking at the Practical Tax Planning conference, hosted by a firm called Tax Chambers. The conference, which cost £854 to attend, promised 'to examine in the congenial atmosphere of an historic Oxford College, practical solutions to the ever changing fiscal complications to modern life.' Protesters were able to walk straight into the Great Hall of the college, where the black tie dinner reception was being held. Mr Reid told The Guardian: 'The video we shot shows Hartnett looking as if he wants the ground to swallow him up. 'We were soon dragged from the room by a tax barrister who called us ""trespassing scum"" and ""intruders"".' Watch the video . Mr Reid also told The Independent newspaper ' Another thing we've talked about is dinners in the City. There's an active and lucrative entertainment industry in the City, whisking bankers away to play polo and shoot pheasants. It will be interesting to see if we could find our way into one of those events.' A spokesman for HMRC said they could not comment as Mr Harnett left in July.","Campaigners gatecrash black tie dinner to present Dave Hartnett with trophy and flowers in online video hit .

Furious: Gordon Ramsay said he was 'astounded' to find prisoners enjoyed perks such as a gym, TV, DVDs and games consoles . Fiery television chef Gordon Ramsay has launched a scathing attack on Britain's jails, claiming criminals have it easy behind bars. The outspoken Scot said he was 'astounded' to find prisoners enjoyed perks such as a gym, DVDs, games consoles and access to TV around the clock. He was speaking after trying to teach inmates at London's Brixton prison to cook in a new TV show, due to be screened later this month. Ramsay said he was disappointed by the prisoners' lack of enthusiasm and reluctance to work hard. 'What I wasn't prepared for was how easy it was for them in there,' he told Guardian Weekend. 'I was astounded at the comfort zone they carve out for themselves. 'Five meal choices a night - that was the one I really struggled with. I just thought it was a bit of a joke, to be honest. 'Coupled with 24-hour television, Xbox, DVDs, gym. We can't watch television until four o'clock in the morning. I'd like to have a gym seven days a week, by the way.' The chef added: 'I thought we were a nation of grafters...Why would they want to come and bust their a**e for 10 hours a day when it was easy for them to do nothing?' In the series, Gordon Ramsay Behind Bars, the chef sets up a kitchen - Bad Boys' Bakery - and trains inmates to cook and sell produce to businesses on the outside. He said he was surprised by the high standard of the facilities, pointing out that professional chefs rarely walked into a kitchen so good. But he felt angry and embarrassed about the prisoners' attitude, and he revealed how he became frustrated with the prison system. Unimpressed: Ramsay launched a scathing attack after trying to teach prisoners how to cook and sell produce . Cosy? Ramsay felt angry and embarrassed about the attitude of inmates at Brixton Prison, pictured . 'Everything was going against me,' he said. 'The system was completely screwed.' Ramsay's comments come less than a week after it was revealed that a feud with his father-in-law had cost him at least £6million. The celebrity chef was plunged into a legal battle after he accused Chris Hutcheson – who was also his business partner - of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire. Hutcheson, whose daughter Tana is married to Ramsay, denied the claims and sued the chef for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. The row was resolved only when the Michelin-starred chef paid a reported £2 million to buy his business partner out of the 30 per cent share he owned of Gordon Ramsay Holdings in February. A spokesman for Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said: 'We are building more working prisons in order to get more prisoners into constructive work and training, instead of enforced idleness in their cells, watching TV or playing computer games. 'A prisoner who works during his or her sentence will be paying back to society for the harm they have caused and be much less likely to return to crime on release. It's common sense.'

David Cameron today prepared to hand over powers which will give 16-year-olds the vote in the Scottish independence referendum. However, despite the concession to the Nationalists, he vowed to fight to preserve the United Kingdom ‘with everything we’ve got’. At a meeting on Monday the Prime Minister will agree to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s demands that 16 and 17-year-old Scots should be given a vote on independence. Future: David Cameron (left) will meet Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (right) in . Edinburgh on Monday to finalise arrangements for the historic referendum . on Scottish independence . This will be viewed as a victory for the Scottish National Party, which says a higher proportion of younger voters back its aims. However, this claim was thrown into doubt by a poll for the Mail on Sunday which showed that only 26 per cent of youngsters supported independence, with 59 per cent opposed. The Nationalists have lost the fight to have a second, fall-back question which would give them more powers even if they fail to get support for independence. Instead, Scottish voters will face a simple question asking whether they want their country to become independent. In his speech to the Tory conference, Mr Cameron asked: ‘What could matter more than saving our United Kingdom?’ Mr Cameron told activists in Birmingham that the Olympics had highlighted the depth of feeling for the United Kingdom. ‘Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. ‘Now, there’s one person who didn’t . like that and he’s called Alex Salmond. I’m going to see him on Monday . to sort out that referendum on independence by the end of 2014.’ Decision: Under-18s are close to securing a vote in the historic referendum on the United Kingdom's constitution in 2014 . He added: ‘Let’s say it: we’re better together and we’ll rise together – and let us fight that referendum with everything we’ve got.’ As part of the deal with the Nationalists, the Scottish Parliament will hold the power over how the referendum is run and who gets a say in it. A Downing Street source said: ‘It is . usually for the administration which is running the vote to decide on . the franchise. We cannot stop them from extending voting rights but the . Scottish government will have to explain how it will ensure all 16 and . 17-year-olds get on the electoral roll in time. ‘This is definitely not setting a . precedent for general or other elections, this is very specific to the . independence referendum.’ Polls have shown that most young . people oppose the break-up of Britain. Government sources said this was . because they were ‘more internationalist’. 'Personal issue': Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is Scottish, said lots of UK ministers will be taking part in the campaign . Mr Salmond said: ‘I’m certainly . hoping and optimistic that a deal can be done next week. There are a . number of issues that are still to be resolved.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove, who . is Scottish, said: ‘There will be lots of UK ministers taking part in . the campaign. For myself, because my family live in Scotland, I don’t . want to be in a situation where I’m part of a government that sees that . my mum and dad become foreigners. For me, it’s an emotional and personal . issue.’ The elderly could have to wait years . before the introduction of a system to prevent them having to sell their . homes to pay for care, Jeremy Hunt admitted. Currently at least 20,000 pensioners . are forced to sell their home every year – denying their children an . inheritance. Older people were promised two years ago that a new system . would be in place by 2015. However, the Health Secretary’s . comments appear to contradict Mr Cameron’s pledge in the summer to find . the money to cap the lifetime costs of long-term care for the elderly at . £35,000. At a fringe event at the Tory . conference, Mr Hunt said, although he wanted to impose a cap, it may . have to be set at a higher level to make it more affordable. Money could . also be saved by restricting pensioners’ eligibility for assistance, he . said. Last year, economist Andrew Dilnot . recommended a cap on total lifetime costs, with the Government stepping . in to pay the rest. The economist put the cost of this at £1.7billion a . year. The Health Secretary said: ‘It may be . that the right solution takes us a period of years to get to. This is . something that is potentially very expensive.’","Under-18s are close to securing a vote in the historic referendum on the United Kingdom’s constitution in 2014 .

An Italian priest who was found carrying a gun during a security check on a ferry told police he had been given it 'during a confession' and could reveal no details. The 33-year-old priest, who has not been named by officers, said he could not 'betray the confessional box' but eventually added he had been asked to 'get rid' of the gun. Security guards called police after the .9 calibre handgun showed up during an x-ray check on the holy man's luggage - nestled between a Bible and set of rosary beads. It was discovered as the priest, dressed in black robes and wearing a dog collar, boarded a ferry at Civitavecchia, north of Rome, which was bound for Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. He was taken to a cell at Civitavecchia jail, where the Salesian order priest insisted for several hours that Catholic doctrine banned him from revealing details as the gun had been given to him during a confession. Eventually he told police that it had been handed to him by a '70 year old parishoner' who had asked him to get rid of it and he had planned to throw it into the sea mid voyage. Police chief Antonio Del Greco said: 'For the time being the priest will have to stay in custody. He is being held on suspicion of illegal possession of a firearm. 'The weapon was found in his luggage during a security check before he boarded a ferry heading to Sardinia - which left without him. 'He has told us the briefest of details about how he got the gun during a confession and what he was supposed to do with it but he refuses to say anymore because he cannot betray what he was told. Weapon: Priest had .9 calibre handgun in his luggage (library image) 'All he has told us is that it was given to him by a 70 year old parishioner during confession who asked him to get rid of it. 'When he was asked why he hasn't called police the priest said he could not reveal details of what he had heard during the confession.' Mr Del Greco said that ballistic checks would be carried out on the gun to see if it matched any recorded crime and when it was last fired. He added:'We need to know the history of the gun and why the priest had it in his luggage. Until we get some answers he will remain in custody.' Vatican officials have been informed and the priest is due before a judge on Monday for a preliminary hearing. Under the Catholic Church's Canon Law, 'it is a crime for a confessor in any way to betray a penitent by word or in any other manner or for any reason'. A priest, therefore, cannot break that code to save his own life, to protect his good name, to refute a false accusation, to save the life of another, to aid the course of justice, or to avert a public calamity. He cannot be compelled by law to disclose a person's confession or be bound by any oath he takes and if he does he could be defrocked and excommunicated. Earlier this year, a man from Ohio was arrested by police after he ran into a New York church and told a priest he had killed his girlfriend and the authorities were immediately alerted. A priest at the church later explained that if the man had decided to make a full confession in a booth then they could have done nothing but as he had simply rushed in and grabbed a priest it did not count.

The firm, which is Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket chain, has its headquarters in Bradford. Trend: Morrisons CEO Dalton Philips said consumer confidence has fallen dramatically over the past few months . It claims to offer cheaper prices because it owns farms and produces fresh fruit and veg itself, and has traditionally been a big presence closer to its northern roots. Currently Morrisons has only 31 shops within the M25 but it said that 60 per cent of all its new stores will be in the south. It has outlets under development at Weybridge and Croydon in Surrey, and Harrow and Colindale in North London. Chief executive Dalton Philips said consumer confidence dramatically fell over the past few months. ‘We are seeing shoppers skipping meals so they can save cash to feed their children,’ he said. ‘They are hiding treats around the house to ration them through the week, dipping into savings and recycling their clothes. ‘Year on year consumer confidence is worse and disposable income is down – it’s tough out there.’ The business, which claims to offer cheaper prices because it owns farms and produces fresh produce itself, has traditionally been a big player closer to its northern roots. But it now feels the time is right to make its move on the more prosperous south as it fine tunes a new store format it thinks will appeal to a broader cross-section of shoppers. Currently only 15pc of its new stores are in the south and by 2013/14 that will increase to two thirds of the retailer’s 2.5m sq. ft. network of new space. On the menu: The supermarket plans to introduce trendy items like samphire and purple potatoes . It now has stores under development at Weybridge and Croydon in Surrey and Harrow and Colindale in north London. Philips added: ‘The next three years will see a step-change in Morrisons southern presence bringing another 2m households within a 15 minute drive of our stores. ‘We are going to be food-focused, not generalists. We believe that UK grocery has got very functional. ‘Our new format allows us to see how we perform with different demographics, you always carry on tweaking the format but we have an offer that really travels down south.’",Northern-based supermarket to expand in the prosperous Home Counties .

The polo-playing millionaire who killed a 23-year-old in a drunken hit-and-run has been jailed after trying to take off his ankle monitor while on house arrest. John Goodman, 48, was sentenced to 16 years in prison but has been allowed to remain at his luxury Florida mansion while his case is appealed, after he posted a $7million bond. He reportedly tried to break device off his ankle with a hand mirror but a police officer, who is at Goodman's house around the clock, was alerted in 35 seconds. Jailed: John Goodman who was convicted of killing a man in a DUI hit- and-run, was arrested after trying to smash off his ankle monitor (right) while on home arrest in Florida . Home . sweet home: Goodman was on house arrest at his mansion in Wellington, Florida but has been sent to jail after tampering with his ankle monitor . Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told Gossipextra.com: 'There’s no doubt he tried to open it... These devices are rugged and sophisticated. He did not accidentally bump it up.' Goodman was arrested coming out of the bathroom at his home in Wellington. He was sent to Palm Beach County . jail late shortly before midnight on Wednesday where is being held pending a hearing. No charges have been filed. Scott Wilson, 23, drowned when Goodman rammed his Bentley into the student's car and sent it into a canal in February 2010. Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' The killer became notorious when he . tried to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend in an apparent attempt to . protect his fortune from his victim's family in the event of a possible . civil suit over Mr Wilson's death. Breaking free: Police were alerted 35 seconds after Goodman tried to disable his ankle monitor with a hand mirror (right) In April, he reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46million in compensation to them. Victim: Student Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash . Goodman faced up to 30 years in prison after being found guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. Prosecutors sought a sentence of 20 . years. The judge ruled that the culprit should be . imprisoned for 16 years during a hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida. According to the Sun-Sentinel, the . judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice . standpoint. 'Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of . fullness of life.' He added that the tragic case should serve as a warning to others as he said: 'Find a cab, find a friend. Don't drink and drive. 'This was a senseless, senseless accident because Mr Goodman chose to drive when he was too drunk.' According to Mr Colbath, the severity . of the sentence reflected the fact that Goodman knew what he was doing . when the fled the scene of the accident without calling 911. 'To avoid the liability, the criminal . responsibility, that he knew was going to visit him from the time of . the crash, he wilfully left the scene of the crash,' the judge said. 'It was because he wanted to figure out a way to save himself.' Mr Wilson's mother Lili addressed the court, giving emotional testimony about her son. 'Sunday is going to be Mother's Day and Scott will not be coming home,' she said. 'By dying at such a young age, he . will never get the opportunity to work as a professional after . graduating from engineering school. He will never have the opportunity to marry and have a family of his own.' Goodman also took the stand, saying: . 'I just wanted to say that from the day after the accident, all I've . wanted to do is reach out to the Wilsons and be with them and cry with . them. 'And I can't imagine or even pretend to imagine what it would be like to lose a son.' Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Earlier the judge dismissed a final . plea from the defense to overturn the sentence on the basis of an . admission by one of the jurors that he had deliberately got drunk to . test the effects of drinking as much as Goodman had on the night of the . crash. Mr Colbath agreed that the juror's . actions did constitute misconduct, but ruled that they had not . influenced the other jurors or affected the eventual verdict. The case gained national attention after Goodman, . the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, . adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins . last October, entitling her to up to a third of his biological . children's trust fund, worth $300million. At the time the Wilsons' lawyers slammed the move as an attempt by Goodman to shield his assets. Grieving: Lili Wilson, the victim's mother, wept when Goodman's 911 call was played in court . Bill: The court was shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, bought for himself and others before the crash . Prosecutors successfully claimed that . Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Mr Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. At trial Goodman said he was sure of . one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the . crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to . alleviate his pain.

The move means she is entitled to up to a third of his biological children's $300 million trust fund . Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . After leaving a bar, he said his car . suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my . brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used . to,' he said. Unable to control the vehicle, it . slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not . aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported. 'I ... drank it to alleviate, . thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the . reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving . level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash.

A mob of vengeful England supporters last night attacked Italy fans celebrating their win in Britain's most Italian town. Up to 150 thugs - angered by Roy Hodgson's side's exit - confronted jubilant 'Azzuri' fans in Bedford, where one in five residents is Italian - the highest proportion anywhere in the country. Women and children fled in fear as the yobs began began smashing up cars and restaurants as England yet again . crashed out of the European championships on penalties. Scroll down for video . Mob: Embittered England fans protest in Bedford's High Street, where police were forced to block them in . During the confrontation, one man was assaulted. Four people were arrested amid the violence, one for assault and three for criminal damage. The showdown took place after a cavalcade of celebrating Italians, many of whom are children of immigrants recruited to brick factories in the 1950s, excitedly drove their cars through the town. As more than 1,200 England supporters spilled out of pubs around the town centre following the defeat shortly after 10.30pm, most headed home. But hundreds of the angry fans chose to protest in the High Street, which police cordoned off and swelled with officers to prevent thugs heading to Russel Park, where Italy fans were celebrating. Trouble: Fans began protesting after pouring out of the pubs following last night's defeat to Italy on penalties . Support: Italy fans watch the game at a community centre in the town where a fifth of residents are Italian . Unfortunately, around 150 yobs broke . off and headed for The Embankment, an area nicknamed Little Italy . because of its association with immigrants from the country. Bedford’s Italian community dates back to the post-war period when a building boom created a shortage of labour in the Bedford brickworks industry. With too few British workers to produce the materials needed, employers began encouraging workers from the impoverished villages in southern Italy to emigrate. One firm, the Marston Valley Brick Company, established a recruitment office in Naples in 1951 and by the 1960s more than 7,500 Italians had arrived in the town. Among them was Felice Facchiano, pictured above loading bricks from the kiln onto a lorry in 1955. As most of  the immigrants were single men, their wives and children began joining them - and today the community numbers 20,000. The town of 100,000 people has the third highest Italian population in Britain, behind London and Glasgow. It has the highest proportion of immigrants from the southern European nation. And up to 30 per cent of the town’s people are thought to have at least some Italian descent.The Midland Road area, which led to the railway station, nicknamed Via Roma and the Embankment, which has many Italian restaurants and shops, is known as Little Italy. The area by the River Great Ouse features Italian . bars, restaurants and social clubs, as well as delis and grocery shops. The violence began in The Embankment . when England fans spotted an Italian cavalcade. One Audi had its windows . smashed and a moped was knocked over, another car was also damaged. Superintendent Mark Turner, who was . responsible for the policing operation last night, said: 'Sadly a well . behaved build-up to the game was marred by approximately 15 minutes of . sporadic disorder in Bedford High Street and the Embankment after the . penalty shoot out. 'A crowd spilt onto the High Street, which was closed in the interests of public safety. 'Unfortunately a group of . approximately 150 people broke away and ran towards the Embankment . straight into grid-locked traffic as many Italian fans had formed a . cavalcade of vehicles to celebrate and it was at this point some . vehicles were attacked by the crowd.' He added: 'It is always a shame when . the majority of well behaved supporters are let down by the actions of a . mindless minority and while order was quickly restored this was . undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant situation for people trying to leave . the area sensibly and particularly for those stuck in their cars.' The first wave of migrants came from impoverished southern Italy moved to the town in the 1950s for . jobs in a local brick works to help rebuild the area after the Second World War. Around 20,000 Italians now live in . Bedford,which has a population of around 100,000. This means the town . has the biggest Italian population by proportions. In numbers, Bedford is behind London . and Glasgow, which each have 39,000 and 35,000 Italian-born residents, . according to the latest census data. The community in Bedford have celebrated football victories for years by . driving through the town centre waving flags and blaring their horns. Police, anticipating problems between, had arranged to put more officers on duty for yesterday's clash. Before the match, Twitter user @KillHollywood tweeted on June 19: 'Bedford is like 40% Italian Mafia, so England vs Italy should be interesting here.'

A new ‘legal high’ is hitting Britain’s streets every week, drug experts warned last night - as they called for the ban of another danger drug. The Government’s drug advisory body urged ministers to outlaw a substance sold as ‘Annihiliation’ which is available legally on Britain’s streets. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is set to issue advice for ministers that use of the drug be made unlawful. Dangerous: Designed to mimic the effects of cannabis, 'Annihiliation' can lead to paranoia, aggression and an increased heart rate (file picture) Currently it is marketed as a ‘herbal incense’ and sold widely in high street ‘head shops’ and online. Ministers are thought likely to accept the recommendation and order a ban within weeks. Police in Glasgow have warned that the drug has left nine people in hospital in the last three months. And last month a 15-year old boy was hospitalised after taking the drug, which he had bought from a high-street shop. The drug is also known as Mary Joy Pink, K2, Warning and Review. It sells for 1g for £10 and 3g for £20 and is widely available online. Designed to mimic the effects of cannabis, it can lead to paranoia, aggression and an increased heart rate. Users have also been found to self-harm after taking the drug, suffer numbness in their legs and been left unconscious. ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen told a meeting in central London: ‘Annihilation is a relatively new substance and product and the evidence for its prevalence and harms is still very preliminary. Issue: Police in Glasgow have warned that the drug has left nine people in hospital in the last three months . ‘However, there have been reports, particularly from Glasgow, of young people reacting very unfavourably to this product, becoming severely agitated and over-stimulated.’ Prof Iversen described Annihilation as ‘particularly potent’ and said its arrival showed just how fast-moving the legal high market had become in recent years. 'He was in a very bad way in hospital. He was hallucinating, was having heart palpitations, and he thought his skin was on fire' Mother of 15-year-old Lancashire boy who took one hit of 'Annihilation' A 15-year-old from Darwen in Lancashire had to be hospitalised last month after he collapsed after taking just one hit of the drug, which he bought from a high street head shop in Blackburn. The drug is labelled as a ‘herbal incense’ but packaging features featuring an image of an atom bomb explosion on the packet, is smoked like cannabis. His mother, who was not named, said: ‘He was in a very bad way in hospital. He was hallucinating, was having heart palpitations, and he thought his skin was on fire.’ She said: ‘I got a call from the police saying I had to come to the hospital. He was vacant and dizzy and looked frightened to death.’ Medical student: Hester Stewart died in 2009 after taking a legal high called GBL, and her mother Maryon said: 'There were 49 new substances last year and there are even more this year' Maryon Stewart, whose medical student daughter Hester died after taking a legal high called GBL, said: ‘There were 49 new substances last year and there are even more this year. ‘Kids are putting themselves in danger without even realising it. 'There were 49 new substances last year and there are even more this year. Kids are putting themselves in danger without even realising it' Maryon Stewart, whose daughter Hester died after taking legal high GBL in 2009 . Mrs Stewart, whose Angelus Foundation will next week launch a nationwide campaign warning of the dangers of legal highs, added: ‘They are called legal highs which implies they are safe but that’s really not right.’ The ACMD also warned of the growing trend for inhaling nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas - and helium. Breathing in both gases was ‘potentially lethal’ Prof Iversen said. Deaths from helium inhalation have risen from just two in 2007 to 42 last year. Prof Iversen said: ‘It is quite easy to open a canister and fill a balloon - for example, at Glastonbury music festival a couple of years ago there were lots of yellow balloons containing nitrous oxide which were being sold and inhaled from the balloons.'","Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs set to issue advice to ministers .

The 26-year-old mother of one also alleged that he made her massage him while he was wearing only boxer shorts and asked if she had ever treated anyone naked. Victory: Samantha Allen was awarded £25,000 after she won her case of sexual discrimination against former boss Christopher Borral . And she claimed that on her first day at the home care firm run by the  married 42-year-old, Barral asked her whether she thought brothels reduced the number of rapes. Only 19 days after she was taken on, he fired Miss Allen for not meeting his ‘expectations’, a tribunal was told. Although she was awarded £24,655 after winning a claim of sexual discrimination and harassment against him, Miss Allen may never see the money because Barral has since shut the firm down. He failed to attend  the damages hearing, instead providing a one-line statement denying discriminating against her. Yesterday Miss Allen branded Barral ‘devious and sleazy’ and told how her time at the firm had left her feeling violated. She also said she can no longer face taking on male clients. ‘He fired me because he realised I would not give in and he could not get what he wanted from me,’ she said. ‘He wanted something more. I believe he wanted sex from me. He is horrible, manipulative, smarmy, devious and sleazy.’ Miss Allen, from Crewe, was hired by Abacus Care (Cheshire), in September last year to provide home visits to vulnerable adults. She told Manchester Employment Tribunal that on her first day Barral  told her he thought brothels were good for the economy and reduced the number of rapes.  Judge David Franey concluded: ‘[Barral] would not have behaved in the same way with a male employee.’ Barral, of High Legh, Cheshire, said in a statement: ‘At no point did I sexually discriminate against the employee Samantha Allen while employed by Abacus Care (Cheshire) Ltd.’ The firm was a franchise of Abacus Care which last night said it had ended its commercial relationship with Mr Barral 'some time ago' following 'breaches of operating agreements'. 'Abacus Care has absolutely no involvement with the case,' Managing Director Nigel Fielding said.","Samantha Allen claims Christopher Barral looked down her top while she cleaned a fish tank .

A 65-year-old American woman who lost her home in the credit crunch is leading a class-action suit against 12 of the world's major banks for their part in the financial crisis. Annie Bell Adams claims banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds, manipulated the Libor rates to make mortgage repayments more expensive than they should have been. The suit alleges the Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates, 'unjustly enriching' the bankers at the cost of mortgage-holders losing their homes. Wide-reaching: The class-action suit takes in 12 banks, including some of the biggest names in Wall Street, as well as banks based in Britain . London's financial district: Banks from across the world, including Barclays and HSBC, have been named in the suit, which was filed in New York . The class action lawsuit, originating in Alabama, alleges the rate-fixing meant homeowners paid thousands more than necessary between 2000 and 2009 - with the knock-on effect causing many families to lose their homes. The group of 12 banks also includes UBS, Citigroup, The Bank of America, . Rabobank International Holdings BV, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC . Holdings, Lloyds Banking Group, Deutsche Bank AG and the Royal Bank of . Canada. Libor, or the 'London interbank offered . rate', is seen as the benchmark for more than $300trillion of loans and securities, and is re-calculated on a daily basis, based on groups of lenders estimating their borrowing rates. But the suit alleges this rate was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates. This allowed them to increase the payments by homeowners on adjustable rate loans, boosting profit, according to the lawsuit. What is Libor? It is the London Inter-Bank Offered . Rate - the rate at which international banks lend to each other. It is . calculated every business day in 10 currencies and 15 timespans, ranging . from overnight to one year and is based on the level at which banks . have been lending to each other. When is it set? It is set and announced at around . 11am to midday for the UK rate, based on borrowing from the previous . day. Operating since the mid-1980s, in the years before the credit . crunch it sat marginally higher than the central bank rate. Why is it important? The sterling three-month LIBOR rate . influences the level at which lenders set some rates on loans, . especially mortgages, to consumers and to businesses. It also impacts on . the amount they will lend. It is the rate at which banks lend . to each other and is therefore a measure of how much they trust each . other and a measure of the credit crunch. There tends to be a lag from . when LIBOR changes to when bank lending rates are altered. Also, some new mortgage deals have . been linked to LIBOR rather than bank rate or a lender's SVR. That's . because it is more closely linked to a lenders' costs. What would LIBOR be in 'normal' conditions? The three-month LIBOR rate should be . just 10 or 20 basis points higher than the bank rate if conditions went . back to how they were in the first half of this decade. So under pre-credit crunch conditions, if the bank rate or base rate is 2%, LIBOR should be 2.1% or 2.2% . But it soared far higher in August . 2007, marking the start of the credit crunch. It recovered over the . summer of 2008 (see the figures above) as some trust returned but then . spiked on the collapse of Lehman Brothers (15/16 Sept 2008). Barclays Plc, Britain’s . second-biggest lender by assets, is the only bank to have settled with . regulators over the rigging of Libor. It . is the first class-action lawsuit filed by home owners, according to . the Financial Times, which said other class-action suits have been . brought by investors and municipalities. Annie Bell Adams's sub-prime mortgage was securitised into . Libor-based collateralised debt obligations and sold on by banks to . investors. The plaintiffs, . who have lost thousands of dollars each, could number 100,000, their . Alabama-based attorney John Sharbrough said. There . are at least 900,000 homes in the UK with loans linked to Libor, with . an unpaid principle balance of more than $275billion. Sharborough declined to give a figure on the total damages his clients are seeking. Under fire: Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are both named in the suit . The lawsuit claims that increasing Libor allowed banks 'to raise the interest rates paid by the plaintiffs on their adjustable-rate notes' It says that many adjustable-rate mortgages had the first day of the month as a 'change date' on which new repayment rates would reset, it adds. The FT adds that the lawsuit claims, upon statistical analysis, that Libor rose consistently on the first day of each month between 2000 and 2009. It claims that, between 2007 and 2009, Libor moved as much as 7.5 basis points for certain certain reset days. Faith in the Libor interest rate system, which underpins more than $300 trillion of contracts and loans from US mortgages to Japanese interest-rate swaps, plummeted after Barclays was fined in June for rigging it. Other banks are under investigation.","65-year-old pensioner who lost her home leads charge over 'unjust enrichment' between 2000 and 2009 .

The two British girls orphaned in the French Alps massacre were away from school without permission, it emerged today. A teacher had left a worried message on the phone of their father, Saad al-Hilli, just before he was gunned down alongside his wife and mother-in-law and a French cyclist. All four adults died in blaze of automatic gunfire close to Lake Annecy which also left Mr Al-Hilli's eldest daughter, Zainab, seven, with horrific head and shoulder injuries. Mysterious message: Investigators found a worried voicemail from a teacher on Saad al-Hilli's mobile phone, left shortly before the family were gunned down in their BMW, pictured, near Lake Annecy in the French Alps . Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, survived, apparently by hiding under her mother's corpse on the floor of the family's BMW. Now detailed analysis of a mobile . phone belonging to Mr Al-Hilli has uncovered the message from a member . of staff at the junior school that both girls attended in Claygate, . Surrey. Violent killings: The aerospace engineer, from Surrey, was murdered in a suspected assassination alongside his wife and mother-in-law . 'The girls were out of school without . permission, and the teacher was asking why they were late back,' said a . source close to the Anglo-French investigation. Mr Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife . Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, . were all found dead in the family BMW on September 5. This was a Wednesday, a day after Zainab and Zeena should have started the new autumn term. Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor, . last week revealed how the girls posed for three pictures with their . parents just 33 minutes before the atrocity was first reported. The attack also claimed the life of Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French father-of-three who was hit by at least five bullets. Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute . with his brother, Zaid, over their father's will, and had changed the . locks on the family home before they went on holiday to keep his sibling . out. The prosecutor said that there was . particular interest in a bank account in the nearby Swiss city of Geneva . in Mr Al-Hilli's name. Believed to contain around three-quarters-of-a-million pounds, it is . thought to be linked to the will the Al-Hillis were arguing about. Aerospace engineer Mr Al-Hilli also kept an illegal Taser defence weapon at home - suggesting that he lived in fear of attack. Leafy home: The girls should have been at their school in Claygate, Surrey, close to the £1m property that had caused a fierce ownership row between Mr Al-Hilli and his brother Zaid . French police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine . Detectives will now have to try and . establish whether his decision to keep the girls out of school may have . been related to such concerns.

The parents of an 8-year-old boy have sued a Chicago hospital, alleging doctors pronounced their son dead though he was still alive and refused to listen to desperate relatives who insisted he continued to move his eyes and body. The lawsuit, filed this week, accuses Mercy Hospital and Medical Center of negligence and alleges that nearly five hours passed before staff agreed to perform a cardiac ultrasound, which showed Jaylen Dorsey's heart was beating. 'You didn't have to be a doctor to see that the heart was pumping blood,' the boy's father, Pink Dorsey, said at a news conference on Friday but hospital officials deny the allegations. Wrong conclusion: Jaylen, who suffers from severe brain damage, was found unresponsive by his mother on February 18. He was taken to Mercy Hospital and doctors there pronounced the boy dead. Jaylen, who suffers from severe brain damage - is bedridden and on a ventilator, was found unresponsive by his mother, Sheena Lane, on February 18. He was taken to Mercy Hospital and doctors there pronounced the boy dead. The family says Jaylen's eyes continued to flick open, but that his parents were told the lingering effects of medicine were causing that to happen. 'We're not doctors, so we just went along with what they told us,' Dorsey said. So family members began to plan a funeral for the boy. But when other relatives arrived at the hospital, they gasped when they saw Jaylen's eyes opening, the boy's father said. Horrifed: The boy's father Pink Dorsey (left) and his mother, Sheena Lane (right) have sued Chicago's Mercy Hospital, alleging that doctors wrongfully declared their son dead . The lawsuit says the family had to demand that medical staff conduct more tests and that a cardiac ultrasound finally showed the boy's heart was beating. The hospital, which rejects the lawsuit's allegations, said in a written statement that Jaylen arrived at the hospital after suffering full cardiac arrest for 25 minutes and doctors treated him for 'an extended period of time' before declaring him dead. 'Despite extensive resuscitative efforts, Jaylen did not immediately regain a pulse and no heart activity was noted for several hours,' the hospital said. '... While this is a very rare occurrence, extensive resuscitation efforts, medication and young age can result in a patient's heart function returning spontaneously. We hope for continued strength for Jaylen.' His parents are seeking $200,000 in damages. The lawsuit says they suffered hours of 'severe emotional distress.' Lawsuit: The Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago has denied the allegations in the lawsuit . The boy's parents also worry that the hours he was off his respirator while at the hospital may have worsened his condition. The boy's mother, Jaylen, says the 8-year-old’s condition has deteriorated since the ordeal in February. 'He doesn’t wake up anymore,' she said. Lawyer for the parents said that because of the ongoing litigation they would not release details about his disability.","Doctors at Chicago's Mercy Hospital told Jaylen Dorsey's parents that the boy was dead but his eyes continued to flick .

Most people with moles know they should check them regularly for signs of skin cancer, but how many of us actually know what we're looking for? At the tap of a screen, a new smartphone app can help identify if a little blemish might turn into a big problem. 'Doctor Mole' uses augmented reality technology to check moles for irregularities in size, shape, colour and border. After taking a picture of a mole, the user is presented with a colour-coded 'risk' level for each of these characteristics. The app can archive and compare data to check for any changes in a mole. It will also remind the user when it's time to check a mole again. Changes in moles are a common sign of malignant melanoma, one of the three main types of skin cancer. Melanoma can also develop in normal-looking skin. Although less common than basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma causes the majority of deaths from skin cancer. It is mainly caused by exposure to UV rays. Mark Shippen, the developer of Doctor Mole, lives in Australia, which has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world. Having lived in South Africa for 26 years before moving to Australia, he's experienced the danger of having fair skin in a hot climate. Mark told MailOnline: 'I have already had 3 basal cell carcinomas removed from my neck, face and back, and at my age this is very rare. So I have pretty much seen first hand the dangers of the sun. That's where the idea for Doctor Mole came from. 'I don't have a background in medicine, but when I found my first cancer a few years back I pretty much read everything about it and had a solid understanding of what to look for. Then it was just a simple case of combining the knowledge I had gained with my software development skills, and DoctorMole was created.' Scroll down for video . The app uses 'augmented reality' technology to scan pictures of users' moles . 'Risk ratings' are assigned to irregularities in various characteristics . The app reminds the user to check a mole, and can compare data to track changes over time . It's not just their beach culture that makes melanoma the most common cancer among Australians aged 15-44; the hole in the UV-blocking ozone layer above the Tasman Sea makes sun exposure down under especially dangerous. In the UK, more than 10,600 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year. It is more common in women, who are most likely to develop it on the legs. In men, the danger areas are the chest and back. More than 2 million Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each year, and some 50,000 will be diagnosed with melanoma. Melanoma is especially dangerous if it is not found early. Regular skin checks can help people discover melanoma in its earliest stages, doctors agree. Mark hopes his app will help teach users how to check themselves, rather than just doing it for them. 'I could have just written an app that snaps a photo and spits out an answer, but I chose to make it as transparent as possible and try educate the user. So by doing it using the real time computer vision, the user can see immediately what sorts of things the app is monitoring... It makes it fun for the user and I think a lot easier to teach the user what sorts of things to look for.' Having fair skin means you might be more susceptible to melanoma, as does a family history of cancerous moles . You should seek medical advice if your mole... Visit the NHS website for more information . Doctor Mole isn't the first tool to help smartphone users check for signs of skin cancer. Other apps guide users through self exams, and the German-made 'Handyscope' converts an iPhone into a dermatoscope, which doctors use to look for melanoma. But at £995, the Handyscope is in a different league to Doctor Mole, available from Apple's appstore for £2.49. Mark stresses that his app is not, and will never be a substitute for a real doctor, even though he says quite a few doctors have told him they are using it with their patients. 'There are a lot of factors that can influence the image processing, such as shadows, poor lighting and poor camera quality, so I don't think any app could claim that they can spot a cancer 100%.","Smartphone app uses 'augmented reality' to check moles for irregularities .

Six months pregnant Alex Jones, 21, was heartbroken when doctors couldn’t find a heartbeat and she would have to go through the ordeal of delivering her stillborn baby. Ms Jones was even told by medical team to make preparations for a funeral for the baby boy she named Cohan. Happy family: Alex Jones with Cohan, who has just celebrated his first birthday, and her daughter Maisy . But midwives were amazed seconds after the delivery that the tiny boy was breathing and wriggling his toes. Her three-month premature baby weighed just 1lb 11oz and was very weak but was alive. Ten doctors immediately dashed in to help as the child was whisked away to be put in an incubator. Alex said yesterday: 'It was the most amazing thing - I was told my baby had died and to prepare myself for a stillborn delivery. 'I really thought I was going to be arranging his funeral when he was born. I was utterly heartbroken. 'Me and mum were talking about organising a little plot for him and where he would be buried. 'But when he was born my mother who was with me noticed he sort of groaned and she saw his tiny toes wriggling. Survivor: Cohan was born three months premature and weighed just 1lb and 11oz and was weak but alive . 'Even the doctors and nurses were calling him a miracle baby.' Yesterday she celebrated little Cohan's first birthday. Ms Jones, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, told how she was 24 weeks into her pregnancy when her waters suddenly broke while watching EastEnders. She was rushed to a maternity unit at nearby Prince Charles Hospital where doctors gave her the grim news that they couldn’t find a heartbeat. She was transferred to Singleton Hospital in Swansea with her mother Sonia holding her hand where she gave birth naturally. But instead of a stillborn child, she was delivered her miracle baby boy Cohan - even though he was very premature and weak. She has spent every waking minute at his side in hospital as he grew stronger day-by-day. His heartbeat had to be regulated in intensive care for five months while he battled a number of infections and was fed through a drip. Intensive care: Alex was rushed to hospital and then transferred to Singleton Hospital in Swansea (pictured) with her mother Sonia holding her hand where she gave birth naturally to her miracle baby Cohan .

And Cohan, who now weighs 14lb 9oz, has just celebrated his first birthday with a party at the family home. Ms Jones, who has a three-year-old daughter Maisy, said: 'I have to pinch myself that he’s here at all. I was devastated when six months into my pregnancy they couldn’t find any trace of a heartbeat. 'When they delivered him, everyone was shocked that he was breathing. No-one was prepared for it. 'But even then, they gave him little chance to survive. I thought he was a child I would never be able to hold in my arms. 'But look at him now. He is a very happy baby and a little boy who really fought for his life. It’s such a relief to see him smiling. Even the doctors can’t believe how well he is now. 'We are not blaming anyone - his heartbeat must have been so weak the doctors were unable to detect it. 'All that matters is that Cohan’s alive. I will always think of him as my miracle baby.' Proud grandmother Sonia, 49, told how she first heard the baby’s gasp and realised he was alive. She said: 'I saw his little legs first because he was breach when he came out. 'I heard a little groan and then I saw his toes wiggle. I thought I was imagining it at first. 'I told the midwife and then she realised he was breathing. Suddenly ten doctors were in the room working on him. 'They resuscitated him and then whisked him away. We were told not to get our hopes up because he was very poorly. 'But that little groan proved to be a miracle because my grandson has survived. 'Up until that point it had been the worst moment of our lives - Alex had been breaking her heart because she was expecting her baby to be stillborn. We thought there was no hope. 'We never expected it after being told by the doctors they couldn’t find the heartbeat and there was nothing they could do. 'But it seems he had been tightly tucked up in her womb and was so small they hadn’t been able to gage his heartbeat. 'It was two weeks before Alex could hold him for the first time. He weighed less than a bag of sugar but he was such a little fighter and he held on to his little life.' Cohan is still under weight but is gaining strength every day and he is expected to live a normal life.

Prince William has revealed how he'd wished that his mother Princess Diana had been able to see his wedding day. The prince said it was the 'one time' since she died that he'd really missed his mother and he'd felt 'sad' knowing she wouldn't be there. William opened up during an interview at Clarence House, where he lives with Kate, for the U.S. show The Jubilee Queen with Katie Couric, set to be screened on ABC at 9pm today. Difficult: 'It's the one time since she's died where I've thought to myself it would be fantastic if she was here, and just how sad really for her, more than anything, not being able to see it,' William said of his wedding day . 'I sort of prepared myself beforehand so that I was sort of mentally prepared,' he said. 'I didn’t want any wobbly lips or anything going on,' Prince William told Couric in the interview ahead of the celebrations in honour of the Queen's 60-year reign. 'It was the one time since she's died where I've thought to myself it would be fantastic if she was here. And just how sad really, for her more than anything, not being able to see it. 'I think she would have loved the day and I think, hopefully, she’d be very proud of us both for the day.  I’m just very sad that she’s never going to get a chance to meet Kate.' For Harry too it was a poignant moment, as he felt his mother's absence acutely, knowing especially that 'she would have loved Kate.' 'I think she had the best seat in the house probably,' Harry said. 'She would have loved to have been there.' Harry, who acted as his brother's best man, also confessed he was 'massively nervous' on his brother's wedding day. 'Everybody was nervous,' he said. 'The whole thing was a bit of a blur to be honest because there was God knows how many millions or billions of eyes focused on us. Luckily, mainly those two.' South of the border: Prince Harry was in Brazil as a part of the Diamond Jubilee tour when he met with Couric . The two billion pairs of eyes didn't go unnoticed by William either. Recalling his wedding day he said: 'Honestly it was one of those days where you feel very elated. Also completely terrified, I have to be honest. The prospect of two billion people watching was quite daunting.' A new biography of the prince has claimed that the future king was so scarred by his parent's failed marriage that he worried whether he could be faithful to one woman. According to royal biographer Penny Junor, the author of 'Prince William: The Man Who Will Be King', Prince Charles and Princess Diana's highly publicised affairs contributed to Prince William's delayed marriage proposal to now-wife Kate Middleton. 'The problem was William: he had very real worries about whether it was possible to love just one woman. After his hurricane childhood, he was understandably cautious about committing to a relationship,' Junor writes in the book. Katie Couric, who later confessed she had been 'trepidatious' to bring up the subject of Diana because it was 'so personal and private', also talked to the princes about their relationship with the Queen. The stories that the heirs to the throne shared shows that they have a very close bond with her, one that is much more normal than expected. 'I still think she's just my grandmother, really,' Prince William told the American interviewer when asked if he remembers a specific moment when he realised that his grandmother was not like everyone else's. But continued, admitting: ''When I was younger and my parents used to always slap my hand if I was picking my nose or if I was running around screaming I was told to shut up. And I sort of understood that when I was around her I needed to be a little but more low key and little bit more polite.' Emotional scarring: A new biography about the prince claims that he was so affected by his parents' highly publicised affairs he doubted he could be faithful to one woman . Looking back at the incredible challenge facing their grandmother who took the throne at the age of 25 back in what Prince William referred to as a 'man's world', both the princes were equally as admiring. Talking to Couric in Brazil, the younger of the two said he couldn't imagine, even at 27, taking on the responsibility that the Queen did in 1953. 'This tour itself has been a brief insight as to what she had to deal with at a very young age,' Harry said. 'What she's achieved and what she's done and at the age of 25, confronted with the world's media. You can see it in her face now. You can see it in the way that she parades herself is just so immaculate.' When it comes to family though, he said his grandmother is  'really very very normal. Very relaxed. She obviously takes a huge interest in what we all do, that's her children as well as her grandchildren. 'She wants to know which charities we're supporting, how life is going in our jobs and such. So you know, she has a vested interested in what we do.' Poignant: Princes Harry and William, pictured with their mother in 1993, said it was 'difficult' not to have their mother with them on the day . And it seems her interests go beyond what her own twenty-something grandsons are up to. Joking about the Queen's Facebook page, he lamented that she hadn't 'friended' him yet and asked Couric whether she had received any friend requests from his grandmother herself. 'She's managed to get the family to move with the times and I think that's incredibly important. You can't get stuck in an old age situation when everything else around you is changing so you have to go with it,' he said approvingly. From William's description of his first meeting to discuss the royal wedding, it would appear however, that when it comes to business versus family, Britain's monarch does not waste time in prioritising. 'I was given a list in the first meeting, of 777 names, and not one of them on there I knew,' he recalled. 'And I wasn't too happy about it so I rang her for a bit of moral support, and a bit of back up, and she said ""don't be so ridiculous. Get rid of the list and start from your friends.""' The interviews came as a part of a special report on the Royal Family which will air in full on ABC tonight at 9pm EST. video platform video management video solutions video player .","William reveals in an interview with Katie Couric that he mentally prepared for the day .

"By . Lawrence Conway . UPDATED: . 06:12 EST, 12 June 2012 . A couple who were given suspended jail terms for hurling their pet dog into the sea, won their appeal against conviction . The terrier dog called Jess was first thrown into the water from a slipway at Exmouth, Devon, by his owner Linda Jones. A court heard the couple were photographed by an eye-witness who caught their actions in a series of pictures which showed Jess being hurled into the water and twisting in mid air before nose diving into the sea. Lucy Jones (right) with John Nesbitt (left) successfully appealed an animal cruelty conviction at Exeter Crown Court claiming they were trying to cool down pet dog Jess . Jones, 51, and 62-year-old John Nesbitt, from Exmouth, Devon, denied a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to Jess one summer’s day last June, but were convicted after a trial in the magistrates court. The couple claimed they were just trying to keep their pet cool. But yesterday an appeal at Exeter Crown Court was successful and Jones will now be reunited with Jess who has been in RSPCA care for nearly a year. Recorder Paul Dunkels QC told Jones: 'It was an utterly stupid for Linda Jones to have done. It is something she must never do to that dog or any other dog given such a chance.' The judge said there was no evidence . to say that Jess had been physically hurt after being hurled into the . sea on a slipway at Exmouth, Devon. Vet . David Cooper said it was ‘probable’ the dog would have been caused some . ‘fear and distress’ when Jones lifted him to her shoulder and threw the . animal in several times as people looked on. The judge said it was the manner that the dog was thrown in to the sea which was the subject of criticism. The appeal judge said there was no evidence to say that Jess had been physically hurt after being hurled into the sea on a slipway at Exmouth, Devon . Lucy Jones (right) with John Nesbitt (left) successfully appealed an animal cruelty conviction at Exeter Crown Court and she will now be reunited with Jess who has been in RSPCA care for nearly a year . The appeal was allowed and Jones and her partner John Nesbitt, 62 - who was also cleared of the same conviction - will be reunited with their pet. Prosecutor Clifford Howard told the first hearing at Exeter Magistrates' Court: 'Both of them accepted that the dog called Jess was thrown into the sea by them. 'However, they claimed they were cooling her down because she was hot.' He said they denied causing the dog any suffering by their actions. Mr Howard said each of then threw the dog from the slipway. He said beneath the water was a concrete slipway but said the couple would not know how shallow the water was at the point. The prosecutor said the first photos showed Mr Nesbitt throwing Jess into the sea after holding her in his arms. The second batch showed Jones holding Jess before launching her into the sea and the dog ‘hitting the water’. Mr Howard said Jess would have been in danger of hitting the concrete base of the slipway. Mr Clews, who took the pictures, said: 'The male picked up the dog and chucked it into the sea. It went into the sea and got back out. 'Then the woman picked it up and she chucked it in the sea. I saw the dog hit the water.' Jones told the magistrates: 'I am so angry. I know the sea like the back of my hand. I just want my baby back.' Jones initially told police 'she was just going in for a swim - to wetten her'. Four year old Jess was unhurt but a vet said she could have been injured as she twisted face first into the shallow water and the base of the concrete slipway. Jones said: 'All my dogs go into the sea. The water was clear, it was not dangerous. It was a lovely hot day in April. I would gladly do it again. 'Whoosh, she goes to the bottom and up she comes. She is 18 inches tall and shakes herself off. 'She swims out of the sea - doggy paddles. It wasn’t that shallow, the tide was coming in. I just plopped her in.' Nesbitt said they both threw her in twice and he said Jess flew a ‘few feet’ in the air into the sea and called them ‘little dips in the sea’. Defence lawyer Jeremy Tricks said: 'Linda Jones handling of the dog was foolish.' But he argued that they did not cause Jess unnecessary suffering because dogs are 'resilient animals'. The magistrates had imposed a 12 week jail term suspended for two years and a 10 year old animal ban after convicting them of causing unnecessary suffering to the black and tan terrier.","Eye-witness captured the couple on camera hurling .

Honey Boo Boo's mother, June Shannon, attempted to give her first daughter, Anna 'Chickadee', away for adoption after becoming a parent at 15, it was claimed today. The 33-year-old reality star from McIntyre, Georgia, now a mother-of-four, first asked relatives if they would take the baby while pregnant, sister-in-law Janice Shannon has apparently said. June is said to have then 'abandoned' Anna, then seven, at the home of her mother, Sandra Hale, in order to 'move into a trailer with a boyfriend'. Honey Boo Boo's mother, June Shannon (left), apparently attempted to give her first daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' (right, now 18), away for adoption after becoming a parent at 15 . According to the National Enquirer, Janice, who was married to June's late brother, Jimmy, had been prepared to take Anna, but June did not want to lose her parental rights so the adoption failed to take place. The magazine says that child welfare officers eventually gave custody of Anna to Sandra, and it was only this year that the teen moved . back in with her mother. But . the current arrangement is just for the cameras, it claims.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:27 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 22 October 2012 . Newsman: Bob Schieffer, who has been at CBS since 1972, will be the moderator during tonight's debate in Boca Raton, Florida . The moderator in the third and final round of the debate slugfest between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney may have a wealth of Southern charm, but don't expect him to be soft with the candidates. Millions of voters will be glued to the tube on Monday night for the last presidential debate, and many are wondering if longtime CBS newsman Bob Schieffer will steal the show as his fellow moderators have - for negative reasons. At 75, Schieffer is only three years younger than PBS’s Jim Lehrer, who came under intense criticism for how he handled the first debate between Obama and Romney. Schieffer’s career goes back to 1972, when he became anchor of the CBS Sunday Night News. Today, he remains the moderator of the network’s Sunday talk show Face the Nation. He is also the network's chief Washington correspondent. It's also not his first foray in the debate scene, as Schieffer was at the helm for the 2004 debate between President George W. Bush and John Kerry, and in the 2008 event between President Obama and John McCain. On the debate agenda are Iran-Israel tensions, China, terrorism and the war in Afghanistan - all subjects expected to come up Monday in the 90-minute encounter. Although polls show the economy is of top concern to most voters, global affairs have cropped up as a key issue in the final weeks due to unrest in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. Thanks to a bitter campaign rivalry, thriving partisan media outlets and the growth of social media, debate moderator is approaching baseball umpire on the scale of thankless jobs. Lehrer was criticized for not doing enough and CNN’s Candy Crowley was ripped for doing too much. Setting the stage: A worker adjusts the backdrop on stage in preparation for Monday's presidential debate between Obama and Romney . The big stage: Lynn University students serve as stand-ins during final preparations for the debate . One last debate: Romney and Obama, pictured during last week's debate at Hofstra University, will get together for the third and final time before Election Day . 'There are millions of people with . their hands over their keyboards ready to analyze every single moment of . what's happening,' said veteran TV journalist Jeff Greenfield. 'That . puts even more pressure on ... It's a no-win situation.' Conservative . columnist George Will called last week's get-together at Hofstra . University on Long Island the best presidential debate he's ever seen. It didn't take long, however, for Republican Mitt Romney's supporters to go after Crowley. They said questions that she chose from undecided voters on immigration, gun control and equal pay for women played to President Obama's strengths. They were incensed when Crowley, faced by two candidates in a dispute over what was said during a presidential address about Libya, corrected Romney by saying Obama had referred to an attack on Americans in Benghazi as an 'act of terror.' Crowley also noted that others in the administration suggested for nearly two weeks that the reaction to an anti-Muslim video was a motivating factor in the attack. Been here before: Schieffer moderated a 2008 debate between Obama and John McCain . Experience: chieffer, center, also moderated a 2004 debate between then-President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry . Radio host Rush Limbaugh called Crowley's work 'an act of journalistic terror.' 'If . there were any journalistic standards, what she did last night would . have been the equivalent of blowing up her career like a suicide . bomber,' he said. The conservative Media Research Center criticized Crowley for having only one question on a foreign policy issue, even though this Monday's Schieffer-moderated debate is supposed to focus on foreign policy. Thanks to a clock that airs on CNN's screen during the debate, some conservatives saw as a sign of bias that Obama spoke for 44 minutes, 4 seconds during the debate, compared to Romney's 40:50. This prompted CNN to count the actual words spoken by each candidate. The faster-talking Romney said 7,984 words and Obama 7,506. Criticism of Crowley was a relentless post-debate topic on Fox News Channel, which knows CNN isn't popular among Republicans in its audience. Presidential: Schieffer, pictured left, chats with President Gerald Ford in the White House . Conservatives on Fox and liberals on MSNBC offer an echo chamber for partisan complaints and have far greater prominence than they had even a decade ago. 'I knew from the start,' Crowley told The Associated Press, 'somebody is going to be unhappy no matter what you do.' Crowley's bosses leapt to her defense: 'She had to deal with the tricky format, the nervous questioners, the aggressive debaters, all while shutting out the pre-debate attempts to spin and intimidate her,' CNN U.S. chief Mark Whitaker said in a memo to staff. 'She pulled it off masterfully.' Even as each debate progresses, Twitter is crackling with reactions. Type in the moderator's name in a search and the screen immediately fills with tweets. Generally, it's a dependable way to gauge how a candidate is doing. The harsher one party's reaction to a moderator is, the tougher time their candidate is having onstage. 'I've never known the winning side to [complain],' said Aaron Brown, the former ABC and CNN anchor who is now a professor at Arizona State University. Lehrer was likened to a teacher who had lost control of the class during his debate. Frustration against Lehrer boiled over predominantly among Democrats like Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow who were witnessing Obama's admittedly poor performance in the first debate. The former PBS host said he essentially tried to get out of the way, asking general questions and letting the candidates go after each other. 'I wondered if we needed a moderator since we had Mitt Romney,' Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said, even though her candidate talked longer. As in the second debate, Romney spoke more words. 'Hey, I wasn't that bad': Jim Lehrer, another journalism industry veteran, came under intense criticism for the way he he handled the first debate between Obama and Romney . Show of support: Moderator Candy Crowley had the backing of CNN despite what her critics said . One motive of the pre- and post-debate criticism is to 'work the refs,' to let the moderators know that partisans are watching. If intimidation works, even on a subtle level, it can seep into their performances at a time when even modest advantages can make a big difference. During the second debate, George Mason University went so far as to count how many times each candidate and Crowley interrupted one another. They found that Romney was interrupted 58 times and Obama 43. The numbers came with little context, however, so it wasn't clear how many interruptions were related to candidates exceeding agreed-upon time limits. Leading the discussion: Schieffer has been at CBS since 1972, and is the current moderator at the network's Sunday talk show Face the Nation . Crowley's role in the Libyan discussion also raised the issue of how much the moderators should be prepared to practice journalism while onstage. If you hear something factually incorrect or misleading, is it your duty to point it out to viewers, or is that strictly the candidates' job? For most viewers, the answer no doubt has to do with which candidate is being corrected.So let's get this moderator's job straight: . Craft sharp questions to get the candidates to talk, while being meticulously fair not to challenge one more than another. Keep an eye on the clock so one candidate doesn't get to hog the time. Don't be bullied; be firm in forcing the candidates to move on. But be flexible enough to keep a productive discussion flowing. Know the difference. Keep the focus off yourself. And do it all on live television before some 60 million people.","Schieffer has been with CBS since 1972, and is the current moderator of the network's Sunday talk show Face the Nation .

"By . Chris Slack . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 17 August 2011 . She has spent every day of the past 84 years inside the walls of her convent in central Spain. Now, however, 103-year-old nun Sister Teresita will finally emerge into the outside world on Friday for a very special occasion. The nun will meet Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to the Spanish capital of Madrid to celebrate World Youth Day. Devout: Sister Teresita will leave her convent in central Spain for the first time in 84 years this week . Sister Teresita is a member of the Buenafuente del Sistal Convent, which is located around 60miles north of Madrid. She has been a resident at the convent since April 16, 1927. This, by coincidence, is the same day that Joesph Ratzinger - now Pope Benedict XVI - was born. The last time the centenarian left the compound was during the Spanish Civil war, which took place between 1936 and 1939. Even then she only fled for a few hours at a time to escape the overnight fighting. Secluded: The nun has lived at the Buenafuente del Sistal Convent since 1927, only leaving for a few hours to escape fighting during the Spanish Civil War . The convent's mother superior, named only as Maria, said: 'She said she thinks she will make the trip with her eyes closed, so that nothing will distract her.' Meeting: Sister Terestia will meet with Pope Benedict XVI in Madrid . Sister Teresita is a minor celebrity in the area around the nunnery after a book was published detailing her life inside the convent. In the book, titled ""What is a girl like you doing in a place like that"", she is quoted as saying: 'Who can spend 84 years in a convent without being happy? Of course I’m happy.' She adds in the book that she was encouraged into the Church by her father, who said that it was a way for them to escape extreme poverty. She claims that when she entered the convent she only had a vague idea of what life would be like and that over the years she found happiness. Sister Teresita's visit to Madrid comes as thousands congregate there to welcome the Pope. Pilgrims will camp out under the stars in an area the size of 48 football pitches ahead of his visit, which begins on Thursday. The city has been transformed with yellow and white banners lining the streets, while religious events and concerts have been planned. Huge screens have also been erected to broadcast the events across the city. 1959-1973: Economic boom known as the 'Spanish miracle' 1975: Death of Franco following 36-year dictatorship . 1978: 33-day reign of Pope John Paul I . 1981: Assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II . 1992: Summer Olympics held in Barcelona . 2004: Madrid train bombings . 2005: Death of Pope John Paul II and election of Benedict XVI . 2010: Spain win the football World Cup . Sister Teresita has also lived through the reigns of seven different Popes, including Pius XII, John XXIII and Paul VI. An air-base in the south west of the city has also been transformed to hold a huge open air mass on Sunday at the end of the papal visit. Hundreds of priests, speaking 30 languages, have also been called in to listen to sins in 200 specially constructed confessional booths. However, the visit has stirred up tensions in the country, with many asking how the Government can afford to spend the money on the visit during its economic crisis. One group of protestors have set up camps in Madrid to vent their frustration at unemployment and political corruption. A spokesman for the movement said: 'With the economic crisis we are going through, we can't pay for this. The Church should set the example.' However the organisers of the event say that an estimate 50m euro cost will be met by  pilgrims’ registration fees and corporate sponsorship. They added that the event could inject around 100m euros into the Spanish economy.",Nun entered convent on same day Pope Benedict XVI was born .
"By . Louise Court, Editor Of Cosmopolitan . PUBLISHED: . 11:34 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:51 EST, 5 October 2012 . After weeks of planning, I finally looked at the black and white photos laying on my desk. We'd set ourselves the challenge of getting Mel B and her husband Stephen Belafonte to recreate an iconic Rolling Stone cover, featuring a topless Janet Jackson, in aid of the charity CoppaFeel! for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Suggesting that Mel B went topless was a big ask, and was dependent on her belief in the importance of the cause we were supporting. Now was the moment of truth. Mel B and her husband Stephen Belafonte in the October issue of Cosmopolitan, recreating the iconic Rolling Stone cover, in aid of breast cancer charity CoppaFeel! My immediate reaction was a huge sense of relief: these pictures were every bit as powerful as I'd hoped. The first signs of breast cancer are often spotted by women's partners, which is why we involved Mel B's husband in the shoot. We wanted the images to become a talking point that would make men and women look twice, think about the message, remember it - and ultimately save lives. When I read Natalie Shalom's article in the Daily Mail last week saying the pictures were 'shockingly crass' and 'insensitive', of course I did some soul searching. She lost her mother to breast cancer and both her sisters have had the disease. The last thing I want is for anyone to find the images upsetting. The October issue of Cosmopolitan . But when I look at the response we have had from readers, and the hundreds of comments that have appeared on MailOnline, I feel very strongly that we did the right thing in publishing them. It has made the whole topic of checking your breasts a major talking point - which was our aim. My inspiration in this whole campaign has been an extraordinary young woman called Kristin Hallenga, who started the breast cancer charity CoppaFeel! Kristin has a very personal reason for her obsession with breasts. Three years ago, aged just 23, she was diagnosed with breast cancer herself. As she says: 'I imagined that aged 23 I would see a bit of the world, enjoy crazy nights out with my friends and have a ton of carefree fun. Instead, I got breast cancer. 'Discovering a lump in 2008, I went straight to my GP but was sent away on the basis that at my young age it was bound to be hormonal. 'Six months later the lump was still there. My no-nonsense mother marched me right back to the GP and demanded a referral. We thought there would be nothing to worry about because breast cancer is an older women's disease. But we were wrong. 'Eight months on, following a frustrating fight to discover what was happening, I found out that not only did I have breast cancer, but that it had spread to my spine. I was at stage four, the most advanced type of cancer. There is no stage five.' Kristin had radiotherapy followed by . five months of chemotherapy and yet more radiotherapy, during which she . lost her hair, had a mastectomy and said goodbye to her carefree life. To . say she became a woman with purpose is a total understatement. Kristin . has since made it her full-time mission to encourage young women (and . men – they get it too) to keep hold of their youth and freedom by simply . getting to know their breasts. Founder of CoppaFeel! Kristin Hallenga, left, and Natalie Shalom with her sister Anneliese, right . So CoppaFeel! was born, thanks to Kristin and her twin sister Maren - who was checked but thankfully found not to have any known breast cancer genes. It's a cheeky name that gets right to the point and sums up both sisters' irreverent attitude, lust for life and love of a good pun. The key message from both of them is: if you don't check your breasts you don't know if you have the symptoms of breast cancer. Kristin has taken her campaign to universities, schools and festivals. She relentlessly coaxes celebrities to add their support to her cause because she knows the power they have in getting the message across. LOOK for swelling in your armpit or around the collarbone . FEEL for constant pain in your breast or your armpit . LOOK for nipple discharge . FEEL for lumps and thickening . LOOK for changes in skin texture, eg, puckering or dimpling . LOOK for change in size and shape . LOOK for nipple inversion and changes in direction . LOOK for a rash or crusting of the nipple or surrounding area . Do all these regularly. If you spot any changes, go straight to your GP. She has persuaded Dermot O'Leary to run marathons, Fearne Cotton signed up to be the patron of the charity, and Hollywood actor Chris O'Dowd has given up time to support CoppaFeel! too. Shooting celebrities in an homage to the Rolling Stone cover was her own idea. Originally, we discussed doing the shoot with survivors of breast cancer but decided early on that celebrities would command far more attention. The point of the campaign was for . young women to take preventative action – immediately. We wanted the . photograph of Mel to be eye-catching and glamorous, and knew it might be . a little controversial. But . it was never intended to be disrespectful to women battling breast . cancer, or to those who have lost loved ones to the disease. Speaking . to Kristin about the recent controversy, she believes we must celebrate . healthy breasts – and doesn't think showing photographs of them on . glamorous celebrities is a bad thing. 'Getting your partner to help isn't . only fun but potentially life-saving. Sexy or not sexy, this awareness . and education can prompt another young woman to start checking her . breasts. 'Telling . young women about the dark days of chemotherapy is not going to . persuade my generation to check their breasts. If anything, it will . scare them into doing nothing - and the fear of this disease must be . stamped out or many young women will be diagnosed too late, as I was.' Hollyoaks actress Jorgie Porter also took part in the Cosmopolitan feature in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month . For years at Cosmopolitan we have . persuaded famous men from Lenny Kravitz, Alex James from Blur, Jason . Donovan, Ronan Keating, Graham Norton, boxer David Haye, Strictly Come . Dancing stars Brendan Cole and  Bruno Tonioli, cricketer Stuart Broad . and many Olympians to strip naked in the battle against testicular . cancer. It is the most . common cancer in young men but as they are notoriously bad at going to . see the doctor about any health matters we target the women in their . lives too. We tell them the symptoms and encourage them both to be aware . of them. The . Cosmo naked centerfold has made a taboo subject talked-about and from . letters we have had I know it has saved lives. No one has complained . that we have used healthy tennis players, footballers, cricketers, DJ's . and soap stars to make this point and no one has had a problem with the . fact that many of them have been shot in a sexy or tongue-in-cheek way. There . is a brilliant breast awareness campaign being run in Scotland starring . the comedian Elaine C Smith, 54, whose mother died from breast cancer. It shows her holding up a series of placards featuring the lumps, . dimpling and changes in skin texture of diseased breasts. It is powerful . and shocking. And I am sure will get the message through to women in . their 40s and beyond. The iconic September 1993 cover of Rolling Stone magazine, featuring a topless Janet Jackson, which inspired the Cosmopolitan shoot . But I truly believe the photos of Mel, who had a breast cancer scare herself when she was younger, will have far more resonance with women in their 20s and 30s. As the biggest magazine for young women in the world, Cosmopolitan does a lot of research into what grabs their attention – and they are a generation of young women who respond to strong visual messages. They don't want to be patronised, but a celebrity will always catch their eye. And they are at risk from this hideous disease. Elaine C Smith says, as do the supporters of our photos on MailOnline and Cosmo readers who have written into the magazine: 'As far as I am concerned if this saves one life it is absolutely worth it.' I feel exactly the same way about our photographs, I thank Mel B for having the courage to take part but most of all I thank Kristin for being the brains behind this campaign and allowing us to bring it to life. But I'll leave the last word with a Daily Mail reader, Amy from Kingston-Upon-Thames, following Thursday's moving piece from Natalie Shalom. She said: 'The campaign isn't aimed at her age group; it is aimed at mine, the 18-30s. I had my first cancer scare at 15 and have had to check myself regularly ever since. 'When I had my most recent scare my best friend came to me and asked how to check herself, she had no idea what to do or even that she ought to! 'My attitude is anything that gets people to think about preventative measures is a major positive. Fear is an incredible motivator. And I say this as the proud daughter of a breast cancer survivor.’ For more information visit the CoppaFeel! website.","Images were commissioned by Cosmopolitan in aid of charity CoppaFeel!

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 11 July 2011 . Jailed: David Bell, 26, beat his wife and kept her in the loft for three weeks . An evil bodybuilder has been jailed after he kept his starving wife and baby prisoner in a filthy loft and forced her to have sex with strangers. David Bell, 26, beat his wife Zara with saucepans and martial arts weapons - and kept her in the attic of the family home with their daughter Jessica, one. Zara, 26, only managed to escape her life of . terror in Pitsea, Essex, when she smuggled an old mobile phone into the loft and called . police while her husband was out. She barely had enough food to feed her daughter and the pair had to sit in the attic, . soaked in their own urine. After police rescued her doctors discovered she had 24 separate injuries. She had been kept there over a three-week period while Bell trained for hours on end at the gym. A recording of her call was played to the hushed court room. 'I have been abused by my husband,' she told the operator. 'I am sitting in the loft and I can't get out.' Bell was jailed for nine years at Basildon Crown Court after he admitted false imprisonment and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He showed no remorse as he was given a public protection sentence. He will only be released if he can prove he is not a danger to the public. His wife has since moved out of the area. Bell repeatedly attacked her with kitchen saucepans, nunchaku - martial arts fighting sticks - and even a metal sieve. After one beating, the court was told he forced Zara to stand in front of a mirror and sneered: 'I don't . suppose you recognise yourself do you?' Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said: 'In . the first day of her police interview she said ""he's always stamping on . me"". It isn't going too far to say she is frightened to death of this . defendant.' Bell refused to answer questions from detectives during interview. Prisoner: David Bell kept his wife and one-year-old daughter holed up inside the loft in the family home in this street in Pitsea, Essex . Mr Jackson said events took a . sinister turn when Bell told his wife he wanted her to sleep with a . stranger to 'spice up their boring sex life'. In . February this year he arranged for his wife to meet a man in a Basildon . pub and bought a video camera for his wife to film the encounter. Terrified . that her husband would harm her even more and fearing for her . daughter's safety she went through with the encounter after drinking a . bottle of Vodka. When her husband watched the video back he was so jealous and enraged he began his campaign of torture the next day. For . three weeks he repeatedly battered his wife and, each time he went to . the gym, Bell locked his wife and their baby daughter in the loft. During one of the horrific beatings, Bell punched his wife in the face, breaking her nose. But he refused to take her to hospital and made her reset her own nose, before beating her again an hour later. Mr Jackson said: 'He subjected his wife, on a daily basis, to what we say was savage and sustained beatings using his fists, feet and weapons. 'During that period the prosecution say he subjected Zara Bell to utter humiliation. 'Effectively, he tortured her.' She was eventually rescued on February 22 after dialling 999 on an old mobile phone that she had smuggled into the loft. Police Constable Mark Hurd said in a statement that he had never seen injuries as bad. Maria Dineen, defending Bell, said: 'Ever . since the moment of his arrest he has been truly horrified and ashamed . at his action and the physical and emotional scars they have left on his . wife.' The mother-of-one lost her job at a bakery because she came in to work covered in bruises so often that her employers felt she put off customers. As he jailed Bell, Judge Jonathan Black said: 'An experienced police officer stated at the time that the injuries he saw were by far the worst he had ever seen.' Speaking after her husband was locked up for beating and falsely imprisoning her, Zara Bell said: 'I'm terrified of him. 'For what he's done to me, I hope he rots in prison. 'I've got to restart my whole life. He destroyed my life. I've had to move away and have been isolated from my family and friends. 'But I've got to make a new life for my daughter and I.' Zara's friends and family wept in the . public gallery as they heard her make the desperate call to police . while Bell was at the gym. She is heard on the recording . becoming increasingly frantic, as the sounds of music from her . daughter's toy could be eerily heard in the background. Police operator: Hello police . Zara: My name is Zara Bell. I have been abused by my husband. I am sitting in the loft and I can't get out. (Begins to cry.) My daughter is with me. Police operator: Are you both in the loft? Zara: My husband is quite well-built. He is going to come back any minute. For the last few weeks I've been hurt by him, my face is black and blue. This was the first time I could get the phone, it took me a few days to get it. Police operator: Okay, stay calm, I've got a police car on its way to you. Zara: Will they be able to get in? I'm in the loft. Police operator: Can you get out of the loft? Zara: I can't get down, the ladders, he's got them out on the balcony. He puts me up here first and then he takes the ladders away. I found this phone when I was cleaning but it took me a few days to find where the phone charger was. Police operator: The police have arrived but stay with me until the officers get to you. (Zara begins heavily crying as she hears the police kick the door down and most of what she says from this point is inaudible.)","24 separate injuries found on 26-year-old's body .

Fifteen British nationals are suspected of being part of an Islamic training camp in Syria, it emerged yesterday during a court appearance by an NHS doctor accused of kidnapping a photographer in the war-torn country. Shajul Islam, 26, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court accused of snatching a British photographer and a Dutch journalist in Syria. Islam, who completed his medical . training at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in East London, left the UK for . Syria earlier this year, it was said. Charge: An artist's impression of Shajul Islam who appeared in court . yesterday accused of holding a British photographer and Dutch journalist . hostage in Syria . He was arrested at Heathrow Airport last week after he arrived on a flight from Egypt with his wife and one-year-old daughter, the court was told. Islam is accused of false imprisonment under terrorism legislation. It is alleged that he, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will between July 17 and 26. When Mr Cantlie, who has worked for the Sunday Times, returned to Britain, he told how he and Mr Oerlemans were handcuffed and blindfolded. Fearing they would be executed, they made a failed bid to escape during which both were shot at.Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were finally freed with the help of the Free Syria Army. Hunt: British security services are trying to trace men who allegedly flew from the UK to join the terror cell in Bab al-Hawa, an area in the north of Syria the country close to the Turkish border . Rescue: Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were finally freed with the help of the Free Syria Army . Piers Arnold, prosecuting, told the court: ‘They were threatened at gunpoint, blindfolded and restrained.’ It is believed that the 40 people in the camp came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. He said: ‘[There were] Chechens and youngsters engaged in jihad conflict for the first time.‘A significant number of individuals appeared to be British - 15 British nationals were in the camp.’ Mozammel . Hossain, defending Islam, said: ‘This is a bright young man with a very . promising future in this country as an NHS doctor. Officials believe up to 100 British nationals have travelled to Syria to fight against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad¿s pictured here at a mosque in Damascus on August 19 . ‘He has a first-class degree in biochemistry. ‘He has qualified as a doctor and completed his training.’ Islam, who wore a black jacket with a grey shirt and tie, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address and was remanded in custody  to appear at the Old Bailey on November 2. His wife, also 26, was released without charge on Tuesday. The would-be jihadists are said to form part of a 40-strong group of fanatics who want to convert Syria to sharia law.

Officials believe up to 100 British nationals have travelled to Syria to fight against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. But the group of 15, who are armed with machine guns, are understood to particularly concern British authorities because of their alleged links to Islamic fundamentalism. Others who may have joined the Free Syrian Army, which is fighting against the Syrian government and is backed by Foreign Secretary William Hague, are of less concern to British authorities. Analysts say the majority fighting Assad’s brutal regime are ordinary Syrians and soldiers who have defected. But an increasing number of  foreign fighters with militant beliefs from countries including Britain and France are crossing the borders. Last week Mr Hague said the Government is monitoring evidence of Britons who want to join the conflict.

"FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva says 'progress' has been made 'in reducing hunger' By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:58 EST, 10 October 2012 . The United Nations has admitted that its headline-grabbing announcement that one billion people in the world were going hungry was wrong and the number is actually significantly less. The UN Food and Agriculture . Organisation made headlines in 2009 when it announced that one billion people — one sixth of the world’s population — were undernourished. But it now places the figure at closer to 870 million after admitting the original projection was incorrect because of flawed methodology and poor data. Poverty stricken: The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation announced in 2009 that one sixth of the world's population were undernourished . 'We were wrong': FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva, pictured speaking at the FAO headquarters in Rome, said the good news is that progress is being made in reducing hunger . It now claims to use a much more accurate set of parameters . and statistics to calculate its annual estimate of the world’s hungry. FAO decided to set the record straight about the number of the world’s undernourished people, applying the more accurate data retroactively to 1990, in its 2012 state of food insecurity report released on Tuesday. And according to the report, the number of hungry people has actually been declining steadily — rather than increasing — over the past two decades. But it added progress has slowed since the 2007-2008 food crises and the global economic downturn. FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said: 'We have good news, we have made some progress in reducing hunger.' The organisation argues that positive action taken now to boost economic growth and invest in agriculture, particularly in poor countries, could reduce the world's hungry by one-half by 2015. The report stated: ‘In today’s world of unprecedented technical and economic opportunities, we find it entirely unacceptable that more than 100 million children under the age of five are underweight, and are therefore unable to realize their full socio-economic and human potential.' Decreasing: The UN FAO has now lowered the number of undernourished people in the world to 870 million . The group of Eight pledged $20billion for seeds, fertilizers and tools in 2009 to help prevent rising numbers of undernourished people . The FAOs announcement in 2009 sparked a high-level summit including the pope and the UN chief went on a daylong hunger strike to show solidarity with the one billion. The Group of Eight devoted much of its summit that year to pledging $20 billion for seeds, fertilizers and tools to help poor nations feed themselves. But the projections were off because they were calculated using figures from non-UN sources that were fed into the UN’s number-crunching model. Jomo Kwame Sundaram, FAO’s assistant director-general for economic and social development, said: 'There was considerable fear that that . combination of lower incomes and higher prices was going to cause . significant undernourishment. 'No one really knows for sure if at any particular period whether that one billion figure was actually reached or not.' He said the goal of the state of food insecurity report is to assess chronic hunger over time, rather than spikes caused by temporary food shortages and price hikes. He added that the UN couldn’t predict how well governments would respond to the crises to protect their poorest and whether individual families would make sacrifices to make sure they had enough food on the table. Helping the hungry: Children receive free food distributed outside a cafe, early morning in Karachi, Pakistan . Going to waste: One third of all food produced is wasted along the distribution line . Pietro Gennari, the statistics director for the FAO’s economic and social development department, added: 'So it was in a way a mistake, an error, that we have made with many other organizations at the time.' FAO officials said the new number of 870 million hungry people for 2012 was based on revised figures from 1990. They calculated this using new population data from the UN Population Fund. China’s population estimate for the 1990s, for example, has been revised upward by some 25 million people, whereas Bangladesh’s population has been revised downwards by 17 million people. That affects hunger statistics because food production figures are divided by population figures and estimates of food loss at the retail level. Previously, FAO considered the amount of food produced as the amount of food available to feed the world. The agency didn’t take into account that one third of all food produced is wasted along the distribution chain, either because it spoils, is eaten by rodents or is otherwise inedible. The 2012 survey takes into account these losses.","UN Food and Agriculture .

Lord Patten admitted that heads could roll if corporation bosses were found to have acted improperly. He said he feared that the television and radio star may have been helped in his sordid sexual exploitation of teenage girls by other BBC employees. Crisis: The Jimmy Savile scandal was branded a ‘cesspit’ yesterday by the BBC’s own chairman. Lord Patten admitted that heads could roll if corporation bosses were found to have acted improperly . Concern: He said he feared that the television and radio star may have been helped in his sordid sexual exploitation of teenage girls by other BBC employees . Lord Patten also suggested the BBC was likely to broadcast a prime-time apology if the inquiries into Savile came back with damning findings. Yesterday the former Tory MP asked director-general George Entwistle to review the corporation’s guidelines on child protection following what he called the ‘appalling’ allegations of sexual abuse against Savile. He also said an independent inquiry at the BBC, supervised by an outside figure, should be started as swiftly as possible following a police investigation into Savile’s activities. Former patients at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire and another in Leeds yesterday claimed they had been assaulted during visits by Savile in the 1970s and 1980s. Teenagers in wheelchairs and others recovering from cancer were among those said to have fallen victim to the DJ. One claimed nurses told young patients to pretend to be asleep whenever the star visited their wards. Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman. Lord Patten is among those at the BBC struggling to explain who knew what and when about the dropping of a Newsnight investigation into allegations against Savile . And in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, his elaborate tombstone was removed from a cemetery at midnight out of respect for ‘public opinion’. Police have said they believe Savile was a ‘predatory sex offender’ who could have abused up to 30 victims over a period of more than 40 years beginning in 1959. Lord Patten and others at the BBC are still struggling to explain who knew what and when about the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into allegations against Savile. On Sunday former director-general Mark Thompson, who left his post last month, said he had never heard any rumours or received any complaints or allegations about Savile when he was in charge. But yesterday Lord Patten – who said he himself first heard about the Savile allegations less than two weeks ago when he read about them in a newspaper – insisted said Mr Thompson had been made aware of the Newsnight investigation last December by director of news Helen Boaden. Lord Patten insisted said Mark Thompson, left, had been made aware of the Newsnight investigation last December by director of news Helen Boaden, right . When asked to confirm that the former director-general knew about the investigation, he said: ‘Yes’. His comments were later retracted by the BBC Trust, which said he ‘misspoke’ on the matter. When asked if he was convinced there were not others taking part or helping Savile with these type of activities at the BBC, Lord Patten said: ‘No’. He also said that bosses could lose their jobs if they were found guilty of impropriety over their handling of the issue. Addressing a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch yesterday, Lord Patten began with the words: ‘I would like to say one or two things about the appalling allegations and the cesspit of the Jimmy Saville allegations.’ But later there were tough questions for him to answer about how current BBC director-general George Enwistle could oversee the organising the independent inquiry when he was one of the executives facing questions about what he knew. Under scrutiny: Scotland Yard has formally recorded eight criminal allegations - two rapes and six indecent assaults - against the former TV presenter so far in its Operation Yewtree investigation . Mr Entwistle was one of the executives who were told about the Newsnight investigation into Savile last year, although it is denied he knew the exact nature of the allegations. There had been criticism that the BBC had ditched the investigation on its Newsnight programme late last year because it would have run counter to other celebratory shows about the once popular presenter which were then being prepared for broadcast. But Lord Patten said yesterday the editor of Newsnight was ‘not leaned on’, and no BBC executives had intervened. Earlier this week Mr Entwistle made an apology to Savile’s victims during an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme and said there would be an inquiry to follow the police investigation. Inquiry: Lord Patten said he was sure the BBC inquiry will look into allegations made by other presenters such as Liz Kershaw, who revealed she was groped by a colleague while she was on air . Lord Patten said yesterday: ‘The BBC has in place child protection policies, processes, guidance for us by all staff on and off the premises and independents making programmes for the BBC. ‘We’ve asked the director-general to assure us that those policies are up to date and fit for purpose that they’re effective in protecting minors and under-age children. ‘We’ve also said that we want to be satisfied on the arrangements in place for dealing with sexual harassment, bullying and whistleblowing and we want to be sure that those guidelines that do exist are gold standard and up to date and comply with current best practice.’ Abuse: Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where Jimmy Savile was allegedly free to prey upon young patients, despite the staff knowing about his behaviour . Lord Patten suggested that the internal inquiry will not look at the editorial decision by Newsnight, saying he did not want to question the ‘journalistic integrity’ of people. But insiders admitted yesterday that it is likely to look at what bosses did with the information contained within it when they were made aware of the allegations. Asked what would happen if any . current BBC employees such as the director general and other executives . were found to have acted improperly, Lord Patten said: ‘You would not . expect any employee of a newspaper or the BBC to survive if her or she . was found to have behaved improperly.’ He . said he was sure the BBC inquiry will look into allegations made by . other presenters such as Liz Kershaw, who revealed she was groped by a . colleague while she was on air.

And Greater Manchester and Tayside Police became the latest forces to receive complaints of abuse by Savile, who died in October last year.

The families of murder victims could face compensation cuts under Government plans to slash spending by £50million. Unions and MPs have blasted proposals to cut a quarter of the £200m awarded annually by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. The scheme awards compensation to more than 30,000 people each year who are seriously injured following violent crimes. Loss: Victims of crime could lose compensation under proposals to save £50m . Usdaw, a union that represents retail workers, claims the cuts proposed by the Government would mean almost 90 per cent of victims would see their compensation slashed or axed completely. The scheme was due to come into force on September 30, but was withdrawn when it was condemned in committee by both Conservative and Labour MPs. However, the Ministry of Justice is now re-considering the changes. Usdaw general secretary John Hannett said: 'We were very encouraged when the Government withdrew the revised scheme, particularly in light of the comments made by Conservative backbenchers, but unfortunately this now looks less like a rethink and more like a tactical retreat. 'Despite the Government continuing to suggest otherwise, the current scheme is already on a sustainable financial footing and not even the most seriously affected victims would receive a penny more from the revised scheme. 'On the contrary, half of victims would receive nothing in future and almost 90 per cent will lose out, including those most seriously injured and the children of murder victims. MP John Redwood (left) is one of a number of MPs who have criticised plans to cut compensation for crime victims. The CWU says postal workers have a right to compensation if attacked by dogs (right) 'We now fear any amendments to the revised scheme will be purely cosmetic changes designed to help ministers avoid future political embarrassment, rather than assist the thousands of innocent victims of violent crime who rely on it as a last resort for financial recompense.' Rob Flello, Labour Shadow Justice Minister and Conservative MP John Redwood also slammed the planned cuts. Mr Redwood urged the Government to 'think again', adding: 'I did not come into Parliament to see these things cut.' The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has added its voice to those objecting to the proposals. CWU Cardiff branch secretary and Wales TUC president Amarjite Singh criticised Government plans to cut compensation claims for everything below £5000. He claims this would hit injured postal and telecom workers hard. He said: 'On average 12 postal workers are attacked every day by dogs. The attack is always dangerous but often the victims also suffer from symptoms of trauma that last long after the event itself.' 'This is yet another Government attack on the most vulnerable members of our society.' However, the Ministry of Justice, said criminals would shoulder more of the financial burden to make up the shortfall. A spokesperson said: 'We are putting more onus on criminals paying for victim support services, and expect to see around £50m more a year come from offenders as a result. The Government continues to contribute £66m a year for victims services. 'Ministers have listened carefully to the concerns raised in Parliament and are considering their next steps in light of this. 'No decision has been taken.'","Plans to cut financial aid to crime victims savaged by MPs and unions .

BBC director-general George Entwistle yesterday admitted knowing about the Newsnight Savile investigation when he ploughed ahead with eulogies showering tributes on the presenter. It came as he ordered a belated inquiry into the abuse scandal and offered an apology to Savile’s victims. He expressed ‘deep regret’ over ‘these awful allegations’ as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary. Apology: BBC director-general George Entwistle expressed 'deep regret' over 'these awful allegations' as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary . Mr Entwistle revealed he had been informed early last December about Newsnight’s investigation - which probed Savile’s alleged reign of child abuse at the BBC - in advance of screening shows celebrating the Jim’ll Fix It presenter’s life. However Mr Entwistle, being interviewed on the Today programme, claimed he had never asked what Newsnight’s investigation was actually discovering about Savile. His comments came as Lord Patten, the BBC Trust chairman, made his first public comments on the growing scandal, telling a business dinner in Cardiff it was ‘no excuse to say, “That was then” in the 1960s, 70s and 80s and attitudes were different then.’ He added: ‘It’s no excuse to say, “I’m sure the same thing used to happen with pop groups and others at the time”. Those things may be true but they don’t provide an excuse.’ He said that the BBC will carry out its own investigation ‘in a way which will have to command credibility in the wider community’ - but only once the police inquiry is completed. He added: ‘The BBC exists above all on trust and the relationship between the wider public and the BBC itself.’ Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir Jimmy Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice .

A week ago, the corporation insisted it had ‘no evidence’ of any abuse, but yesterday Mr Entwistle told Radio 4 he wanted to apologise to women victims ‘on behalf of the organisation …for what they’ve had to endure here’. Presenter Evan Davies asked him why the BBC ran a eulogy on Savile after evidence of abuse surfaced during the Newsnight inquiry.

Narrow escape: Passengers and crew managed to spot the 44-year-old in his 11m yacht 'Streaker', and he was rescued. Pictured, the yachtsman on police vessel Nemesis on his way back to shore . They managed to pinpoint where the solo yachtsman was drifting on his 36ft (11m) boat Streaker and he was rescued. Mr Ey had got into trouble after leaving Pittwater, on Sydney's northern beaches, two weeks ago. He had been heading for Eden on the New South Wales south coast, but after rough weather knocked down his mast, he was left helpless, 270 nautical miles east of Wollongong. He activated an emergency beacon early on Tuesday reporting that his boat had hit rough seas iand drifted out into the ocean. The lucky 44-year-old was located by the plane, which was heading . from Vancouver to Sydney, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authorities brought him back to Sydney harbour on police boat Nemesis - where his relieved mother was waiting to give him a hug.

'The pilots immediately determined they had sufficient fuel to undertake this, and headed out to the remote area which was over fairly rough seas,' he said. 'After apprising the customers onboard that we would assist as we were the only aircraft in the immediate vicinity, all onboard became involved in the search efforts. 'The crew borrowed binoculars from customers and also engaged those sitting on the right-hand side of the aircraft to help look.

"Lawrence Key persuaded friends to hold up signs on log flume . Proposed with her grandmother's wedding ring . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 06:12 EST, 13 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 13 September 2012 . From lip-syncing parades to signs on the subway, there are many spontaneous and romantic ways to pop surprise proposals. But one man pulled out all the stops to surprise his partner of five years by proposing on a log flume- but the unsuspecting fiance-to-be had no idea until they collected their souvenir photograph. Lawrence Key, 19, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire persuaded his friends to hold up pieces of paper spelling out ‘Will you marry me?’ with an arrow pointing to 20-year-old Sophie Stock sitting in the front of the flume. Screaming at the front of a falling log flume Sophie Sperring had no idea her boyfriend was proposing . Sophie had no idea her partner had popped the question until they climbed off the ride and collected their souvenir photo. She said friends covered her eyes as they came off the Loggers Leap ride. It meant she had no idea about the proposal until she was handed the photograph automatically taken of all logs plunging down the flume. Sophie said: 'I had no idea he was planning this. I did not even know we were going to Thorpe Park until all my friends turned up in the morning when I was still dressed in my pyjamas. 'I could not understand why Lawrence kept his jacket it on all day as it was really hot. Sophie was completely taken aback by Lawrence's proposal and was impressed by how everyone had kept it a secret . 'When we went on the ride they told me to keep facing forward, but I thought nothing of it. 'I knew something was going on when my friends covered my eyes as we came off the ride - now I know it was so I didn't see the picture on the screen. As soon as the stunned garden centre worker set eyes on the picture smitten Lawrence dropped on to one knee and pulled out his grandmother’s ring in the middle of Thorpe Park theme park. Overcome with emotion, Sophie said yes before Lawrence swept her off her feet and whisked her away to Rome for a romantic three-day city break. 'I am amazed Lawrence and our friends . managed to keep it all a secret. And I got a second surprise when . Lawrence said we were going away, but kept the destination a secret all . the way until we were about to get on the plane. 'Rome was amazing and I am really excited about getting married. It is all so much to take in.' The couple, who have been together for five years, jetted off to Rome to celebrate . Stunned Sophie had no idea Lawrence had been planning the imaginative proposal and the couple had never even discussed getting married, even though they live together. Lawrence revealed his incredible relief that Sophie said ‘yes’ - because he had been planning the proposal for two years. Bride-to-be Sophie said: 'I was really surprised when I saw the picture. I am really happy and excited to be getting married.' Sophie, who works at a home and garden store, and Lawrence, a bakery worker, met at Ralph Sadleir Middle School, Herts., and have been together for five years. The couple now plan to wed on August 21 2014, which is a poignant day as it is the seventh anniversary of the death of Sophie’s father, Grant Stock, who died from cancer aged just forty five. Lawrence got down on one knee to propose to Sophie after asking her to marry him with signs on a log flume ride . Sophie, whose grandparents also got . together when they were 15, added: 'I wanted to get married on the . anniversary of my father's death to make it a happy day too.' Sophie’s proud mother Sally Stock, 44, who helped put the plan into action, said: 'He asked my permission to marry her which I thought was very nice about a month before. 'I was quite excited about it knowing it was going to be such a surprise.' Sally, a civil servant, drove Lawrence up to Norfolk to Sophie’s grandmother Shirley’s house to collect her ring to use for the proposal. She added: 'He had it in his jacket and, even thought it was really hot, he kept it on all day because he was too scared of loosing it. 'They nearly had a row because she kept saying ""why don’t you take it off"". 'I was waiting for the phone call all day but she didn’t call untill about 3pm because I think she needed to calm down.'","Lawrence Key persuaded friends to hold up signs on log flume .

The mother of a missing prostitute killed by taxi driver Christopher Halliwell has written a letter to the jailed murderer, begging him to confess to ending her daughter’s life. In an emotional plea to the father-of-two, Karen Edwards called on him to end her torment and 'tell the truth' over what happened to Rebecca Godden, who was last seen alive by her family a decade ago. The then-20-year-old had turned to drugs and prostitution, and her remains were only found last year when Halliwell led police to her body. Scroll down for video . Karen Edwards, left, the mother of Rebecca Godden, right, has begged her daughter's murderer to confess . Christopher Halliwell confessed to the murder of the two women and even led police to their bodies . The Wiltshire taxi driver confessed to killing her after admitting murdering 22-year-old Swindon office worker Sian O’Callaghan, ending a five-day missing person investigation. But he escaped justice over the murder of Miss Godden because of a police blunder. While there was considerable evidence against Halliwell for Miss O’Callaghan’s murder - including DNA and CCTV images linking him with her death - his confession to killing Miss Godden was all police had in presenting a case against him. A High Court judge ruled that the confessions during a three-hour period on the day of his arrest were inadmissible . because Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher breached police . guidelines governing the interviewing of suspects. The senior detective, who was leading the hunt for Miss O’Callaghan, failed to caution Halliwell, 48, and denied him a solicitor. The ruling by Mrs Justice Cox meant that Wiltshire Police had no other . evidence against Halliwell to link him to Miss Godden’s murder and the . charge was withdrawn. He has refused to admit anything since. In a letter to Halliwell in jail, published in the Daily Mirror today, Mrs Edwards writes: 'My every waking moment is filled with the horrific thought of her terrifying, frightening moments as she suffered her death at your hands. 'The nightmare never ends. Please could you find it in your heart as a father to tell us the truth about my beautiful girl. 'I am begging you, please, admit Becky’s murder.' Mrs Edwards broke down at Bristol Crown Court on Friday when Halliwell was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for murdering Miss O’Callaghan as she made her way home to her boyfriend, Kevin Reape, following a night out in Swindon with friends on Friday March 18 2011.

Her body was found dumped down a steep bank in south Oxfordshire, while Miss Godden’s remains were recovered from a field in the Cotswolds. Speaking outside the court, members of Miss O’Callaghan’s family praised the work of the police, including Mr Fulcher, for finding Miss O’Callaghan’s body 'so soon' and sparing them further anxious days waiting for news. Mr Fulcher is currently suspended from the police because of allegations of 'inappropriate contact with the media'. Today, Mrs Edwards called on David Cameron to help save the career of the man who assisted in finding her daughter’s body. In a plea to the Prime Minister, also published in the Daily Mirror, she said: 'There should be more policemen like Steve Fulcher.

Jerome Kerviel, a 35-year-old unemployed Frenchman, insisted he was innocent of all the crimes carried out when he worked at Societe Generale Bank in Paris. But, following a four-week trial in June, the French capital's Appeal Court ruled that he was 'solely responsible' for unauthorised deals which sent the bank’s share price into free-fall. Going to jail: Judges have ordered rogue trader Jerome Kerviel to repay almost £4billion after one of the biggest frauds in financial history. They also upheld a three-year prison sentence that he had been given . Judges upheld an October 2010 . sentence of three years in prison with another two suspended, while . ordering Kerviel to reimburse Societe Generale for its losses. There was . no indication as to how Kerviel will pay the money back. Prosecutor . Dominique Gaillardot branded Kerviel a ‘perverse manipulator’ and had . called for a maximum five-year term as ‘an example and a deterrent’ to . others. Kerviel was charged with breach of trust, forgery and entering false data into computers to disguise the stock market deals. He had remained free, pending the result of his appeal, but is now set to begin his sentence. David .

He claimed Societe Generale turned a blind eye to his bets in late 2007 and early 2008, as long as they were making money. Kerviel said the bank also used losses to mask the threat posed by the US subprime mortgage market.

The parents of Milly Dowler have warned that people of 'ordinary means' will no longer be able to defend themselves in court as a result of the Government's plans to reform no win, no fee agreements. The Dowlers, who used the no win, no fee system to obtain a multi-million pound settlement over the hacking of the murdered schoolgirl's phone, were among signatories of a letter published in the Guardian criticising the reforms. Christopher Jefferies, the former landlord of Joanna Yeates who was defamed by a number of tabloid newspapers during her murder inquiry, also signed the letter, released today as the Government's Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill is debated in the Commons. Bob and Sally Dowler are against the Government's plans to reform no win, no fee agreements . The letter says: 'We are all ordinary citizens who found ourselves in a position of needing to obtain justice by taking or defending civil claims against powerful corporations or wealthy individuals. 'We would not have been in a position to do this without recourse to a 'no win, no fee' agreement with a lawyer willing to represent us on that basis. As was made clear to each of us at the beginning of our cases, we were liable for tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds if we lost. 'Without access to a conditional fee agreement (CFA), which protected us from this risk, we would not have been able even to embark on the legal journey.' Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke is planning to reform the no win no fee legal scheme amid fears of a compensation culture. Under the current system, claimants are not obliged to pay anything if they lose a case, providing no incentive not to sue and giving people a perverse incentive to ramp up their claims, the Ministry of Justice has said. However, under the new proposals the winning claimant's fees will be paid from the pot of damages they receive, not by the defendant. Robert Murat, the original suspect in the case of missing Madeleine McCann, is another who is against the reforms . It is hoped the move will give claimants a more vested interest in what they pay their lawyers and reduce costs in the system. Legal aid to victims of domestic violence will also be cut as part of the changes, with people only qualifying for assistance if they have reported the abuse to police. Labour MP Helen Goodman yesterday told the Commons that tens of thousands of women will 'suffer in silence' as a result, claiming that in most cases, victims only alert the authorities after 20 episodes of violence in the home. The letter, co-ordinated by media campaign Hacked Off, is also signed by Robert Murat, who sued British media organisations for libel in the wake of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, Mary-Ellen Field, Zoe Margolis, Nigel Short and Hardeep Singh. All have used CFAs to seek justice in the courts. The letter goes on to say: 'We would like to voice our dismay at the CFA reform proposals in the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders bill, which effectively remove the opportunity of people of ordinary means to seek redress when they have been libelled or intruded upon, or where they need to defend a libel claim. We do not believe this is fair or just. 'While there is a case for amending the way they function in practice, the current drafting of the bill will deny access to justice to people like us in the future. 'Tom Brake MP has tabled an amendment this week which would exclude privacy and defamation cases from the proposed CFA reforms with no extra cost to the public purse, and we call upon MPs to support that amendment and for the Government to discuss with those of us who have been through this experience how access to justice can be preserved for those who come after us.'",The Dowlers used no win no fee to gain multi-million hacking settlement from News of the World .

Rights: the judge ruled that Ms Quashie had been employed by Stringfellows and can sue the club for unfair dismissal . A former £200,000-a-year Stringfellows lap dancer won a landmark legal battle yesterday to become the first stripper to sue for unfair dismissal. Nadine Quashie, 29, claims she was wrongly fired by the Covent Garden nightclub in December 2008 over allegations of drug dealing. She had been refused permission to bring a case by a panel Central London Employment Tribunal because it decided she was self-employed. But His Honour Judge McMullen overturned that ruling today at the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Her legal triumph is set to benefit thousands of strippers and lap dancers who have until now been unable to sue even where they work long, regular hours under their club's control. The judge found that Miss Quashie was employed by Stringfellows because the club imposed contractual obligations on her. Miss Quashie, of Greenford, west London, will now seek up to £63,000 in compensation for alleged unfair dismissal when her case goes back to the original tribunal. Miss Quashie's solicitor Shah Qureshi, of law firm Bindmans, said of the landmark ruling: 'This is a victory for common sense. 'His Honour Judge McMullen considered some very important issues concerning the contractual obligations of stringfellows in relation to its dancers. Poles apart: the club owned by Peter Stringfellow has said Ms Quashie's case is based on 'lots of little lies' 'Nadine has been fighting to get her basic employment rights for many years and this is a vindication of that struggle. 'The decision is likely to impact on many dancers in the industry who, until now, have been vulnerable to exploitation through questionable practices.' The judge heard how Miss Quashie had to work set days and attend meetings at the club - or face being fined. Miss Quashie, a single mother, had to comply with the club's strict image and dress code that saw her dance topless wearing only a G-string on stage and naked in private. While working she had to be on standby ready to perform free pole dances whenever summoned by the DJ. Miss Quashie also claims she had to perform free dances for customers 'on the hour every hour' whenever the Motley Crue song 'Girls, Girls, Girls' was played. She says she could be fined £10 for each part of a song or whole song that she missed. She would earn up to £1,265 a night as wealthy customers stuffed prepaid vouchers called 'Heavenly money' into her garter. And she had to get a manager's approval for 'any agreement with a customer worth more than £300 to the dancer'. At the end of each night, the club had to give Miss Quashie cash for the vouchers she accumulated - minus its fees and commissions and any fines. Landmark case: Ms Quashie's solicitor said the ruling was good news to lap dancers who are vulnerable to exploitation by club owners . Miss Quashie was a women's rights campaigner while studying accountancy and finance at Thames Valley University. She began her legal battle against Stringfellows after she was sacked in December 2008 over drug dealing allegations that she denies. Stringfellows denies that she had to give free dances to customers and is vigorously contesting her claim of unfair dismissal. The club's barrister Caspar Glyn told the original tribunal her case was 'constructed on lots of little lies'. A panel at Central London Employment Tribunal will now hear the unfair dismissal claim at a later date.","Judge rules Nadine Quashie was employed by the club, paving the way for her case to be heard by employment tribunal ."

At 6pm tonight, Apple boss Tim Cook is set to take to the stage in a San Jose theatre to introduce Apple's latest blockbuster product - a mini tablet set to fend off competition from Amazon’s Kindle Fire and a raft of relatively cheap smaller tablet computers. The shrunken iPad is rumoured to have a screen that is 7.8inches across the diagonal – which compares to 9.7 on the original version. Tech watchers suggest the device – like the latest incarnation of the iPhone – will work on the superfast 4G mobile network that will launch next week in the UK. Is this the finished iPad Mini? a leaked photo shows the purported mini on top of a full sized iPad for comparison . The mini is thought to be 7.85in diagonally, compared to the 9.7in of the full-size iPad. This would allow it to be used easily on public transport, and fit into a (large) jacket pocket. TrustedReviews is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the iPad nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel, not a retina dispaly as seen in the latest iPhone and larger screen iPad . Interest in the new gadget has been huge - with monitoring firm Experian Hitwise saying 1 in every 6000 UK internet searches last week were for the iPad mini. Piper Jaffray technology analyst Gene Munster said in a note to investors that he expects the iPad mini to launch on 2 November. The firm believes Apple could sell 5 million iPad minis in the December quarter, but that will be at the expense of 1 million 9.7in iPads. 'For every 5 million smaller iPads, you lose 1 million standard iPads,' Munster wrote. Apple is said to be planning to charge £200 for the smaller version, which is around half the price of the cheapest iPad 3. However, it will remain considerably . more expensive than Amazon’s Kindle Fire, which costs £129, and the . higher specification Kindle Fire HD, which is £159. Amazon has suggested it is selling its tablets at a loss in order to get it into the hands of families.

Apple’s innovative phones, tablets . and computers have always come with a hefty price premium, while its . rise to become the world’s most valuable company has been fuelled by . sales through its vast iTunes store. Jason Jenkins, the editor of CNET UK, . said: ‘If the leaks are correct, we can expect Apple to announce an iPad . mini that’s more like a shrunk-down iPad 2 than an iPad 3. ‘It should have a 7.8-inch screen with . a resolution of 1024 x 768.

Mini has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best . set of pictures yet leaked on the internet. Sonny . Dickson, a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com, published the images on . his Twitter feed last week, sparking a wave of excitement among Apple . enthusiasts. The images (above and below) show . a device that is significantly smaller than the regular iPad. According . to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display, making it a rival . to Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire.

Insiders . say the iPad Mini will be announced on October 17, a few days from the . releases of Amazon's Kindle Fire and Microsoft's Surface tablets, and go . on sale November 2. As yet, however, Apple has not officially confirmed any of the reports, rumours of leaks about a smaller iPad. Apple's 9-inch device dominates the . market, but smaller, cheaper tablets have been eating away at the iPad's . popularity. Changes: This picture, leaked by the same source, compares the new connector on the iPad Mini with the old version as seen on previous versions of the iPad . The launch comes in a week of hi-tech product releases. Amazon has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated . Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time . on the 25th October. The gadgets, are available in both . 7-inch and 8.9-inch versions (although only the 7-inch version is . currently set to go o sale outside of the US). Microsoft is also launching its Surface tablets on the 26th, when Google is also believed to be revealing new tablets and software. The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per . cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing . someone else's tablet for web browsing. About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year. The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of . cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening . Apple's grip on the market. A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent. The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent. Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a . smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an . iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry. Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival. 'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.' However, . devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that . there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public . transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini' with a 7 or 8 inch screen.","Gadget believed to have a 7.85inch screen - compared to the 9.7in on the most up-to-date version of the full-size iPad .

A police officer hunting a mugger shot and killed an innocent pit bull in the back yard it was trained to protect, it was revealed today. It is the second time police have shot a dog in recent weeks, following an incident in New York when a pit bull named Star was gunned down in front of horrified shoppers. The latest victim was a four-year-old male pit bull, named Pup-pup. He was shot in the back yard of a home  in Hollywood, Florida. Four-year-old male pit bull Pup-pup was shot in the back yard of a home in Hollywood, Florida . Dog owner Antonio Williamson said: 'I just heard gunshots as I was walking back to the house.' It happened just after Williamson came outside to ask why so many police officers were parked in front of his house. They were looking for a man who had punched another man in the face and stole his bike in front of a convenience store nearby. A witness followed the suspect and called 911. Hollywood Police Sergeant Lester Cochenour told Local10.com: 'The police suspected the robber may have gone into the back yard so they entered through a side gate. 'When they got to the back yard, they were confronted by a pit bull.' Dog owner Antonio Williamson said his pet was only protecting the back yard it was taught to protect .

He said Pup-pup was a humble dog and was great with children, but was also trained to protect to his property. 'There have been a lot of break ins around here, in this area for the last year and a half or so, and I have my dog out here just for that purpose,' Mr Williamson said. Under the law, police are allowed to enter private property if they are pursuing or searching for a felony suspect. Sergeant Cochenour said: 'It is an unfortunate circumstance that the dog and the police met. 'It was not the initial call but the officer had to shoot the dog to protect himself. 'Well, you know, they apologised about it but naturally the dog was protecting its area,' Mr Williamson told Local10.com. It comes after the horrific shooting of a pit bull was shot in the head by a New York City police officer on a crowded street last month. The dog named Star was gunned down in the East Village after it lunged at police officers trying to approach the animal’s homeless owner, Lech Stankiewicz, who was apparently having a seizure. The wounded pup was taken to the Manhattan Care Center, where it has been receiving veterinary care since the August 13 incident.","Pit bull named Pup-pup died protecting the yard he was trained to guard .

The students behind an outrage-causing restroom flier boasting 'the top 10 ways to get away with rape' have been found, Ohio's Miami University said on Monday. Those responsible for posting the distressing notice two weeks ago face possible suspension, officials they said as they are taken through the college discipline process. Other, lesser punishments could include removal from residence hall and mandatory educational programs, cincinnati.com reported. None will answer to criminal charges, however, and the university is banned from naming the perpetrators under federal student privacy regulations. Anger: A flier posted in a freshman dorm at Miami University has caused outrage, as it lists the top ten ways to get away with rape .

Disturbing tips on the flier included that 'practice makes perfect. The more you rape, the better you get at it.' It . also says: 'If you're afraid that the girl will identify you, slit her . throat,' and to 'never take pictures or give your phone number to the . girl you rape.' The offending typo-filled top ten list hardly caused a stir among Miami University officials, but has some students up in arms. 'It could have been a joke, but the fact of the matter is that those thoughts are crossing someone’s mind,' said Miami University junior Kate Van Fossen, vice president of Women Against Violence and Sexual Assault (WAVE). 'There are girls living in a hall where someone came up with that. It’s just disturbing,' she told told Cincinnati.com. A resident assistant at McBride Hall found the flier over the weekend and reported it on Monday October 8, Van Fossen said. Barbara Jones, Miami’s vice president for student affairs, chose not to alert students of the incident because it didn't pose an immediate threat, the report said. 'All of our evidence shows it was confined strictly to McBride Hall,' she's quoted as saying. 'I read the flier. I was shocked. It has no place on our campus or any other campus,' she said, adding that it was 'reprehensible.'

'If I wasn’t involved with WAVE I wouldn’t have known about this incident,' Van Fossen told Cincinnati.com Friday. “The university is brushing this issue ... under the rug.' Van Fossen said university officials denied her request to send out a notice to students. She also questions whether Miami is serious about sexual assault prevention on campus -- the university’s sexual assault prevention coordinator position has been vacant for a year, she said. According to the report, a campus crime alert online indicates a recent attack involved a female student who reported being raped near a school construction site on September 23.

Wal-Mart has pulled a batch of powdered baby milk from more than 3,000 of its stores across the U.S. after a newborn boy who was given the formula died from a suspected bacterial infection. Cans of Enfamil Newborn powder have been withdrawn by the retailer even though the manufacturer claims the batch tested negative for the bacterium before being distributed. Ten-day old Avery Cornett, from Lebanon, Missouri, died on Sunday after appearing to suffer from an upset stomach. Little victim: Ten-day-old Avery Cornett from Missouri, here with his big sister Audrey, died on Sunday after taking the milk Enfamil . Hospital tests revealed he had become infected with the rare Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can grow in powdered formula. A spokesman for Wal-Mart said the company had acted 'out of an abundance of caution' while health officials investigate the death. Samples of the formula given to the baby were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for testing. 'At this point it has not been determined whether the illness is linked to the formula or an outside source,' a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said. Cautionary action: Wal-Mart decided to withdraw the product pending an investigation into Avery's death. Here is the Missouri store where Avery's formula was purchased . Public health investigators will also . look at environmental factors, such as the water used in preparing the . powdered formula, and at anything else the baby might have ingested. A spokesman for Mead Johnson Nutrition, . which produces the formula, said: 'One of the things every batch of . product is tested for is Cronobacter.

An 11-year-old boy has been banned from joining the Scouts because he does not believe in God and refuses to swear allegiance. George Pratt had attended his local Scout group for ten months before scoutmasters invited him to invest in the group. But the schoolboy, from Radstock, Somerset, refused to make the Scout Promise which includes doing one’s ‘duty to God and to the Queen’. Scroll down for video . Atheist: George Pratt, 11, will not swear allegiance to God as required in the Scout Promise. The movement is unashamed of its religious roots and allows children of other faiths to pledge allegiance . The Scouts centre in Radstock where George had been going for ten months before he was asked to invest in the Scouts . Although variations in wording are permitted for members of non-Christian religions, there is no exception made for atheists. As a result he cannot join because children of all faiths must make the promise to God if they want to become part of the organisation. Yesterday the Scout Association refused to back down. A spokesman said: ‘Faith has been an important tenet of the movement for 105 years.’ 'All young people are required to make the Scout Promise if they wish to . become a Scout. 'Variations . of the Scout Promise are available for different faiths (such as the use . of 'Allah' to replace 'God' for Muslim Scouts), however all the . variations of the promise recognise the 'Duty to God' element. 'Young . people are required to show both an understanding, relevant to their . age, and an acceptance of the promise before they become a member. 'Young . people will not be refused membership solely because of their parents’ beliefs or non-beliefs, however they are required to make the promise as . outlined above. 'Furthermore, . Scouting accepts that as they grow into independent adults, some young . people may question or doubt the existence of God as they develop their . personal spiritual understanding. 'Scouting believes that young people going through this process should be able to remain a Scout.' George says he is 'disappointed' and was look forward to going caving with the group . However, his father Nick, 45, is furious about the decision and has accused the Christian movement of being ‘intolerant’. He said: 'Christianity is meant to be about being tolerant, forgiving and understanding. 'You are allowed to join if you are a Christian or a Muslim but you can’t not believe in God. He’s being excluded because he doesn’t believe. 'I’ve brought George up to be courteous, kind and considerate. 'He’s a clever child and came to the decision himself, he doesn’t believe in God and doesn’t believe the world was was formed in seven days. 'This is George's choice and if he changes his mind in six months’ time then that is fine by me, as long as he has made an informed choice.' Refusal: Children of all faiths can join the scouts. Muslim children, for example, can swear duty to Allah . George began attending the 1st Midsomer Norton Group in Somerset - which meets in a hall opposite his house - in January. But to become a full member he must now take the Scout Promise, which reads: . 'On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people, and to keep the Scout Law.' George is sad that he cannot join but will not say the words required by all scouts who wish to become a part of the movement . Scouting was founded by Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell (1857-1941), a decorated soldier, talented artist, actor and free-thinker. His experiences during the Boer War propelled him to develop a training programme for young people in Britain. In 1907, encouraged by his friends, he held an experimental camp on Brownsea Island, Poole, Dorset, to try out his ideas. He brought together 20 boys, some from public schools and some from working class homes, and put them into camp under his leadership. The movement was born. Scouting for Boys was published in 1908 and sales of the book were enormous. What had been intended as a training aid for existing organisations became the handbook of a new and, ultimately, worldwide movement. Scouting for Boys has since been translated into many different languages and dialects. There are now around 28million Scouts worldwide . George called the decision 'very unfair' and says he is missing out on the adventures Scouts enjoy because of his atheism. He said: 'I am really disappointed about not being able to go anymore just because I don’t believe in God. 'We have spoken about it with the Scout Leader but he won’t change his decision, it is very unfair. 'My friends who are Scouts don’t think it is right, either. 'Everyone is going caving soon and I’ve never been before. It is something I would love to do but I’m not allowed. 'I’m not going to change my decision though.' The Scout Movement was founded by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907 and adventurer Bear Grylls is the UK’s current Chief Scout. The ‘Born Survivor’ star, famed for his death-defying challenges, has spoken strongly about his Christianity in the past. Mr Pratt, who lives with wife Kate, 40 and 14-year-old son Henry, is surprised that the Scouting movement is not willing to accept George. He said: 'To be invested into the Scouts you have to believe in a God but it does not say which religion that God is from. 'So you can be Muslim or Buddhist, but if you have the courage to stand up and admit that you do not believe in any God then look out because you are not welcome into the Scout community. 'George had the guts to stand up and admit his view and I believe the Scouts are being narrow-minded.'","George Pratt, 11, cannot join the Scouts because he objected to a reference to God in the traditional Scout Promise .

PC Stephen Hudson was given a nine month suspended sentence after he was found guilty of misconduct in a public office . This is the moment a police officer lost both his unblemished career and his reputation by  losing his temper with a disruptive teenage tearaway. PC Stephen Hudson bent the 15-year-old boy’s arm behind his back and lifted him off the ground after he refused to empty his pockets. CCTV captured the 6ft 1in officer – who in a 12-year career suffered injuries including a suspected fractured skull, cracked rib and broken finger while tackling criminals – slam the 4ft 8in  boy on to the counter, causing him to scream in pain. The 43-year-old then pushed his face against the teenager’s ear and shouted: ‘You are not the big man. You might think you are but you’re not.’ However the divorced father-of-three was himself arrested after the boy – described in court as a ‘local nuisance’ who had repeatedly tried officers’ patience – complained of bruising and a nosebleed. Hudson claimed to have been using an authorised police restraint technique called ‘pain compliance’ and said he himself had been assaulted by the youth. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been arrested for a breach of bail. He had been in the custody suite at Swinton police station in Greater Manchester ‘numerous times’ before and had previously kicked cell doors and refused to obey the rules, a court heard. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage from the custody suite at Swinton Police station of PC Stephen Hudson gripping the teenager . The jury heard he went 'over the top' when the boy refused to empty his pockets . He pulled the 15-year-old boy's arms behind his back three times and held him against the counter . However a jury at Bolton Crown Court found the former officer, who worked at the suite, guilty of misconduct in a public office. Hudson, who has quit his job, was given a nine-month jail term suspended for 18 months. The court heard he had been left ‘a . broken man’ facing bankruptcy, while his children had to be taken out of . school as a result of bullying over the incident. During the incident the teenager was lifted off his feet when Hudson took hold of him . Hudson has now quit his role as police constable after 12 years service after he grabbed the boy . The 15-year-old boy was so distressed he was left with a bleeding nose and bruised chest . In addition, he faces being sued by the boy’s family. But Judge Peter Davies accused . Hudson, of Westhoughton, near Bolton, of ‘besmirching’ the reputation of . a force which last  month lost two female officers in a shooting by . inflicting ‘deliberate degradation and humiliation’ on the teenager. And he branded the laughter of three . other watching officers, including a sergeant, ‘bullying of the worst . form’ and said they  ought to have been in the dock alongside Hudson. The two PCs and a custody  sergeant are now facing disciplinary action.

Almost 6,000 buildings and historic sites are at risk of being lost, English Heritage has revealed. The latest Heritage at Risk register revealed that 5,831 listed buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, battlefields, shipwrecks, places of worship, conservation areas and landscapes in England are under threat from neglect, decay and damage. The figure includes heritage sites with the highest levels of protection, Grade I and II* listing, across the country but those with the lower Grade II listing have only been included in London. A terrible loss: Grade I listed The Crescent, Buxton, High Peak, Derbyshire . At death's door: Grade II Frank James Memorial Hospital on the Isle of Wight . Curtain call: Grade II* listed Torbay Cinema in Paignton, Devon, which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose-built cinema . English Heritage also announced a . programme to assess England’s 345,000 Grade II listed buildings, funding . between nine and 15 pilot surveys with local authorities and other . groups to find out which such structures are at risk. Grade II sites already known to be at risk include an 18th century windmill in west Lancashire, an Edwardian lido for women in Reading and the dramatic front portico of a Victorian Methodist Sunday school in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. This year’s register shows that 318 Grade I and II* buildings and sites have been saved and are no longer at risk but 360 heritage structures and places have been added. With just 13 per cent of those on the list considered to be economic to repair, English Heritage’s director of heritage protection Dr Edward Impey said that in the current climate, efforts to save buildings may have to focus on 'holding' measures. Must try harder: Hill Top Sunday School in Burslem, Staffordshire is a Grade II building at risk . Lost and Foundry: Grade II Harvey's Foundry in Cornwall . Scrubs up nicely: Kings Meadow Baths in Reading, Berkshire . Boarded up: Wade Heath Pottery Works, Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, is a Grade II building at risk . Buildings could be saved with innovative schemes by people to find ways to preserve and find new use for structures, he said, adding 'there has never been a time when imagination and commitment has been more important'. Other examples of heritage at risk are Grade II* listed Torbay Cinema in Paignton, Devon, which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose-built cinema but has been vacant for 10 years. Margate’s Grade II* Dreamland rollercoaster was built in 1919-20 but was badly damaged by fire in 2008 and is on the heritage at risk list. There are plans, supported by English . Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, to breathe new life into the . Dreamland amusement park and scenic railway in the Kent seaside town, . and it is hoped the site has a future off the at-risk register. A huff and a puff could blow this down: Grade II Windmill Hills in Gateshead . Not so grand: The main stairway at the Grade II Grand Hotel in Birmingham​ (left) and Flaybrick Memorial Gardens, in Birkenhead​, Wirral . Bitter Pil: Grade II building at Pilcher Gate, Nottingham . Had its ups and downs: The Grade II-listed Scenic Railway at Dreamland, Margate, Kent, is Britain's oldest surviving rollercoaster . Britain’s first atomic bomb store on Thetford Heath, Barnham, Suffolk, a Grade II* scheduled monument, has been added to the at-risk register. From the mid-1960s onwards, the site’s watchtowers were vandalised and they and the 66 kiosks used for storing nuclear components fell into disrepair. English Heritage said it has worked with the owners to help refurbish the five watch towers and carry out restoration, but much more needs to be done. Simon Thurley, chief executive of . English Heritage, said: 'We launched a first-ever Buildings at Risk . register in 1998. We have expanded it over the years to include . archaeology, monuments, gardens, conservation areas, places of worship, . wrecks and battlefields. For whom the bell tolls: Grade II Toll House in Illminster, Somerset . Mixed fortunes: While Taylor's Bell Foundry (left) remains at risk, Grade I Kirkleatha​m Hall (right) in Redcar has recently been removed from the register . Ring the changes: Inside Taylor's Bell Foundry, Loughborough, Leicestershire . Deteriorating: Grade II sites already known to be at risk include the dramatic front portico of a Victorian Methodist Sunday school in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent . 'Now with the economic climate putting more pressure than ever on Grade II buildings, it’s time to plug the one remaining gap.' English Heritage said Grade II buildings account for 92 per cent of all listed buildings and include houses, shops, inns, offices, schools, town halls, libraries, farms and mills which make up the character of England’s towns and country. Dr Thurley said: 'Grade II buildings are the bulk of the nation’s heritage treasury. When one of them is lost, it’s as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past; something that made your street or your village special will have gone.' The number of Grade II listed buildings is not large in relation to all the buildings in England but it is too many for English Heritage to survey on its own, he said. The heritage body is funding the pilot surveys to work with local people to find out what historic buildings and sites most need scarce resources.

Town hall chiefs last night vowed to kill off David Cameron’s plan to allow large extensions in back gardens. They warned his free-for-all would encourage unsightly development and spark tension between neighbours. In a huge blow to the Coalition’s flagship housing policy, the Local Government Association said councils would not implement the plans. Blow: Town hall chiefs vowed to kill off David Cameron's plan to allow large extensions in back gardens . Homeowners can currently build a 10ft extension at a terraced property – and 13ft at a detached house – without planning consent. Mr Cameron wants these limits doubled to 20ft and 26ft for a three-year period. The move is needed to boost the economy, the Prime Minister says. But without the co-operation of town hall chiefs the policy is unlikely to be implemented. Last year councils rejected outright only 22,000 of the 200,000 applications they received. And the LGA, which represents more than 370 councils, fears that without such scrutiny these failed plans would now go ahead. ‘This policy potentially gives the green light to unsightly and out-of-place development without delivering a big enough boost to the construction industry to justify the potential damage,’ said the association’s Mike Jones. ‘The planning process works to ensure development is suitable for a local area and doesn’t unduly impact neighbours. Loosening rules around extensions would eliminate this vital mediation process in a large number of cases. The 22,000 applications which are rejected each year are knocked back for good reasons and it would be totally wrong if extensions which were previously rejected due to objections from neighbours or because they were judged to blight the neighbourhood could now sneak back in unimpeded.’ Tory-run councils in Lincolnshire and in Richmond, South-West London, have already said they will not cooperate with the new policy. Lincolnshire said a ‘rash of extensions’ could increase the risk of flooding in the low-lying county. Additions: Homeowners can currently build a 10ft extension at a terraced property - and 13ft at a detached house - without planning consent . At their party conference, the Liberal Democrat rank and file also voted against the proposals. And a YouGov poll commissioned by the Royal Institute of British Architects revealed 54 per cent believe the shake-up would lower the quality of neighbourhood design. 'This policy potentially gives the green light to unsightly and out-of-place development without delivering a big enough boost to the construction industry to justify the potential damage' Mike Jones, Local Government Association . The LGA’s intervention sets the stage for a clash between town hall chiefs and Eric Pickles. The Communities Secretary has warned that homeowners could sue councils that refuse to follow the new guidance on extensions. Ministers have said however that it will be up to each council as to whether to cooperate. The LGA’s warning is also a challenge to Mr Cameron, who repeated calls for growth-friendly planning changes in his speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham this week. The Prime Minister attacked ‘yes-but-no people’ – ‘the ones who say “yes, our businesses need to expand but no we can’t reform planning”’. Mr Jones countered: ‘We agree with the Government that stimulating the construction industry is essential to economic recovery but this proposal is not the answer. We need to tackle the housing crisis and that means freeing up lending so first-time buyers can secure mortgages and developers can borrow to build. Extensions: A YouGov poll commissioned by the Royal Institute of British Architects revealed 54 per cent believe the shake-up would lower the quality of neighbourhood design . ‘The Government should also lift tight restrictions on local authority borrowing so councils and housing associations can raise money to invest in new homes.’ Planning minister Nick Boles, who is a . Lincolnshire MP, hit back, saying: ‘The planning system needs to strike a . balance between the rights of the homeowner and their neighbours. 'The planning system needs to strike a balance between the rights of the homeowner and their neighbours' Nick Boles, Planning minister . ‘Our proposals will make it easier for thousands of hard-working families to undertake home improvements to cater for a growing family. It will also help generate new business for local construction companies and small traders.’ When the plans emerged, Ruth Dombey, the Lib Dem leader of Sutton council in South London, said: ‘These proposals are a recipe for disaster. They have not been properly thought through. ‘If this is allowed to happen it will set neighbour against neighbour and split communities for years. On top of the resentment and loss of quality of life, some people’s houses will also plummet in value if they’ve got no light or a noisy factory is within a few metres of their front door.’","Councils warned Cameron's plan would encourage unsightly development .

Primary school pupils were caught watching porn on a school trip - leading to demands for an investigation into the matter by education chiefs. Dozens of parents have withdrawn their children from classes after the youngsters watched the scenes in a dormitory on a trip to Skegness. It is claimed the girls, aged just eight, were seen watching the film by other children. Burton Joyce Primary School, in Nottinghamshire. The school is being investigated after it was revealed children as young as eight were caught watching porn on a school trip . More than 30 pupils have now been taken out of class following a string of serious complaints about teaching practices at Burton Joyce Primary School, in Nottinghamshire. The school, which caters for 308 pupils aged from four to 11, was given a 'good' status by Ofsted in it’s last inspection in March 2009. The youngsters were on a school trip when they were found in a room watching the explicit film . Angry Eric Ashworth, a governor at the school, said: 'I do not believe that child protection measures at the school have been rigorous enough. 'One of the complaints that has been made is that two girls watched porn while on a trip to Skegness. 'We are very concerned about this allegation. 'Dozens of children have been withdrawn from the school by their parents.' The trip in question took place during the Spring term. Mr Ashworth, a former teacher, also claims important decisions about the school have been taken by governing body committees - but that formal records of these meetings don’t exist. He is calling for headteacher Margaret Gretton to be suspended while an inquiry by Nottinghamshire County Council takes place. At least four governors have resigned as a result of the allegations and 'dozens' of children have been taken out of the school. Dad-of-four Christopher Green, 47, who has taken all his children - aged five, eight, nine and ten - out of the school, said: 'We didn’t want our children at that school anymore. 'It was a really bad situation that was getting worse.' Another mum, who did not want to be named, said: 'If the teachers fail to control what the pupils are viewing while in their care then they are not doing their job properly . 'My concern is that this could be just the tip of the iceberg, which is why I have taken my daughter out of the school. 'There are a lot of young, inexperienced teachers at the school who treat the job as a joke.' Councillor Philip Owen, committee chairman for children and young people’s services at the county council, said an inquiry had been launched into the way the school has been run - including the role of the headteacher. Speaking about the Skegness trip, he said complainants had spoken of 'inappropriate material' for the age of the pupils. He added: 'I am aware that allegations have been made from a variety of sources.' A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Burton Joyce Primary School’s application to become an academy has been deferred whilst the local authority completes an investigation into concerns raised by members of the local community, and we have had the opportunity to consider the outcome.' The school and its headteacher were unavailable for comment.","Youngsters were watching movie in a dorm on a field trip to Skegness .

At first glance, it appears that Man has stepped onto the surface of the red planet for the first time. In an image uncannily similar to the one created when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. However, in reality the martian 'footprint' is simply a bizarrely shaped 'scuff mark' left by Curiosity's tyre tread as the rover trundles over a ledge on the martian surface. Scroll down for video . A Curious footprint: Nasa's rover left a print on the red plant that is eerily similar to Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon . Neil Armstrong maintained for some time later that he said 'One small step for a man', the line he prepared with h rather than 'for man'. That line was what he, with the help of his wife, had prepared in advance. The rather fuzzy tapes of the event aren't clear enough to be sure, although the 'a' does appear to be missing. In more recent years, after listening again to the recording, Armstrong has acknowledged that he may have fluffed his line. However, more recently still, analysis of the tape indicates that the 'a' may have be present on the recording but is too indistinct to hear. Looking very similar to the iconic first footprint on the Moon from the Apollo 11 landing, this new raw image from the Curiosity rover on Mars shows one of the first 'scuff' marks from the rover’s wheels on a small sandy ridge. This image was taken by Curiosity’s right Navcam on Sol 57 (2012-10-03 19:08:27 UTC). Nasa refers to each Martian day as a sol - with staff on the mission working to Martian time. However, Neil Armstrong's incredible footprint is set to remain on the lunar surface for a long time - Nasa says the first footprints on the Moon will be there for a million years, since there is no wind to blow them away. Research on the tracks left by Spirit and Curiosity revealed the time scale for track erasure by wind is typically only one Martian year or two Earth years - so the Martian footprint will be long gone by the time a true footprint is left on the Martian surface. The image was produced as Nasa revealed the rover has been using the Foursquare service to 'check in' from Mars. Curiosity will continue to check in . at various locations throughout its Gale Crater landing site, posting . photos and tips as it rolls along, NASA officials said. 'NASA is using Foursquare as a tool . to share the rover's new locations while exploring Mars,' David Weaver, . associate administrator for communications at NASA Headquarters, said in . a statement. 'This will help to involve the public with the mission and give them a sense of the rover's travels through Gale Crater.' Foursquare users will be able to earn . a Curiosity-themed badge by checking in at museums, laboratories and . other locations that generate an interest in science, engineering and . technology, NASA officials said. The badge will become available later this year. The $2.5 billion Mars rover Curiosity . landed on Aug. 5 with the aim of determining if the Gale area could . ever have supported microbial life. The six-wheeled robot is about two . months into its planned two-year mission. One of the footprints left on the lunar surface by Neil Armstrong . While Curiosity is currently cruising toward a site called Glenelg, its main destination is the base of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the Martian sky from Gale's center. Mars-orbiting spacecraft have detected evidence that Mount Sharp's foothills were exposed to liquid water long ago. NASA has been on Foursquare since 2010, when astronaut Doug Wheelock made the first-ever check-in from the International Space Station. The Foursquare community numbers more than 25 million users, who have made more than 2.5 billion check-ins since the free app was introduced in March 2009, according to the Foursquare website.

A top barrister's career was under threat today after she was convicted of assault for grabbing her misbehaving daughter's hair. The woman, 47, snapped after the 11-year-old started hitting her and trashing their home during a row over a sleepover, Burnley Magistrates' Court heard. The youngster had earlier rung the police because she was furious at not being given money for a taxi to a friend’s house. Lashing out: The 47-year-old snapped after the schoolgirl threw ironed washing down the stairs, slammed the door and hit her repeatedly with a jacket, Burnley Magistrates Court heard . After officers came to the family home and told the girl off for the call, she began throwing clean and ironed washing down the stairs and repeatedly hitting her mother in the face with a jacket. The unruly schoolgirl then slammed the lounge door so heavily that a chair smashed into a wall and knocked over a shelf, spilling DVDs and ornaments onto the floor. The lawyer, who has been both a prosecution and defence barrister for 17 years, eventually lost her temper. She lunged forward from her own chair and grabbed the child’s shoulder-length hair, accidentally ripping out some strands, which were caught by her costume jewellery ring. Today the barrister - who cannot be named for legal reasons, to protect the identity of the child - was facing a disciplinary hearing before the Bar Council after she admitted assault at the Lancashire court. She sobbed as she was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 costs. Her counsel Mr Sephton Lee told the court that it was the barrister's birthday on the night of the assault earlier this month. Turning to the law: Police had come to the house earlier after the girl called them when her mother would not give her money for a taxi (file picture) Mr Lee told the court: 'She had no plans to go out and celebrate. She had been drinking and perhaps it is fair to say that during the course of the evening, she drank a bit too much.' He said the daughter had 'a bit of a tantrum' after returning from a friend's house and was demanding to be given money to go back there by taxi. When she didn’t get any cash, the girl secretly rang the police. Officers arrived and spoke to the mother and daughter before admonishing the daughter for calling them. Mr Lee added: 'Police clearly had no concerns about the daughter’s welfare or the mother’s level of intoxication before they left.' The solicitor said the girl continued to misbehave until the mother got out of her chair to stop her. Job in jeopardy: The lawyer will now have to account for her actions in front of the Bar Council in London (file picture) He said: 'It's against all this . background, she accepts she lunged forward towards her daughter and she . accepts she grabbed her daughter’s shoulder-length hair. 'It . would appear she has pulled some hair from her daughter’s scalp. It’s . believed a costume jewellery ring which she has on her finger caught on . her daughter’s hair, causing hair to get caught up in the ring and that . was how the injury has occurred.' 'This was not a deliberate, intentional, . malicious assault on her daughter. The mother was arrested, taken to . the police station and interviewed and during the course of that . interview, she expressed deep remorse and regret and she has asked me to . apologise unreservedly to the court today.'She is well respected by her fellow practitioners and the judiciary. 'There is no suggestion whatsoever that she is an unfit mother, quite the reverse. This is a tragedy for everybody, certainly for the girl and her mother. 'This is an isolated incident, when a loving, caring mother pulled her daughter’s hair in circumstances where, we would say, her daughter was behaving badly.' The court heard that the lawyer had informed the Bar Council about what had happened. Her law chambers continue to support her and she will be travelling to London in the near future to account for her actions before the Bar Council. Mr Lee said : 'The Bar Council will no doubt take a dim view of this matter and her ability to earn a living as a barrister may well be in jeopardy. This has been a very difficult case for the mother. These proceedings and the conviction today are significant punishment.' Passing sentence, District Judge Nicholas Sanders told the woman: 'This is a tragic case on many levels.'","Child threw ironed washing down the stairs and repeatedly hit mother in face with jacket .

Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins is slashing his tax bill by using an offshore scheme branded ‘abusive’ and ‘artificial’ by the Treasury. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the seven-time Olympic medallist, hot favourite for 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax. The 32-year-old cycling hero who climbed to the top of his sport partly thanks to Lottery funding, earned an estimated £5 million this year. He has joined a complex tax-avoidance partnership, Twofold First Services, which takes advantage of farming tax reliefs. But the Treasury has taken action to close the loophole and the taxman last night pledged to ‘investigate and challenge’ any arrangements put in place before the change in the law. Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership  Management, based in the Cayman Islands tax haven. But the firm believed to have set it up, York-based Tax Trade Advisors, is also linked to NT (‘No Tax’) Advisors, the firm criticised for similar schemes involving comedian Jimmy Carr and Coronation Street star Bill Roache. Roache is also a member of Twofold, along with Wiggins and 230 other rich investors. How much  Wiggins invested is not clear, but his spokesman insisted it involved only a ‘small percentage’ of his income and the ‘vast majority’ of his earnings were taxed at the higher rate of 50 per cent. Sources say the cyclist paid more than £1 million in tax last year. Companies House records show Wiggins joined Twofold on March 13 this year. On the same day, the Treasury issued a strongly-worded press release referring to an ‘abusive’ tax avoidance scheme’ without naming it. Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said it had shut down a ‘contrived’ scheme being marketed at the time, and that it would challenge any  others put together before March 13. ‘The scheme  .  .  .  used artificial transactions to generate tax relief from a property business that owns agricultural land,’ said the Treasury at the time. Involved: Actor Bill Roache, posing for a snap with his partner Emma Jesson . Taken for a ride? The seven-time Olympic medallist has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax . ‘Although the land itself and the . business owning it will exist, the transactions are not part of any . genuine agricultural business. They are generated only to create an . artificial loss that can be set off by users  .  .  .  to reduce their . tax bill.’ In a . Twofold-type scheme, an individual could end up paying no tax at all, by . investing around £100,000 yet claiming tax relief on £1 million. This is achieved as each £100,000 is supplemented by a £900,000 loan taken out by the partnership. That money, after being paid to the farmer, is swiftly repaid to the bank. The accountants find a way to artificially ‘write down’ the investment to become a loss on paper, even though there was no cash loss. The original £100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees, but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £1 million, which they set against their income. Tax haven: Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership Management, based in the Cayman Islands (pictured) Last night an HMRC spokesman, referring to the unnamed March 13 scheme, said: ‘HMRC reacted very quickly when this scheme was disclosed and Ministers announced a change to the legislation within days. 'This protected the Exchequer by shutting down a scheme that was being marketed at that time. HMRC will challenge any schemes of this type which were implemented before the announcement.’ A spokesman for Wiggins said: ‘The vast majority of Bradley’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate. The investment in Twofold Services involves only a small percentage of Bradley’s income. Bradley has paid, and will continue to pay, his fair share of tax.’ Roache and NT Advisors declined to comment.

The high street retailer's new 'appearance policy' also outlaws footwear like flip flops as they try to impose rules to make workers look more professional. HMV want to move away from the scruffy stereotype of record shop workers, so only 'discreet' body art or piercings can be on show from next Friday. 'If someone does have extensive body art - whether in store or at head office, we would expect them to cover this up whilst working,' a company spokesman said. Changes: HMV staff will have to cover tattoos up and men will have to cut their hair under new rules . 'More discreet tattoos and piercings are not an issue so long as people look smart. It goes without saying that we want our work colleagues to feel valued as individuals who can express their personalities, but it's also important that we balance this against the needs and expectations of our customers, who, ultimately, have to be at the heart of everything we do. 'We'd like to think our colleagues are presentable anyway, so this is just about adopting a more consistent approach, which we believe our customers will appreciate.' However, this new image has not been conveyed on its website yet, where a member of staff is shown with lots of tattoos and a large piercing in their face. Police recruits to Britain's largest police . force - The Met -  were banned last month from having visible tattoos in a sweeping . reform of its public image.

The ban comes amid increasing concern among senior ranks . nationwide over complaints from crime victims that some young officers . appear 'thuggish'. They are particularly worried about the trend for tattoo 'sleeves' in which wrap-around tattoos are inked along the arm. But . rank-and-file representatives claim associating tattoos with criminals . is old-fashioned and police should reflect the public they serve.

I’m just so relieved Blake pulled through.’ Doctors considered Ms O’Donnell and her unborn baby in the high-risk category and tests revealed that the unborn baby was pushing down on her right kidney. Ms O’Donnell had to have surgery but afterwards she contracted a water infection which brought on early labour. High-risk: With her stomach muscles too tight, her unborn baby pushed against her kidney and so he was delivered by emergency caesarean section 10 weeks premature . She said: ‘My stomach muscles were too tight and they had been pushing Blake onto my kidney. ‘Doctors warned there were risks to me and the baby from the anaesthetic, but we had no option. ‘I just started getting contractions one day and I knew he was coming early.’ Ms O’Donnell had gained seven stone while pregnant with first child Shannon, now 10, but lost the weight through healthy eating and exercise over six months. Her weight continued to fluctuate as she later gave birth to son Malachy, now seven, Felicity, now four, and Harvey, three. Warn of dangers: Ms O'Donnell (pictured with Malachy, Harvey, Blake and Felicity) wants to warn mothers of the dangers of having surgery if there is a chance they will have children afterward . She and her former partner decided against more children and in 2009 she travelled to Prague for the tummy tuck operation. Ms O’Donnell said: ‘Putting on seven stone left me with this massive flap of skin, and because I was so young I didn’t really want that. ‘It was disgusting to look at, and I kept getting infections because there was so much excess skin. ‘The tummy tuck gave me a washboard stomach again.’ After four children (including Harvey, Malachy and Felicity pictured), Ms O'Donnell said 'the tummy tuck gave me a washboard stomach again' but contractions with Blake (who Ms O'Donnell is holding) felt like 'stitches from the tummy tuck coming apart' Tiny Blake spent four weeks on the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, Wrexham. To repay hospital staff for their efforts, Ms O’Donnell, who has been a part-time promotional model for 10 years, has created a calendar with the proceeds to be donated to SCBU. She said: ‘The staff there were amazing, and I can’t thank them enough. ‘Blake might not have made it without them. This is my way of repaying them.’ Go to www.missyo.co.uk to purchase a copy of the calendar for £12.

It is widely considered to be the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution and a proud testament to a time when Britain led the way in new technology and engineering. And now the Ironbridge Gorge, which has been under threat from landslides for the last few years, will still be around for generations to come after being awarded a multimillion-pound grant. The World Heritage site consists of 18th century iron works, huge kilns and even a Victorian town surrounded by the natural beauty of the Shropshire landscape. Scroll down for video . The 'cradle' of the industrial revolution: The government will today announce a £12m grant to protect the Ironbridge Gorge . Contrasting: The World Heritage Site near Telford and Wrekin is surrounded by the stunning natural beauty of the Shropshire hills . The gorge has been dubbed the 'cradle of the Industrial Revolution' by many historians and described by writer Charles Hulbert in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world'. According to the Daily Telegraph, communities secretary Eric Pickles will today announce a £12million grant to 'preserve Ironbridge Gorge’s place in history as one of the world’s great symbols and a site of outstanding beauty for generations to come'. Historical: Writer Charles Hulbert described the Ironbridge Gorge in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world' Mr Pickles will say later today: 'It is vital that we do not let places like Ironbridge Gorge deteriorate or slide out of sight. 'The picturesque 18th century Ironbridge Gorge stands as a monument to modernity and the industrial revolution - a testament to British ingenuity and ambition that has been universally protected as a World Heritage Site for all to marvel at.' The money will be spent on protecting the various monuments in the gorge and to repair cracking to the bridge caused by the constantly shifting river banks. The bridge - the first iron bridge of its kind in the world - has required significant maintenance since it was first built in 1779. The location of the bridge was chosen because East Shropshire was an important industrial area because of the huge coal deposits near the surface. The Ironbridge Gorge was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance. The Gorge and its ten museums spread along the valley by the River Severn attract 500,000 visitors every year bringing £20million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.

Two-year-old Siann Parkinson was doing barrel rolls down a grassy slope when she landed on the discarded hypodermic syringe. The needle pierced Siann’s right thigh, causing the youngster to scream out. By the time mum Annabel, 25, turned round, Siann had pulled the syringe out and was holding it with blood splattered on her trousers. Anxious wait: Annabel Parkinson will have to wait for up to two months to learn if her daughter Siann has contracted HIV . Horrified Miss Parkinson, a hairdresser, rushed the youngster to hospital and Siann was given a Hepatitis B injection and blood tests. They now face a distressing two-month wait until Siann can have more blood tests and injections to see if she has caught HIV from the needle.

'Siann had a Hepatitis B injection and a blood test but we were told we would have to come back in June and July to have more injections and blood tests. 'It’s only when they can compare the three blood tests that they can say for definite whether Siann has contracted HIV. 'It will feel like an eternity before I know for certain whether Siann is okay. 'The risk that she has been infected with HIV is small but it’s like there is a big, black cloud hanging over us. 'I’ve lived here all my life, the park is on our doorstep but there’s no way I will ever take her back there.

'Appalling state of neglect': Police and child protection officers described the mother-of-two's house as the dirtiest they had ever seen . A cruel mother who left her children to live in a squalid house filled with piles of rotting waste, dog mess, and even dead animals while she went out drinking has been jailed for two years. The remains of a dead dog and a dead parrot still in its cage were discovered along with piles of mouldy food and filthy clothes by police and child protection officers who called to the house in Hull, which they described as the dirtiest they had ever seen. The pets had starved to death after the woman failed to feed them, but she refused to dispose of their bodies, Hull Crown Court heard today. Officers discovered four empty bottles of vodka in the kitchen of the 33-year-old barmaid's home - which she shared with her 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter - along with a lone lettuce and a cucumber. They also reported an inch of water covering the floor of one room and filthy carpets in others. The court was told the barmaid's children - who could not recall ever seeing their mother use the cooker and said they lived on takeaways - were left unclean and provided with no fresh clothes, while their mother spent her money on nights out, alcohol, and new outfits for herself. Her son said his mother used his older sister as her 'child-minding slave'. When arrested she told police she had no money, but was later found to have £400 in cash. Handing the mother a two year prison sentence, Judge Simon Jack said he had never seen a home in such an 'appalling' state of neglect. 'In all the time I have been dealing with cases of this kind I have never seen pictures as bad as this which show the state of neglect in your home,' he said. 'It was appalling.' Squalor: Inspectors who called to the filthy house in Hull discovered remains of a pet parrot that had starved to death . Neglect: The barmaid left her 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to fend for themselves amid the piles of mess . The mother-of-two chose spent her money on going out drinking rather than running her house and caring for her children, the court heard . The judge said that, unlike many cases of neglect he has dealt with which involve parents with 'low mental ability', the mother-of-two was 'perfectly capable' of running a home and holding down a job. 'You chose to prioritise your own job and social life going out drinking rather than the welfare of your own children,' he said. 'The effects on the children can be very serious indeed. The message it sends to children is they are not worth looking after.' Crown barrister Mark Kendal told the court the house in Hull had no hot running water, a sink filled with greasy, dirty pots, and a freezer that was taped shut. There were bags of rubbish dumped all over the house and the stairs, one child's bedroom and the landing had no carpet, just bare floorboards. 'Disgusting': The greasy sink was filled with dirty dishes and cutlery . Inspectors had to pick their way around mounds of rotting waste and mouldy food . The house contained no fresh food apart from a lone lettuce and a cucumber - but police found four empty vodka bottles in the kitchen . The barmaid was jailed for two years at Hull Crown Court today . 'The children could not remember when their mother last used the cooker or microwave,' Mr Kendal said. 'One of the children told the police he was hungry as all he had to eat at midday was a bacon sandwich bought from a shop. 'The environmental health team who visited the house to evict her described it as in a disgusting state. They said it was the worst premises they had ever been in.' RSPCA officers also attended the house to recover the animals. The unidentified woman was sentenced at Hull Crown Court today after pleading guilty to two charges of child cruelty by neglect at an earlier hearing. She was also given a 12-month suspended prison sentence at Hull Magistrates Court after being charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty. The 33-year-old has been banned from owning animals for life.Defence barrister John Thackray said: 'I have to concede this was a disgraceful incident of neglect.' He said the woman was suffering from depression following the breakdown of her relationship and alluded to 'matters in her own childhood'. But he added: 'These are not excuses...She buried her head in the sand.'","Barmaid, 33, left her son and daughter alone amid piles of festering waste, mouldy food, and the remains of dead animals at their home in Hull .

Masaki Kitamura suffered a terrifying ordeal after Japanese police arrested him for posting death threats from his computer. The chilling postings and emails, which were traced to Mr Kitamura’s computer, threatened mass murder in Osaka and claimed there was a bomb on a Japan Airlines flight to New York. But weeks after the animation director was arrested and charged, despite protesting his innocence, police realised Mr Kitamura was a victim of a ‘zombie’ computer hacker, according to The Times. Threats: An unidentified hacker sent emails and postings threatening to bomb a Japan Airlines flight and attack the city of Osaka from Masaki Kitamura's computer . His computer had been taken over by an unidentified hacker who proceeded to send threatening emails and postings online. In August, just days before the threats began to appear, Mr Kitamura had downloaded some free software from the internet. Two days later, a posting appeared on a bulletin board with a threat to drive a truck into pedestrians in Osaka and then attack them with a knife. Tasteless: Another threat said an attack would occur at the school attended by Prince Hisahito, centre, the six-year-old grandson of Emperor Akihito . Three days after the first threat was posted, a plane was forced to return to Tokyo after a threat had been emailed claiming a bomb was on board the aircraft as it travelled to New York. The police traced the threats through Internet Protocol (IP) to Mr Kitamura’s computer and promptly arrested him. The authorities were also investigating more threats in Mie Prefecture, where someone had posted online that they would attack workers at video game manufacturer Nintendo and people visiting the Ise Grand Shrine. Again the police traced the IP address and arrested the owner of the computer who, like Mr Kitamura, protested his innocence. Investigators discovered signs that his computer was infected with a Trojan horse virus after they inspected the machine. Further threats were made to bomb a school attended by Emperor Akihito’s six-year-old grandson, Prince Hisahito. A man in Fukuoka was arrested and confessed because he believed his girlfriend had posted the message and he wanted to protect her. The unknown perpetrator appears to be revelling in the police’s failure to apprehend the hacker, and yesterday a Japanese newspaper printed extracts of a gloating email he had sent. The email listed the names of 12 people whose computers had been hacked, before concluding: ‘Thank you for playing with me. Let’s play again.’ Threats: The individual falsely claimed there was a bomb on a Japan Airlines flight to New York, causing the plane to return to Tokyo (File photo) ‘Zombie’ hackers take control of other computers by implanting a daemon, often by tricking the computer owner to download some software online. The hacker can then send commands to the infected computer from other locations. Computer hacking has enabled a range of criminal and mischievous activity worldwide. As well as the postings of death threats or abusive comments, hackers have been known to steal money and people's identities, and in other cases hackers will promote a political agenda. The group Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group have taken responsibility for attacks on the Pentagon, News Corp and threatened to destroy social networking site Facebook in the past. Most recently though, they named a man allegedly responsible for the suicide of 15-year-old Canadian girl, Amanda Todd, in a vigilante move. Other hackers work while on the move and log on to people's internet connections from outside their homes to gain access to private information or download illegal material from another IP address. Other online fraudsters hack email accounts, and send messages asking for financial help. Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying of Amanda Todd, 15, who was found hanged, was a 32-year-old man from British Columbia . Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday . In one such incident in 2009, former Justice Minister Jack Straw was targeted by Nigerian fraudsters. They logged on to the MP's email account and sent more than 200 emails asking for money, claiming Mr Straw had lost his wallet while doing charity work in Africa. Briton Gary McKinnon yesterday avoided extradition to the U.S. after Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the move. He allegedly hacked Pentagon computers from his home in north London and has battled against extradition to face trial in the U.S. for more than ten years. Mrs May blocked the move on health grounds.","Masaki Kitamura wrongly arrested for threatening mass murder in Osaka, Japan .

A spokesman for the MP claimed last . night that the pair’s smear campaign included encouraging the Guardian . newspaper to run a lengthy piece claiming Respect was involved in . political thuggery in Bradford West, where 58-year-old Mr Galloway won a . shock by-election victory over Labour in March. It was claimed that the couple slept at the MP’s house in Streatham, south London, while he was away in Indonesia. As well as making a formal complaint . to the police, the MP has tabled a motion in Parliament calling on the . Home Secretary to make a statement on the issue. Mr Galloway said he felt ‘violated’ by the events, and called for the officer to be sacked. 'It could not look worse than that a . person whose job is essentially to police Britain’s Muslim community . could have been coming and going, sleeping in my house when I was away, . when I am the MP for tens of thousands of Muslims and heavily involved . in issues that vitally affect the Muslim community,' he said. George Galloway, pictured with wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, claimed the Met officer had sex with his aide in his house while he was abroad . 'If he could not see that then he is too stupid to be a detective inspector in SO15. It is not enough for me that he has been placed on restrictive duties, which means counting pencils. He should be suspended.' Mr Galloway’s spokesman and associate for the last 36 years, Ron McKay, said: 'Aisha Ali Khan had become George’s aide after turning up at the Respect headquarters in Bradford before his election campaign. I think she used to be a teacher. 'There was some concern that she had been involved with the Labour Party. She worked for George in Bradford and in London – and while he was away in Indonesia in June he gave her the keys to his house in Streatham. 'A short while after George came back there was a break-in at his house when he, his wife and Aisha were in, and the burglars made off with a parliamentary computer. 'Local police were investigating – but it was then that Aisha introduced Afiz Khan to George as a police officer and security expert who could help him beef up his home security. 'It transpired a few hours later that Insp Khan had declared to the cops investigating the burglary that they would find his fingerprints in the house because he had been sleeping in the house with Aisha while George was away. 'That was George’s rude introduction to what had been going on. Scotland Yard said the officer has been placed on restricted duties pending an investigation by the Directorate of Professional Standards . 'Since then George has been given incontrovertible evidence from emails that Insp Khan had been using his Met police email account and two fictitious accounts to communicate with her and use her as his agent to indulge in a dirty tricks campaign. 'We also found Aisha was the instigator of a Guardian story criticising Respect. We’ve got the emails between her and the Guardian and between her and Afiz. One email from his police account claims there was electoral fraud in George’s by-election. 'It’s clear he was keeping a close eye on George in his constituency.' Mr Galloway’s team supplied a picture said to show the couple together. Miss Khan refused to comment on the allegations against her, while Det Insp Khan could not be contacted. Former Labour MP Mr Galloway is renowned for courting controversy over a long and flamboyant political career. Days after his by-election victory in Bradford, he took a fourth wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, who is 30 years his junior. Only two months ago he was criticised for taking £80,000 a year from a TV station linked to Syria and Iran, and for using the insulting term ‘window licker’ against a disabled person on Twitter. In his Parliamentary motion, he complains about 'the involvement of a very senior officer in SO15 in an apparent dirty tricks operation against the Hon Member for Bradford West'. He claims: 'The officer, Afiz Khan, entered the Hon Member’s London home without his knowledge or consent, the Hon Member  never having met or heard of him, and he slept in the Hon Member’s home.' And he adds: 'Afiz Khan sent emails to an individual in the Hon Member’s office who acted as his agent and co-ordinated this operation from his police email account and from at least two other fake email accounts, duping, amongst others, the Guardian newspaper as to his true identity.' The MP’s motion also alleges that Det Insp Khan used an alias to attack him on Facebook and elsewhere, 'all the while concealing that he was a senior serving police officer at Scotland Yard'.","Respect MP claims the pair had sex in his home while he was abroad .

"By . Neil Moxley . PUBLISHED: . 02:47 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:00 EST, 23 October 2012 . A football hooligan who ran onto the pitch and attacked a goalkeeper in front of television cameras and a packed stadium has been jailed for four months. Aaron Cawley, 21, from Cheltenham, pleaded guilty to assault and invading the pitch after he shoved Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland to the ground in a shocking display during a match against Leeds United at Hillsborough Stadium on Friday night. Unemployed labourer Cawley told police he had been too drunk to remember the incident, after downing cans of lager and three quarters of a litre of vodka before he arrived at the match, Sheffield Magistrates' Court heard. Scroll down to watch the video . Disgrace: Unemployed Aaron Cawley caught Sheffield Wednesday keeper Chris Kirkland flush in the face in a sickening assault fuelled by incredible amounts of booze . Disgrace: Thousands of football fans witnessed the shocking attack on Friday night, which was seen on live TV . Kirkland, who has played for England, was shoved to the ground moments after conceding an equaliser in the 76th minute. Cawley was clearly seen running on to the pitch and pushing the keeper in the face before running back into the crowd. Stunned goalkeeper Kirkland fell to the ground after the attack and was attended to by medics. The shocking scenes were caught on camera by Sky Sports which was broadcasting the derby game. Cawley wore a blue T-shirt at today's hearing, exposing an 'LUFC' tattoo on his neck and a Leeds United club crest on his right arm. Sheffield Magistrates Court heard the 21-year-old had been the subject of two football banning orders in the past, which he had breached four times. Despite living with his mother in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, he had supported Leeds United all his life and went to every game - home and away, a district judge was told. Prosecutor Paul Macaulay said Cawley told police he was so drunk he could not remember the incident, which has been seen by millions of TV viewers. Mr Macaulay said Cawley told officers he had drunk a number of cans of Stella Artois lager on Friday morning, followed by three-quarters of a litre of vodka - all before he arrived in Sheffield by train. Once in Sheffield, he had a further seven to 10 pints of cider, the court heard. District Judge Naomi Redhouse heard that Cawley, of Blenheim Square, Cheltenham, only realised what he had done when other people told him and then he saw himself clearly on TV. He emailed the police to say sorry and also emailed Sky Sports in the hope that his apology would be passed on to the two clubs and Kirkland. Pain: Shocked keeper Chris Kirkland fell to the ground after taking the surprise knock to the face . His solicitor Elizabeth Anderton asked the district judge to accept that her client pushed Kirkland rather than slapped him. She said Cawley had shown a 'great deal of regret and remorse'. 'It's certainly not something he would ordinarily do,' she said, adding that, as well as drinking a huge amount of alcohol, her client had not eaten before the match. 'He was absolutely disgusted by his own behaviour,' she said. But District Judge Redhouse said she had no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence. She said a huge effort had been made to tackle hooliganism in football and 'make football an event where there's no violence and where families are happy to attend with children'. The judge said footballers were at matches as part of their employment and that everyone has the right to be 'protected from being assaulted by a stranger' at work. She also noted that, while she had heard all the evidence about how much Cawley had to drink, she did not see any evidence of his drunkenness on the TV footage she had been shown. Later, Cawley returned to court where he was formally given a six-year football banning order. One of the conditions is for him to stay at least a mile away from football stadiums where Leeds United are playing on match days. He was handcuffed before being led from the dock. Named: Aaron Cawley, seen posing outside the Leeds United ground, pleaded guilty to assault at Sheffield Magistrates' Court today . Trouble: Aaron Cawley had already been banned from entering any football ground in Britain . Cawley was barred from all football matches for five years at the age of 16 . after being caught at the centre of a 200-strong riot at the team's . Elland Road ground. Magistrates subsequently extended the ban to the end of 2013 after the thug repeatedly breached the order. Former England keeper Ben Foster fears a player could one day be confronted by a knife-wielding thug on the pitch. The West Bromwich goalkeeper said: . ‘The guy who interrupted the Boat Race got six months. Why can’t someone . who runs on to the pitch and slaps Chris in the face get at least that? ‘If someone has got it into their . head that they are going to run on to the pitch with the aim of hurting a . player, they will do it — regardless of how many stewards there are. ‘It’s impossible to put a steward . along every metre. You have to trust the fans to behave themselves. I . was watching it and it made me feel sick. 'I wish Chris had  flattened him. I wish he had fronted him up and given him a boot up the a***. But Chris isn’t expecting it. 'He’s been smacked in the face and . didn’t have a clue what was about to happen to him. That lad could have . had a blade. It’s ridiculous if you think of it like that. To be quite . honest, it’s scary.’ Wednesday manager Dave Jones has called on fans to ‘police their own’ in the wake of the attack. Jones, the subject of foul-mouthed . chanting from Leeds fans, told 5 Live’s Sportsweek: ‘It’s a football . match and we’re looking at blaming police and stewards because they’re . not there. He was a hero, he ran in the crowd, they were slapping him on . the back, so what do you do about that? It’s not one person. ‘In this country we seem to end up . going with the minority all the time and it’s going to take the majority . to sort it out. You’ve got to police your own clubs. ‘The people who go to the games who . are disgusted — and it’s going to be hard — they are the ones who should . walk out and isolate or point out the  people there who are doing it. ‘Neil Warnock said I was upset . because I didn’t win the game but Neil must be deaf and blind because . there wasn’t just one person chanting vile stuff.’ Leeds boss Warnock believes the law should make a stand to prevent these incidents from happening. 'Every club has got these fans and . it’s got to start at the very top,’ he said. ‘We know the lad who . assaulted him and he’s got to go through the courts and they’ve got to . make it detrimental. ‘It’s all right saying, “Go in and . get them out”, but you’ve got to be there. It’s frightening for stewards . — I wouldn’t want to be a steward.’","Television cameras captured the man creeping up behind Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland and shoving him to the ground .

"PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:31 EST, 16 October 2012 . Amateur astronomers have discovered a new planet that not only orbits two suns but is simultaneously being orbited by two other suns. The incredible four sun solar system, the first of its kind ever discovered, was found as part of the Planet Hunters project led by a team from Yale University. Amateur enthusiasts work alongside professional scientists to analyse data collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope and find evidence of new worlds . The planet, called PH1, a gas giant slightly bigger than Neptune, has being likened to Tatooine, the fictional two-sun planet and childhood home of Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars films. Deep space discovery: An artist's illustration of PH1, orbiting its two 'parent' suns with its other two suns far off in the distance . The Planet Hunters project is a citizen science project run by Yale University and the Zooniverse web site. Participants help sieve through data taken by the NASA Kepler space mission. These data consist of brightness measurements, or ""light curves,"" taken every thirty minutes for more than 150,000 stars. Users search for possible transit events, which appear as a brief dip in brightness that occurs when a planet passes in front of the star, with the goal of discovering a planet - hence the name 'Planet Hunters'. For more information click here. But while Tattoine is a circumbinary planet, the likes of which have been known to scientists for some time, PH1 takes things even further with an extra two suns orbiting the entire set-up. It means if someone were able to stand on PH1, they would be able to see a double sunset as well as two extremely bright stars far off in the night sky. The quadruple star system, roughly 3,200 light-years from Earth, has been named KIC 4862625. 'It's fascinating to try and imagine what it would be like to visit a planet with four Suns in its sky, but this new world is confusing astronomers - it's not at all clear how it formed in such a busy environment,’ said Dr Chris Lintott, of Oxford University, one of the Planethunters.org team. Debra Fischer, a professor of astronomy at Yale, and one of the founders of the Planet Hunters project said: 'This unique system might have been entirely missed if not for the sharp eyes of the public.' PH1 was discovered by Planet Hunter volunteers, Kian Jek of San . Francisco, Calif., and Robert Gagliano of Cottonwood, Ariz., who were . using the transit method. This involves noticing faint dips in light as the planet passed in front of, or transited, its parent stars. Mr Gagliano said he was 'absolutely ecstatic' about the finding . adding: 'It's a great honor to be a Planet Hunter, citizen scientist, . and work hand in hand with professional astronomers, making a real . contribution to science.' The newly discovered PH1 planet is depicted in this artist's rendition transiting the larger of the two eclipsing stars it orbits. In the distance are a second pair of stars bound to the planetary system. Mr Jek said in a statement: 'It still continues to astonish me how we . can detect, let alone glean so much information, about another planet . thousands of light-years away just by studying the light from its parent . star.' After being discovered through planet hunters, PH1's existence has been confirmed by a team of professional astronomers, who present their findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Reno, Nev. PH1 is roughly 6.2 times the size of Earth. It spends 138 days completing a single orbit around its two suns, one of which is 1.5 times the size and the other 0.41 the size of Earth's sun. Those two suns circle one another every 20 days. The two other suns orbit PH1's twin suns at a distance of roughly 93,000,000,000 miles -  1,000 times that between the Earth and the sun. Science fiction: PH1 is being likened to Tatooine, the fictional two-sun planet and childhood home of Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars films . PH1's temperature is estimated to range from a minimum of about 484 degrees Fahrenheit (251 degrees Celsius) to a maximum of 644 degrees (340 degrees C), far too hot to bear life. So far scientists have identified six circumbinary planets but none of these have further suns orbiting them. In a draft research article the Yale rearchers noted: 'Although PH1 is a gas giant planet, even if there is a possibility of rocky moons orbiting the body, their surfaces would be too hot for liquid water to exist.' One of the team Meg Schwamb explains: 'Circumbinary planets are the extremes of planet formation. 'The discovery of these systems is forcing us to go back to the drawing board to understand how such planets can assemble and evolve in these dynamically challenging environments.' The Kepler telescope was launched in March 2009 and has already evidence of more than 2,300 possible alien worlds.","Four sun solar system KIC 4862625 is the first of its kind ever found .

The BBC was in uproar last night over astonishing allegations involving the reporter leading tomorrow’s Panorama exposé of claims that the Corporation covered up sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile. Top BBC journalist Meirion Jones angrily denied he had concealed the potential involvement of one of his relatives in the scandal. Mr Jones says the allegation is designed to discredit him and the Panorama investigation into claims that Newsnight was ordered to scrap a film about Savile’s sex crimes. The BBC civil war intensified after it was alleged the reporter tried to censor a video interview with one of Savile’s victims, who referred to Mr Jones’s aunt, Margaret Jones, and her role as headmistress of a school where the DJ preyed on young girls. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday last night, Mr Jones said: ‘Allegations I concealed an interview to protect my aunt are ludicrous. The tape was in the [editing process] ready to go into the Newsnight film last December. I made it available in full to Panorama and Newsnight. If my purpose was to protect my aunt, I would never have tried to uncover the scandal in the first place.’ The crisis is the biggest faced by the BBC since the Hutton Inquiry probed claims that Downing Street  ‘sexed up’ intelligence reports in the run-up to the Iraq War. The latest disclosures come days before new BBC Director General George Entwistle is grilled by a Commons committee over the Corporation’s handling of the scandal. The corporation also stands accused of protecting other star presenters who staff had voiced concerns over. The BBC is said to have ignored . complaints, including those of sexual harassment, and allowed those . under question to continue working without facing investigation, the . Observer has reported. It added that he culture of allowing TV stars to take liberties with their position has caused anger among BBC staff. Guests: Jimmy Savile and other personalities were invited to Duncroft House Approved School for Girls, pictured . One woman alleges that female . producers were warned to keep their distance from historian Adam . Hart-Davis, now 69, after making women feel uncomfortable with sexual . comments and advances. She told the Observer: 'I thought it was unfair that we would be warned but a presenter wouldn't be expected to change his behaviour.' But the second cousin of David . Cameron said he was not aware of the warnings but admitted he was . told he had offended a female employee and added that he 'greatly regrets' having annoyed her.related] . Mr Jones led the Newsnight investigation, and is now helping Panorama uncover how the Newsnight show was abandoned. The latest incident in the BBC feud concerns the original Newsnight probe into Savile, led by Mr Jones. The . script for the programme, which was scrapped days before it was . scheduled to be broadcast, included a filmed interview with one of . Savile’s victims at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, . Middlesex[ . BBC insiders say they were shocked to discover last week that Mr Jones recorded an interview with a second victim who had referred to Mr Jones’s aunt, the headmistress at the school. The TV star, pictured in 1986, would kiss the students at Duncroft Approved School for Girls goodbye, a former pupils has said . Jimmy Savile has been described as one of the most prolific child sex abusers of all time . Crucially, they say Mr Jones did not tell . BBC bosses of the second interview – and they claimed Newsnight had not . intended to broadcast it. One source said: ‘We were staggered . when we found out Jones had filmed a second victim who mentioned his . aunt. Serious questions need to be asked about why this stayed secret. If it was left on the cutting-room floor because of Jones’s personal . interest in the story, it would be totally unprofessional.’ The . Mail on Sunday has been told senior BBC management only became aware of . the second interview when part of it was broadcast by Newsnight last . week – though not the section that referred to Mr Jones’s aunt. However, . sources close to Mr Jones reacted with fury to the claims against him. ‘These allegations are totally untrue, a malicious smear and utterly . outrageous,’ said one. They . say the Mr Jones made no secret of his family connection with the . school. ‘He visited the school as a teenager and could see something odd . was going on with Savile,’ said one. ‘That is why he was so determined . to expose it.’ Furthermore, they say there was no . conspiracy to ‘bury’ the second interview. ‘If the film had been . screened, the second interview would have been in it,’ said a source. Historian and BBC presenter Adam Hart-Davies, pictured, said he was unaware of allegations that women were warned to keep their distance from him . ‘Meirion . fought tooth and nail to get it on air. He knew it could open his aunt . to criticism, so the idea he would try to cover it up or try to protect . his aunt is absurd.’ The second interview was with a former Duncroft pupil called Rochelle Shepherd. In . the Newsnight show broadcast last week, ten months after the footage . was recorded, she said Savile was naively treated as a ‘saviour’ by . pupils. She added: ‘In fact, he was the complete antithesis of that. ‘The . girls would say how he never stopped eyeing up their t***, and how he . lined everybody up to kiss them all goodbye. He stuck his tongue in . their mouths and touched their breasts.’ The preying TV star terrified his enemies by bragging of his links to IRA killers - claiming he could have terrorists cripple anyone he wished. It is believed his threats of violence were also used against his victims to stun them into silence, The Sunday People has reported. Reporter James Saville recalled the time he met the star in 2000, who he said was 'raging' over the death of a friend and demanding details of anyone involved so he could on his friends in the IRA to 'get them done'. Investigators believe he used the threats as a weapon to stifle accusations as he systematically abuse children. More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star . Contacted by The Mail on Sunday yesterday, Ms Shepherd said the headmistress ‘must have known’ Savile was a sex offender, adding: ‘She had been friends with him for a long time.’ Mrs Jones could not be reached for comment. Ms Shepherd said Mr Jones made clear from the start he was the nephew of the headmistress, but she didn’t get the impression that he wanted to protect her. Asked whether she thought the section about Mrs Jones was cut because of the family connection, Ms Shepherd said: ‘No.’ Several other former Duncroft pupils have told how Savile abused them during visits. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has launched an independent review led by former Head of Sky News, Nick Pollard, which will cover these questions. It would not be appropriate to comment further until this has been concluded.’ Jimmy Savile was a frequent guest at garden parties at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, pictured right. In the Sixties, the school for intelligent girls from troubled backgrounds was looked on in some quarters as ‘an educational experiment’. Former pupils recall that other visitors included  the popular character actor James Robertson Justice and  the Conservative politician  Rab Butler. The school in Surrey became embroiled in the Savile scandal after a former pupil, Karin Ward, accused Savile of sexually abusing girls there. Waiving her right to anonymity, Miss Ward and three others said in the ITV documentary, Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, that the DJ would sit girls on his lap and put his hands up their skirts and in  their underwear. Another of his alleged victims claimed the headmistress, Margaret Jones – aunt of BBC journalist Meirion Jones – had dismissed their allegations. The school closed in the Eighties and is now luxury flats.","Top BBC journalist Meirion Jones denies claims he concealed potential involvement of his aunt in scandal .

Classic lines: YSL's interlocking lettering has always been popular . Others remark that the new image is 'boring', 'confusing', 'too Chanel-esque', 'ridiculously stupid', 'senseless' and 'disrespectful to Yves'. There are fans, however, who disagree with the mass displeasure, expressing their admiration for the new design. With one user commenting: 'LOVE!

One user comments that the new logo is set to be 'the Marmite of the fashion world' because of its ability to divide opinion. Facebook fury: YSL fans have taken to the social networking site to comment on the brand's new logo . Yves Saint Laurent was founded by designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé in 1962, and the current logo was created by the graphic designer Cassandre. Over the years it has become as recognisable as Chanel's interlocked Cs or Louis Vuitton's LV and the recent announcement that Yves would be eliminated has provoked outcry from a number of commentators.

Ring leader: Admitted Russian mobster and former South Beach club owner Alec Simchuk, 46, has opened up to authorities after his arrest on fraud and bribery charges . The admitted Russian mobster behind a . swindling ring of Eastern European 'bar girls' is speaking out about his illegal operation that bamboozled eager-eyed male tourists out of tens of thousands of . dollars. Speaking to authorities from a Miami prison cell . Alec Simchuk, 46, disclosed his operation of flying . women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at . his South Beach clubs. Sent to seduce men from their . expensive hotels to one of his private locations, he said the women lured . their victims into extravagant bar tabs earning $400,000 . to $1 million in profits. At least 88 men were duped, he said, . with the most famous victim having been a Philadelphia weatherman who . took his crisis public after spending more than $43,000 over two nights. Charged for overpriced bottles of Dom . Perignon, Beluga caviar and in the weather man, John Bolaris' case, a . $2,480 modern art painting, Simchuk . said it was a gradual plot to get the men drunk and not realize what . they were signing. Appearing in a federal court last month were several of the so-called 'B girls' from Estonia and Latvia. One testifying was 24-year-old Marina Turcina of Latvia, as the Miami Herald reports. Baited: Simchuk has admitted to flying women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at his private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia . Speaking out: Testifying against Simchuk and his illegal operations has been 24-year-old 'B-girl' Marina Turcina of Latvia, pictured, who previously pleaded guilty to her involvement . He was just signing them without . looking at them,' Turcina told the court of Mr Bolaris' signature to . anything she and the other women handed him. 'They come over and they said, ""Do . you want to do a shot?""' Mr . Bolaris, who is expected to testify, previously recounted of his . experience to ABC's 20/20. 'And I go, ""No I don't want to do a shot."" Then . one comes behind me, rubs my shoulders, pulls back my head and says, . ""Come on, do a shot"". And I said, ""All right, I'll do a shot.""' After . having a few drinks with the women they took him in a taxi to their . friend's art shop. He said after that the details are very sketchy. 'I remember standing up ... signing something, vaguely. Next thing I know, I'm in a cab with a big painting [of a woman's head]. 'Then I woke up, I had red wine on my shirt, fully clothed and I'm thinking - something happened, but what?' Big spenders: Valeria Matsova, 22, pictured of . Estonia, is also one of the named 'B-girls' who helped lure . at least 88 men in all to the private clubs and purposely racking up . thousands of dollars worth of bar tabs . Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs . Duped: Banding together, the women would lure the men from expensive hotels in Miami to the private clubs, 22-year-old Julija Vinogradova of Latvia pictured . Making matters worse for Mr Bolaris . was his mistake of spending a second night with the women after they . called him up to get together saying they found his sunglasses. As part of Simchuk's deal each woman would receive a 20 per cent commission from the men's perceived lucky night on the town. Starting out at fancy hotels like the . Delano, the women targeted wealthy looking tourists, . according to court documents, who were judged by their expensive watches, . clothes and shoes. Those who were cheap and found lacking otherwise were called 'condoms' by the women, the Miami Herald reports. If successful in capturing a victim, a text would get sent out to one of the club's bartenders telling them to get the place ready. Once there, the women would press the . men into ordering more and more rounds of drinks while they carefully . poured theirs into flower vases, watching their victim down theirs. Having developed a similar method . while operating a club in Latvia, Simchuk told authorities that he . purposely used small font on bar menus and that he would have his bar . tenders pour vodka in his customers’ beer. As their victim became more and more . intoxicated it became easier to encourage them to order another round, . the women said, often of the most expensive drink available – with . inflated prices. In total Simchuk admitted to scamming between $400,000 and $1 million from the men. With the men one-by-one later waking . up to outstanding charges on their credit cards in the yearlong . operation, authorities stepped in, responding to the growing number of . bizarrely similar complaints. Bamboozled: The most famous victim was Philadelphia weatherman John Bolaris, a notorious ladies' man pictured here with his former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman . Conned: In all Mr Bolaris, pictured out with friends, said he spent more than $43,000 over two days in bar tabs with the women . Staging an undercover investigation . at one of the clubs for the B-girls and their managers, the women were . caught on tape plying the men and ultimately allowing a warrant for . Simchuk's arrest. Eleven defendants, who were mostly women, pleaded guilty to the sham and served short prison sentences. Simchuk fled to Latvia and then Russia before saying he found that a life on the run wasn’t for him. Preparing to come clean this spring, . it was a group of strangers on the street of St Petersburg that . he said threateningly encouraged him to choose otherwise. One guy pulled gun on my head and . said, ""Good people from Miami don't want you to testify. You have . beautiful wife. Stay at home,""' he told authorities according to the Herald. 'Another guy just broke my leg. Just squeeze it in one shot,' he said. Turcin in court alluded to Simchuk being no better, having forced the women he hired in his overseas clubs to sleep with him, in a similar fashion to his operations in Miami. 'They were scared to lose the job, so they were sleeping with him,' she testified. Simchuk admitted to having a never satisfied desire for sex but against the girls said they knew what they were doing when working for him, and with their roles against the tourists in Miami, he said they knew what to say and do all on their own. 'They are professional liars,' he said. In July Simchuk returned to Miami to face his charges and was greeted by federal officers who placed him under arrest. Simchuck has since pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and visa violations. He's now aiding prosecutors by . testifying against the five defendants now on trial of Stanislav . Pavlenko, 41, Albert Takhalov, 31, his wife, Kristina Takhalov, 31, . Siavash Zargari, 48, and Isaac Feldman, 51, who ran in a 2010 city . commission election. The Herald reports Feldman invested $25,000 in one of the clubs run by Simchuk and Takhalov. All five are accused as organizers and investors in the operation. If convicted they face a maximum . penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud related count, 10 . years for each count in connection with immigration documents, five . years in prison for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. in connection with . immigration documents and 15 years in prison for the bribery count.","Alec Simchuk, 46, had pleaded guilty to hiring women to lure men into his South Beach clubs and take financial advantage of them .

In Desperate Housewives, all kinds of drama and intrigue unfold in the fictional US town of Fairview. Now, it seems, Britain has its own equivalent... Tandridge in East Surrey. This leafy corner of the commuter belt has been declared the housewife capital of Britain. A study found 64 per cent of women in the area, described by residents as full of ‘body-conscious yummy mummies’, were housewives who do not work. By contrast, only around 30 per cent of married mothers nationwide are in a similar position, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. Tandridge – home to celebrities including  Dame Judi Dench and businessman Mohamed Al Fayed – is a largely affluent area. It contains part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, as well as part of the Weald. Its biggest towns – Caterham, birthplace of actor Bill Nighy, and Oxted  – are within easy reach of London and over half its working population commute to the capital, 22 miles away. Almost half of households – 48 per cent – have two cars or more. Clare Francis-Bird, 47, a mother of . two from Tandridge, yesterday suggested the percentage of stay-at-home . women could be even higher. She said: ‘At the school my children go to I would say that the figure is more like 80 per cent of housewives.’ Describing the typical Tandridge . ‘yummy mummy’, the former  nursery teacher added: ‘A newish  4x4 is a . must, typically very  body-conscious, maybe a size six or an eight. Leafy Surrey is a housewife haven, with two thirds of women living there not needing to work . ‘They are very aware of keeping fit . and also have the time to do it. Many around here are yummy mummies. If . I’m really honest I think people have got the money for the wife not to . work.’ The average house price in  Tandridge . is £535,000 and just  20 per cent of residents rent, compared with a . national average of  32 per cent. Peter Gottelier, of East Surrey-based Rayner’s Estate Agents, said: ‘There are certainly some very affluent areas in Tandridge. ‘For example, in Oxted you will struggle to pick up a property for anything less than a million pounds. ‘Because there is an abundance of very . large schools in the area, naturally that attracts a lot of families to . live here.’  The study, launched by film subscription service LoveFilm . and based on ONS figures, found that the top ten locations for . stay-at-home wives and mothers were almost all around the capital, in . Surrey, Kent and Greater London. But Gloucestershire’s Forest of Dean . came second, ahead of Merton –  the Greater London area which includes . Wimbledon – in third. Pendle, in Lancashire, was the first . northern district to feature in the list, in 17th place – one of just . two northern entries in the top 25. Helen Cowley, of LoveFilm, said: ‘Our . study shows that there are significantly more housewives in the South . with just a couple of cities in the top 25 representing the north of the . UK.’ Nationwide 70.9 per cent of  married . or co-habiting British women with dependent children were working in . 2011, according to ONS figures. Tandridge is just 22 miles from London, it contains part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, part of the Weald and the towns of Warlingham, Caterham, Oxted, Godstone and Lingfield. The area has several woodlands and some open heathland. Elevations range from 267m at Botley Hill, North Downs to 42m above sea level near Edenbridge. The average house price is £363,586 .

When Ray and Vi Donovan were awoken in the early hours of the morning to the horrific news that their two sons had been attacked by a gang while returning home that night, they felt as though their world had caved in. The couple discovered from the two officers at the door of their home in Surrey that one of their sons, Christopher, was fighting for his life. He later died from the injuries he sustained in the brutal attack. The Donovans would have been forgiven for holding onto the anger they felt at the perpetrators forever. Compassion: Ray and Vi Donovan found it in their hearts to forgive the men who killed their son Chris . Indeed, many couples crumble under the weight of the loss - the marriages of parents who have lost children are, tragically, more likely to end in divorce. But 10 years on from Christopher's death, Ray and Vi have not only let go of their anger - but in an extraordinary show of compassion, they have managed to forgive the thugs that beat their son to death. The couple say they could not have done it without the help of the restorative justice scheme, which allowed the couple the opportunity to come face to face with the men who killed Christopher. In a meeting arranged by the Restorative Justice programme and mediators at the charity CALM (Confidential And Local Mediation), the couple met with two of the three perpetrators responsible for the crime when they came to the end of their sentences. In a moment of heart-wrenching humanity that brings tears to the eyes, Ray says that when one of the offenders entered the room, all he wanted to do was hug him. 'I held my hands out to him and he came to me and hugged me,' Ray says. 'He grabbed hold of me and wouldn't let go. He cried and cried,' Ray says. 'As I cuddled him, he whispered ""I'm sorry"" in my ear. 'Then he turned to Vi and said simply, ""May I?"" Vi nodded, and he went to hug her too. He said ""sorry,"" again and again.' 'We said ""I forgive you"". One of the offenders admitted to the Donovans that for the first two years of his eight year sentence, he didn't spare a thought for the victims of his crimes. Tragic: Chris was attacked by a group of youths as he walked home with his brother Phil . But after he took part in a Victim Awareness course in prison, he says he couldn't get Chris out of his 'head and heart' and he felt an urgent need to apologise to the Donovans. 'He told us that he’d been a 15-year-old coward. He acknowledged he'd kicked Chris then left . him in the road and run away. 'That was something we'd waited 10 years . to hear.  He wasn’t at all the person we’d expected to see.' Asked how they found it in their hearts to forgive their son's killers, Ray displays a compassion many of us would find impossible. 'These boys were just 15, 16 and 19 when they attacked Chris,' he told MailOnline. 'We don't blame them - we blame the drug dealers that gave them the drugs they were on that night; the people who bought them alcohol.' Neither do the Donovans blame the parents - in fact, they reserve enormous sympathy for the mother and father of one of the offenders in particular, who have spoken on the BBC about the horrific moment their front door was kicked down by 30 policeman. 'They are decent people,' Ray says. 'But they had to cope with something most of us could never imagine happening to us. 'I always say there are four lots of people who lost - us, and the parents of those three boys. They have to live for the rest of their lives with the stigma that their sons are murderers.' Ray's seemingly limitless compassion does not end there. He set out to get one of the offenders - an artist - a job and a place on a mentoring programme to become a curator. The man is now working for a charity - Ray is not allowed to say which. 'I called the director and got him a place,' Ray says. 'The secretary who took the call was in tears when she heard the story. 'Now he's been mentored into the art world as a curator. Isn't that better than him walking the streets?' Ray says that he has visited the offender at the art institution to see how he is getting on, but that he doesn't have daily contact. 'It wouldn't be fair to check up on him,' Ray says. 'It would throw everything out, upset the apple cart. We know he is doing well there and that's enough.' Ray and Vi have published a booklet - entitled Five Minutes Of Madness - to bring awareness to youngsters of the consequences of crime. The booklet's name comes from an incident that happened in the riots of last summer. Two boys were passing through a riot zone and happened to put their hands through a broken window to lift two packs of chewing gum. They were later identified and sentenced to months in prison. Ray uses this as an example of how five minutes of 'madness' can change the course of a young person's life forever. The booklet - which they mark with a price of £1.50 but give away (kids are more likely to read something if it has a price tag on it and they think they've got something for free, he says) - contains the stories of the boys in the riot, as well as a boy who knifed someone to 'gain respect.' 'We ask the question, ""why is that sort of respect more important than your family's respect?"", and try to get the kids to think about what they would lose by going to jail.' Lost youth: Chris as a teenager celebrating his birthday . The Donovans now advise the probation service on restorative justice too. 'Each meeting takes months of planning,' he says. 'The scheme is victim-led, not offender-led. There are safety valves all over the place - get out rooms for both parties. 'It's important that the victim gets to make decisions, even down to who will be in the room first' Ray says that in his and Vi's instance, he chose to be in the room first - so that he could hold out his hands to the offenders. 'But the most important part of the process is the tea and biscuits after the official meeting,' he says. 'With the second boy, after the meeting [which is chaired by a counsellor] we talked for four hours. He's a plasterer learning the trade, and he told us all about his girlfriend and the baby that's on the way. 'Neither of us had to stay for the tea and biscuits - but it was the most healing part.' It was a welcome moment for the Donovans, who have battled with their own guilt in the years following the death of Chris. The family had only recently . moved from Peckham to New Malden in Surrey, close to where the fatal attack occurred, assuming it would be a safer . place to bring up their sons. For Ray, one of the most painful elements of the events that unfurled that night is the knowledge that he had turned down Chris's request for a lift home. 'He asked me to drive him, but I said . I was too tired,' Ray says. 'Then he went to meet Phil and said they . should get a mini cab - but Phil had just been paid, and said that as it . was a nice evening, they should walk.' 'The hardest thing for me to accept was that Chris had tried to get a lift twice - and twice he had been turned down. 'It took a policeman to teach me to . forgive myself. He said to me, ""Ray, 'What if' won't bring Chris back. You're just destroying yourself."" It was better than any psychiatrist.' Ray's final word is one that many will find inspiring. 'If we go around angry, what kind of example is that to set?' he asks. 'This was the best way we could find to honour Chris. We could have had a park bench made with a plaque on it - or we could do what we are doing. That's the way we look at it. 'What's more important? A park bench or changing someone's life?' The Victim's Voice will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 tonight (Monday 20 August) at 8pm. Ray and Vi will be on Radio Surrey tonight at 5.30pm to talk about their experience with the restorative justice scheme.","Ray and Vi Donovan met offenders jailed for their son's murder as part of Restorative Justice scheme .

'Terrified': Anne Bass has testified against her former butler who allegedly held her hostage at her estate in Connecticut in 2007 . Multimillionaire socialite Anne Bass has revealed she thought she was going to die when three armed men broke into her Connecticut home, howling 'war cries', brandishing knives and demanding cash. Testifying in court against her former butler - allegedly one of the three men who attempted to steal millions of dollars from her - the 70-year-old wept as she remembered thinking how her murder would affect her two daughters. She also recounted her fear on hearing the men enter the home, before she and her boyfriend Julian Lethbridge were bound and given an injection the intruders claimed was a deadly virus. 'I spent a lot of time thinking about my children and how horrible it . was going to be for them because I was sure I was going to die,' she said. 'I just . didn't see how anyone could survive something like that.' Bass, the former wife of Texas billionaire Sid . Bass, also revealed her guilt that her three-year-old grandson was asleep in her home during the home invasion in 2007. 'I just felt like I had failed as a mother, that I would be in that kind of a position,' she told the court, the Hartford Courant reported. She also revealed she stopped the men from kidnapping her grandson Jasper, by asking: 'Do any of you have children?' She added: 'I thought they would scream at me.' But one of the intruders admitted he did have children. She told them her grandson would be forever frightened if he saw the three men dressed in black, and they did not take the boy. 'Victims': Bass and her longtime boyfriend, Julian Lethbridge (pictured), were allegedly bound by three masked intruders who demanded money and injected them with a 'deadly virus' Bass was in court to testify against Emanuel . Nicolescu, whom she had employed at her South Kent home for two months . in 2008, and whom is accused of holding the pair hostage for 12 hours. Authorities say Nicolescu and at least . two other men broke into the house around 11 p.m. on . the estate that spans several hundred acres. Bass . had just taken a bath and Lethbridge was falling asleep when he heard 'a . loud crashing noise and a sound like boots running up steps', prosecutors said. Bass failed to bar the invaders from getting in through the kitchen door. They . then blindfolded the victims, bound their hands and took . them to a bathroom where they administered the 'poison'. The masked assailants demanded the philanthropist pay $8.5 million for an antidote within 20 hours. Testifying . on Tuesday, Bass added that she heard the men howling terrifying 'war . cries' when they entered the home, the Harford Courant reported. Hostage situation: Bass testified against Emanuel Nicolescu (left), her former butler and allegedly one of the three men who broke into her home. Bass was married to Texas billionaire Sid Bass (right) She had climbed out of the bath, dressed in a terry cloth robe and shuffled to the kitchen. Once there, she 'heard these war cries, very terrifying sounds' and saw hooded men storming the house. Bass said: 'In my memory I see them in some kind of military formation like little . children acting like Indians, beating their chests, trying to frighten . you.' She screamed for Lethbridge and attempted to run, but the men grabbed her and bound her wrists. Bass's testimony comes days after her boyfriend . told the court he thought he would die when three men ‘dressed like . ninjas’ broke into the philanthropist's mansion and 'poisoned' them. ‘It felt like a flu shot,’ he said. ‘They injected me by sterilizing my shoulder, exactly like an . inoculation…I thought it was poisonous or they were putting me to sleep.' Wielding . a knife, one of the assailants announced that they had been injected . with a ‘very virulent virus’ with symptoms taking 20-24 hours to appear. ‘When the symptoms appear, it’s almost certain to be fatal,’ Lethbridge recalled the thugs saying. House of horror: The sprawling Connecticut retreat where Anne Bass and her boyfriend were held captive for 12 hours in 2007 while her three-year-old grandson slept in a separate room . He told the . men Bass did not keep that sum of money in the house and that she would . have to contact associates out of state to get the money. Prosecutors said that Nicolescu, his . former roomate Nicolae Helerea, aka Michael Kennedy, and Stefan Barabas . talked on either cellphones or two-way radios. After . about five hours in the house, the men became concerned with the . presence of the child, the health of the victims and their apparent . inability to immediately obtain the money, the affidavit says. Before . fleeing, the men gave the victims a beverage that they claimed was the . antidote and the victims fell asleep. Nicolescu, who was fired by Bass after . he wrecked one of her cars he was using without permission, faces 50 . years in prison if convicted of the home invasion. Nicolescu's lawyer Audrey Felsen previously told jurors that the butler 'did not do the crimes. He did not participate in them, He didn't plan them. He didn't help anybody plan them.

"Kelly Brook took the crown followed by Rihanna, Jennifer Aniston, Cheryl Cole and Kim Kardashian . David Beckham took the male crown with Simon Cowell in third place . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 10:59 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:52 EST, 17 September 2012 . Although we have witnessed hundreds of super slim models looking fabulous whilst parading the catwalks this weekend at London Fashion Week, forget size zero and extreme dieting because female slimmers want a body just like curvaceous Kelly Brook. The brunette actress and model, 32, was crowned ‘Miss Body Perfect’ by a new survey where almost a quarter of voters said she was their number one choice. The curvy model was followed by singer Rihanna (14 per cent), ex Friends star Jennifer Aniston (10 per cent), popstar Cheryl Cole (8.05 per cent) and US reality TV star Kim Kardashian (7.45 per cent). It's actress and model Kelly Brook who won the votes for the perfect figure, leaving Victoria Beckham trailing behind . Super skinny Victoria Beckham – who was photographed last week with Vogue editor Anna Wintour, in an elegant tangerine dress that created the illusion of curves - won less than one per cent of the vote. However, despite this there was still cause for celebration in the Beckham household, as husband David was named owner of the hottest male celeb body. A third of women voted father–of-four David’s body the best, one in ten opted for movie legend George Clooney and X Factor supremo Simon Cowell was the surprise third place choice, with 8 per cent of the vote. The 52-year-old British TV star beat a long list of, much younger, Hollywood leading men, including Twilight star Robert Pattinson (5.15 per cent), screen idol Orlando Bloom (5.95 per cent) and all action hero Jason Statham (6.55 per cent). David Beckham took the crown for the men with Simon Cowell coming in a surprising third place . And pop music mogul Cowell was even more popular with women under 35, with over a fifth of women in this age range insisting he was their ‘Mr Body Perfect’. Speaking about the results of the poll, Linda O’Byrne, chief nutritionist for the New Atkins Diet, who OnePoll carried out the research for, said: 'It’s great that women in the UK are looking to celebrities with real curves for inspiration, as it provides an achievable weight loss goal. 'The trend for size zero and extreme dieting was very unhealthy and worrying, so it is very reassuring to discover, thanks to our research, that women are beginning to adopt a healthier attitude to losing weight and using better role models. 'Kelly Brook has a fantastic figure, and now it seems that it is no longer just men that appreciate it. It is also very easy to understand why so many women voted David Beckham the perfect body, he has it all. 'And while Simon Cowell has a certain charisma, it was something of a surprise to discover just how popular he is with women under 35.' Cheryl Cole and Rihanna were in the top five females voted with having the best body . The study also discovered that women were most conscious of their tummies (55.85per cent), followed by legs (16.80 per cent) and then their bum (11.50 per cent). Worryingly, a fifth of those under 35 confessed that they had first started dieting at the tender age of 11, and almost a third of ladies in this age range said they were always on a diet. Chocolate was voted the hardest thing to avoid when dieting, with four out of ten women agreeing, followed by carbs, such as pasta and bread (17.25 per cent) and thirdly, alcohol (15 per cent). Meanwhile, one in four told researchers they were most likely to break their diet and comfort eat at this time of year, as autumn arrives and the weather turns colder. Linda O’Byrne, chief nutritionist for the New Atkins Diet, added: 'It is a fact that when slimming, many women do try and fail numerous diets and also often find themselves blindsided by temptation or seasonal changes, such as colder weather setting in during autumn or an abundance of parties at Christmas time.' 1.    Kelly Brook . 2.    Rihanna . 3.    Jennifer Aniston . 4.    Cheryl Cole . 5.    Kim Kardashian . 1.    David Beckham . 2.    George Clooney . 3.    Simon Cowell . 4.    Jason Statham . 5.    Orlando Bloom .","Kelly Brook took the crown followed by Rihanna, Jennifer Aniston, Cheryl Cole and Kim Kardashian .

Success story: Noma head chef Rene Redzepi is bringing his world-renowned restaurant to Claridge's during the Games this summer . The 10-day event welcomes renowned chef, . Rene Redzepi, and his award-winning restaurant, Noma, which is based in . Copenhagen, to London. The dining experience, which attracted overwhelming demand, will be hosted during the Olympics by Claridge’s hotel in central London. The meal of a lifetime will come at a cost, with the five-course menu priced at £195. But those successful in the lottery will no doubt be awaiting the event with eager anticipation, given Noma's astounding global success. Redzepi’s Danish establishment has held the title of the 'World’s Best Restaurant' for the past three years. The award is run by British magazine . Restaurant based on a poll of international chefs, restaurateurs, . gourmands and restaurant critics. Impressive environs: Noma will be a pop-up in Claridge's hotel, where the famous ballroom will seat 3,000 diners over 10 days . The legendary chef, who was this . month included in Time magazine’s list of ‘The 100 Most Influential . People in the World’, has never before taken Noma overseas. But given the interest he has attracted, it is likely this won't be the last time. Diner David Sims, of Southampton, Hants, who managed to get a table for four, said: 'This will be the culinary event of the year in the UK. 'It is like the Rolling Stones of cooking coming to your home town.' There were 3,400 tickets available for the event - 170 will be seated in the hotel’s ornate ballroom for lunch and dinner over the 10 days. Thomas Koch, general manager at Claridge’s, said: 'We knew 10,000 people had registered, but we never expected all of them to try to book. Top notch: Noma, in Copenhagen, has been voted World's Best Restaurant three years running by industry experts . Innovative: Redzepi, 34, has sparked a cultural revolution with his focus on foraging and his reinterpretation of Nordic cuisine, but for his London pop-up he will focus on British ingredients . 'Bringing Rene and his approach to food to London was essential in creating this dining experience. 'It’s not intended to replicate a visit to Noma in Copenhagen, it will be Rene’s food with British ingredients. 'The lucky people who have succeeded in their bookings will be very, veryhappy.' Redzepi, 34, has sparked a cultural revolution with his focus on foraging and his reinterpretation of Nordic cuisine. The pop-up restaurant will be open from 28 July 28 to 6 August  - coinciding with the period the London 2012 Olympics are being staged. Mr Koch added: 'It’s a very special time for London. 'Our city will have the world’s eyes on it and we wanted to contribute to the experience - which is how the idea came about.' The Copenhagen restaurant is being renovated during the two weeks that Noma is in London.","10,000 people applied to dine when Copenhagen's Noma hits London .

Premier League footballer Joey Barton has been bailed pending further inquiries by Merseyside Police after being arrested for affray earlier today. The Queens Park Rangers midfielder, 29, was involved in trouble in the early hours of today while on a night out with his girlfriend in Liverpool city centre. Barton, who has become well known for his opinionated Twitter outbursts, indicated tonight he was going on holiday tomorrow. Fracas: A picture of the incident, apparently showing a shirtless Barton . being held back by police and a woman, believed to be his girlfriend, was circulated on Twitter . He tweeted: 'Looking forward to Portugal now tomo. Bit of rest and lots of golf...' Earlier the Liverpool-born midfielder confirmed the incident by tweeting: 'I got sucker punched in the back of the head.' Two men, aged 21 and from the Old . Swan area of Liverpool, were arrested on suspicion of a public order . offence at around 5.30am at the scene of the incident, outside Garlands . nightclub in the city. But after they were held in custody and questioned, Barton and a 20-year-old man were also arrested this afternoon. All have been bailed pending further inquiries - with Barton the last of the quartet after he was questioned by officers. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Following an altercation in . Eberle Street, Liverpool city centre, in the early hours of this . morning, four men have been arrested on suspicion of affray. 'Two 21-year-old men were arrested at the scene in the early hours of . this morning and another two men, a 20-year-old from the Liverpool area . and 29-year-old from the Widnes area, were arrested this afternoon. 'The two 21-year-old men and the 20-year-old man have been questioned by . officers and have been released on bail pending further inquiries. 'The 29-year-old man remains in police custody where he will be questioned by detectives.' Delay: Joey Barton finally updated his Twitter account more than nine and a half hours after the incident . A picture of the incident was circulated . on Twitter later in the morning - but the footballer, whose own . near-constant tweeting has been a frequent source of controversy, . remained uncharacteristically silent until shortly after 3pm. Barton finally broke his silence by . telling almost 1.6million followers: 'I got sucker punched in the back . of the head. Not injured as reported just a...Small bruise on rear of . head/ear. I've had worse. Life goes on! Thanks for the concern. Have a . good day people'. The . footballer later added: 'Not planning on pressing charges as its (sic) not that serious. The police have also got better things to do with . their time. 'Can I just say a public thanks to the police last night as they were and have been today brilliant.' Until Barton mentioned the incident, all visitors to his Twitter page could see were . a series of boring comments about the Royal Family and the Queen's . Golden Jubilee. He tweeted: 'How have Prince Charles . and Philip got that many medals? Can't remember reading about their . heroism anywhere... #mystery'. In . another post, he wrote: 'I don't mind The Queen. She seems alright. William seems sound as does Harry. The rest, well, they just annoy . me...' The . photograph, taken outside a takeaway 25 metres from the club, apparently . shows a shirtless Barton being held back by police and a woman, . believed to be his girlfriend Georgia McNeil. Some celebrities took to Twitter to comment rather unkindly on the fracas. Television host and former newspaper . editor Piers Morgan was among the first of Barton's more than 1.5million . followers to reply to his comments, writing: 'If you need me to walk . you home tonight, Pitbull @Joey7Barton - let me know.' Barton replied: 'thanks mate. Ill give your good self a text next time. #tallyhosecurity' Athlete Iwan Thomas wrote: 'BREAKING NEWS Joey Barton been attacked outside nightclub.... Police looking for 450,000 suspects'. Circulated: The photograph of Barton was taken outside a takeaway 25 metres from the gay bar . It was alleged that the footballer had to be 'physically removed' from Garlands by security staff before he was punched outside. Property entrepreneur Martin Makepeace, a friend of Garlands staff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just spoke to the lads at Garlands Liverpool who told me that Joseph Barton was physically removed from the club before the fracas outside.' Nobody from the club was available to confirm the events leading up to the attack . Controversial: Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton was involved in a fight with two men outside a nightclub . A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said: 'Merseyside Police were called to Eberle Street in Liverpool city centre at 5.30am this morning following reports of an altercation. 'On arrival officers found a 29-year-old man who had sustained injuries to his face. The man left the scene voluntarily. 'Two 21-year-old men from the L13 area were arrested at the scene for a public order offence. 'They are currently in police custody.' Ian Taylor, a spokesman for QPR, said: 'Joey Barton was involved in an incident in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Monday morning. 'Barton was on his way home from a night out with his girlfriend when two men sang offensive chants and then proceeded to hit the R's midfielder. 'Police were immediately on the scene and arrested one man. 'Barton decided not to press charges and left the scene with his girlfriend soon after. 'The club will be making no further comment.' News of the fight was widely commented on on Twitter, with the words Joey Barton and Garlands trending on the social media site. Tweeter @JoshGore-11, who claimed to have been at the scene, said Barton had 'looked in a bad way' after the fight. Athlete Iwan Thomas, left, and television host Piers Morgan, right, made light of Barton's predicament . The Liverpool-born footballer has a . long history of controversy on and off the pitch and has become . well-known for his opinionated tweets. Barton has posted about football, philosophy, politics and art in an attempt to shrug off his bad-boy image. His . tweets have ranged from quoting philosophers to insulting figures like . Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer for the clothes he wears on screen. But the player has courted controversy and was threatened with legal action after tweeting about John Terry’s racism case. Barbed comments: Athlete Iwan Thomas joked that police were 'looking for 450,000 suspects' for the attack . It is the latest of a long list of incidents involving the midfielder who was banned for 12 matches by the Football Association following his red card on the final day of the season in QPR's match against Manchester City. He was banned for the sending off and . then for kicking out at Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and attempting . to head-butt Aguero's team-mate, Vincent Kompany. Barton . has never been far from trouble in his career and was jailed for six . months in May 2008 after admitting common assault and affray following . an incident in Liverpool city centre the December before. The club: Garlands outside which Joey Barton's alleged altercation took place . He was also fined about £60,000 while at Manchester City after he stubbed a lit cigar into the eye of his young team-mate Jamie Tandy during the club's Christmas party. Barton was suspended by City for after a training-ground altercation with team-mate Ousmane Dabo. He was charged with violent conduct by FA and received a four-month suspended sentence at Manchester Crown court. An internet guide to Liverpool night life describes Garlands as a 'gay friendly super club'. Trouble: Barton was given a 12-match ban after being sent off in the final match of the football season . 'Garlands holds a mixture of gay and straight people who are all out for one thing - a funky night!,' states a review on the website anightinliverpool.com . 'There are drag queens all around, usually ironing and hoovering with kids' toys, just funny and you're bound to have a smile on your face throughout the night. 'Drinks are quite expensive but the atmosphere is great and the music is a mix of house and dance tunes with some electro pumped in for good measure. 'It's a ""Wear what you Dare"" place, which gives it a feel good feeling because no one fits in, you're just individual and accepted.'

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 27 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:22 EST, 28 September 2012 . Time for action: Pregnant women will now be given the whooping cough jab in the womb . Every pregnant woman will be offered the whooping cough jab amid the worst outbreak in more than 20 years. There have been nearly 5,000 cases of the illness already this year and nine babies have died. For the first time the Government is to offer the vaccine to all pregnant women in the hope they will pass on protection to the foetus in the womb. At present, babies are given a whooping cough jab when they are eight weeks old, followed by boosters at three and four months. They cannot have their vaccine any sooner as their immune systems are not developed enough for it to be effective.  All nine babies who died from whooping cough this year have been under the age of eight weeks. If pregnant women are given the jab, they will make antibodies – proteins that fight infections – that are passed on to the foetus via the placenta. This will give the baby protection for the first few weeks of life. The Department of Health insists that the injections are entirely safe and there is no risk they of harming the unborn baby or cause complications in the pregnancy. From Monday, all women who are between 28 and 38 weeks pregnant will be able to get the jabs from their GP. Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation, said: ‘We’ve got a situation where there isn’t a choice. We’ve got a real problem and we’ve got babies dying. ‘We have a solution available to us that has a strong safety record. ‘The vaccine that we are offering to pregnant women has been  recommended by experts and a similar vaccine is already given to pregnant women in the US.’ The Department of Health  estimates that the immunisation programme will cost the taxpayer around £10million. It is only a temporary measure however and the vaccinations will be halted as soon as the disease rates go down again. Since  January, there have been 4,791 cases of whooping cough, three times as many as last year. The last time rates were this high was in 1990 when there were 15,000 cases, and seven babies died. The illness is rarely serious in adults – many will not even be aware they have it. The Health Protection Agency       is unclear as to why this outbreak is so severe but rates tend to go up and down every three or four years.If they are low for several years and few catch the infection, everyone’s immunity goes down. So if the illness reappears – after being brought in from abroad, for example – the public is far more susceptible and rates go up again. The HPA believes this latest outbreak may have its origins in mainland Europe or America, where rates are also very high. Mothers are being offered the jab at between 28 and 38 weeks as experts believe this is when their antibodies will most effectively be passed to the newborns. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The medical term for whooping cough is pertussis. The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough which progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise. The coughing can last for around three months. Other symptoms include raised temperature and vomiting after coughing. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every 3-4 years. There is currently a peak occurring. Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, which can be passed from person to person through droplets spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery, however measures should be taken to stop it spreading. Children with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery until they have taken antibiotics for five days. The same applies to adults returning to their workplace. Young babies under the age of six months are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications, such as serious breathing difficulties. They will be treated in isolation to prevent the infection spreading and will be given antibiotics into a vein through a drip (intravenously). In the UK, all pregnant women are now to be offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant to protect their babies from the infection in the first few weeks of life. Children are vaccinated against whooping cough at two, three and four months of age, and again before starting school at about three years and four months of age. Read more about preventing whooping cough. Source: NHS Choices . The Repevax jab, which is  manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, contains tiny amounts of dead  Bordetella pertussis bacteria. It cannot cause the illness but it is enough to provoke the body’s immune system to produce antibodies, which protect against it. But it may cause minor side effects such as a sore arm or a fever. The Department of Health is now urging GP surgeries to contact pregnant women to encourage them to come forward for their jabs. Family doctors will be paid £7.60 for each vaccine carried out to compensate for the extra workload and time. Around 650,000 women become pregnant every year although it is unlikely that all will get the jab. Only about a quarter of pregnant women come forward for the flu jab. They have been offered it for the last two years.","All women who are between 28 and 38 weeks pregnant will be eligible for the vaccine .

Beleaguered: Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative Party Chief Whip, says his anti-police image is unfair . Andrew Mitchell yesterday said his verbal assault on Downing Street police had been ‘blown out of proportion’. The Tory Chief Whip also claimed he did not use the words ‘pleb’ and ‘moron’ in the clash with protection officers who would not let him cycle through the street’s main gate last week. In an interview with his local paper, Mr Mitchell also sought to paint himself as a friend of the police who visits their station in his constituency at Christmas to thank them for their efforts. He blamed a 'long and extremely frustrating day' for his rant, and says he has apologised to all concerned so wants to get on with his job. But to further undermine Mr Mitchell’s explanation for his rant, however, it later emerged the day in question included lunch at . London’s poshest curry house, the Cinnamon Club. 'I hope my constituents and friends in . Sutton Coldfield will not recognise the hideous caricature that has been . portrayed in some of the tabloid press,' he told his local paper the Observer. 'I have an excellent relationship with the police whom I know well and . whom I always go to see at Christmas time to thank for their services to . the people of Sutton. 'I go round the police station and thank all the police who are on duty . before Christmas for keeping us safe and sound throughout the year,' adding he has 'a tremendously close and warm . relationship with them'. Two-wheeled terror: Mr Mitchell had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike out of a gate when he launched the outburst at police . Altercation: Mr Mitchell got in a row after police asked him to go via the side gate of Downing Street, but he wanted to go through the main larger one . After the incident David Cameron called him in for a face-to-face meeting and told Mr Mitchell his behaviour was unacceptable. He 'looked him in the eye', insisting he didn't use the word, sources said. Mr Cameron has since read an official police log showing he called officers 'f****** plebs', but is expected to stand by Mr Mitchell. The police log states: ‘There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite . the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr Mitchell said: “Best you . learn your f****** place... you don't run this f****** Government... You're ******* plebs.” Claims: Mr Mitchell has constantly denied using the words attributed to him in a police report . ‘The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken . aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior Government . official. I cannot say if this statement was aimed at me individually, . or the officers present or the police service as a whole.’ The Chief Whip has again gone through his version of events and denied the police report was accurate. 'On Wednesday night I tried to leave Downing Street by the main gate, something I have done many times before. 'I was told that I was not allowed to leave that way. During the subsequent altercation, although I did not use the specific words that have been suggested, I do accept that I did not treat the police with the respect they deserve. 'I have apologised profusely to the police officer involved and to the supervising sergeant. 'It’s been extremely difficult both for me and my family. I have apologised and said that I am extremely sorry. I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone. I would gently point out that I did not say the words that have been ascribed to me.' Mr Mitchell confirmed that he will be returning to his constituency 'shortly' and is looking forward to getting back to his two roles as MP and Chief Whip - a position he says is 'evolving'.","The Chief Whip says he has a 'close and warm .

Isobel Cohen, 33, had to leave daughter Beatrice in intensive care while she sat her practical criticism paper in her dressing gown and slippers in hospital. She then completed her Shakespeare and the Greek tragedies exam the next day in the hospital. Bright spark: Isobel Cohen said she was 'fixed' on completing her Cambridge English degree, despite being heavily pregnant with her first child, Beatice . Despite the exhaustion of labour and . the final weeks of her pregnancy, she secured a first class honours . degree in English from the University’s Lucy Cavendish College.

She said: ‘I wonder how I held it . together and got through them because now I’m into full-blown “nappy . brain”. While my concentration and memory were not as good as they might . have been, I could still do things I needed to do and retain enough . information to write decent essays. ‘At the time it seemed like a perfectly legitimate thing to do but now I look back and think it’s slightly insane.’ Miss Cohen, a former dancer from .

She was offered the chance to apply . for a DDH – ‘deemed to have deserved honours’ – instead of attempting . her exams, but she decided to go ahead. ‘Maybe I was being desperately . obsessive but I knew whatever happened I should be able to get a better . result than what the university would give me if I didn’t take the . paper,’ she said. She added that she hoped the baby, . like many first-borns – would come late. But a scan showed Beatrice may . have had a digestive tract disorder so doctors at Adenbrooke’s Hospital . arranged for Isobel to be induced. New beginnings: High-achiever Isobel Cohen plans to take six months off work to care for Beatrice, before continuing in further academic study . She was born weighing 6lb10oz after a . difficult labour. Twenty-eight hours later, at 2pm on May 24, Isobel sat . her exam. She said: ‘I was sitting in a hospital room in my gown . attached to a catheter.

But with the recent furore surrounding his child-misplacing exploits and a crunch G20 summit coming up today, David Cameron might have been wise to avoid the pub this time around. The Prime Minister was pictured yesterday chillaxing yet again over a tipple just a week after it emerged he left his eight-year-old daughter Nancy behind in his local. Although he no doubt will need no reminder to check he has all his children with him when leaving the pub, one of his locals has put up a handy poster to jog his memory. Chillax, guys, Nancy's not here: David Cameron leaves the Althorp Coaching Inn near Northampton where staff said he relaxed with family and friends on Father's Day . Downtime: Mr Cameron was with a group of adults and reportedly also met up with wife Samantha, but his eldest child, Nancy, whom he left in a pub two months ago, was not there . The Swan Pub, near his country retreat . at Chequers, has a poster which says 'Please ensure you have all your . children with you when you leave'. Yesterday, Mr Cameron was at the Althorp Coaching Inn in Great Brington, near Northampton, were he was said to have enjoyed a pint of local ale. He was photographed with a group of adults and security guards and was said to have also been joined by his wife Samantha and a child believed to be their youngest daughter, Florence. There was no sign of his other children, Arthur and Nancy, at the inn, which is also known as the Fox and Hounds. The pub is close to the Althorp Estate, which hosted the Althorp Literary Festival this weekend, an event sponsored by the stationery firm Smythson of Bond Street, where Mrs Cameron works as a creative consultant. Don't leave your children: The tongue in cheek message to David Cameron left at The Swan pub near Chequers, the Prime Minister's country retreat in Buckinghamshire . Making a habit of it: The Prime Minister was said to have had a local ale, but with a crunch G20 summit today some may question whether he should have been down the pub yesterday . Marc Lagalante, 41, a chef at the pub, told the Daily Telegraph: 'He was having a nice time with friends, having fun and chatting. He was having a pint, probably the local ale. 'I saw him and spoke to him, just asking how he was. He said ""I'm fine"" and asked how I was as well.' Downing Street have not commented. Mr Cameron has been making a habit of . chillaxing down the pub in recent weeks. Last week, a picture emerged . showing him back at the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, where in a blunder two months ago he had driven off without his eldest Nancy. Full view: Mr Cameron, seen in the background, was surrounded by friends and his children earlier this month . Mr . Cameron was there with wife Samantha, and children Nancy, Arthur, six, . and 22-month-old Florence, just a few miles from his country residence . Chequers. In a casual shirt, trousers and trainers, Mr Cameron is pictured standing surrounded by friends, children and his staff, including protection officers. Rambler Robert Stone spotted Mr Cameron and decided to grab a picture when he and his wife stopped for a well-earned drink. 'We were about a quarter of the way through them and I turned to my missus and said, ""That's David Cameron"". He put down his rucksack and his missus turned up with the kids and it was clearly him,' he told the Mirror. Family atmosphere: Mr Cameron stands by a Land Rover at the pub where families were enjoying drinks . Packing up: Samantha Cameron collects belongings at the pub after drinks in its garden . 'There were some adults and a few . more kids who sat near where we were sat and Mr Cameron was sat on the . fence drinking his pint of Guinness.' Two months previously, Mr Cameron mistakenly left his daughter in the pub and only realised she was missing when he . arrived back at Chequers. As they went to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them. The . Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the . pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their . other children in another. Mr . Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she . thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister. Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . An insider said: 'It was a case of ""Oh crikey I thought you had her"" and ""Oh crikey I thought YOU had her.' A spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened. They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy. ‘Thankfully . when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman . said. ‘The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’ When . Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub he found his daughter happily . helping the pub staff. It is understood she had been left by herself for . 15 minutes.

After long lunches the Prime Minister likes to recharge his batteries with an afternoon nap, the book claimed.

Mr Cameron has previously been branded ‘DVD Dave’ for his love of watching Danish dramas in bed with his wife Samantha.He also finds time for a weekly date night. Plough . landlord Steve Hollings, who has run the pub with his wife Sharon for . more than 13 years, said the Prime Minister and his family regularly pop . in for lunch or drinks. Mr Hollings said Mr Cameron had again been in the pub with his family at lunchtime yesterday, and had spent about an hour there.

The economy is expected to return to growth this week as  figures suggested Britain is  creating jobs at a faster rate than the United States. If predictions prove correct, the end of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War will be a much-needed boost to Chancellor George Osborne. It comes just days after employment figures reached an all-time high. Chancellor George Osborne was out running in Westminster early this morning, at the start of a crucial week which is expected to see Britain declared to be out of recession on Thursday . The total number of those in work has risen by 1.75 per cent, or 510,000 jobs, in the past year to 29.59million – the highest since records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. That increase outpaced the 1.37 per cent gain in employment registered in the US . It also adds weight to the argument that Britain’s economic situation is far better than troubled eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, where 25 per cent of the population is unemployed. However, 1.4million are working part-time but would like a full-time job. Gross domestic product  figures due on Thursday are likely to show the economy has grown by between 0.4 and 0.8 per cent. Chris Williamson of financial data experts Markit, said: ‘GDP is expected to have rebounded sharply in the third quarter.’ He added that the Olympics and fewer bank holidays in this quarter will have helped the positive trend. Experts’ estimates of growth in the three months July, August and September range from zero to 1 per cent, with an average of 0.6 per cent. Consumer confidence has risen but there are fears over prices in 2013, when higher energy bills threaten to push up inflation, a survey by business advisers Deloitte found. Meanwhile, a report from accountants Ernst & Young found weak growth had forced up the number of profit warnings from firms during the third quarter – its highest level since 2008.","The total number of those in work has risen by 1.75 per cent, or 510,000 jobs, in the past year, outpacing the US with 1.37 per cent .

'King of his castle': Former lawyer Paul Baxendale-Walker insists he was within his rights to build a helipad in his garden . For years the retired lawyers and businessmen of Hersham have enjoyed the peace and calm of their genteel village. Until, that is, the arrival of adult TV boss Paul Baxendale-Walker. The entrepreneur is building a helipad in the grounds of the £6million mansion he has bought in the heart of the Surrey stockbroker belt. Residents are outraged, saying the concrete landing site is an eyesore and the resultant noise will wreck their quality of life. But Oxford-educated Mr Baxendale-Walker, who sometimes stars in his pornographic films, is convinced he has done nothing wrong. Responding to his Hersham neighbours’ concerns, the 48-year-old said: ‘Every Englishman’s home is his castle. I am completely entitled to have a helipad on my land. If they want a lift, they can just ask me.’ He bought six-bedroom Burleigh House earlier this year from a property developer. It is near the prestigious Burhill Golf Club and is described by estate agents as ‘a sophisticated, welcoming house, designed in the style of a traditional English country residence’. The helipad is being built on two acres once owned by a part of the Burhill group, which was founded in 1926 to manage the estates of Lord Iveagh, boss of the Guinness empire. A covenant on the land says it must stay as a paddock. ‘We believe the helipad is totally inappropriate,’ said a spokesman for the Burhill Group. ‘We are taking legal action and it is now in our solicitors’ hands.’ Luxury: Mr Baxendale-Walker tore down the existing property to build a modern mansion in the village of Hersham . 'Eyesore': Neighbours said they had hoped the film boss was turning the paddock into a Japanese garden - in fact he was installing a helipad . Malcolm Groom, 62, a retired oil and gas lawyer who lives next to Burleigh House, was one of the first to complain. ‘People like Baxendale-Walker choose . this lovely area because of its quiet serenity and peacefulness and the . moment they arrive they destroy what it is they were looking for,’ he . said. ‘He says he can do what he wants with . his castle but what about our castle?’ Colourful character: Mr Baxendale-Walker, seen at a Loaded Magazine event in London, said he would be happy to give his disgruntled neighbours a lift in his helicopter . His wife Kim said she had . discovered that a helicopter can land 28 times a year without . permission. Jean Connell and her husband John, a . former chairman of The Distillers Company, have lived in their house . next to the paddock for 50 years. Mrs Connell said: ‘A few years ago it was a peaceful little backwater here. ‘Now if this man is going to be . allowed to get away with it you will have helicopters coming in, their . friends arriving.

"By . William Cook . PUBLISHED: . 09:48 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:30 EST, 23 October 2012 . A Second World War veteran who risked his life to transport vital supplies to the Soviet Union has spoken of his anger at being denied a bravery medal by the British government. Bob Cowan, 93, has been offered a medal by Russia for his role in the 1941-1945 Arctic Convoys, but British rules on foreign military honours bar him from accepting it. The Russian embassy recently offered the Ushakov medal for valour to all survivors of the perilous missions to deliver food and munitions to allies on the Eastern Front, on which 3,000 sailors died. 'It's a farce': Bob Cowan, 93, has been told British rules ban him from accepting an award from Russia in recognition of his service on the Second world War Arctic convoys . They have already given the honour to veterans from Australia, Canada and America. But Bob, who braved German torpedo attacks on two convoys in May and October 1942, has been told that Foreign Office red tape prevents him and other veterans from claiming the medal. Under the rules, former British soldiers are not allowed to accept military medals from foreign governments - unless it awards service performed in the past five years or there is no equivalent medal in Britain. Unrecognised: Bob Cowan as a young sailor, left, and the letter from Foreign Secretary William Hague to Bob's MP Gerald Kaufman . But veterans' groups say that the Ushakov medal is a bravery award, and can therefore be awarded in addition to campaign medals that recognise service. Grandad-of-four Bob, who lives in Chorlton, Manchester, with wife Joyce, 87, said: 'It's a farce. It seems like they have been trying to sort out [what recognition we should get] for years. 'I would like to receive the Russian medal. The Russian embassy has the silver medal in its possession so it's just waiting for our government to give it the go-ahead.' Perilous: 3,000 sailors died on the Arctic convoys . Hellish: Sailors braved freezing conditions to deliver essential food and munitions to the Soviet Union . The British Government . has repeatedly denied the Arctic convoy survivors a campaign medal of . their own, insisting the Atlantic Star medal is sufficient. Veterans say the Atlantic Star is . inadequate, as it was created in recognition of a separate Naval . campaign and extended to include those who served on the convoys. The fight to overturn the government ruling has now been taken up by the Labour MP for Gorton Gerald Kaufman. And Bob's friends at community group Chorlton Good Neighbours, plan to conduct a ceremony in his honour - regardless of what the Government decides. Bernard Leach, from the group, said: 'Bob is 93 and in poor health and I don't see why he should not be honoured in this way. It seems mean-spirited of the British government.' A spokesman for the foreign office said: 'We very much appreciate the Russian government's wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the Arctic Convoys. The Arctic covoys delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union during the darkest part of the Second World War. With naval escorts, around 1400 merchant vessels sailed from Britain, Iceland and North America to the Soviet ports of Archangel and Murmansk. The convoys carried food, munitions, weapons and vehicles donated under the Allies' lend-lease agreement. These supplies were vital to Russian troops on the Eastern Front, particularly those resisting the siege of Leningrad. 85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost over the course of the campaign. 'However, the Rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years. 'Additionally, permission cannot be granted if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services. All British Veterans of the Convoys were eligible for the WW2 'Atlantic Star'. Additionally, a lapel badge (the ""Arctic Emblem"") was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued. 'We look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or Commonwealth state award upon a British citizen on an individual case by case basis. We can never comment on individual cases, but, in general terms, the Russian government would need to provide evidence of direct support for Russia in the last five years for any British citizen to be awarded the Ushakov Medal.'","Bob Cowan, 93, took part in missions to deliver supplies to the Soviet Union .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 05:51 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 19 October 2012 . Director Duncan Roy was arrested last November - and held in prison for three months without a trial or the option to post bail . British film director Duncan Roy is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff after, he claims, he became 'lost' in the prison system for three months - with no option to post bail and no legal recourse. The director was caught in what the LA Times called a 'Kafka-esque corner of America's immigration war', after his name was flagged up by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Despite having the means to post a £35,000 bail on an extortion charge, the director, whose best-known film is a semi-autobiographical account, 'AKA', instead became trapped in a vicious circle. The County Sheriff would not accept bail until custom officers had cleared his records - but somehow Roy was lost in the system and a 'ICE hold', which normally lasts 48 hours, was never lifted. Roy, who is recovering from testicular cancer, said he suffered a nervous breakdown during his 89 days inside. Four other plaintiffs are making similar claims against the department, in a lawsuit being filed by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) today. According to the LA Times, Roy was arrested on November 15 in Malibu on an extortion charge. He was in the country legally - but was identified as a suspected legal immigrant when his fingerprints were put through the system. When this occurs, all bail possibilities are held - which the ACLU breaks a 'fundamental principle' of justice. But for Roy, it was worse, for while a hold should be a straightforward procedure, it turned into a three-month nightmare from which there was 'no escape', . It is claimed there are thousands of people who get trapped in similar situations - although the ACLU says in its suit that the holds system may itself have been put on hold in the last week. Incarcerated: Duncan Roy was kept at the Los Angeles Men's Central Jail . Roy's arrest followed issues with the foundations of his L.A. property, after the director says he received a late-night phonecall saying his house foundations were faulty, reducing the property's value. Further incidents led to Roy calling his ex-boyfriend and saying, as Roy tells the LA Times: 'I said: ""You've conned me out of $500,000, and why don't you take the house back? I'll give you the house back for $500,000 - or I could just blog about what you've done to me.' I threatened to blog about him.' The next day, Roy was called to the Sheriff's Department for a meeting - and was arrested for extortion. While he believed his arrest was an over-reaction, instead he found himself on a 'never-ending Möbius strip', spending the first night in cell with no blanket while his lawyers scrambled to release him. Duncan Roy, pictured in 2000, made headlines in the 1980s when he re-invented himself as 'Lord Anthony Rendlesham' But Roy's bondsman, Morris DeMayo, said: 'The minute he got arrested, it was one weird incident after another. The jailer basically said, ""We have an ICE hold, so we can't accept the bond."" There was just a runaround.' Two days later at an arraignment, the judge set bail at $35,000 but was told about the ICE hold, and Roy was remanded to county custody. This was Los Angeles County's Men's Central Jail - which Roy said was 'theatrically unpleasant. 'You're being shouted and screamed at. You're not allowed to look anybody in the eye - you have to look at the floors at all times. It was an understandably barbaric situation. There he claims he was left for long periods without food, and was kept incarcerated except for a once-weekly trip to a roof. The rest of the time he spent in a small cell, awaiting news that never came, trapped in what the ACLU calls a 'legal dead zone' between the ICE and the Sheriff's office. Jenny Pasquarella, of the ACLU of Southern California, said: 'A lot of time, when you talk to immigration about a person who is in custody, they say, ""We can't do anything about it because the person's not in our custody. Talk to the Sheriff."". 'Then you talk to the Sheriff and they say, ""We can't do anything about it. We didn't place the hold."" 'They keep pointing fingers at each other.' Roy, who says he is innocent of the . charges, even debated pleading guilty after three months - during which . Christmas and New Year passed him by. Finally, an fellow prisoner told Roy about the Esperanza Immigrants Rights Project, a Catholic-based charity. He was able to make contact and: 'This woman literally turns up at the dorm, Susanne Griffin. And she's wearing a bright pink suit. 'She said: ""My boss doesn't usually take individual cases, but I think we can take yours."" 'They took my passport information to prove that I was here legally.' And 24 hours later he was free - because Griffin knew 'exactly who to call at ICE'. When she explained the situation, the hold was lifted. ICE told L.A. Weekly: 'Because he had no prior criminal convictions and did not otherwise fall into ICE's enforcement priorities, the agency rescinded the immigration detainer and Mr. Roy did not come into ICE custody.' Roy said: 'You are literally spat out of the jail. Then they pull you through a door, and you're outside. And it's the weirdest feeling. I'm on the street at 3 o'clock in the morning, waiting for the bail guy who's going to take me home.' The LA Times said that Roy 'still seems very much in shock, speaking in a calm, almost disembodied voice that suggests the toll has not sunk in'. He said: 'I still keep an eye on the roads in case a police car comes. I'm terrified they're going to take me back there.' Ironically, the whole drama started when Roy prepared to sell his house for a move to Berlin. But, due to the charges, he now cannot leave America. But at least this time, his prison is a whole country and not a small Kafka cell.","Duncan Roy, who filmed the 2002 film AKA, was arrested and held in L.A. for three months without trial or chance to post bail .

A bullied worker took revenge on his colleagues by offering to make their morning coffee then spiking the drinks with speed. Paul Harries, 52, joked to his workmates that he had made them 'turbo-charged coffee' as he handed them the hot drinks laced with amphetamine, a court heard. Within minutes of taking a sip his victims - who thought the senior supervisor had been referring to an especially strong brand of coffee - began shaking and suffering palpitations. Both project manager Dean Ivey - who described feeling as though 'his hair was standing on end' - and operation manager Grant Fieldhouse needed hospital treatment after Harries spiked their drinks with the Class B drug. Cardiff Crown Court was told that Harries felt he was being bullied at work after he reported staff for drinking alcohol while on duty at McGinley Infrastructure Services in Taffs Well, Cardiff. Harries had complained about workmates he claimed to have seen drinking before working on a rail line. The court heard how Harries found the the word 'grass' scrawled on his car after blowing the whistle on colleagues, and that he later blamed Mr Ivey and Mr Fieldhouse. Prosecutor John Probert said: 'Harries offered to make the morning coffee and asked if they wanted turbo-charged or rocket-fuel drinks. 'They thought he meant a special strong brand he liked but within minutes both men felt ill. 'Turbo-charged': Harries' victims both reported feeling ill within minutes of sipping the drinks . 'Mr Ivey had a dry mouth, goosepimples and palpitations. He felt like his hair was standing on end. 'Mr Fieldhouse started to shake and his heart was racing.' Both men were kept in hospital until their raised heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal. Harries was handed a six month sentence suspended for 12 months after admitting administering a poison with intent at Cardiff Crown Court. Sentencing, Mr Justice MacDuff told Harries: 'This was bordering on wicked - it was a wholly unacceptable reaction to bullying.' The judge added that Harries deserved credit for reporting alleged drinking on duty atMcGinley Infrastructure Services, in Taffs Well, Cardiff. Harries, of Merthyr Tydfil, was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid community work. Speed makes users feel wide awake and excited.

Matthew Mark Kelsey pictured outside Hull Crown Court where he was spared jail after bombarding a 13-year-old girl with sex texts . A piano teacher who bombarded a 13-year-old girl with sex texts has been spared jail after a plea from her parents for mercy. Matthew Mark Kelsey, 24, has been given a community order for sending explicit texts and e-mails to the girl after her mother made a tearful appeal for him to be spared prison. Speaking at Hull Crown Court yesterday, the mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept: 'She doesn’t support this. She hates me and her dad for causing all this.' Kelsey, from Elloughton, East Yorks, had taught the girl to play piano before befriending her on Facebook. They began sending each other explicit e-mails and texts. The court heard they eventually arranged to meet in his car around the corner from her East Riding school, where Kelsey kissed her. The girl’s parents later discovered the messages and called the police however, the court heard they did not want him to be jailed. Prosecutor Nick Adlington said: 'The defendant had been her piano teacher. 'He established contact with her when she started a Facebook account. 'The contact on Facebook developed from low-key, general conversation and pleasantries. 'She said she had a crush on someone older. He told her age was ""just a number"" if two people like each other. 'He suggested she could visit him at his home and tell her family she was going to stay with friends. He told her she should be careful and not tell anyone of their relationship. 'He also asked her if he could kiss her when they met and her response was affirmative. 'There is then a thread of sexually explicit comments.' The girl’s mother asked the judge in the case not to jail Kelsey and said she hoped her daughter would not meet him again in secret. She said: 'I hope she won’t. I’m not going to lie, I just don’t know. I didn’t even know she did Facebook.' Mr Adlington said the attitude of the girl’s parents towards Kelsey was 'extremely charitable'. He said: 'They have made it clear they are saddened it has gone to court and have no desire to see him receive a custodial sentence.' Kelsey pleaded guilty to causing a child under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity. Hull Crown Court, pictured, was told the attitude of the girl¿s parents towards Kelsey was 'extremely charitable' Judge Mark Bury told him: 'You are 24 years old, although I suspect you are a lot less emotionally. 'You got involved with a younger girl whom you met when you had a professional relationship. 'You began texting her and messaging her on Facebook over innocuous matters and then it became more personal. 'Then you were essentially talking about having a sexual relationship with her. You are remorseful and I take the view this was isolated behaviour on your part and behaviour that is not going to be repeated. 'Both your parents and the parents of the girl are sympathetic and supportive of you, which says something about you as a person. 'In all the circumstances it doesn’t seem to me to be necessary or appropriate to send you to custody.' The judge did, however, warn Kelsey he faces a prison sentence if he is caught doing the same thing again. Judge Bury told him: 'You have a lot of offer society in general and I take the view this is an isolated lapse due to your own difficult personal circumstances. 'If any harm had come to her the sentence would have been different.' Kelsey was sentenced to a two-year supervised community order and ordered to attend a sex offenders’ treatment programme. He was also given a five-year restraining order not to contact the child by phone or Facebook or go within 100 metres of her. Kelsey must sign the sex offenders’ register for five years.","Girl's mother made a tearful appeal for Mark Kelsey to be handed a community order .

Afghan police have arrested four people who allegedly beheaded a young woman after she resisted their attempts to force her into prostitution. Mah Gul, 20, was murdered after her mother-in-law tried to force her to sleep with man at her home in the Herat province in the west of the country. Provincial police chief Abdul Ghafar Savedzada confirmed that his officers had arrested the victim's husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and man who killed her, known as Najibullah. Savedzada added that Gul married her husband four months ago and that there had been several previous attempts to force her into prostitution. Najibullah was paraded at a press conference following his arrest where he said that the mother-in-law lured him into killing the woman by telling him she was a prostitute. He said: 'It was around 2:00 am when Gul's husband left for his bakery. I came . down and with the help of her mother-in-law killed her with a knife.' The murder of Mah Gul comes against a backdrop of a world outcry over the shooting by the .

A 15-year-old school girl is determined to drop 16 stone in order for her to have gender reassignment surgery. Raven El Messaoudi has lived as a girl for ten months since coming out as transgender to her family and schoolfriends, and now takes hormone blockers to stop her from adopting male features. The teenager, from Johannesburg, South Africa, used to live on a diet of McDonald's, fried chicken, and 14 eggs-on-toast a day, is on a strict diet in preparation for her surgery at the age of 21. True life: Finally happy living as a woman, transgender teenager Raven El Messaoudi, right, poses with her mother Diane, left, in their home in Edenvale, Johannesburg . Raven suffered bullying at school because of her weight and gender identity and after her teachers refused to allow her to attend as a transgender girl, she is now being home-schooled. Her mother Diana, 44, has agreed Raven can have sex reassignment surgery as soon as she is 21 and a breast augmentation when she reaches her target weight of ten stone. ‘We both know it's going to take a long time,’ Raven, who is 5ft 2in tall and currently weighs 26 stone, said. ‘But it's good to have something to work towards.’ ‘Mum wants me to be sure of my decision to become a woman before I undergo any permanent changes.’ Motivation: Raven has been promised gender reassignment surgery when she turns 21 and a breast augmentation when she reaches ten stone . Mother-daughter time: Raven, seen getting some help with her makeup from Diana, says she loves sharing a wardrobe with her mother . Courage: The 15-year-old stood up on stage in front of her bullies and told them she was transgender . Despite being trapped inside the wrong body, Raven, born as a boy called Sharif, is happy she is allowed to live like a girl. ‘At the moment, I feel like I'm looking through the bars of a prison. I feel like I've been forced to live inside this body. ‘I'm starting to get hair on my lip and chest - it's horrible - so I shave every day.’ She says she is grateful for the support from her mother and brother, especially as other members of the family still insist on calling her Sharif. Raven was taken out of school earlier this year by her mother. ‘Some people found it hard to accept,’ Raven said. ‘There were rumours going round that I was gay, so I got . fed up and took to the stage in front of 80 other pupils. ‘I said: “I'm not gay, I'm transgender. I'm a girl stuck in a boy's body and if you can't accept it, then it's your problem.”' Changes: Raven is pictured as a boy, left, aged 9, and earlier this year, aged 14, when she began living as a girl . Her mother Diana said: ‘When Raven . grew her hair, the school said she wasn't allowed to sit her exams . unless she had it cut. 'I took her to the hairdressers and they hacked it . off - and she looked like a boy again. It broke my heart seeing Raven . so upset.’ On another occasion, Diana discovered that other pupils were planning on throwing pig's blood over her daughter. Boyhood: Raven says growing up, aged 4, left, and eight, right, she felt she was born in the wrong body . She . said: ‘I knew that they'd been calling her a pig, but I never imagined . it would be this bad. Children are cruel, but this cruel? I couldn't . believe it.’ Raven’s battle with her weight started when she began comfort eating to deal with the death of her grandfather. She . used to eat a fried breakfast of fourteen eggs on toast a day, followed . by a large Big Mac with fries and three cheeseburgers on the side, and . two McFlurries. Then she . would snack on chocolate bars before dining on a huge plate of pasta . with four pieces of fried chicken, followed by a whole tub of ice-cream . in front of the TV. Diana herself weighs 20 stone tells a . similar tale of comfort eating which began when her husband Hassid was . shot and killed during a hijack aged 31. Diet: Diane used to feed Raven 14 fried eggs on toast for breakfast, before Raven would go to McDonald's for a lunch of a BigMac and three cheeseburgers before pasta and fried chicken, followed by a tub of ice cream, for dinner . Diana admits she used to overfeed raven and her 12-year-old brother Ali, who weighs 19 stone. ‘I was trapped in a cycle of comfort eating all the time, and I am sorry I passed that on to my children.’ Raven, who is now on a diet, is determined to reach her goal and fulfill her dream of surgery. She said: ‘Me and mum share clothes and I'm growing my hair and wearing makeup - it's great. ‘But on top of everything, knowing I have the support of my mum means the world.’ Support: The 15-year-old says she is ready to take on the challenge to lose weight thanks to the backing she gets from her mother and brother Ali .","Raven El Messaoudi, 15, is 5ft 2in and currently weights 26 stone .

A photo has emerged of the beautiful . family-of-six that was destroyed when a neighbor shot five members - two fatally - in a pre-dawn home invasion. Desmond John Moses, 55, was wearing a painter's mask and a . bulletproof vest when he entered the Lamas family home in Inglewood, California, in the early hours of Saturday morning. He set his bungalow ablaze before entering his neighbors' house in a murderous rage because he blamed them for an eviction notice he had . received from their landlord, it is believed. Filimon Lamas, 33, was shielding three of his children when he was killed. Tragic: Gloria Jimenez and her husband Filimon Lamas are seen here with their four children. Mr Lamas and his four-year-old son were killed. Ms Jimenez, her seven-year-old daughter and six-year-old son were wounded . His wife Gloria . Jiminez, 28, was shot in both legs but managed to carry their seriously . wounded four-year-old boy out of the house, police said. Paramedics found her collapsed on the street. The child, who was shot in the head, died in hospital. Investigators believe Moses, who shot . himself in the head after the rampage, entered the family's home around 4am wearing a . dark cap and a white painter's mask. Suspect: Police believe Desmond John Moses, 55, attacked his neighbors after being served with an eviction notice . He is thought to have fired ten times, also wounding a seven-year-old girl in the chest, while a six-year-boy suffered a bullet wound to the . pelvis. An eight-year-old boy escaped injury. The mother and daughter remain in hospital in a stable condition; the six-year-old boy has been released. Moses had lived in the bungalow . behind the Lamas' home for 17 years. Police recovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver registered to Moses at the scene. His body, burned beyond recognition, . was found inside the bungalow late on Saturday. Detectives are almost . certain it is him; an autopsy to be carried out today will determine . whether it is. Moses had 'what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the head,' wore body armor and carried additional ammunition in his pockets. Relatives said Mr Lamas and Ms . Jiminez were high school sweethearts who recently got approval for a . home loan, and were looking to move out of their property, where they . had lived for eight years, and into a bigger house. Authorities launched a manhunt and . evacuated surrounding homes after the shooting rampage, but it wasn't . until hours later that they found the charred body because it was hidden . under layers of debris. The Los Angeles Times yesterday . reported that Moses has held a security guard registration with the . California Department of Consumer Affairs since 1984. However, police . said they did not know whether he was working as a security guard. Mr Lamas owned a small cafe near his home and had worked hard to turn it into a thriving business. Victims: Ms Jimenez was shot in the pelvis and knee while she carried her wounded daughter out of the house . Aftermath: Emergency personnel respond to the scene of the deadly shooting in Inglewood . Investigation: Police recovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver registered to Moses at the scene . The house where the family lived was next door to Ms Jimenez's parents' home. Her brother, Jaime, told the Times that Mr Lamas was a devoted family man. 'All he breathed was his family. All he did, all he talked about was his family,' Mr Jimenez said of his brother-in-law. Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said: 'The father was found draped over two of the children, shielding them.' Police kept fire crews away from the . burning home due to concerns that the gunman was still inside or hiding . nearby in the bushes, KCAL reported. About 8.30am, they were allowed to . approach the residence and managed to extinguish the flames. Ablaze: Moses was wearing a painter's mask and a bulletproof vest when he entered the Lamas family home . Motive? Moses lived in a bungalow behind the property, but was recently evicted .

A British grandmother living in South Africa was stabbed, beaten and left in her car boot for ten hours after being kidnapped. Dorothy Carlyle's car was hijacked in Durban on Tuesday and she was driven around while tied up and forced to make cash withdrawals from ATM machines. Originally from Londonderry, the 59-year mother-of-three was only freed after a police gun battle and is now recovering from her wounds in hospital. The terrifying ordeal began when she . was attacked by three men with knives as she got into her silver BMW car . on her driveway at her home. Her daughters  Lauren and Brooke told South African news website Independent Online their mother had left the house after lunch at 2:30pm  to go to her job as a Durban estate agent. She had moved to the South Africa after leaving Ireland thirty years ago. They recalled hearing a scream, but thought it was the children next door and then left the home to buy her a birthday present. They . only raised the alarm when their mother failed to arrive home at 5:30pm . and her office confirmed she had not attended work. Attacked: Victim Dorothy Carlyle, left, with her two daughters. The 59-year-old was stabbed, beaten and left in her car boot for ten hours after being kidnapped . Lauren alerted the police, but claimed her report was not taken seriously and a friend of the family hired a private detective. They also alerted her son Mark who flew over from London to join the search. Her brother-in-law Paul Carlyle, told the Londonderry Sentinel Mrs Carlyle was stabbed with a screwdriver every time she tried to speak. He said the only reason she was kept her alive because the kidnappers were waiting to force her to withdraw more money yesterday. 'Every time she spoke they stabbed her with a screwdriver,' said Mr Carlyle whose late brother was married to Mrs Carlyle but died in 2006. Gun battle: Police stand over handcuffed suspects in this photo, taken in the immediate aftermath of the shootout between police and Mrs Carlyle's alleged abductors . Her daughter Lauren said her mother was shown off 'like a trophy' as passengers got in and out of the car. 'They slapped her if she spoke,' Lauren said. She said that at one point she asked a young boy for water who was in the car and he asked his mother who refused. She believed they were arguing about who was going to kill her,' Lauren said. Ms Carlyle was eventually found ten hours later outside a tavern in KwaMashu. She had managed to activate a satellite vehicle tracking device in the car. After a shoot-out with the hijackers, police arrested two women and a man while continuing the search for two more men.

The son of the man arrested on suspicion of abducting April Jones has joined the search for the missing five-year-old, it has emerged. Scott Williams told reporters that he has been looking for April ever since she disappeared at 7pm on Monday evening from near her home in Machynlleth. Mark Bridger, 46, was arrested on suspicion of abduction on Tuesday afternoon as he walked along a road on the outskirts of the Mid Wales market town wearing a camouflage jacket and waterproof trousers. Help: Scott Williams, 19, told reporters that he has been looking for April ever since she disappeared . He has been in custody ever since and . this morning police revealed they now have until 5pm tomorrow to . question him over April's disappearance. Since Monday night hundreds of volunteers from the local area have been scouring the local area to look for the child - including Mr Williams. The 19-year-old told Sky News that his father's arrest was nothing to do . with his family. He said: 'He has never been in my life. I have . only met him on a couple of occasions like down the local pub – he's . been there a couple of times that I've been there. Unemployed: Mark Bridger has had a colourful love life and a long line of different jobs . 'But it was a shock when we heard it on the news that he'd been arrested.' He added that he had joined the local community to search for April 'since she's gone missing', and said that his father had 'never done anything to anyone'. Mr Williams' mother is local woman Julie Williams, who Bridger married in June 1990 in Machynlleth, but the couple have not spoken for years. Today police have continued to appeal for information about Bridger's whereabouts between 6.30pm on Monday and 3.30pm on Tuesday. Yesterday officers took the unusual step of issuing a photograph of . Bridger and of his Land Rover – although officers stressed that he is . only one of several lines of inquiry. His complex private life . began to emerge as it was revealed he has a . colourful love life and a long line of different jobs.

Born in Sutton, Surrey, the Bridger was known to April’s parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 43, after his move to Wales in the 1980s. The divorcee has had a string of . relationships in Machynlleth, and he has fathered at least . three children with two women on the Bryn-y-Gog estate where April . lives. Railwayman Glen Lewis, 50, remembers him moving to the town to work as a lifeguard 15 years ago around the time the leisure centre was built. 'I know him well enough to wave to. I’ve always thought of him as a bit of a ladies man,' he said today. Friends described him as being a regular visitor on the estate. It has been previously suggested that he is a former soldier but there . is no record of him ever having been employed by the Ministry of . Defence. Bridger is still on good terms with Elaine Dafydd, the mother to two of . his children. Mrs Dafydd is now married to a new partner and has a four-year-old girl. Up until two years ago, Bridger was living with a local woman named Corinna Robinson, but they have since split up. Press conference: Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan holds pictures of Bridger and his vehicle at a media conference.

He’s never been single for long and has . always got on with people even though  this is a very small community – . everyone knows everyone else’s business here.’ Locals described Bridger as quiet but friendly, and revealed that he was a member of the local pub darts and cricket teams. One said: ‘Mark had always  been very friendly and trying to  fit in since he moved here 20-odd years ago.

A coroner has warned about the dangers of alcohol after a quantity surveyor drank a pint of rum 'for a laugh' and later died. Andrew Thompson, 29, had been drinking cans of lager with friends at a football match then went to a friend's house where a group of men were drinking shots of fortified wine. A friend recalled Mr Thompson being 'full of bravado' and pouring a bottle of rum into a pint glass and downing it in one, an inquest heard in Leeds. Mr Thompson was taken to St James' Hospital in Leeds but died five days later on March 29 this year . He fell asleep on the sofa and . appeared to be snoring but about 2am his pals noticed he was a different . colour and called an ambulance. Mr Thompson, from Allerton Bywater, . West Yorkshire, a keen sportsman who regularly undertook charity events, . was taken to St James' Hospital in Leeds but died five days later on . March 29 this year. He sustained a severe brain injury caused by cardiac respiratory arrest. West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff . said his alcohol level was 379 mg per 100 mls of blood which was almost . five times the legal limit for driving. It would have caused him to fall into a . deep sleep, stifling his cough reflex and causing his stomach contents . to enter his lungs. He said: 'Andrew was a very bright and . charming man who excelled in everything he did, especially in his work. He had a great love of sport and retained his friendships right from . infant school into adulthood. 'He strikes me as a man who enjoyed . life. Very sadly on this occasion he very foolishly had a great deal to . drink, not just a few pints but to actually drink neat rum in the . quantity he did pushed his blood level to within a fatal range.' He said his death should act as a warning to others. Mr Hinchliff said: 'He did it but . didn't intend the outcome. It was just a group of young men having a few . drinks with a bit of rivalry and bravado and I suspect he liked to be . at the centre of things and he did it for a laugh. 'I'm not convinced people know how dangerous alcohol can be. When people are consuming alcohol to that level it has this effect. 'It is a warning to others that what seems like a laugh at the time can have very serious consequences.'

People living in Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect to spend a smaller proportion of their lives in good health than their English and Welsh neighbours, new figures suggest. The amount of life spent in good general health is increasing in England and Wales but falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Could diet be to blame? Scottish youngsters can expect to enjoy fewer healthy years compared to the English and Welsh (file picture) And health authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland should expect increasing demands on services, researchers concluded. Boys born in England between 2008 and 2010, who are expected to live to the age of 78, are estimated to spend 64 years in good health. Those born in Scotland, who are expected to live for almost 76 years, have a 'health life expectancy' of just under 60 years, data shows. Similarly, girls born in Wales between 2008 and 2012 can expect to live 63 of their estimated 81.7 years of life in good health. The number of years spent in good health for girls born in Northern Ireland is 61.9. The authors said: 'These findings indicate that Scotland and Northern Ireland may face proportionally greater future demands on health services than England and Wales due to the well established link between self-rated health and subsequent mortality and health service use.' While life expectancy continues to increase across the UK, researchers wanted to assess whether the additional years were spent in good or bad health. Across the UK as a whole, people can expect to spend more than 80 per cent of their lives in good or very good general health. For boys born between 2008 and 2010, they could expect to live 63.5 years in good health - 81% of the life expectancy of 78.1. The average time for girls to live in good health was 65.7 years - 80 per cent of the female life expectancy of 82.1. Dr Ros Altmann, Director-General of Saga, comments: 'The latest figures showing that more of us are staying healthy into later life these days are really something to celebrate.  Medical advances have brought such success in helping people live longer. That does also mean re-evaluating our lives too. 'Working longer, keeping active - and saving more if you can - are vital ingredients of managing the ageing population. We need to help older people look after themselves where possible and help younger people appreciate the value of elders.'",Scottish boys can expect to enjoy four fewer years of good health than English boys .

She finally had a body to be proud of and put her tiredness and lethargy down to the hours spent in the gym. But her exhaustion and her weight loss were in fact signs of bowel cancer. Dramatic: Melanie Swan-Horton went down six dress sizes but unfortunately it was because she had developed bowel cancer . Unfortunately Mel ignored the symptoms and put them down to the side effects of her diet and exercise regime. Now after surgery and chemotherapy the married mother of two from Norwich, in Norfolk, has been told nothing more can be done to save her life. Because she missed the warning signs for so long the cancer has now spread to her liver and lungs. Brave: Mrs Swan-Horton with her husband Kristian. She says she wants to let make . everyone aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer before she dies . Bowel cancer affects more than 36,500 people in the UK every year. It is the second most common cancer in women -  around 18,400 new cases were diagnosed in the UK in 2009. The biggest single risk factor is age as the chances of having bowel cancer go up after 50. 1 in 10 people are under 50 when they get bowel cancer - Melanie Swan-Horton (featured) is 46. Early bowel cancer may have no symptoms. Initial symptoms can also occur in people with less serious problems such as haemorrhoids.However, the NHS recommends seeing your doctor if you notice the following: . If you are worried about any symptoms you can also call the Bowel Cancer UK Support line on 0800 8403540 . She said: ‘I’m still having treatment, but it’s palliative care now just to keep me going. ‘I’m . mentally and physically exhausted and I’m finding it hard to keep going . at the moment but I don’t want to let this horrible disease win. ‘Before . I die I want every man and woman in Britain to know the signs of bowel . cancer. I thought I was getting really slim and fit but it was the . cancer killing me and other slimmers need to be aware.’ She . is concerned that in the run up to the holiday period women who are . dieting may also miss the tell tale signs and symptoms which are putting . their own lives at risk. The former charity manager said: ‘ I’m not trying to panic people but I genuinely thought I was slimmer, fitter and happier than ever. When I heard them say incurable cancer I was shocked and devastated. ‘I just want people to know the facts so they can get checked out. If I had it may have saved my life.’ Melanie, 46, started slimming to rebuild her confidence after a divorce two years ago. She followed a high protein plan for fast results and soon dropped from a size 16 to a size ten. Melanie met her new husband Kristian, 36, who regularly worked out at the gym and encouraged Melanie to join him. Within three months of working out with weights she had achieved an enviable bikini body. ‘When I looked in the mirror I couldn’t believe it was me. I’d gone from a frumpy middle-aged mother to toned and slim. It was astonishing and I loved buying a bikini for the first time in years.’ ‘My confidence rocketed and I wished I had done it sooner.' Big change: Mrs Swan-horton followed a high protein plan for fast results after meeting her now husband Kristian who regularly worked out . Working out: Training in the gym hid the signs of Mrs Swan-Horton's underlying bowel . cancer. As she thought she was getting healthier the cancer was . spreading . But at the same time she started feeling drained and tired. ‘ It was no surprise really because I was spending up to two hours in the gym so I thought nothing of it. When Melanie noticed blood in the toilet she was alarmed. ‘ I was shocked at first but then I remembered hearing that lifting weights could cause small bleeds so again I put it down to the exercise. ‘All the pieces of the puzzle seemed to fit. Of course if it had come out of the blue and if I hadn’t been dieting and lifting weights I would have gone to the GP immediately.’ But three months later with the bleeding persisting she finally saw her doctor. He referred her to hospital and two weeks later she went back for the results. It was then that she was told she was suffering from bowel cancer. Tying the knot: Melanie Swan-Horton and husband Kristian on their wedding day . Chemotherapy treatment to shrink the tumour to an operable size started immediately. But on the operating table doctors discovered the cancer had now spread to her liver. Despite further chemotherapy, tumours were then found in her lungs. A week after the devastating news Melanie married Kristian last September in Cyprus in front of her twin daughters aged 24. Back home she continued chemotherapy but was recently told it had stopped working. Disguised: Melanie says she doesn't want to scare people but wants them to know the facts about bowel cancer so they can get checked out . Battling: Mrs Swan-Horton has been told there is nothing more that can be done for her but says she doesn't want to give up fighting for more time with her daughters, husband and family and friends . ‘I was told there was nothing more that could be done for me. There was a slight possibility of taking part in clinical trials to keep it at bay for a little longer but I knew it would be draining so my doctors agreed I could go on holiday and think it over. ‘I decided to try but it’s very hard and I feel very poorly now. I’ll do my best to keep going though. ‘I haven’t asked how long I have because I don’t want to give up fighting for more time with my daughters, husband, family and friends. ‘They have all been amazing and I love them all to bits. I don’t think I would have got this far without their support. ‘If bowel cancer is found in time it can be cured so if you read my story and you have any of the symptoms please see your GP.’","Melanie Swan-Horton's dramatic weight loss was due to bowel cancer .

Ali, who has suffered from Parkinson's Disease since 1984, appeared visibly frail as he was presented in front of the Miami crowd during the 'uncomfortable' and 'unnecessary' appearance. The boxing legend was transported on to the pitch very slowly in a cart, his arms shaking heavily as Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria clutched his hand and held his shoulder. The Miami Marlins stadium announcer attempted to generate a crowd response during Ali's appearance, but bewildered baseball fans instead looked in with sadness and apparent discomfort at the great man's clearly deteriorating health.

A young mother was killed by a party drug while marking the death hours earlier of a friend who had taken the same substance. Lynette Nock, 28, collapsed in front of friends she had invited to her house after the death of Carl Fearon, 24. Both are believed to have taken GBL, which comes in liquid form and is mixed with soft drinks. Tragic pair: Carl Fearon, left, died after apparently taking GBL - just hours before his friend Lynette Nock, right, died after allegedly using the same party drug . Fresh agony: Miss Nock's home in Northfield, where she died during a memorial party for Mr Fearon at 9pm on the day of his death . Saturday’s deaths are the latest linked to the Class C drug that can be purchased legally as an alloy-wheel cleaner. Known to clubbers as ‘coma in a bottle’, . GBL achieved notoriety three years ago when it claimed the life of . medical student Hester Stewart, whose mother now campaigns to raise . awareness of its dangers. GBL is usually diluted with water or juice and is virtually tasteless, but produces a high not dissimilar to ecstasy. It can damage the kidneys, liver and the stomach lining and can lead to psychosis. Once . in the body, chemical reactions turn GBL into now notorious drug GHB, . which was banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug. Although . legal for use in the chemical industry - in cleaning products, solvents . and paints - it has been banned for recreational use since 2009 and is a . Class C drug. Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Sarah O'Dowd, 24, who drowned in her bath in October 2007. Brighton medical student Hester Stewart died in April after taking GBL and drinking alcohol. A 25-year-old man died hours after taking GBL on its own while out clubbing in 2008. But . because traces of GBL remain in the body for only up to 12 hours after . consumption, the true number of fatalities is unknown. Family and friends yesterday spoke of their shock at losing Miss Nock, an accountant with a ten-year-old son. Mr Fearon, an Aston Martin engineer and . former Ibiza holiday rep, is thought to have collapsed on Friday night . at a party in Birmingham. His body was discovered on Saturday afternoon. A few hours later Miss Nock invited . grieving friends to her flat in the Northfield area of the city, where . she was found dead that evening. Two male guests were taken to hospital . with overdoses but have since been discharged. Police are treating both . deaths as unexplained while toxicology tests are carried out. Miss Nock’s father, Dave, 69, said: ‘Was . it that their drink was spiked? From what I’ve read, this GBL has no . taste and no smell. It could easily have been slipped into a drink. They . could have been oblivious to it.’ Mr Nock, who has custody of his grandson . Christopher, heard from his daughter on Saturday when she called to . tell him of Mr Fearon’s death. ‘She was sobbing her heart out and was . in bits over his death,’ he added. ‘There was no mention of drugs. The . last thing she said was that she would phone us later on. The whole . family is in shock. Lynette was so kind. ‘I want to know how many other people will have to die before something is done about GBL. It’s a lethal drug. A killer.’ Miss Nock’s cousin, Melanie Adams, said: . ‘Lynette was always sensible, a nice girl who worked hard. She liked to . party and drink with her friends. ‘She went to festivals and had fun but I . really didn’t think she would dabble in something like this, especially . after her friend died. ‘I just feel for her son and her . parents. My dad went round to see them and Lynette’s mum collapsed in . his arms. Dave had a heart attack when he was told. It’s just such a . shock.’ Rave drug: Both Miss Nock, left, and Mr Fearon, right, had apparently used the legal high often used for making alloy wheels . Kind-hearted: Miss Nock was described by her heartbroken parents Dave and Tracie as a 'golden girl who would help anybody' Dark day: Three people were taken to hospital after the wake held for Aston Martin worker Mr Fearon . Maryon Stewart, whose Angelus Foundation . campaigns for drugs education in schools, said: ‘It is unforgiveable . that two people have died taking the same stuff in the same day. ‘Young people think it is just a party drug but withdrawals when you take GBL are worse than heroin. ‘It is a horrendous drug. If they knew what it did, no one in their right mind would take it. ‘The problem is people don’t care . enough.

Bleddyn King, 18 (pictured) is alleged to have stabbed David Evans, 63, and then used his mobile phone to film his body . A teenage killer used his mobile phone to film the body of his victim after brutally stabbing him 72 times, a court has heard. Bleddyn King, 18, allegedly recorded a chilling soundtrack to the video after killing David Evans, 63, in his own home. Cardiff Crown Court heard King said: 'F*** around with me and this is what happens. You **** with me and you **** with the best.' King is alleged to have used an internet dating site for gay men to contact Evans with the intention of robbing him. A murder jury was told King went to Evans' country bungalow, where the widower lived alone, pulled a knife on him and stabbed him so forcefully the blade was left bent. Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees QC said: 'It was brutality of the extreme kind. 'After he was dead King videoed his body while giving a dialogue (sic) of what he had done and why he was doing it. 'It was because he was short of money. 'He made a video of the death scene to scare people he may have owed money to. 'He is heard saying: '**** around with me and this is what happens. You **** with me and you **** with the best.' 'The film was made to instil fear of him in somebody else.' Death scene: Police forensics officers outside the house where the body of 63-year-old David Evans was found . Torched: King is alleged to have set fire to the bungalow before making his escape . The court heard King then stabbed Mr Evans’ cat Jess to death before setting the bungalow on fire and escaping. Father-of-two Evans, of Pentyrch, near Cardiff, was described as a ‘lost soul' following the death of his wife Christine, and was said to have turned to gay websites. He was only 5ft 6in tall and weighed eight-and-a-half stones compared to King who was described as having a 'muscular and powerful physique'. Mather-Lees said: 'Mr Evans was a quiet and gentle man who had married, had two boys and lived in France for a time. 'He and his wife moved back to Cardiff, where he nursed her when she became ill.' The court heard King used the name 'Big Wolf 1993' on the gay website where he contacted Evans and another man after hatching a plan to rob them. Mather-Lees said: 'He developed a plan - he deliberately, callously and brutally targeted a gay man for his own gain. 'He chose a gay man because he thought he would be somebody more vulnerable and that if he survived his attack would be less likely to complain. 'It was a plain and simple premeditated robbery with extreme violence contemplated. 'It was executed and then followed with cynical lies.' King, of Abercynon, near Pontypridd, denies murder but has admitted manslaughter. The trial continues.

Banker Stephen Hester faced calls to forfeit his bonus and fall on his sword yesterday after the computer meltdown continued to cause chaos for millions. A leading peer said there was ‘no question’ of the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive receiving an annual  bonus from the state-owned bank – if he was allowed to keep his job. His remarks came as it emerged the software support team for the at-fault computer programme is based in India. 'Out of touch': Outspoken Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott has said there is 'no question' of Stephen Hester, chief executive of Natwest parent RBS, receiving a bonus from the state-controlled bank this year . As well as his short-term bonus, . Hester is also eligible for £7.9million of long term incentive awards . over a number of years, provided he meets performance targets. But he cannot even guarantee that the . crisis – which has led to a backlog of 100 million transactions – will . have been ironed out by the end of the week amid claims from insiders . that the ‘priority incident’ is far from being resolved. Customers called for him to resign and . accused RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, of . repeatedly lying about fixing the computer fault which triggered the . week of misery for the group’s 16.9million account holders. In a day of dramatic developments: . As the crisis dragged into a second . week, RBS insisted its computer systems were now ‘operating normally’, . although it admitted there was still a backlog to clear. But customers questioned how an . apparently routine software update on Tuesday night could have brought . millions of accounts to a standstill. No money: A mother with a baby passes a NatWest cashpoint which says millions have been left high and dry due to 'tecnical difficulties' in Olney, Buckinghamshire . RBS has refused to offer a full . explanation about what caused its computer systems to fail but has . insisted the fault happened in Britain and was not caused by the . outsourcing of operations to India. However insiders have confirmed to . the Mail that key support staff are based in Hyderabad where they are . employed on salaries of up to £11,000 a year. Internet scammers are trying to cash in on the NatWest crisis by conning customers into handing over their bank details. E-mails claiming to be from the bank were being sent out within hours of the problems becoming public. The scam emails - with the subject line: 'Important Information for Our Customers' - appear to take anyone who opens it to a NatWest site where it asks them to verify their accounts by entering their confidential login information. Yesterday one NatWest customer revealed how she was almost duped into filling in the form as concern over the problems with the bank grew. She said: ‘When I saw the email I opened it, and it was very realistic. Normally I ignore these emails because I know there are a lot of con artists out there, but with everything going on at NatWest, I almost fell for it. ‘Its despicable that criminals are trying to take advantage of what is, already, a very stressful time.’ NatWest warned customers on its website to ignore any communications on the internet which asked for details. Anti-scam website Millersmiles monitors and reports on online confidence tricks and alerts the banks whose customers are being targeted. They said they first recorded the NatWest con late last week and the spoof website had been traced to Derby. In a staff email seen by the Mail, RBS . admitted nightly ‘critical updates’ failed to run normally on Tuesday . and Wednesday last week, meaning computer systems and customer balance . information were not updated. ‘These updates bring all balance and transaction information in customer accounts up to date,’ said the email. ‘These processes failed to run in the . normal times on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. The result is that our . systems and customer balance information is not currently up to date. ‘In some circumstances customers have not been able to access payments into their accounts. This is a priority incident.’ The Financial Services Authority is . expected to question what went wrong and Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of . the Commons Treasury select committee, said MPs would also expect a . ‘full explanation’. Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal . Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the crisis was the latest in a ‘series . of disasters’ to hit the bank, which has faced public criticism for its . failure to lend to small businesses since its taxpayer bail-out. Earlier this year, its former chief executive Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his role in the bank’s failure. Mr Hester took home more than . £1.2million last year after he agreed to waive a £1.6million bonus . following weeks of political pressure. He could be in line for a share . bonus of up to £2.4million this year, or £3million for exceptionally . good performance, and is eligible for £7.9million in long-term incentive . awards, if he hits his targets. Asked if RBS executives would receive . bonuses this year, Mr Hester said: ‘Anyone who is thinking about . bonuses, I’m afraid I have no patience for them.’ Lord Oakeshott said: ‘If Stephen . Hester even thinks there’s any question of him getting a bonus this year . that just shows how out of touch he is with ordinary taxpayers and . customers ... There is a very serious question whether he should still . be in his job.’ Eddy Weatherill, of the Independent . Banking Advisory Service, said: ‘The very basics of banking seem to have . eluded RBS. I feel there are no bonuses to be given here for any of the . top executive team.’ RBS is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £2billion bailout following the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Hester promised a ‘drains-up’ investigation into what had gone wrong and said senior management would . face ‘proper accountability’, but refused to give a commitment that . everything would be working normally by Friday. He said: ‘I hope that the problems are . very substantially solved and as we go through the week we get through . the backlog of complaints.’ Parent group RBS has said it will . reimburse any customer for penalty charges or overdraft fees incurred . because of the crisis, and will work to ensure credit ratings were not . affected. But it is not clear whether account holders will be offered . compensation for so-called consequential losses, such as property . purchases falling through or being stranded abroad. Shares in RBS fell three per cent . yesterday and the group is expected to face a compensation bill for . millions of pounds, coupled with overtime payments for staff who worked . at the weekend. City analysts said the total bill was likely to exceed £50million and could reach £100million. RBS has persistently refused to reveal . how many of its 16.9million customers have been affected by the glitch. But Ulster Bank said its total alone was 100,000. Last night RBS sent an email to . customers, saying it would increase credit card limits by £100 and waive . charges and cash advance fees. Some 1,200 branches will continue to . open for extended hours, from 8am to 6pm until Friday.","Lord Oakeshott says there is 'no question' of RBS chief Stephen Hester receiving an annual bonus - if he keeps his job at all .

A mother feared her toddler could go blind in one eye after he bit into a liquid laundry capsule, causing detergent to squirt in his face. Layla Miles believes that her 22-month-old son Riley had mistaken the pink Vanish Powershot Gel Cap for a sweet. It is the latest in a string of cases in which young children have been injured after putting detergent capsules, which are used in dishwashers and washing machines, into their mouths. Agony: Riley Leach screamed as his right eye swelled shut after he bit into a liquid laundry capsule . The brightly coloured capsules, known as 'liquitabs' cause an immediate chemical burn, resulting in breathing problems as the airway swells. The consequences can be fatal without medical attention. One hospital in Scotland has already seen five cases this year, and today the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) called on manufacturers to redesign the packaging of the capsules to deter children from playing with them. Ms Myles, 30, of Ashford, Kent, described how Riley screamed as his eye swelled shut and the chemicals inside the capsule also got into his mouth and on his stomach. 'I heard him scream,' she told the Sun. 'The chemicals were burning him. I was terrified he wouldn't be able to see properly.' Riley was kept in hospital for four days and put on a drip. He is due to go back to hospital today for a check-up, but doctors do not believe that he suffered any internal damage. Medics will monitor the child's sight every three months. The scare has prompted Ms Myles to warn other parents of the dangers of leaving liquid laundry capsules where children can find them. She said: 'I want to warn parents to keep the capsules locked away in a cupboard. We had left ours on the side and somehow Riley managed to climb up. Injured: Riley is recovering well (left) after he was kept in hospital for four days (right) and put on a drip, but doctors will monitor his sight every three months . 'The capsules come in a child-proof plastic box, but Riley still got into it.' The . National Poisons Information Service recorded 647 reports of injury . involving detergent capsules last year. Some 850million capsules are sold . in the UK each year. Sheila Merrill, public health adviser at the RoSPA, said: 'The safe storage of all household chemicals and medicines is absolutely crucial so we encourage families to keep items like laundry detergents in a lockable cupboard. Fear: Layla Miles believes that her 22-month-old son Riley had mistaken the pink Vanish Powershot Gel Cap for a sweet . 'In addition to children accidentally squirting detergent in their eyes, doctors have also recently raised awareness of the risk of children ingesting detergent – accidents that have reportedly caused near-fatal injuries. 'Given the seriousness of some of the injuries already caused, it is perhaps time for the industry to look again at the way these products are packaged. 'So often they are brightly coloured and very tactile – and must be quite attractive to young children, who may mistake them for sweets or toys.' Riley's case came to light less than a . fortnight after it emerged that five children under the age of two have . been admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow this . year after possibly thinking they were jelly sweets. Doctors called for childproof . packaging for the products and advised parents to take a child to their . nearest A&E unit as soon as possible if it is suspected they have . swallowed something poisonous. Dr Lyndsay Fraser, from the . hospital's ear, nose and throat department, said: 'We have known for . some time about the risk of eye injuries from kids squeezing these . liquitabs until they burst. 'What we have seen more recently is . that children are biting into the tablets, presumably because they think . they are sweets as they have the same soft texture and bright . colouring. 'The alkaline chemicals in the . liquitab cause an immediate chemical burn, causing breathing problems as . the airway starts to swell rapidly. Getting them to hospital straight . away is imperative. 'In most of the cases seen so far, we . have had to insert a breathing tube to protect the child's airway from . the swelling and help them breathe. 'If these children hadn't reached A&E on time, the airway could close over completely with potentially fatal consequences.' Once the breathing tube is inserted, children can be on a ventilator for as long as two weeks until the swelling settles. One child admitted to the hospital required further surgery to repair the damage caused by the capsule. Dr Fraser said: 'It really is only good fortune that we haven't seen a death resulting from this type of injury. Butylphenyl methylpropional: . A synthetic fragrance that is also used in a number of beauty products. It is considered safe only within recommended use of concentration.However, . it is a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin . applications at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage. Alpha-isomethyl Ionone: Banned . by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) from being mixed into . fragrance products, such as perfume and cologne, it . has been found to irritate the skin and trigger allergic reactions in . some people. However, it is still found in detergents and other . cosmetics that are not classed as a 'fragrance'. Linalool, Hexyl cinnamal, Citronellol: Severe . allergens that be listed on the label because they are severe . allergens. Higher concentrations can even cause central nervous system . disruption (thus their use in certain pesticides) and skin, eye and . respiratory tract irritation. These chemicals can also trigger asthma . attacks. 'It is important parents realise that these liquid capsules are dangerous chemicals and they should be kept locked away so children can't reach them. They must be stored safely at all times, out of reach and sight of young children. 'Wherever possible and, as with all household cleaning products and bleaches, they should be stored in a locked cupboard or in a cupboard that cannot be accessed by children.' Dr Fraser and his colleagues have published a letter in the medical journal Archives of Diseases in Childhood to alert medics and parents to the danger. Earlier this month, concerned mother Shannon Hutchison revealed how her seven-month-old daughter spent 10 days in hospital and was treated in intensive care after eating the contents of a tablet. 'Orla was at my sister's house playing with my two-year-old nephew who managed to get hold of one of these liquitabs,' Ms Hutchison said. 'He thought it was a sweetie because it was bright and like a jelly, so he gave it to Orla who bit into it. 'Immediately we realised there was a problem as she was going in and out of consciousness, so phoned an ambulance right away. It was terrifying. I'm just so lucky to still have my little girl. 'Now I make sure that all the liquitabs are locked away and I tell everyone to do the same. 'The boxes they come in really should be child-proof and I hope manufacturers do something about this as I wouldn't want this to happen to any other little girl or boy.' Philip Malpass, director general of . the UK Cleaning Products Industry Association, said that manufacturers . were taking steps to make their products safer. 'Companies . are introducing child-frustrating closures, there have always been . safe-use icons, and where companies have packaged the capsules in clear . boxes we are increasingly seeing that those boxes are milky or opaque so . children cannot see what is inside,' he added. 'The . simplest way to reduce the number of incidents to zero would be for . parents to keep the capsules out of the reach of children.' Warning: Riley was injured after he bit into a pink Vanish Powershot Gel Cap which he had apparently mistaken for a sweet . A spokesman for Reckitt Benckiser, the company which makes Vanish products, said: 'When developing our products we are also always looking for formats which are effective, practical, convenient, but above all safe for consumers. 'The safety and quality of all our Vanish products is always our primary objective. 'This includes clear user instructions on the pack which should always be followed. 'As with all household cleaning products these include clear instructions that products of this type should be stored safely and kept away from small children. 'In the case of Vanish Power Shots this warning is clearly on the lid and the box has been designed to make it difficult for children to open. 'We are unaware of the details of this particular case as we have not heard directly from the family. 'However, we take it very seriously and will urgently look into the case.'","Layla Miles feared 22-month-old son Riley Leach would go blind in one eye .

Ian Brady ‘died’ and had to be resuscitated during the seizure that hospitalised him earlier this year, it emerged yesterday. The Moors Murderer’s heart stopped for seven minutes and doctors used a defibrillator to revive him, his self-styled mental health advocate has revealed. Brady, 74, who has been campaigning for years for the right to starve himself to death, was furious when he discovered what had happened, Jackie Powell said. She claimed the child killer lodged written instructions with staff at high security Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Merseyside, where he is being held, that his life should not be saved if he ever lost consciousness.But it is believed that because Brady is classed as mentally ill his wishes were disregarded. Miss Powell, 47, said Brady collapsed in July while being interviewed by a psychiatrist preparing for his appearance at a mental health tribunal. It would have been the first time he had been seen in public for almost five decades. The tribunal was due to hear claims from Brady that he was sane and could be moved to a regular prison, where he would not be prevented from starving himself to death. He has been tube fed against his will for the last 13 years. Miss Powell told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He (Brady) suddenly started having small convulsions. At first, they thought it was hiccups. Quickly, they grew more severe. Suddenly, he collapsed and went into a full seizure. He lost consciousness for several minutes. ‘Help was called and several doctors and nurses rushed in. His heart stopped. He was dead. That should have been that. Brady's health adviser Jackie Powell, left, said the child killer should never have been resuscitated, but a relative of victim Keith Bennett, right, whose body has never been found, said he is happy Brady is suffering . Ashworth Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, the secure psychiatric unit where Brady had the life-threatening seizure . ‘He had told the hospital years . earlier he did not wish ever to be resuscitated. He put it in writing. They knew that, but still used a defibrillator. ‘He does not recall the seizure and . was furious that he had been resuscitated. He should be dead. They . should have let him go. This is the one thing he has always said he does . not want.’ The fall caused Brady, who suffers . from a degenerative spine condition, to fracture two vertebrae. He was . transferred from Ashworth Hospital to the University Hospital Aintree, . six miles away. Brady spent two nights in a private room before being . driven back to Ashworth. He has been held at the secure hospital – at an estimated cost of £7.3million – since 1985. The mental health tribunal had to be postponed until next year because of Brady’s poor health. Miss Powell was subsequently arrested . after she told documentary makers Brady had given her a sealed envelope . to be opened after his death, which would allow Winnie Johnson – the . mother of Keith Bennett – ‘to find peace’. Winnie Johnson, pictured, died last month not knowing where her murdered son Keith Bennet was buried . Mrs Johnson, who died in August aged . 78 a few days before the programme was screened, dedicated her life to . finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her 12-year-old son, who . vanished in 1964. Keith is the only one of the pair’s . five victims whose body has not been found. Brady and Hindley, his . girlfriend, lured children to their deaths in the 1960s, torturing them . before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham. Brady was jailed for life in 1966 . after he and Hindley were convicted of murdering John Kilbride, 12, . Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, Brady finally confessed that he had also murdered Keith and Pauline Reade, 16. Hindley died in jail in 2002 aged 60.

Miss Powell speculated that the letter might reveal the location of Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor. In August, police responded to . publicity about the Channel 4 documentary on Brady by raiding Miss . Powell’s home in Llanelli, south Wales, and arresting her on suspicion . of preventing the lawful burial of a body. Officers also searched Brady’s room at Ashworth Hospital but they did not find the letter in either place.

The foundation described the heart-breaking moment abandoned Moses was found in February this year when he was just a week old by rangers at Vwaza Wildlife Reserve. A post on the foundation website blog says: 'Rangers at Vwaza Wildlife Reserve noticed a baby elephant on his own running around frantically trying to find his mother.

Millions of workers are ‘too frightened’ about losing their job to take time off work when they are sick, even if they are very ill, a report reveals today. The authoritative report says a culture of ‘presenteeism’ is sweeping Britain as workers decide to come into the office, rather than stay home in bed. A third of bosses have seen an increase in the number of workers ‘who struggle into work when unwell’ over the last year, according to the report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Headache: A third of bosses have seen an increase in the number of workers 'who struggle into work when unwell' over the last year (file picture) Overall, the average number of sick days taken by workers in both the public and private sector has dropped from an average of 7.7 days last year to 6.8 days this year. In the private sector, the average number of sick days per worker has fallen from 6.5 per year in 2011 to 5.8 days this year. And among State workers, who are the worst offenders for taking large numbers of sick days, it has dropped to 7.9, the lowest level for a decade. Dr Jill Miller, a research adviser at the CIPD, said: ‘We are seeing employees struggling into work to demonstrate their commitment. ‘Presenteeism can be a sign of anxiety.’ The report, which polled nearly 670 bosses in Britain, reveals how many workers are terrified of losing their job during the long economic downturn. It said: ‘Employees struggle to work while ill to demonstrate their commitment, particularly when their job security is threatened.’ One in two bosses say they use their worker’s ‘employee absence record’, which lists how many days they have taken off work, when working out who to make redundant. At home: In the private sector, the average number of sick days per worker has fallen from 6.5 per year in 2011 to 5.8 days this year . Professor Cary Cooper, an expert in organisational psychology from the Lancaster University Management School, said the results are ‘worrying’. He said: ‘People are so frightened that they are turning up to work when they are unwell. ‘At this time of such high job insecurity, would you want to be ill and off work? No.’ His own poll of 39,000 workers found nearly 30 per cent have suffered from ‘sickness presenteeism’ - that is, coming into work when ill - at some point over the last 12 months. 'People are so frightened that they are turning up to work when they are unwell. At this time of such high job insecurity, would you want to be ill and off work? No' Professor Cary Cooper, Lancaster University Management School expert . Stress is the most common cause of long-term sickness absence for white-collar as well as blue-collar workers, dubbed the ‘21st-century equivalent of the Black Death’, according to the CIPD. Long-term absence is defined as taking four weeks or more off work at one time due to sickness. The CIPD said coming into work when ill can have ‘a damaging effect’. Most importantly, it can spread the illness, such as flu, among other colleagues. But is also means the worker is less effective than usual, is prone to make ‘costly mistakes’ and will take longer to recover from their illness. In a sign of the extreme presenteeism culture in Britain, the news that the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group was timing time off work due to exhaustion caused widespread shock. Antonio Horta-Osorio, who returned to work in January, later described how he would ‘go to bed exhausted but could not get to sleep’, adding: ‘I could not switch off.’ The Portugese-born boss, who spent a week in the mental health clinic, the Priory, said the gruelling experience meant he now understood why sleep deprivation is used to torture prisoners.","Report issued by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development .

David Cameron yesterday defended sending millions in aid money to a controversial African dictator - just hours after the United Nations accused his regime of masterminding a bloody rebellion led by a wanted war criminal. The Prime Minister said the Government was right to restore £16 million of aid to Rwanda - hailing the regime led by President Paul Kagame as a ‘role model for development’. The decision, made by beleaguered Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell on his final day as international development secretary last month, has angered the Foreign Office and caused dismay among other Western donors and human rights activists. Defence: Prime Minister David Cameron (left, yesterday) said the Government was right to restore £16million of aid to Rwanda - hailing the regime led by President Paul Kagame (right) as a 'role model for development' But Mr Cameron, who has built up a close personal relationship with Kagame, insisted that Rwanda remained a ‘success story’, despite mounting alarm at the regime’s dire human rights record. Speaking in the Commons he said: ‘I am clear, Rwanda has been, and continues to be, a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty in Africa. ‘I am proud of the fact that the last Government, and this Government, have continued to invest in that success.’ Mr Cameron said he had been ‘frank and firm’ with Kagame about alleged human rights abuses, but said it was ‘right’ to continue pouring aid into his regime. His comments came as a devastating UN report accused Rwanada of effectively masterminding a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which has forced half a million people from their homes. Labour called for the immediate suspension of aid to the Rwandan government, saying the Prime Minister’s comments displayed a ‘worrying level of ignorance’ about the situation in east Africa. The leaked report said the uprising . by the so-called M23 rebels was receiving ‘direct military orders’ from . Rwanda’s army chief and Kagame’s defence minister. The . rebellion is led on the ground by Congolese warlord Bosco Ntaganda, who . is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. Rebels . are accused of recruiting child soldiers, waging a campaign of terror . against civilians and government forces and attacking UN peacekeepers . sent to the region. Unhappy: Shadow international development secretary Ivan Lewis said the UN allegations of 'Rwanda's continued support for militia activity in Eastern DRC raise further questions' about Andrew Mitchell's decision . ‘Rwandan officials exercise overall command and strategic planning for M23,’ the UN report said. ‘Rwanda continues to violate the arms embargo through direct military support to M23 rebels, facilitation of recruitment, encouragement and facilitation of Congolese army desertions as well as the provision of arms and ammunition, intelligence, and political advice.’ Controversial: The decision to restore aid was made by Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell on his final day as international development secretary last month . Kagame has also been accused of running . an increasingly authoritarian regime within Rwanda. Human rights . organisations allege that political opponents and journalists have been . tortured, murdered and imprisoned as Kagame seeks to tighten his grip. The report is acutely embarrassing for Tory high command which has established close personal links with the Kagame regime. Mr Cameron used an ongoing voluntary project in Rwanda to help ‘detoxify’ the party’s image in the run-up to the election, and Kagame was even invited by Mr Cameron to address the party’s annual conference in 2007. The new report will pile pressure on ministers to explain Mr Mitchell’s decision to release £16 million in aid to Rwanda, half of which will go directly into the Kagame regime’s coffers. Other donors, such as the United States and the Netherlands, have refused to lift aid bans imposed in the summer after an interim UN report first revealed evidence of Rwanda’s involvement in the bloodshed in the DRC. Mr Mitchell is reported to have overruled the advice of both the Foreign Office and his own officials to restore the aid programme. His successor Justine Greening has also indicated she is unhappy with the decision and will freeze the next tranche of aid to Rwanda due in December. Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds this week said the UK remained ‘very concerned by continuing reports of Rwandan support for the M23 rebels’. New role: Mr Mitchell's successor Justine Greening has also indicated she is unhappy with the decision and will freeze the next tranche of aid to Rwanda due in December . Labour last night called for the immediate suspension of aid to the Rwandan government. Shadow international development secretary Ivan Lewis said: ‘The latest UN allegations of Rwanda’s continued support for militia activity in Eastern DRC raise further questions about Andrew Mitchell’s seemingly arbitrary decision to reinstate aid to Rwanda on his last day in office. 'I am clear, Rwanda has been, and continues to be, a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty in Africa' Prime Minister David Cameron . ‘David Cameron’s answer at Prime Minister’s Questions demonstrates a worrying level of ignorance about these serious allegations. ‘The EU, US, Netherlands and other donors have maintained their suspension of aid leaving the UK isolated and responsible for undermining a coherent international position.’ Foreign aid accounts for more than 40 per cent of the Rwandan government’s income, and Britain is the country’s single biggest donor, giving £75 million this year. The Rwandan government yesterday strongly denied the allegations in the UN report. A senior Rwandan diplomat accused the UN of pursuing a ‘political agenda’.","UN accused Paul Kagame's regime of masterminding a bloody rebellion .

Allegations: Kelly Scruggs claims she was one of Secret Service Agent Arthur Huntington's lovers . The married CIA officer at the centre of the Colombian prostitute scandal has been accused of bedding two more women behind his wife's back. Disgraced Secret Service agent Arthur Huntington is alleged to have seduced two women in Texas - and his extramarital conquests are said to have begun during the administration of George W. Bush. The two separate alleged affairs took place in 2007 and 2008 and, while one of his conquests admitted she knew Huntington was married, the other said he spun her a web of lies to get her into bed. The latest claims come less than a week after another woman said Huntington pursued her after they met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of President Obama's security team during his official visit to Ireland in May 2011. The CIA officer lost his job last month after he gave a Colombian prostitute just $28 for an $800 tab. Kelly Scruggs, who labelled Huntington 'a total jerk', described how the agent broke her heart after meeting him at the Wild West club in Waco, Texas, in 2007. The pair spent a lot of time together during the Bush administration while the President was at the Western White House in Crawford, Texas, it is alleged. The 33-year-old claimed she and Huntington had seen each other for more than a year but that he cooled the relationship when she introduced him to her mother, the New York Daily News reported. Blonde Scruggs, from Martin in Texas, only discovered the truth about her lover - who had claimed he was divorced - when news of his prostitution scandal in Colombia broke last month. She told the New York Daily News: 'I don’t feel sorry for (him). I think he’s a total creep now.' Meanwhile, fellow Texan Holly Snow, 41, met Huntington at the same bar a year later - about the same time of his break-up with Scruggs. At first - like with Scruggs - he claimed he was separated from his wife but confessed his true marital status when Snow confronted him with her suspicions. She claimed Huntington then told her he kept women 'in all 50 states' - while his wife Jolie and their two sons were at home in Maryland. She told the New York Daily News: 'He said he would never leave his wife because of the kids, the boys.' Liaison: Ms Scruggs described meeting Huntington at the Wild West Club in Texas in 2007 . She added: 'He was lonely. He is the type of person that needs attention. That’s his personality. He has to have attention. 'He has to have that one someone that is there for him, that makes him think they really care about him.' Snow said she had a 'funny feeling' Huntington was involved in the Cartagena scandal when news of it broke, adding she put 'two and two together' when he failed to reply to an email she sent him. Scandal: Dania Suarez claims she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex . Huntington sparked the prostitution scandal in Colombia in April, which brought shame on Obama's administration. The Secret Service Agent spent the night with Dania Suarez while on duty in South America but paid only $28 of his $800 tab. His encounter with the escort led to police being called to the luxury Hotel Caribe, and subsequently a major Secret Service investigation where nine agents lost their jobs. The scandal overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas. Last week it emerged he allegedly lied about being divorced to bed a Canadian woman he met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of the President's security team during his trip to the Irish capital in May 2011. The woman, who only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said the CIA officer's wife deserved to know about the liaison because his indiscretions were 'not a one-time thing'. The 42-year-old woman, a single mother-of-two, claims she felt 'sick' and 'used' when she discovered his dalliance with the hooker - and that he was married and living in Maryland with his wife and children.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 07:00 EST, 4 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 4 April 2012 . A social worker who subjected his stepchildren to almost a decade of 'deliberate and unceasing cruelty' has been jailed for nearly nine years. Victor Lindsay, 45, brutally beat and tortured his girlfriend's three children Leon, Leona, and Cleo, who were aged five, four and two respectively when the attacks began in 1985. Horrified Judge William Kennedy said Lindsay's actions represented an 'extraordinary contradiction' considering he had worked for many years as a social worker and a youth worker. The horrific abuse began with Lindsay dangling the youngsters over a high balcony before degenerating into extreme violence. Each injury was explained away by mother Heather Seraphim while police and social workers did nothing to help the children, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that Victor Lindsay, 45, brutally beat his stepchildren over a decade . When Cleo was just four years old, Lindsay broke her jaw with a right hook because she failed to stand still with her arms up in a 'stress position' he often imposed as a punishment. She was left without treatment for days until staff at her nursery school noticed her injuries and took her to hospital. Five months later in January 1989 the little girl, then aged five, was admitted to the same hospital with suspected appendicitis. 'Man's inhumanity to man always . disappoints, but a man's deliberate and unceasing cruelty to . disadvantaged children repels and sickens' - Judge William Kennedy . Surgeons found a 5cm rupture to her bladder caused by her stepdad jumping on her with his full weight when she got a spelling question wrong. All three children remember being made to run four miles from their home in Hackney to their school in Islington with Lindsay following in his car to make sure they did as they were told. He would swing punches at Leon for no apparent reason and once threw a plastic plate at Leona, leaving a permanent scar on her face. On one occasion Lindsay refused to let the youngsters use a bridge to cross the River Lea near their house in Pedro Street and insisted that they waded across. Only when Cleo was in trouble and seemed on the point of drowning did he get in and rescue her. The River Lea in Ware: The court heard how Lindsay made one of his daughters wade across the river . All three children reported the abuse to police and social services but were not believed, with social workers even branding Leon a 'troublemaker' and sending him to live with family in the Dominican Republic. Aged just 13, the youngster was told he was going on a two-week holiday then refused any help getting back to the UK. Lindsay was arrested in October 2010 after all three children reported him to the police. He denied any wrongdoing until the day of his planned trial in March, when he admitted six counts of child cruelty and two of assault causing grievous bodily harm. Passing sentence, Judge Kennedy condemned the 'disgracefully inept' police and social services staff who let the abuse continue. Jailing Lindsay for eight years and 11 months, he said: 'Relatively small incidents of cruelty, for example dangling tiny children over a high balcony so that they feared they might fall, began as soon as you joined the household. 'These quickly degenerated into physical violence, where each child was hit with objects such as coat hangers, punched and kicked on what seemed to them to be a daily basis for no reason at all. 'By way of further example, you from time to time dragged Cleo round by her hair and you ground Leon's head with your fist. 'So many acts of cruelty, all against youngsters in your care and who should have been able to look to you for protection against the ordinary dangers of young life, were visited upon them by you on a daily basis. 'Every injury was explained away by you and the children's mother. The Hackney Social Services Department at that time seems to have been entirely ineffectual. 'Cleo was made the subject of a care order, and although she complained of assault by you, was eventually returned to you and her mother. 'Leona ran away from home to escape the violence, but was returned there despite having told police officers of repeated assaults. 'Reports made to police officers were uninvestigated, despite an unceasing tide of injury and complaint. 'Man's inhumanity to man always disappoints, but a man's deliberate and unceasing cruelty to disadvantaged children repels and sickens. 'The fact you have spent many years as a social worker, both in residential establishments and as a youth worker, represents an extraordinary contradiction.' The court heard Lindsay had been abused as a child and had gone on a domestic violence education programme when convicted of assaulting Ms Seraphim in 1997. Lindsay, of Homerton High Street, Hackney, admitted six counts of child cruelty and two of assault causing grievous bodily harm.","Victor Lindsay, 45, beat and tortured three children aged five and under .

A young woman who lost a foot and several fingers to a flesh-eating bacteria could hardly believe it when she was able to speak on Sunday for the first time since she was taken to a Georgia hospital more than three weeks ago. ‘Hello. Whoa. Wow, my mind is blown,’ were Aimee Copeland's first words addressed to her sister and mother, according to her father, Andy Copeland. Mr Copeland was in church at the time and had to wait until Sunday evening to hear his daughter's voice. When her father finally got into Copeland's room around 5pm, he asked her how she felt. He said he was thrilled to hear her respond, ‘It feels weird being able to talk.’ Thrilled: Aimee, left with mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige, has delighted her family by speaking for the first time since her shocking extreme surgery . The 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a May 1 fall from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated. Copeland began breathing on her own early last week and the ventilator was wheeled out of her room on Thursday, the same day she was able to sit up in a chair on her own. She no longer has tubes in her nose and is down to three IVs from an initial 12, her father said. She also is finally able to eat soft foods. A vegetarian, she had a tall breakfast order for her mother on Monday: veggie sausage, a biscuit, white gravy, a fried egg over easy and fresh fruit. 'She'll probably eat one bite,' said Copeland's mother, Donna. ‘But sure I'm going to make it. What mother wouldn't make it?’ Andy Copeland described his daughter’s newly regained voice as weak and raspy, but said that she already has been joking with family, talking about her life at the hospital and asking what everyone else has been up to. In silence: Miss Copeland had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her . Copeland had to have most of her left leg, hands and right foot amputated at Augusta Hospital, Georgia, and doctors thought she had only a slim chance of surviving the aggressive infection. She had been unable to speak until Sunday because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her. Miss Copeland has improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up for his brave daughter. She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read. Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a fortnight ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite several major operations. Now she has spoken for the first time, although she is likely to remain in hospital for several months. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed. A week ago, Mr Copeland revealed that his daughter was breathing on her own, as she was taken off her ventilator for several hours. She surprised doctors by sitting for five hours on Tuesday, after nurses thought she would only be able to sit up for an hour. Aimee 'is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?' he wrote on his blog. Miss Copeland's amazing recovery has brought support from all over the world and her father had said how grateful he is for the outpouring of concern from across the world. 'The level of prayer and support has been phenomenal and we intend to read every card and send thank you cards for every gift,' he wrote after she began breathing independently. Stoic: Aimee Copeland has now been removed from a ventilator at the Georgia hospital after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . 'Aimee is being Aimee. She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours.' When Miss Copeland learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on May 19, she responded by saying: 'Let's do this.' Mr Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after she contracted the condition. He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote. He said he was finally able to tell his daughter after she began communicating what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world. 'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.' Difficult times: Miss Copeland was only given a small chance of survival as she battled the infection . Distraught: Paige Copeland, centre, cried as her parents Donna and Andy spoke about Aimee after she had her leg amputated . He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened and her jaw dropped. Then, Mr Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face. 'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote. He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said. 'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote. 'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - ""Let's do this"".' Doctors had hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counsellor was available to help Miss Copeland once she was informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Dr Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Miss Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland has spoken for the first time since being infected after cutting her leg in a zip line accident .

A boy of 12 who raped a nine-year-old girl after watching hard-core pornography online was spared jail yesterday as his lawyer warned of a generation of children growing up with a ‘skewed view’ on sex. The schoolboy, who is now 14, told police he had raped the little girl because he wanted to ‘feel grown up’ after watching porn online. In a disturbing case that has raised fresh concerns about the sexualisation of children, the teenager had unrestricted access to the web and was able to freely look at sexually explicit material. Attack: The boy, now aged 14, had unrestricted access to the internet and had watched the sex acts online (picture posed by model) He then ‘emulated’ the graphic footage and attacked a neighbour’s daughter, the High Court in Edinburgh heard. Yesterday his lawyer warned the case was just the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and many other cases were going unreported. The Daily Mail has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn, calling for a consultation on the introduction of content filtering systems for internet accounts. Sean Templeton, defending the boy, said: ‘There is a real risk that young people are growing up with a skewed view of what sex is and sexual activity. ‘This was an emulation of an adult act witnessed by him at this young age. He was afforded unfettered access to the internet and it has become apparent from a very young age, the age of 12, he was accessing hard-core pornography.’ Decision: Lady Smith opted not to jail the boy and sent him to a a . children's panel where he can be kept under continuing supervision . Mr Templeton said it was a great concern that children may be getting their sex education through internet pornography. He warned: ‘This is the tip of the iceberg. Many, many cases throughout the country may not be identified, not reported, not coming to anyone’s attention.’ The shocking case, on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, only came to light when the young victim felt ill and told her mother she feared there was ‘a baby in my tummy’. Asked if something had happened to her, she became hysterical before revealing what the boy had done. Police discovered the girl had been sexually assaulted a number of times in a shed in the garden of her home between December 1, 2010 and January 31 2011. The boy, who lived next door, also abused the girl in his bedroom in front of a 12-year-old friend. When he was interviewed by police the boy pointed out the sites he had viewed and when asked why he had copied them, he answered ‘temptation’ and ‘to feel grown up’. He was later placed in a secure unit hundreds of miles away. Earlier this month the teenager stood shaking in the dock as he pleaded guilty to one charge of rape and two of sexual assault. Sentencing: The boy, 12, was spared a jail term when he appeared before Edinburgh's High Court . The extraordinary case was heard in a closed courtroom with only relatives of the children and care workers present. Judge Lady Smith said he should be given advice on handling relationships and sexual development rather than face jail. She handed him a four year supervision order to be carried out under the Children’s Panel, which means he will be closely supervised by social workers until the age of 18. She told the boy he was being given an opportunity to ‘make something of yourself’. Judge Lady Smith went on: ‘You should not and must not regard pornography as any guide at all as to how to behave sexually. You should not have engaged in sexual activity of any sort with a nine-year-old girl or indeed any other young girl who, under our law, is not able to consent to it.’ The Daily Mail has led a campaign calling for greater curbs on access to online pornography. The Government is to consider introducing web filters to make adults ‘opt in’ if they wish to view pornography on their computers. David Cameron will consult on whether to introduce automatic filters – or a less stringent system where users would have to make an ‘active choice’ on whether to view explicit sites when they sign up with an internet service provider. Last night Anne Houston, chief executive of the Children 1st charity, said the case illustrated the importance of the Mail’s campaign. She said: ‘It’s everyone’s responsibility to protect children and young people from the potential risks. ‘Internet providers play a huge role in supporting families to achieve this and we would support recent calls for them to block inappropriate websites unless an adult has legally opted in to view content. ‘Although the internet puts lots of possibilities at children and young people’s fingertips and provides access to many positive activities and opportunities, children, young people and their families must be aware that even if it feels like a  virtual world, the internet has real-life consequences.’","Schoolboy was copying acts he had watched online, court hears .

Accused: Adrian Bayley, 41, has been charged over the disappearance of 29-year-old Irish woman Jill Meagher in Melbourne . Charged: Bayley, of Corburg, was remanded in custody after being charged with the rape and murder of Mrs Meagher . Mrs Meagher's uncle Michael McKeon described the 29-year-old as 'a brilliant person', and said her family - including parents George and Edith McKeon - were 'powerless to describe' their loss. 'Jillian was a brilliant person, so happy, great worker, so in love with Tom - all the cliches, that was her,' said Mr McKeon, who had last seen his niece three weeks ago when she was on a trip home to Ireland. 'Tom and Jillian were a lovely couple and they don't deserve this - nobody does.' Bereft: Jill Meagher's husband Tom pictured leaving Melbourne Magistrates' Court . A statement issued by Mr McKeon on behalf of the journalist's family said: 'We are devastated. We are heartbroken. 'She was the first grandchild my mother had and her aunts, uncles and cousins are powerless to describe their loss.' 'There are no words to describe how we feel at what has happened.' 'Both the McKeon family and Meagher family will have to plan now to grieve for Jillian and this is going to be one of the hardest things given that, only three years ago, we came together for the marriage of this lovely couple.' The then newlywed couple moved to Australia from Ireland three years ago. Mr McKeon admitted the family had 'feared the worst' during the agonising six days search for Termonfeckin-born Mrs Meagher, who was last seen on Sydney Road in Brunswick, Melbourne, after a night out with ABC colleagues in Bar Etiquette. Her handbag was later discovered in a lane off Sydney Road. Mrs Meagher's husband Tom had combed the streets around the couple's home as her family anxiously awaited a clue to her whereabouts. The 29-year-old's body was eventually discovered buried in a shallow grave about five metres from Black Hills Road in rural Gisborne South. The farming area -  also known as Couangalt - is nestled in Macedon Ranges Shire in Victoria. Adrian Bayley, who has been charged with the rape and murder of the 29-year-old, is due to reappear before magistrates in Melbourne in the morning.

Discovery: Jill Meagher's body was discovered buried beside a road in rural Gisborne South on Friday, a week after she vanished following a night out on Sydney Road . Police said the 'Find Jillian Meagher' social media campaign sparked by her disappearance had helped their investigation. More than 120,000 people signed up to a Help Us Find Jillian Meagher page on Facebook as police searched for the 29-year-old. Officers studied CCTV footage taken from several shops along the Sydney Road route in Brunswick as part of their inquiries. ABC colleague Gloria Kalache has said the city of Melbourne had been shaken by the random attack. ‘There . is a feeling of shock, it’s a case that not only affected all of us in . ABC, but particularly it affected lots of women in the Melbourne area, . who walk home by themselves without giving a second thought to it,' she . said.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 09:38 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:53 EST, 11 October 2012 . Another week, and another set of barely believable unemployment figures. A crucial government report released today showed a dramatic drop in the number of people filing jobless claims to the lowest level since February 2008. . . but it soon emerged one major state's figures weren't added to the total. The Obama administration hailed a shock drop of 30,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, but one Labor Department official let slip that the figures may have fallen because the state, not officially named failed to turn over its figures which in turn were not added to the report. Just last week monthly unemployment figures showed a shock fall which led some, including former CEO of General Electric Jack Welch to claim that they were 'downright implausible' and issued to improve Obama's economic record just ahead of the election. This graph shows that the weekly unemployment insurance claims have dropped to their lowest level since February 2008 . Some experts have speculated that the omitted state is California and it will surely add to the growing perception that unemployment figures can't be trusted. Welch created a furore last week when he . tweeted that the sharp drop in the unemployment rate  was 'unbelievable"" and that Obama and his campaign aides 'will do anything ... can't . debate so change numbers'. On the jobs figures, which were above 8 . per cent for Obama's entire term until Friday, Welch said in a piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that there was a . strong possibility of 'subjectivity creeping into the process'. 'The economy is not in a free-fall. Oil and gas are strong, automotive is doing well and we seem to be . seeing the beginning of a housing comeback. But I doubt many of us know . any businessperson who believes the economy is growing at breakneck . speed, as it would have to be for unemployment to drop to 7.8% from 8.3% . over the course of two months.' He accused the Obama campaign of being disingenuous and the media of being its lapdogs. The mystery state did report their . weekly jobless claims, but did not process in time the quarterly claims, . which is when people re-apply for benefits for administrative . reasons as opposed to having recently lost their job. Because the state did not hand in the higher quarterly numbers, there wasn't the expected spike in claims that normally occurs at the start of a quarter but in fact, a fall. This also means that should the state file their full and correct figures in time for next week, the tally of jobless claims is likely to rise next week, negating any good news from today. But California 'provided all required' claims data on a 'timely' basis to the Labor Department, Dan Stephens, a . spokesman for California’s Employment Development Department, said in . an e-mail to Bloomberg. Job applicants wait for the opening of the National Career Fairs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida as the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent last month, dropping below 8 percent for the first time in nearly four years . Initially the figures were seen as a boost to President Obama's . re-election effort. They showed the number of Americans seeking unemployment aid . surprisingly plummeted last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the . lowest level since February 2008. The sharp drop, if sustained, could signal a stronger job market. The fall was a shock to analysts and investors and offered a hopeful sign that the job market could be picking up as firms feel confident enough to keep workers in employment. The news has come the week after the unexpectedly upbeat and widely questioned September . employment report from the Department of Labor which showed . unemployment falling below eight percent for the first time since . President Obama entered the Oval Office. The Labor Department said on Thursday . that weekly applications fell by 30,000 to the fewest since February . 2008. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped by 11,500 . to 364,000, a six-month low. Weekly applications are a proxy for . layoffs. They can fluctuate sharply from week to week. If they stay near . last week's level, it would likely signal better hiring ahead. 'The overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving,' said . Brian Kim, a currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, . Connecticut. However, the . figures can also indicate that people are leaving the workforce entirely . and no longer attempting to even find work anymore. When applications consistently drop below 375,000, it suggests that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate. The U.S. Unemployment rate dropped to a near four-year low of 7.8 per cent in September, a potential boost to President Barack Obama's re-election bid . Zach Pandl, strategist at Columbia Management in Minneapolis, said 'you . do have to be cautious about possible distortions. But with that caveat, . the jobless claims numbers have been modestly encouraging over the last . few weeks.' The positive figures follow a government surprisingly upbeat September employment report. The report said the unemployment rate fell in September to 7.8 percent, from 8.1 percent in August. It was the first time the rate had dropped below 8 percent since January 2009. Taken with the unemployment figures the latest data has offered a hopeful sign that the moribund . job market could pick up and provides Mr. Obama with ammunition against . Republican challenger Mitt Romney that his economic policies for . recovery are bearing fruit. The unemployment rate declined because a government survey of households found that 873,000 more people had jobs, the biggest jump in nearly 10 years. An increase in part-time employment accounted for most of the gain. Employers, meanwhile, added 114,000 jobs in September, according to a separate survey of businesses. And hiring over the summer was stronger than previously estimated. The economy gained an average of 146,000 jobs a month in the July-September quarter. That's more than double the monthly pace in the April-June quarter. Better-than-usual weather returned construction workers and others back . to the job, and the end of some union-related labor strikes also reduced . the number of jobless claims, some analysts said. Still, hiring must be stronger to bring relief to the more than 12 million people who are unemployed. Roughly 100,000 new jobs are needed each month to keep up with the working-age population. Another report on Wednesday suggested hiring will likely remain modest. Employers posted slightly fewer open jobs in August compared with July, the Labor Department said. It was the second straight monthly drop and the fewest openings since April. A key problem is the economy is not growing fast enough to generate much hiring. Growth slowed to a tepid annual rate of 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter, down from 2 percent in the previous quarter. Most economists see growth staying at or below 2 percent in the second half of the year. On the trade front, exports dropped 1% to $181.3 billion as demand for U.S.-made cars and farm goods declined. Imports . edged down a slight 0.1% to $225.5 billion as purchases of foreign-made . autos, aircraft and heavy machinery fell. The cost of oil imports rose . sharply. Jack Welch - the former CEO of General Electric questioned the unemployment rate figures released last week and tweeted President . Obama's administration had rigged the numbers . A wider trade deficit acts as a drag on growth because it . means the U.S. is earning less on overseas sales of U.S.-produced goods . while spending more on foreign products. Economic growth slowed . to an annual rate of just 1.3% in the April-June quarter, and most . economists don't expect the economy to grow by much more than 2% at an . annual rate the rest of the year. U.S. manufacturers have been . hampered by slumping economies in Europe, China and other key export . markets. Many European countries are recession. The region accounts for . about one-fifth of U.S. exports. The International Monetary Fund . this week projected global growth of just 3.3% for the year and 3.6% in . 2013. The stunning turn around in the . unemployment trend has led some to claim the books have been cooked . after the Obama's debate disaster last week . The number may sound respectable at first glance, but it takes . into account what is expected to be a sharp drop in China's growth rate . to well below 10%. The downgrade from its July forecast reflected . disappointing growth in the U.S., spreading recessions in Europe and a . marked slowdown in China. There have been some hopeful signs that . the U.S. economy is improving. Manufacturing grew in September for the . first time in four months, according to a closely watched survey from . the Institute of Supply Management. The growth was driven by a jump in . new orders and more hiring. The unemployment rate declined to 7.8 . percent in September, the lowest level since January 2009. It fell . because of a huge increase in the number of people who said they found . jobs. Increases in major purchases show consumers gaining more . confidence in the economy. Auto sales rose 13% last month from a year . earlier to nearly 1.2 million. Home sales have been posting solid gains, . which have driven home prices higher. When home prices rise, people . tend to feel wealthier and spend more freely. Last week the national unemployment rate dropped . to 7.8 per cent in September, edging below eight per cent for the first . time in almost four years and handing President Barack Obama's . re-election hopes a potentially major boost. U.S. Labour Department figures state that employers added 114,000 jobs in . September as wages rose and more people started looking for work. In . addition, 86,000 more jobs were created in July and August than first . estimated. According to . James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, however, if the . labour participation rate had remained at the same rate as it was when . Obama took office, the unemployment rate would be 10.7 per cent. The figures immediately prompted claims of political manipulation in the wake of a poor debate performance by Obama in Denver. 'Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago . guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,' tweeted Jack . Welch, former CEO of General Electric.","The fall was a surprise to most analysts who suggest and came about because one major state failed to file their complete figures for the last quarter .

A teenager wants to ‘clear his slate’ after allegedly burgling 278 homes and stealing 60 cars since he was 12. Adam Crampton, 19, has been a ‘prolific’ one man crimewave, especially in the Leicester area where up to 200 of the burglaries took place. He pleaded guilty to three specimen counts of burglary at Leicester Magistrates’ Court recently but has asked that a further 278 break-ins and 60 car thefts be taken into consideration when he is sentenced later this month. Adam Crampton claims to have burgled 278 homes and stolen 60 cars . Crampton, of no fixed address, revealed the full extent of his criminal history in interviews with police at a young offenders’ institution earlier this year as he began a four-year sentence for robbery and burglary offences in March. He even took officers on tours of Leicester four times, pointing out homes he had targeted. Inspector Andy Parkes, of Leicester Police said: ‘Victims want to know that someone has been caught and held responsible for crimes committed against them. This man was very young when he began and has been prolific. ‘One of the aims of the criminal justice system is to help people turn their lives around and hopefully this is the beginning of that process for him.’ Confessed to crimes: Crampton revealed the full extent of his criminal history in interviews with police, even taking them on tours, pointing out homes he targeted . Steve Morris, defending, said: ‘He has volunteered the information to get things cleared up and he wants to do this as soon as possible.’ Sylvia Hammond, one of his earliest victims, told of her relief at discovering the identity of her intruder. Crampton stole a laptop, a phone and a digital camera from Mrs Hammond’s home in Oakham, Rutland, in July 2007. The 60-year-old said: ‘It did cause great upset at the time. Clear up crimes: Prosecutor Ian Johnson told Leicester Magistrates' Court that Crampton 'indicated he wanted to clear up all of his outstanding crimes'. He will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court (pictured) on October 23 . ‘If he is only 19 now he must have been . very young then, only a child but it’s comforting to know who did it and . also that the police have never given up even after all these years. ‘You hear that a lot of people in prison go back to their old ways when they are released. I just hope he doesn’t, now that he has admitted all of these crimes.’ Prosecutor Ian Johnson told the court: ‘He was sentenced to four years in March this year for offences of robbery and dwelling house burglary. ‘He was visited by police officers and he indicated he wanted to clear up all of his outstanding crimes.’ Crampton will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on October 23.","Adam Crampton pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary but asked for a further 278 break-ins and 60 car thefts to be taken into consideration in sentencing .

A pregnant teenager who brought rush hour Tube trains to a standstill when she ran along the tracks trying to dodge her rail fare was warned she faces jail today. Elesha Proud-Miles, 18, narrowly avoided being hit by a Victoria Line train as she dashed across the rails at Finsbury Park Station, in north London. The expectant mother, who is five months pregnant, was fleeing police when she jumped off the platform and into a tunnel used by high speed trains. She had earlier punched a police officer in the face during a foul-mouthed tirade when she was caught trying to jump the barriers without paying for her train journey. District judge Elizabeth Roscoe said Proud-Miles must be dealt with by a crown court judge, who has tougher sentencing powers, and warned she is likely to be locked up. ‘I think the sentence you are likely to receive is too severe for this court, this is a really serious offence’, she said. ‘I think this is likely to be prison.’ Proud-Miles hopped on to the tracks and was seen clambering back on to another platform before running on to the tracks again, at around 10am on August 6 this year. ‘The defendant was seen in the mouth . of the tunnel, passing through a barrier at the end of the platform and . entering the tunnel’, prosecutor Ravinder Chodha told Westminster . Magistrates Court . ‘She . was close to the tunnel wall, and a driver applied the emergency brakes . after seeing the defendant was not standing still.’ Several trains had to be evacuate as the Victoria Line was brought to a standstill. Proud-Miles . arrived at the station without a ticket to get through the exit barrier . or any money, and soon began hurling expletive ridden abuse at PCSO . Yakubu Musah. She tried to give a fake name and address to the officer before trying to sneak through the barriers behind another passenger. Dangerous: Proud-Miles, who is five months pregnant, dashed across the rails at Finsbury Park Station, in north London . She then told PCSO Musah: ‘What are you going to f***ing do, I’m not afraid of a f***ing police officer’. PCSO Musah told the court: ‘She double shuffled through the barriers and made no attempt to use a ticket to get through. ‘I grabbed her wrist and held her back, telling her to come back.’ Proud-Miles continued to scream abuse at the officer while he radioed for help, and then punched him in the mouth. ‘It was hard enough to cause my head to jerk backwards and made my hat fall off my head’, he said. As station staff and police officers rushed to help, Proud-Miles started to lean backwards over the edge of the platform, saying ‘I’m pregnant, you can’t do anything to me’. Challenge: Westminster Magistrates Court heard that she had earlier punched a police officer in the face during a foul-mouthed tirade when she was caught trying to jump the barriers without paying for her train journey . She then dangled her legs off the edge of the platform as fast trains continued to steam through the station. Police and rail staff tried to coax her back on to the platform, but then she got down on to the track and walked along it, the officer said. After she had run into the tunnel and forced trains to be stopped, she continued to ignore the assistance of train staff. ‘The train driver stopped his train halfway into the platform and contacted control to switch off the electricity to the tracks’, Ms Chodha said. ‘All the trains in the area then came to a stop. ‘He then got out of the train and told the defendant to get into the train, but he says she simply brushed past him and said no. ‘She continued to walk through the tunnel and was eventually arrested by police officers and taken to hospital.’ Proud-Miles, of Wandsworth, SW London, admitted obstructing a train, disobeying rail safety notices, and assaulting PCSO Musah. The court heard the teenager already has a string of convictions to her name, including several assaults dating back to 2008 and a common assault in 2011. She was also forced to relocate from Islington, in north London, after being sentenced to nine months in youth detention in April this year for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Proud-Miles was released on unconditional bail and will now be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court on a date yet to be set. She could face up to two years in prison for the offence of obstructing a train alone.","Elesha Proud-Miles, narrowly avoided being hit by train .

Blow: Viviane Reding, the EU commissioner for justice and fundamental rights, has been forced to dilute her draft proposal for binding gender quotas . A European Union plan to force companies to allot 40 per cent of board seats to women by 2020 has been dropped at the last minute, after lawyers argued strict quotas were unlawful. Men currently represent over 85 percent of all executive posts in the European Union, an imbalance some prominent women in EU institutions are trying to correct, but their efforts have run into widespread opposition. Viviane Reding, the EU commissioner for justice and fundamental rights, has been struggling to overcome obstacles to her draft proposal for binding gender quotas, and had to scale back the plan after lawyers in the Commission said its main tenet was unlawful. Ms Reding had wanted to push a binding 40 per cent quota for women on company boards, enforced with sanctions. And earlier drafts of her proposal showed that she wanted a quota to be enforced by 2020. But officials say that has now been diluted in the proposal, which was still being drafted ahead of a vote by the 27 EU commissioners later on Tuesday afternoon. The EU's legal service said countries cannot be obliged to reach the 40 per cent female quota, but can ensure that more is done to address gender bias on boards. Previous drafts outlined hefty sanctions for companies which were not meeting the quota. In a recent version the size of such sanctions has been left to member states to decide. Supporters of Ms Reding's plans say men could also benefit from the corporate gender push. If a man who is out of work on paternity leave for a year is up against a woman in a job interview who had been in work for a year, then the man could get priority, one official said. Many of the EU's 27 member countries have already said they will not support Ms Reding's proposal, and their opposition has also contributed to the softening of her position. A recent survey of female workers in . the UK showed the majority did not aspire to become directors. The survey of 547 female workers, by . the Daily Telegraph found, only four per cent aspired to join the board . with a similarly small proportion saying they were looking to become . chief executive. While some other female commissioners . say they agree with the proposal's objective, some say its unwieldiness . and subsequent unpopularity could kill off much-needed debate on gender . inequality. Poll: A survey of British female workers found only four per cent aspired to join the board . Five of the commission's nine female commissioners are against the proposal a commission official said while several of the male commissioners, including Finland's Olli Rehn and Michel Barnier of France, are in favour. Dutch commissioner Neelie Kroes is set to vote against it. Her career has spanned several company board positions and two tenures as a commissioner. But despite the difficulties Reding's proposal faces, the gender debate has been high on the agenda of other EU institutions. Members of the European Parliament economics committee on Monday rejected the appointment of Luxembourg's Yves Mersch to the ECB Executive Board, because no women had been considered for the post. While Mersch is still expected to get the job, members of the Parliament believe the stand has put the issue under the spotlight.","Men represent over 85 percent of all executive posts in the European Union .

Dangerous driving: Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter caused a head-on car crash after her Ugg boot became trapped under her brake pedal . A teacher wearing Ugg boots caused a head-on collision when one of her shoes became trapped under a brake pedal. Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter, 49, was unable to slow her VW Golf down because her footwear had become snagged on the pedal and she took evasive action to avoid hitting cars in front. However, she veered into the path of a Mercedes being driven by Jason Hoang, 33, in Manchester city centre. She had also caused a police patrol car to swerve out of her way just moments before hitting the car of Mr Hoang from Middlewich, Cheshire. Baxter was arrested and charged with dangerous driving after being treated for cracked ribs and internal bruising. Mr Hoang suffered from whiplash. After the crash, Baxter tore her boot away from the pedal and crawled free from the wreckage. She was banned from driving for four months and fined £350. She told Manchester Crown Court how she thought she was going to die when she lost control of her vehicle on her way home . after visiting a friend in nearby Stretford. She said: 'My Ugg boot got trapped at the traffic lights. 'I suppose it was a freak accident - as I put my boot across the prong of the pedal it caught in the seams. 'I attempted to free it with my left . hand and then swerved to the right to avoid going into the back of . vehicles in front of me. There seemed to me more space on the right-hand . side to avoid oncoming traffic. 'I can’t tell you how terrifying it . was. When the crash happened the airbags came out, I smashed my head on . the steering wheel. I could smell horrible petrol smells, I thought the . car was going to catch fire, I thought I was going to die. Culprit: Baxter was wearing a pair of Ugg Cardy boots when one of the buttons on the right boot got caught on the brake pedal . Off the road: English teacher Miss Baxter was banned from driving and fined £350 after pleading guilty to dangerous driving at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) 'Basically I just yanked the boot out . forcibly with both hands because I thought the car was going to . explode. I pulled it out and the edge of the wool ripped. I threw myself . out of the car, crawling to the middle of the road. 'I had the boots . for a year and they were my first pair of Ugg boots. It’s a freak risk . but I keep a pair of trainers in the car now.' Judge Martin Steiger QC told Baxter that she bore responsibility for the October 30 smash last year because the risk posed by driving in the boots was ‘entirely foreseeable’. Judge Steiger said: 'It was the defendant’s choice of footwear that made her unable to control the vehicle when the crisis arose.' The crash is the latest in a string of accidents caused by motorists wearing unsuitable footwear behind the wheel. Motoring groups said a quarter of drivers admitted putting themselves and others in danger by wearing everything from high heels to flip-flops, Wellington boots - and even clogs. And a poll by road-safety group Brake found 40pc of women admitted to having driven in high-heels. An AA spokesman said: 'It is common sense that when you are driving you should be wearing appropriate footwear.'",Vera Baxter was charged with dangerous driving and banned for four months .

The footage, which was posted on WorldstarHipHop.com and on YouTube, shows the unidentified woman exchange a barrage of insults and obscenities with the driver. After she lunges towards the driver and hits him as he is behind the wheel of the moving vehicle, he pulls over the bus and approaches her, with a passenger filming their confrontation on a phone.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:08 EST, 29 November 2011 . 'Rogue trader': Gregory Allnutt dodged more than £420,000 in VAT selling cut-price electrical goods over eBay . A stay-at-home father who dodged tax on £4.7million-worth of electrical goods he sold on eBay was jailed today. Gregory Allnutt, who has a seven-year-old son, avoiding paying more than £420,000 in VAT. He raked in £4,000 a month over three years selling cut price electrical goods on the internet. The 40-year-old, from Croydon, set up a company called Shapewise to sell nutrition products from the comfort of his home. But instead he bought tax-free electrical goods from the European Union through online site Pixmania before selling them on for a profit. Instead of declaring the sales and adding on the price of VAT, he undercut his rivals and maximised his profits. He continued to file 'nil' accounts between 2007 and 2010, falsely stating he had earned no money. Allnutt, whose wife was paid £7,000 each month as well an extra allowance for school fees and a company car, spent the cash on a luxury car and two motorbikes. He did not realise he was obliged to pay VAT on the goods he sold, the court was told. But he was informed by his accountant at a meeting in 2007 that he owed £67,000. Scam: The father of one was caught by HMRC inspector in 2010 - three years after he had been told he was not paying the VAT that he should . Instead of turning himself in, he continued with the scam until December 2010 when he was caught by inspectors from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Prosecutor David Hewitt said: 'It wasn't until 2007 that he realised he wasn't paying it properly. 'At that point he was in too deep and he realised he was stuck. He realised if he charged VAT he wasn't able to compete. 'He did try it legitimately but he couldn't make the system work because he couldn't make enough money.' The court also heard his VAT number was eventually automatically de-registered by HMRC after he failed to file any accounts. But unperturbed, he re-registered and continued trading, later changing the company name to Specialist Electricals. Lavish lifestyle: The Croydon-based stay-at-home father was able to afford a luxury car and two motorbikes using the profits from his dealings . 'It was a simple fraud in effect,' said Mr Hewitt. 'What had been discovered was that records showed that in fact over the period that the registration had been in place Pixmania had sold goods to this defendant of more than £4.7million. 'Therefore the total amount of VAT which he avoided was £420,000.' Sentencing him to 20 months in prison, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: 'Being aware of your obligations to pay VAT you carried out a thoroughly dishonest scheme to avoid paying VAT. 'You avoided £429,000 of VAT and because you were able to offer the goods at prices below those a trader paying VAT could you have prevented honest tax paying traders competing with you. 'You claim that you had become trapped into the scheme when you discovered that you owed £67,000 to the revenue. 'That should have led you to stop your trading altogether but you decided to carry on in full knowledge that you were doing what was wrong and that you owed money to the revenue.' Allnutt admitted 12 counts of fraudulent evasion.","Gregory Allnutt bought tax-free goods from EU .

The firm gave over its entire homepage to a short film which highlights Jobs achievements and his key speeches, which became known as 'Jobsnotes'. The film is followed by a letter from Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, which is signed simply 'Tim'. On the first anniversary of his death, Apple gave over its entire homepage to a film about Steve Jobs . Cook writes: 'Steve's passing one year ago today was a sad and difficult time for all of us. 'I hope that today everyone will reflect on his extraordinary life and the many ways he made the world a better place."" Jobs died on October 5, 2011, aged 56, just hours after Apple launched the iPhone 4S in an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. He was first diagnosed with a pancreas neuroendocrine tumour in 2003, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009 - although did not immediately admit to it. In early 2011 announced that he was taking a third leave of absence from Apple for health reasons. Ill health finally forced him to resign as Apple's chief executive in August 2011, when he became chairman. However, it was believed Jobs carried on working for the company he created with Steve Wozniak in his parents garage on April 1st 1976 until his final hours. Tim Cook, who had acted as chief executive three times while Jobs was on medical leave, replaced him. A makeshift memorial for Steve Jobs at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California set up by fans of the company when he passed away after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. 'One of the greatest gifts Steve gave to the world is Apple,' Cook said in his letter. 'No company has ever inspired such creativity or set such high standards for itself. 'Our values originated from Steve and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. 'We share the great privilege and responsibility of carrying his legacy into the future.' However, the firm has come under fire in recent months after Cook was forced to issue an embarrassing apology for its maps apps, which led many to speculate that the company's standards were slipping. Cook's message concludes: 'I'm incredibly proud of the work we are doing, delivering products that our customers love and dreaming up new ones that will delight them down the road. 'It's a wonderful tribute to Steve's memory and everything he stood for.' It is believe the firm, which is now the world's largest in terms of market capitalisation, is putting the final touches to a mini version of its hugely popular iPad. The iPad mini is expected to be revealed later this month as the firm tries to quell sales of amazon's Kindle and Google's Nexus 7, both of which have smaller screens that the iPad. Cook's message, signed 'Tim' was displayed after the short film on Apple's site today.","Firm gave over its entire homepage to a specially produced video about Steve Jobs life .

Tough rules on lending will make Britain’s mortgage drought permanent – hitting millions trying to get on the property ladder. Some of the biggest losers will be those in their 50s who want to trade up to a  bigger house or to acquire a second home. The Council of Mortgage Lenders warned that people who want to take out an interest-only mortgage will also be affected. Crackdown: Tough rules on lending will make Britain's mortgage drought permanent - hitting millions trying to get on the property ladder . In future, these borrowers will have to show that they are saving a pot of money to pay off the capital when the mortgage matures. The crackdown by the Financial Services Authority is designed to prevent a repeat of the reckless lending which led to the financial crash. Under the changes, to be revealed tomorrow, the City regulator is expected to force lenders to make sure that a mortgage cannot be handed out unless a homeowner will repay it before their 70th or 75th birthday. As a typical mortgage is for 25 years, . this will create problems for people currently in their 50s. For . example, a person who is 55 will struggle to get a 25-year loan because . it would not be paid off until they were 80. David . Hollingworth, from the mortgage advisers London & Country, said . banks and building societies are already clamping down ahead of the . FSA’s ‘Mortgage Market Review’. Changes: Some of the biggest losers will be those in their 50s who want to trade up to a bigger house or to acquire a second home . He said: 'Nearly all lenders will say, ""If you want this mortgage, you must have repaid it by the time you are 75, or even 70"".' Another change will be a crackdown on interest-only mortgages, the cheapest type of mortgage which helped millions to buy their first home or a larger property in the past. An interest-only deal is cheaper than . other types of mortgage because it allows people only to pay the . interest on the loan, but not a penny of the actual loan. A . key new rule, expected to be unveiled tomorrow, will force lenders to . make sure all homeowners build up a separate pot of money to pay off the . actual loan. Tricky: Another problem surrounds Britain's 4.2million self-employed workers who will face an even bigger battle to get a mortgage . They will also be required to check ‘at least once during the mortgage term that it [the savings pot] is still in place’, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Lenders have already started to cut back radically on their interest-only mortgage deals ahead of the widely expected change. This month, Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, abruptly announced it had decided to stop offering interest-only mortgage deals to new customers. It is a landmark moment for the mortgage industry. Of the 11.2million mortgages, figures from the FSA estimate around 43 per cent are interest-only deals. Mark Harris, of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘Many people are already delaying getting on to the housing ladder to the age of 35 and beyond. ‘It is going to get tricky for them because of the new age restrictions, such as when they need to remortgage.’ Another problem surrounds Britain’s 4.2million self-employed workers who will face an even bigger battle to get a mortgage. Before the credit crunch, it was relatively easy for the self-employed to get a loan without providing much evidence of their earnings. The FSA’s new rules are expected to make it more difficult, such as demanding two years of audited accounts, which many will struggle to provide or simply do not have. A Council of Mortgage Lenders spokesman said: ‘The FSA has already trailed the broad outline of the forthcoming regulatory changes for a long time, and the mortgage market has to a great extent already absorbed and planned for them. ‘On the one hand, this means that consumers are unlikely to suffer significant additional impacts as a result of the changes. On the other hand, it also means that the relatively high hurdles for customers in getting a mortgage are likely to remain a permanent feature of the mortgage market.’ The council’s figures highlight the fall in the number of loans handed out to buy a house. In August 2007 – the month the credit crunch struck – 103,000 house purchase loans were made available. In August this year, there were only 55,300.","Some of the biggest losers will be those in their 50s who want to trade up to a bigger house or to acquire a second home .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:28 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:17 EST, 24 October 2012 . One of the main architects of the . poll tax has warned ministers they are in line for similar chaos over . controversial plans to impose council tax on thousands for the first . time. Tory peer Lord . Jenkin, who helped design Margaret Thatcher’s doomed community charge, . said plans to cut council tax benefit would hit the pockets of the . working poor – just the sort of people for whom the Coalition has . pledged to make work pay. Experts . said last night that cuts to the benefit meant that up to 750,000 . people – most of them working people on low wages – could be forced to . pay council tax for the first time, or will have to pay more. The introduction of the Poll Tax in 1990 sparked riots, including violence in Brixton. Lord Jenkin said the government should brace itself for a 'backlash' to new changes to council tax . In addition, thousands of middle . class people could lose out because some local authorities are scrapping . discounts on second homes in response to the reforms, which come into . effect next April. Lord . Jenkin told the BBC that the government needed to be braced for a . ‘backlash’ over the complicated changes to council tax benefit, which is . paid to 5.9million people. The . warning comes just a day after accountants said another set of changes – . this time to child benefit – could also lead to chaos because the . reforms are too complex for parents to understand. The latest potential chaos arises . from a double whammy in the way the reforms are being introduced. First, . ministers have slashed the fund for council tax benefit by 10 per cent, . around £500million. Second, . they have scrapped the running of the benefit as a national scheme – . meaning each council in England will decide who gets the handout for the . first time. Councils . will therefore have to decide whether to cut the amount of benefit . paid, to cut services, or try to fill the funding gap by scrapping 50 . per cent discounts for second homes and empty properties. Authorities are not being allowed to reduce benefit for pensioners or to change the 25 per cent discount for single households. Some . town halls have even gone as far as charging double the standard rate . of council tax on empty and second homes – meaning that both the working . poor and the middle classes are being affected. Lord Jenkin was Environment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and was responsible for the poll tax . Lord Jenkin told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that the Tories were making the same mistakes over council tax benefit as they made over the ill-fated poll tax, which sparked riots in London and was a factor in the downfall of Mrs Thatcher. ‘The poll tax was introduced with the proposition that everyone should pay something, and with the present structure of society it doesn’t work,’ he said. ‘We got it wrong. ‘The same factor will apply here, that there will be large numbers of fairly poor households who have hitherto been protected from council tax, who are going to be asked to pay small sums.’ He said many of those being hit would be ‘pretty vulnerable households’, adding: ‘I think the Treasury has taken a fairly brusque view of this all the way along.’ Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, said figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies implied that around 750,000 would be affected by council tax benefit cuts. He said: ‘This could be a slow-burn political issue. Like Gordon Brown’s 10p tax rate, the impact will not be felt until people receive their bills in April and feel the pain. [must keep some of this]. ‘It affects the same group of people, those who are working but do not earn much – the group that all politicians want to get into work and stay there. ‘One of the knock-out consequences is that councils are having to come up with other savings, and those with second homes are a target. There will be a large number of losers. Ministers should fiddle with council tax at their peril.’ Hilary Benn, Labour's communities spokesman, said: ‘When the architect of Thatcher’s poll tax – which contributed to her downfall – tells David Cameron that he's making the same mistake, it’s time for the Government to sit up and listen.’ A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Spending on council tax benefit doubled under the last administration and welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit we have inherited.'","Benefit changes mean 750,000 people could be forced to pay council tax for the first time .

Former supermodel Paula Hamilton is to be prosecuted for drink-driving after crashing her car into a neighbour’s conservatory. The 51-year-old surrendered to police bail this week and was told she was to be summonsed for driving with excess alcohol after a blood test allegedly proved positive. A sample of Hamilton’s blood was taken by a police surgeon and sent for analysis following the serious crash which happened near the star’s home in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire. She was the centre of a police investigation last month when her green coloured Hyundai car veered off the road, demolished a telegraph pole and a garden fence before crashing into a newly-built conservatory. Police found a mystery man sitting alone in the wreckage of the car and a police tracker dog later discovered Hamilton crouching in another garden. Miss Hamilton, who shot to fame as the face of Volkswagen cars in the 1980s,  was rushed to Wycombe General Hospital in High Wycombe, having lost her two front teeth in the crash. However, she claimed she was done more physical harm when 'mauled' by the police dog in the aftermath of the crash and thanks the car manufacturers for saving both her life and her long, model legs. The scene of the accident in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, where a conservatory was damaged . A close up of the scene of the crash in Buckinghamshire which involved former model Paula Hamilton . This week she surrendered to bail at High Wycombe Police Station and was told that she would be reported for alleged drink-driving. She was expected to appear before magistrates before Christmas to enter a plea to the allegation. She was released on unconditional bail until a date is set. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We can confirm that a 51-year-old woman from Farnham Common has been reported for summons for alleged drink-driving. This follows the results of a blood analysis. 'We are waiting to hear a court date for her appearance.' At the time of the crash, which happened just 200 yards from Hamilton’s home, neighbour Manohar Gogna told how he was awoken by the crash as the car slammed into his newly-built £20,000  conservatory. Damage caused to a neighbour's property during a crash involving Paula Hamilton, who shot to fame in the 1980s . The retired BT worker said that he was told by police that a car was embedded in his glasshouse. 'We were lucky that it happened in the early hours of the morning and not when my grandchildren were in there,' said 68-year-old Mr Gogna. Speaking shortly after the accident, at her red-brick mansion on a private drive hidden back from the street, she lifted up her top to reveal a scar on her back. The brunette, who said she has Asperger’s syndrome, was bitten by a police dog in the aftermath of the horrific crash. However, . she claimed police laughed and watched the mutt 'maul' her as she lay . curled helplessly in a ball, an instinctive reaction of Asperger’s . sufferers in panicked situations. She said: 'I got mauled by a dog. It bit me on the back and it mauled my teeth out - I wasn’t even arrested. 'When I got out of the car I rolled into a ball because I’m Asperger’s, which is on the autistic spectrum, and this is a common reaction among people with Asperger’s. 'The dog mauled me while I was lying there and the police just watched and laughed at me.' She has scars on her back as well as on her arm and hand, including a hole in one of her fingers. Despite the force of the impact, with no airbag in her seven-year-old car, she claims her four front teeth were knocked out by the police dog’s attack. The 51-year-old shot to fame in 1987 when she starred in an advert for Volkswagen cars . Paula, who at times burst into song in response to questions she did want to answer, claimed to have demanded meetings with the police and said she was being given treatment only a Prime Minister or senior politician would get. Dentists have already begun £15,000 treatment to have implants fitted in her gums, into which fake teeth will screw. The former model was the face of . Volkswagen cars when she starred in a blockbuster advert in 1987 . which made her a household name. The iconic ad, directed by David Bailey showed the model dressed up to resemble Princess Diana and posting an engagement ring through the letterbox of her partner's front door. She rips off her pearl necklace, discards a brooch and sheds her fur coat but stops short of ditching the car keys down a drain, instead choosing to drive off with a smile on her face. Since then she has struggled with addiction and a complicated personal life. She had a brief marriage to a cameraman in 1987 as well as a . disastrous affair with the billionaire former Conservative party . vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft. In the 1990s she was  engaged to film-maker . Henry Cole. Last year, she revealed that she had lost her virginity to X-Factor svengali Simon Cowell, her childhood sweetheart from their days growing up in leafy Hertfordshire.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit says they have found a mysterious teenage boy who appears in an online video thanks to the public's help. Federal agents told the MailOnline that they were also able to rescue a child victim. Last week, ICE released two stills from the video and say the boy - between 13 and 19 - is in a 'dangerous environment' with several other children and at least one adult. Today, charges of sexual assault of a child and the sexual exploitation of a child were filed against a juvenile suspect, though agents remain tight-lipped on the exact circumstances of the boy in photographs - refusing to say whether he is the victim or has victimized someone else. Mystery: In the photos, the teen appears to be in a basement and is aged between 13 and 19. He is wearing a Minnesota Twins baseball T-shirt . Information leading to identifying the teen was provided by an anonymous tipster that called investigators. Special agents in St. Paul, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C. — in cooperation with investigators from the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation — worked together to bring the teen into custody on June 25. They said they also were able to identify and rescue a child victim. 'Due to the ages of the individuals involved and the sensitive nature of this on-going investigation, no further information can be released at this time,' ICE said in a statement. The Wisconsin District Attorney's office . said today that a 7-count charge was filed today in Winnebago County . Circuit Court in the juvenile division in connection with this case. 'The success of this investigation is another example of the important role all citizens play in protecting our children,' said Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen. The first four counts are first-degree sexual assault of a child, the fifth count is the sexual exploitation of a child and the remaining two involve exposing genitals to a child. The assistant district attorney said that they will be pursuing a waiver to try the suspect in adult court. In the pictures released last week, the teen appears to be in a basement and aged between 13 and 19. He is wearing a Minnesota Twins baseball T-shirt. This was one of the few leads the agency had. ICE believes that the recording was made within the last 18 months or two years, based on the design of the boy's T-shirt. The logo was first marketed by the baseball team in July 2010 but appears to be faded. In danger: It is thought that an adult might be involved and officials expect state-level charges to be filed in connection with the case . 'We have reason to believe that this . person may now live, or may have lived at one time, in either Minnesota . or western Wisconsin,' ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer told CNN. 'It is entirely possible this young man is not currently in Minnesota or Wisconsin, but has either a friend or relative in the area, or recently moved from one of those states,' he said. In the photos, it looks like he may be talking to another person - possibly an older person - off camera. 'We believe there's an adult involved in all of this,' said Mr Neudauer. It is thought that the teen is particularly at risk because he is unable to ask for help from the police. 'If we can identify the young person involved, we suspect that we'll be able to remove a couple of young people from a dangerous environment and also, perhaps, identify an adult.' It is not usual for ICE to issue a public appeal, but their hope that the public would be able to identify the boy and help him was rewarded. 'Issuing a public plea is an extraordinary step by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, warranted by our belief that there may be young people at risk without the ability to ask for law enforcement's help,' he said.","'Extraordinary' plea to find boy in online video wearing Minnesota Twins T-shirt results in successful rescue mission .

Katie Ward, 28, said her dream of a film industry career was destroyed when her left index finger was sliced off while operating the unguarded machinery on her second day at London-based architecture firm Allies & Morrison. The finger was re-attached by surgeons, but says she has not been been able to use her left hand properly since. She is now at the centre of a test case in which senior judges are being asked to define what is meant by 'disability'. Miss Ward, of Royal Leamington Spa, was awarded around £80,000 damages at Coventry County Court in April last year, but her lawyers are now arguing at London's Appeal Court that it was nowhere near enough for the devastating impact on her future. They say she should have received nearly £280,000. Miss Ward graduated with a first-class honours degree in model making from Bournemouth Arts Institute in July 2006 and her ambition was to pursue a career making sets and props for film and theatre. But disaster struck on the second day of a work experience placement with Allies & Morrison, when her left index finger was cut off by an unguarded circular saw while she was cutting wood - without supervision - for a model. Although surgeons managed to re-attach her finger, she was left with reduced function in her left hand and her lawyers said the finger was 'more hindrance than help'. She also continues to suffer pain in her left hand and post-traumatic stress disorder, which has affected her ability to work with machinery. As a result of the accident, she had to take an administrative job at a college instead of pursuing her chosen career path. During the hearing at the county court, Katie told Judge Anthony Cleary she was 'embarrassed' by a sculpture she created of a Wallace and Gromit character - made after her accident. However, the judge said he could see 'little difference' in quality between that and her earlier work and he did not detect she had lost any of her 'artistic flair or skill'. He added: 'I do not for one moment trivialise the injury, nor its consequences, but it is plain to me from what I have observed that the index finger is an inconvenience rather than a disability.' Test case: Miss Ward was awarded around £80,000 damages last year, but her lawyers are now arguing at London's Appeal Court (pictured) that it was nowhere near enough to compensate for the impact on her future . The judge also accepted evidence from one of Katie's former visiting tutors that he had worked on the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film with a model maker who had a prosthetic hand. Judge Cleary concluded: 'From the evidence which has been put before me, I am unable to find that this young woman, either as a matter of fact or law, fulfils the criteria of a disabled person.' When it came to assessing her loss of future earnings, the judge said a career in model making was 'simply beyond' her - not because she lacked skill, but because she had lost motivation due to the accident and was now 'far behind the pack'. However, he found she could earn at least as much in another field as she would have earned as a freelance model maker, without steady employment. Challenging the judge's decision, Katie's lawyers argued he was wrong to find she was 'not disabled' - which greatly reduced her payout for loss of future earnings. Her barrister, Theodore Huckle QC, said: 'The judge appears to have wrongly concluded that, because the claimant can and does still do things, including with her injured hand, and because she can continue to do things in part by avoiding use of that hand, then she is not to be regarded as ""disabled"" for these purposes.' He also said the judge should have found that her ongoing phobia of machinery is a further disability and that, had he found she was disabled, her loss of future earnings would have been calculated differently. Rohan Pershad QC, for Allies & Morrison, argued Judge Cleary reached the correct decision on the evidence before him and that the level of damages he awarded was appropriate. Lord Justice Aikens, sitting with Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Richard Buxton, reserved giving judgment on the case until an unspecified later date.","Katie Ward awarded £80,000 damages last year after slicing off index finger .

Winner: Hilary Mantel, 60, was awarded the £50,000 literary prize for her thriller Bring Up The Bodies . Hilary Mantel has become the first woman ever to win the Booker Prize twice after scooping the accolade for her latest novel. The author, 60, was awarded the £50,000 literary prize last night for her Tudor thriller Bring Up The Bodies, making her the first author to have won it for two novels written in succession. The novel, which chronicles the dark world of Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII, is the sequel to Wolf Hall, which won the prize in 2009. Miss Mantel was one of the bookies’ favourites to win this year’s Man Booker accolade and ahead of the prize-giving at London’s Guildhall, Sir Peter Stothard, chairman of the judging panel, insisted Bring Up The Bodies won on merit. He said: ‘This is a unique accolade. This is something that no other woman has done before. This is an extraordinary book in its own right. ‘It’s about novels, not novelists. It’s about texts, not reputations. ‘This prize was set up for books that will be around for decades to come. They are texts that will live on because each time you read them it’s a different text.’ Competition: Authors, from left to right, Tan Twan Eng, Deborah Levy, Hilary Mantel, Alison Moore, Will Self and Jeet Thayil, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, hold their books at the Royal Festival Hall in London . Shortlisted: Umbrella by Will Self, Swimming Home by Deborah Levy, The Lighthouse by Alison Moore, The Garden of Evening Mists by Tan Twan Eng, Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel, and Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil . The accolade is likely to set sales of . her latest novel soaring, as they did in 2009 when Wolf Hall sold more . than 200,000 copies in Britain and nearly half a million in the United . States. Previous win: Miss Mantel holds a copy of Wolf Hall in 2009 after being awarded that year's Booker Prize . Bring Up The Bodies tells the story of Anne Boleyn’s downfall through Cromwell’s eyes. The judges, which included Downton . Abbey heartthrob Dan Stevens, chose it unanimously after deliberating . for two hours and 16 minutes. Sir Peter added: ‘This is a very remarkable piece of prose that transcends the work already written by a great English prose writer. This is a bloody story of Anne Boleyn. Mantel is a writer who thinks through blood. She uses her art, her power of prose, to create moral ambiguity and the real uncertainty of political life – then and now.’ Miss Mantel, from Glossop, Derbyshire, studied law and worked as a social worker before becoming a novelist – with Bring Up The Bodies being her 11th novel. She beat fellow shortlisted authors Tan Twan Eng, Deborah Levy, Alison Moore, Will Self and Jeet Thayil. The shortlist was selected from an initial list of 145 titles – all of which the judges had to read in the space of a year. The Booker Prize, set up in 1969, is awarded each year to the best full-length English language novel. The only other authors to have won the Booker twice are Peter Carey, an Australian, and South African-born J.M. Coetzee, which by some counts makes Miss Mantel the first British author to achieve the feat. However, others count another British author, JG Farrell, in the list. Farrell won the prize in 1973 but in 2010 he was posthumously awarded a second Booker for his 1970 book Troubles. The award was known as the ‘lost’ Booker Prize because a change in the timing for books to be eligible in that year meant that 12 months’ worth of novels missed out on the chance to compete. Other honours: Miss Mantel is pictured in 2006 at Buckingham Palace after receiving a CBE from the Queen .","60-year-old author awarded £50,000 literary prize for Bring Up the Bodies .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 19:36 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:41 EST, 23 October 2012 . Police have found a tuft of blonde hair just a mile away from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered, it emerged on Monday. Someone walking in a field made the discovery at the weekend and comes just days after police found a wooden cross which they believe may be a vital piece of evidence in the case. The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found  on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school. A local news channel reported that the source alerted police to the scene and a grid search was conducted while the hair was taken into evidence. A clue? A tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered prompting local station Fox 31 to link the evidence to the case . But Westminster police investigating her . murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case. After Denver's Fox 31 news team made the . so-called potential evidence public in an 'exclusive' report yesterday, investigator Trevor Materasso ruled '60 percent' of the new station's reporting . 'erroneous and bad information.' Misleading: An investigator on the case called Fox 31's reporting 'erroneous' and said that the police still do not even know if the hair was human let alone Jessica's . He told the Denver Post that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with Jessica or is even human. 'We don't even know if this is dog hair yet,' he said. 'Like everything else, every tip we've gotten, it was taken and we'll take a look at it to see if it's connected.' The most recent clue in the tragic investigation that police are examining carefully, appeared in the form of a wooden cross last week. Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday. From missing to murdered: The Colorado schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school . 'Authorities are looking for someone who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department Mr Materasso said in a statement. Police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses. The solid wood pendant has three vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side. Recent clue: Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department today . 'The cross appears to be a solid piece of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below the short horizontal section,' Mr Materasso said. He added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.' Last Thursday, police revealed that they suspect Jessica's killer may have attempted to abduct a woman in the same area months earlier. In the previous abduction attempt, a 22-year-old woman jogging around a lake about a half-mile from the Ridgeway home was grabbed from behind by a man who placed a rag with a chemical odor to it over her mouth. Life cut short: Jessica's body was so dismembered that police had trouble identifying the body . The woman escaped and described her attacker as a light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair. 'Police believe there may be a connection between the Jessica Ridgeway murder and the attempted abduction at Ketner Lake, and urge the public to specifically look for someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect's description from Ketner Lake,' Mr Materasso said. 'In an ongoing attempt to identify the predator responsible for (Jessica's) abduction and murder, police are asking the public to look at several pictures to see if these will help lead police to the killer.' Jessica was last seen beginning a short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of Oct. 5. She never arrived. Heartbroken: Jessica's dad, Jeremiah Bryant, pictured, breaks down during a press conference, as Jessica's mother describes their little girl . Family in mourning: Jessica's father, Jeremiah Bryant (left) and mother, Sarah Ridgeway, (second right) were initially investigated by police but have since been cleared of any involvement . Widespread hunt: An extensive search was carried out in the days after Jessica first disappeared on October 5 . A search by hundreds of law officers did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't there. Fliers about the fifth-grader were posted on nearly every house in Jessica's neighborhood of modest, two-story homes with single-car garages. Purple ribbons, Jessica's favorite color and a symbol of hope for her return, were tied around trees. Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home. At about 5pm on Wednesday, dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working on a credible tip. Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer . Grim find: Jessica's dismembered body was found behind a cabin . After the body was found, police covered it in a sheet and used the flood lights from a firetruck to illuminate the crime scene so they could work late into the night. The focus of their search was an abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes. Several new housing developments are close to the park and a busy highway runs alongside it. Police said they are not suspicious that Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle over her, had any involvement in the disappearance. Missing: The case has brought together Jessica's close knit community as they rally round to support the family . 'At this point in the investigation, after thoroughly looking at the parents, we're confident they're not involved in the disappearance of Jessica Ridgeway,' Materasso said on Wednesday afternoon. 'The focus shifts to [an] unknown suspect.' The girl's mother Sarah Ridgeway and Jeremiah Bryant, the girl's father, spoke out on Tuesday, denying any involvement in her disappearance. 'I know I didn't do anything. Everybody that's here knows I didn't do anything,' said Jessica Ridgeway's mother, Sarah, surrounded by relatives dressed in purple - her daughter's favorite color. She added, 'Nobody in this room did anything to harm her or a tiny hair on her little head.' Favourite colour: Ahead of the official memorial last week, green and purple balloons were released by members of Jessica's community in tribute to the slain girl . Ceremony: Friends and family gather at the altar just before the start of a memorial service for 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway on Tuesday . Sarah Ridgeway was joined by ten family members, among them her ex-husband, Jeremiah Bryant, who said that when questioned by the FBI if his former spouse could have anything to do with the 10-year-old's disappearance, he said 'no.' 'I don't see how any parent could do something like that to their child,' Bryant added, according to Fox31. Appearing composed for most of the 38-minute-long pubic statement, the girl's mother told a reporter that she understands that police need to conduct an investigation before they eliminate her from the list of potential suspects. 'I know it's something that has to get done,' she said. 'The have to get it out of there.' Kind words: Friends and family including Jessica's aunt, Becca Ridgeway, left, remember Jessica during the service . Police announced that the 'not intact' body had been identified as Jessica's on October 12 and have been warning parents to be vigilant - reminding them a predator is still on the loose. 'Our focus has changed from the search for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica,' said Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk. 'We realise there is a predator at large in our community.' Anxious parents in Denver kept close watch over their children and the FBI again urged residents to report any suspicious activity by people they know. 'We want you to look for changes of habits, patterns, peculiar absences of those around you and report it to law enforcement,' said Jim Yacone, FBI special agent in charge in Denver. Grieving: Family and friends share their grief during Jessica's memorial service . The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration officials and state Department of Corrections were reviewing registered sex offenders in the area, Yacone said without elaborating. Investigators have received more than 1,500 tips from the public. Authorities also have searched more than 500 homes and more than 1,000 vehicles but still need the public's help, Yacone said. Last Saturday, one day after the heartbreaking discovery, her family and friends came together to pay tribute to the dead 10-year-old, launching balloons into the sky above her Colorado home. Jessica's favourite colour of purple was donned by thousands of memorial-goers who released purple-and-green message-strewn balloons at a park in Westminster on Saturday evening.","Hair found by someone walking in field a mile from the site where Jessica's dismembered body found .

The plot of the new film 'Argo', in which a CIA operative poses as a Hollywood bigwig scouting locations in Tehran during political upheaval and secretly rescues six hostages, is almost as unbelievable as the true story behind the silver screen adaptation. But CIA master of disguise Antonio Mendez is real, as are the six Americans saved in the daring rescue mission in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis. For almost three months, the group hid . out in Iran, sheltered by the Canadian government until Mr Mendez flew in with fake business cards and a ridiculous cover story - and the Iranian revolutionaries believed every word. 'This movie..if it weren't true, it would be terrible,' director Ben Affleck said. 'It would just seem absurd... the CIA is trying to get these people out of Iran and they turned to Hollywood for help?' Scroll down for video . Star: Former CIA agent Antonio Mendez, pictured in 1999, is the real life star of the new film Argo . Silver Screen: Ben Affleck is pictured as Tony Mendez, center, in 'Argo,' a rescue thriller about the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis . Iranian militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. But a small group of six diplomats miraculously made it outside of the embassy and into the residence of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, where they stayed for 79 days until their rescue. Robert Anders, Henry Schatz, Mark and Cora Lijek and Joseph and Kathleen Stafford effectively didn't exist - the militants didn't know they were missing hostages and the Americans couldn't give away their position. 'It was like robbing banks, except in our case, we had to make it look like the money was still there,' Mr Mendez said to CBS. As cover, Mr Mendez concocted an elaborate back story involving a Hollywood film called 'Argo'. 'When you're doing an ex-filtration of a group of people you need a cover story... a lie,' he said. 'Maybe it's not credible but it's so strange that it couldn't be false - it had to be true.' Mr Mendez developed a plan to disguise the Americans as a Hollywood group scouting locations for the fake film. He said the team chose the name 'Argo' based on an obscene knock, knock joke. He said the joke goes as follows: 'Knock, knock', 'Who's there?', 'Argo', 'Argo who?', 'Arr...go...f*** yourself.' '""Argo"" was kind of a battle cry we used when things were going a little dicey,' Mr Mendez said. Taken Captive: 52 Americans were held captive in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, but six managed to escape to the Canadian ambassador's home, where they awaited rescue . Danger: A mass of Iranian protestors is held back from the gates of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Nov. 5, 1979. Iranian students stormed the embassy the day before, taking scores of American and other nationals as hostages . Crisis: Two lines of troops loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stand in front of the U.S. Embassy during shooting in the compound, Feb. 15, 1979 in Tehran . As part of the plot, he obtained a . script, advertised the film, printed business cards, and rented and . staffed a Hollywood office in case anyone in Iran checked up on the . story. 'We decided to call it ""Studio Six"" productions because there was six of these guys and gals,' he remembered. Then, posing as the film's producer, . he slipped into Tehran and began prepping the hostages for their big roles. As time went on, the situation became more and more dangerous, he said. 'The Canadian ambassador was getting anonymous phone calls with people asking for them by name,' Mr Mendez said. 'My chore was to get in and get everyone to believe in the first meeting that we were going to be able to do this.' With a back story for each and every hostage, Mr Mendez helped transform the embassy workers into . Hollywood types and handed them fake Canadian passports and whisked them to the airport. Life imitates art: Left, Ben Affleck's upcoming movie poster and right, the imaginary film's poster .

Disguise: With a back story for each and every hostage, Mr Mendez helped transform the embassy workers into Hollywood types and handed them fake Canadian passports and whisked them to the airport. Henry Schatz, pictured, became Henry Collins . Mr Schatz remembers how terrified he was when they got to the heavily guarded airport. 'Our hats were Canadian, our shirts were Canadian, all of the paraphernalia that comes along with life had that Canadian mark if someone decided to pull us aside and go through luggage,' he said to CBS. 'I ended up going through clearance first and was questioned.' He said they first asked him if he was the person in his photograph, to which he responded 'yes.' Then, he said, the guard left him and his compatriots in line and went into a side room. A few minutes later he returned - with a cup of tea. Safely through the security check, the group waited patiently for their flight, which was delayed, before they successfully escaped on January 27, 1980. The Canadian embassy was closed on the same day and all of the people who aided the Americans were flown safely out of the country. The other 52 hostages were released on January 20, 1981, after several attempt to negotiatetheir release and a failed rescue mission, with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on January 19, 1981 minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. Once home, Mr Schatz gave Studio Six a ring. Safe: Safely through the security check, the group waited patiently for their flight, which was delayed, before they successfully escaped on January 27, 1980 . Together: Bob Anders, Mark Lijek, Cora Lijek, Lee Schatz and director/actor Ben Affleck attend the 'Argo' Los Angeles Premiere at AMPAS Samuel Goldwyn Theater on October 4, 2012 in Beverly Hills, California . 'I called the phone number on my business card. I asked to speak to myself. They said ""He's traveling in the Mid East,' Mr Schatz said. 'And I said, ""No"", I said ""He's home""' For years, Canada was credited as the organizers of the ingenious plot, the CIA getting no credit for the operation. It was even known as the 'Canadian Caper.' That changed in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the CIA. Mr Mendez was honored by the agency that year, and the story behind Argo was declassified. WIRED magazine covered the story in 2007 and in an ironic twist, director Ben Affleck optioned it for a real movie. 'The fact that it's based on true events means that you have to sort of take it seriously,' he said to CBS. He stars in it as Mr Mendez and Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman star alongside him.","CIA disguise master Antonio Mendez created a sci-fi movie plot to free captives in Tehran in 1979 .

A father who stabbed his wife and two sons in their beds before starting a fire and embracing their bodies as he choked to death had been deeply affected by the loss of a baby four years earlier, an inquest heard today. Richard Smith stabbed wife Clair in the chest and strangled her with a neck scarf. He then stabbed nine-year-old Ben and one-year-old Aaron at their home in Pudsey, Leeds, in December last year. He placed their bodies on the marital bed, blocked the doors and windows and set fire to the mattress before lying down with them to die, Leeds Coroner’s Court heard. Tragedy: Richard Smith (pictured) killed his wife Clair, also pictured here with . Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, . in December last year. An inquest heard how he had been deeply affected by the death of a baby four years ago . Clair Smith, 36, was found cradling the ashes of baby Jake who died fours years earlier in December 2007 alongside her two sons, both wearing their pyjamas. The inquest heard that she . died from the stab wound to the chest and compression of the neck and . Aaron died from a stab wound to the neck. Both were dead before the fire . started. Ben had been stabbed three times, in . the chest, neck and arm, but the wounds were not fatal. He died from . inhaling smoke and fire gases and suffocation. Scene: Mr Smith placed his family's bodies on the marital . bed. He blocked the doors and windows and set fire to the mattress before . lying down with them to die, Leeds Coroner’s Court heard . Investigation: A forensics officer prepares to enter the house in the aftermath of the tragedy . Dr Brian Rodgers, a pathologist who . conducted post-mortem examinations on the family, said the suffocation . could have been caused by a hand being placed over Ben’s nose and mouth . or because his face was pressed tightly into his father’s chest as they . lay on the bed. Mr Smith, 37, a quantity estimator, . died from smoke and fire gas inhalation but had also stabbed himself in . the neck in an unsuccessful attempt to take his own life. Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, . of West Yorkshire Police, told the inquest: 'Clair was in the position . you would imagine was natural to sleep in, Ben was laid across his mum, . Aaron between them and Richard embracing all three.' Mr Taylor continued: 'Four years ago, . almost to that day, they lost a baby Jake. The box containing baby . Jake’s ashes was found in the crook of Clair’s arm.' Mr Taylor said the couple would take days off work each year around the anniversary of Jake’s death. Sealed off: Emergency workers in protective clothing prepare to enter . the house. Officers initially thought the family might . have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning . Under watch: An officer guards the property in the aftermath of the grim discovery . Forensic teams are seen working at the house following the tragedy in December last year . Tributes: The bouquets were laid outside the house which was cordoned off with police tape. The note on flowers is from friends Sara and Dean Turnbull . Coroner David Hinchliff said: 'That’s something that obviously deeply affected them.' Mr Hinchliff recorded verdicts of unlawful killing on Mrs Smith, Ben and Aaron and said Mr Smith took his own life. The bodies were discovered at a property near the centre of Pudsey on the outskirts of Leeds . He said: 'It would appear Richard has . undergone some aberration, some problem, affecting his mental health . which caused him to take the action he has.' Mr Hinchliff added: 'It was a concerted act of destruction of his family and his own self-destruction.' He continued: 'It is my view that, . having been the perpetrator of all that had happened and being faced . with the enormity of whatever was preying on his mind at the time and . causing an aberration of this immensity, he has taken his own life.' The family were found at the three-bedroom detached house in Sheridan Way on the evening of Sunday December 11. Speaking after the inquest, Detective Superintendent Taylor . said they had attended a social event at a local cricket club two days . previously, on the Friday evening. He believed they died a short time later as Ben had not opened his advent calendar on the Saturday morning. Detective Superintendent Taylor described Mr Smith as 'obsessive' and said he had been receiving treatment for depression for around two years. He said something may have happened to cause Mr Smith's actions which would not necessarily have affected other people. He added that the anniversary of baby Jake's death was also likely to have been a contributory factor. Detective Superintendent Taylor praised the families of Mr and Mrs Smith for their dignity. Ben was pictured in his local paper a few weeks before this death dressed up in a Pudsey Bear outift as part of a charity day at Greenside Primary School in Pudsey, West Yorks .

Former RAF pilot Alistair Mathie, 67, who was killed when he walked into the spinning propeller of an aircraft . A former RAF pilot who died after walking into an aircraft's propeller could not hear the blades spinning because he was deafened by his headset, an accident report has claimed. Alistair Mathie, 67, a former fighter pilot, had just landed the Piper J3C-65 Cub at an . airstrip when he had a 'momentary lapse in concentration' and walked . into the revolving blades. He was killed instantly after suffering a severe head injury and pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. He was said to be the 'best of the best' in the flying world and was known all over the globe. The incident happened shortly after 3pm on January 28 after the flying instructor touched down at Priory Farm air strip in Norfolk during a lesson to allow a student to take the controls. A report by the Air Accident . Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has revealed Mr Mathie was wearing his . headset at the time of the accident and may not have heard the engine. The AAIB found the wind produced by . the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly . strong and Mr Mathie may not have felt it. Experts also believe he may not have . seen the propeller because, as although the tips of the blades had . different colours, the hues may not have been visible to him. A post-mortem report found the . injuries Mr Mathie, from Burgate, Norfolk, sustained were consistent . with him having had his head down at the time of the accident, when he . was struck once on the head. He had no medical conditions which could have contributed to the accident, the report found. Mr Mathie lived in a large farmhouse in . Burgate with his wife Dorothy who is also a pilot and who he taught to fly. He was born . in India before moving to the UK to pursue a career in the RAF. He was a former fighter pilot who flew Jaguar fighter jets before becoming an airline pilot for Thomas Cook. The AAIB did not recommend any specific safety improvements, but the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) is set to broaden its training. The LAA, which qualified Mr Mathie as a coach, plans to include the dangers posed by propellers when boarding or leaving the aircraft in future training. The AAIB report also stated the accident illustrated the value of a procedure used by some pilots of following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving the aircraft to ensure safe clearance from the rotating propeller. The possibility of turning off the engine in between flights was also considered. However, the Piper Cub’s engine has to be started by hand, which can be equally as hazardous as leaving the engine running, especially if hot after recent use. Tragic: Mr Mathie pictured in his RAF days when he flew Jaguar fighter jets . Speaking at the time of his death Peter Gill, 67, secretary of the International Auster Club said Alistair Mathie, 67, was 'the best of the best' in the flying world.

Very long legs: This harvestman with a phenomenal foot-long leg span was discovered by a German researcher exploring caves in Laos . A daddy longlegs with an incredible foot-long leg span has been discovered - and left scientists baffled as to how to classify it. Dr Peter Jäger from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, found the collossal harvestman while exploring caves during a trip in Laos. It is one of the largest representatives of the entire order discovered anywhere in the world, but a lack of researchers with expertise in the taxonomy of local wildlife mean it has as yet escaped definition. Dr Jäger, an arachnologist, had been visiting the south-east Asian nation to film a documentary when he made the discovery. 'In between takes I collected spiders from the caves in the southern province of Khammouan,' he said. 'In one of the caves I discovered a harvestman that was absolutely huge.' The leg span of the gigantic male harvestman was more than 33cm (nearly 1.1ft). That's just a centimetre shy of the current record leg span for a species from South America. However, when the time came to sort and label his find Dr Jäger, who mainly deals with huntsman spiders, found himself stumped. Harvestmen are arachnids, but they are not spiders. Even the specialist he consulted, Ana Lucia Tourinho from the National Institute for Research of the Amazon in Manaus, Brazil, could only conclude that it is probably the genus Gagrella in the Sclerosomatidae family. 'It’s a shame we can’t identify such an exceptional discovery correctly,' Dr Jäger said. 'We haven’t dealt with these and related genera from China and neighbouring South East Asia before. 'Specialists are also unavailable due to the fact that descriptive taxonomy is no longer the main focus of research funding.' The harvestmen of the Sclerosomatidae family can be found in virtually every habitat and they constitute an ecologically very important predator group in the natural food chain. Once properly classified and investigated, the creatures could serve as an indicator of the ecological state of the natural and cultural scenery. These long-legged creatures are also of interest to behavioural scientists and evolutionary biologists. For example, during courtship the male presents a nuptial gift to the female to demonstrate his fitness. Only when the female accepts it do they mate. Whose a pretty boy then? Attempts to define the arachnid have baffled researchers. Gaps in the taxonomy . of local wildlife mean it could only be classified as probably the . genus Gagrella in the Sclerosomatidae family . Dr Jäger would now like to do a . detailed case study of the Sclerosomatidae family along with his . Brazilian colleague and in collaboration with other scientists in . Germany, China and Japan. The term 'daddy longlegs' can actually refer to three different kinds of creepy crawlies, depending on which part of the world you are in: . Their findings should then be applicable to other groups and regions. 'We want to avoid a situation in future where we again lack the experts to classify such unique creatures,' said Dr Jäger. Meanwhile, Laos has turned out to be a veritable land of giants. Other similarly huge arthropods found in the same region include the Laotian huntsman spider Heteropoda maxima with a leg span of up to 30cm; the whip scorpion Typopeltis magnificus with a span of 26cm; and the predatory centipede Thereuopoda longicornis with a total span of almost 40cm. All these organisms are more or less closely linked to caves in these karst areas. 'What mechanisms or factors are responsible for this frequency of gigantism is still unclear', said Dr Jäger.","Huge harvestman found by German researcher exploring caves in Laos .

MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace has been fined £1,300 for speeding at 82mph through a 50mph zone in his flashy Jaguar sports car. The millionaire TV star from Whitstable, Kent, was snapped by a police safety camera van driving his £85,000 Jaguar XKR convertible in April this year. Mr Wallace, 47, a former fruit and vegetable seller turned plush restaurant owner, admitted driving 32mph above the speed limit in his high-powered sports car. Gregg Wallace was snapped hitting 82mph in a 50mph zone in his flashy sports car . The millionaire TV star admitted in court to driving over the speeding limit . The Jaguar can accelerate from 0-62mph in a cool 4.6 seconds and the top speed is limited to 155mph. Mr Wallace was driving along a stretch of dual carriageway on the A240 passing the village of Detling near Maidstone, Kent on April 22. Ten people have been killed or seriously injured on the stretch of road where he was caught. The top chef, who did not attend his court appearance, was fined £1330, given six penalty points on his licence and ordered to pay £85 costs. Katherine Barrett, Communications Officer for Kent & Medway Safety Camera Partnership, today said: 'Safety cameras operate at sites where people have been killed or seriously injured. 'On this stretch of road from Maidstone towards the County Showground there were 8 people killed or seriously injured within the signed camera area before the site was installed and 2 people in the last three years.' She insisted: 'We do not want to catch people speeding. 'We would like them to drive within the speed limits to as to reduce the number of crashes and casualties. 'We offer Speed Awareness courses to drivers who are within a certain threshold. 'However, excessive speed cases such as this are referred to court.' The news comes after Mr Wallace revealed in his new autobiography how he was abused by his babysitter's husband when he was eight years old. He said the man, who was in his 60s, kissed  him on the mouth after telling him he would 'show you what happens when you get a girlfriend'. He told how he clearly remembers his 'hot, stinking, tobacco breath' before adding: 'I turned to jelly, in a state of total confusion.' Mr Wallace said he fell victim to the man, called George, while he was living in Peckham, south London. Mr Wallace, who has a 15-year-old daughter Libby and a son Tom, 18,also revealed how he was 'scared of marrying again' after splitting from third wife Heidi, 30, in March after just 14 months of wedlock. Soon after the break-up, he had been openly telling diners at his Wallace and Co restaurant in Putney, South West London, how much he stills loved her. Mr Wallace, who had been separated from his second wife Denise for eight years when he met Heidi, told the Daily Mail at the time: ‘I’ve had a terrible week. Glamour model Cara Franco, 26, who is dating the TV host Gregg Wallace, left . 'It’s all over Twitter. I’m in bits, I love my wife. I don’t know what’s gone wrong.

'We both have images of each other, I don’t know if they were right. I had an image of her and she had one of me but whether they were right...' He insisted that the age gap – at 30, Heidi is 17 years his junior – was not a factor in the split. He has now opened his heart on his blossoming romance with his new girlfriend, 27-year-old ex-glamour model Cara Franco.

The majority of slang used in America today originates in cities with large African American populations, it has been suggested. A study of language used on Twitter found that popular terms begin in specific urban areas are the ones that then spread more widely. It confirms the long-held view that African-American slang - with words such as cool and dig - has a strong influence on the rest of the population. A study of around 40million tweets provides valuable insight into the use of local slang terms across the U.S., explaining how terms such as 'bruh' and the emoticon '-_-' can spread from region to region over time. Enlightening: This map shows the areas where American slang terms tend to originate, and the paths they take across the country as they grow in popularity . Jacob Eisenstein at the Georgia . Institute of Technology in Atlanta and his colleagues examined millions . of tweets sent from locations in the U.S. between December 2009 and May . 2011 to find out where commonly used slang words were originating and . how they were migrating to other parts of the country. They found that certain regions, such as . Atlanta, Southern California and New York, are hotbeds for new slang . terms, and that those cities often share and exchange slang words. 'Bruh,' for example, originated in the Southeast and eventually jumped . to Southern California. Tracking slang: Researcher Jacob Eisenstein examined millions of tweets for the linguistic study . The emoticon '-_-', implying indifference or mild annoyance, began in New York and Florida before leaping to Arizona and Texas. And more often than not, New Yorker tend to type 'nuttin' in place of 'nothing.' Residents of Cleveland, Ohio, were the first to use ""ctfu"", an abbreviation of ""cracking the fuck up"", usage that has since spread into Pennsylvania, the New Scientist reported. They collected around 40million messages from around 400,000 individuals between June 2009 and May 2011 that could be tied to a particular geographical location in the USA because of the smartphone metadata optionally included with the message. After collecting the data, the team built a mathematical model that captures the large-scale flow of new words between cities.The model revealed that cities with big African American populations tend to lead the way in linguistic innovation. Eisenstein and his colleagues are tracing the origins and spread of colloquialisms to understand better understand how Twitter is affecting written language. As part of their research, they have produced a map illustrating the migration of language trends and how different regions affect one another. They are also trying to determine how and why certain words catch on and become trendy whereas others never leave the cities of their origin. The researchers are hoping to present their preliminary findings at a workshop on Social Network and Social Media Analysis in December organised by the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation. However, one expert suggested that the results don't necessarily reflect the wider population as Twitter has a higher rate of adoption among African Americans than other ethnic groups.","Researchers use Twitter as a tool to study spread of language .

Staff at The Bull  in Romford, Essex, told stunned troops that they were ‘not allowed to serve squaddies’ when the troops tried to order a round after their homecoming march through the town on Tuesday. The astonishing ban was imposed on the 600-strong 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, who have lost 16 men in Afghanistan, on the day they paraded through town to mark the end of its final tour of the war-torn country. Won't serve squaddies: At the end of the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment parade through Romford on Tuesday (pictured) marking the end of its final tour of Afghanistan, troops were refused bar service at The Bull in the town's market place .

Salute to soldiers: Famously known as The Vikings, the battalion has just been awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Havering . She said: ‘There were about 15 soldiers just standing outside the bar and they told us that they wouldn’t serve them. ‘When we went in to the pub they told my grandson and his friends that they “are not allowed to serve squaddies”. ‘When my daughter asked if she could buy the drink for them, they told her that “they are not allowed in”. ‘She insisted: “I felt so embarrassed”. ‘Romford . is my grandson’s hometown and he wanted to take his friends to the pub . to get a drink and they wouldn’t even serve them.’ A spokesman for The Bull, which dates back to 1890, admitted that soldiers had been banned from the big historic pub.

We absolutely welcome the armed forces into . The Bull and we apologise for any offence caused to the soldiers. ‘We are talking to the team members involved and clarifying that we welcome the armed forces into the pub.’ Some family and friends were also upset when their spot to watch the parade was blocked by officials.

But after leaving the hit ITV2 show in 2011, Mark insists that he has grown up a lot and - and says his debut perfume, unveiled yesterday, aims to reflect this. Mark has launched both a male scent imaginatively named Mr Wright and female perfume called Mrs Wright, and he features in the smouldering promotional shot for both of them. Scroll down for behind the scenes video . Mark Wright, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has launched his debut perfume collection - Mr and Mrs Wright . 'I have been waiting a while to launch this. I love fragrances - I collect them - so creating my own perfume is quite honourable. 'This had to be completely my own. I have been perfecting it until it is totally right,' he told MailOnline. Mark's female perfume has been described as an 'intricate, fruity, floral fragrance' with notes of lemon, peach, apple and grapefruit combined with jasmine, dry wood, amber and musk. Created, he says, to reflect his perfect women, the fragrance is 'sweet, sexy and smart,' according to  25-year-old Mark. Mark can be seen caressing the neck of the female model, who he handpicked himself, in his new shots but maintains that they are 'not cheesy but smart and classy' As for Mr Wright, the scent is woody with floral notes and is based on his own personality and maturation. He said: 'It is smart, dapper, strong and mature. I love to wear suits and be sharp and classy so Mr Wright reflects this.' Baring an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Reynold's Hugo Boss perfume campaign, Mark describes the comparison as a 'good shout' and admits he did channel the Hollywood star. 'That is brilliant.

A friend of the prime suspect in the case of Kyron Horman who has been missing for two years, refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance, pleading the Fifth Amendment, it was revealed today. Kyron Horman went missing from Skyline School on June 4, 2010, and his stepmom Terri Horman was named in a civil suit as the prime suspect because she was the last person to see him. Now, Kyron's biological mother Desiree Young - who divorced father Kaine before their son vanished - has asked a judge to force Terri's friend to answer all of the questions put to her during a deposition taken earlier this month. DeDe Spicher was uncooperative during questioning - even refusing to identify a picture of her friend, whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met Kyron - in the $10million civil suit filed by Young. Scroll down for video . Prime suspect: Terri Horman, left, the stepmother of Kyron Horman, right, was named the 'prime suspect' by a judge in a civil case in August . Refusal: Desiree Young has asked a judge to force DeDe Spicher to answer all of the questions put to her during a deposition taken earlier this month in which Spicher asserted her Fifth Amendment right to every one . Multnomah . County sheriff's investigators looking into the disappearance of Kyron . Horman were interested in the whereabouts of Spicher on that day. Court . documents say she was at work that day but left abruptly at 11.30am and . returned 90 minutes later. She declined to say what she did during that . time. 'Are you aware that Kyron Horman has disappeared?' asked Young's lawyer, Elden Rosenthal. 'I'm . asserting my Fifth Amendment right,' Spicher replied, according to a . transcript filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court obtained by The . Oregonian. She even refused . to identify a picture . Last seen: Kyron, pictured at a science fair on the morning of June 4, 2010, aged 7, was last seen by his stepmother walking off to class; this is the last known picture of him . Proceedings: His biological mother, Desiree Young, is pictured in court on August 15 with her attorney, Elden Rosenthal; Young filed a $10m civil suit against the stepmother . His mother Desiree has now filed a motion asking the court to compel Spicher to answer the questions. Lawyer . Elden Rosenthal noted that  the Fifth Amendment provides that 'no . person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against . himself.' 'Plaintiff . believes that Ms Spicher has inappropriately sought the protection of . the privilege against self-incrimination,"" he wrote. 'The privilege is . personal; it cannot be used to protect another person...Otherwise, the . privilege could be used as a shield to protect a witness' friends, and . to deny a civil litigant probative evidence. 'A witness may not invoke the Fifth Amendment in order to hide knowledge of a friend's criminal conduct.' After Kyron disappeared, authorities searched the condo Spicher was working at on June 4. In . 2010, investigators also put out a flier with Spicher's photos on it, . asking if anyone noticed her or Terri Horman between 9:45 a.m. and 1 . p.m. on June 4, 2010. The suit Ms Young filed asks the judge to order Horman to return Kyron or, if he is dead, reveal where his remains are located. In his ruling, Judge Kantor wrote: ‘Witnesses and evidence may disappear. Memories may fade. The opportunity to find Kyron alive or dead, lessens.’ Ms Young accused Horman of knowing what happened to Kyron. She told the East Idaho News in June: ‘I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.’ According to NWCN.com, Horman was the last to see Kyron alive. Ms Young’s civil suit accuses her of kidnapping him from Skyline Elementary. Following Judge Kantor’s decision, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a statement that stated the civil case was separate from the continuing criminal investigation against Horman. No stone unturned: Authorities have searched more than 28,000 hours for Kyron since his 2010 disappearance; here, recovery workers take to the water . Three if by sea: Three rescue workers from the Tualtin Valley Water Rescue Unit posed for a picture ahead of a rescue mission . A mother's grief: Young is seen speaking with reporters after filing the lawsuit against Kyron's stepmother on June 1 of this year . The statement read: 'While there may be rulings regarding the court's opinions as to how the case may proceed, these rulings/legal opinions are part of the civil court case. The civil case is a process that is independent of the active, on-going criminal investigation being conducted by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges. When the lawsuit was filed on June 1, Young's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, said it would be on a 'parallel track' with the criminal investigation. He would not say what kind of reaction the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office gave when he informed them of Young's decision to sue. Horman believes the suit is working to advance the aims of local law enforcement. She points out that the judge hearing her divorce from Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, delayed that case while the criminal investigation plays out. 'Plainly and simply, Young's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool,' according to the filing. Civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Compelling her to testify, Bunch wrote, could force Terri Horman to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination, pointing out the weak spots in her case. Happier times: Young smiles and holds her son on the beach . Playtime: A family photo shows a smiling Kyron enjoying the playground . 'The burden on Horman of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights,' Bunch wrote. 'We've racked our brains trying to think . of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal . opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.' -Biological mother Desiree Young . According to local news reports at . the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair . at the school that Friday morning. Initial sheriff’s reports said that Horman saw Kyron walking off to his classroom, and judging that he was on his way, left. The teacher of Kyron’s class didn’t see him at the 10am start, and marked him absent. His parents were alarmed when Kyron didn’t get off the school bus that afternoon, and called the school. Skyline, in turn, called 911 to report the boy missing. According to East Idaho News, the police department has spent a collective 28,000 hours searching for him.

Rupert Murdoch has apologised for criticising the 'Jewish-owned press' in series of incendiary tweets about the current fighting in the Middle East. The controversial billionaire media mogul did not back down completely, however, insisting he did not understand why his critics were so outraged by his messages accusing the media of anti-Israel bias. He tweeted on Sunday: '""Jewish owned press"" have been sternly criticised, suggesting link to . Jewish reporters. Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly.' News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch has taken to his Twitter feed to question the 'bias' he feels that certain U.S. media organisations are displaying towards the fresh conflict in Gaza and Israel . Climbdown: The mogul apologised on Sunday for his inflammatory comments about the media . The apology came a day after the 81-year-old questioned, 'Why is Jewish-owned press so . consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?', and asked if President . Obama's 'friends in Egypt' could stop the shelling of Israel. The avowed supporter of Israel also took to Twitter to call the coverage of events in Gaza by CNN and the AP biased to the point of 'embarrassment.' Reaction to the tweets was swift with . BuzzFeed political reporter Andrew Kaczynski saying he wanted whatever . 'Rupert Murdoch is smoking' and New Yorker political reporter Ryan Lizza . tweeted simply 'wow'. Murdoch's controversial tweets came as . the White House on Saturday said that Israel had the right to defend . itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the . Gaza Strip. The White House is blaming the ruling Islamic militant Hamas group for starting the conflict. In another tweet which caused some political commentators to scratch their heads - Murdoch asked why the Jewish-owned press does not back Israel . In one tweet, the News Corp chief pointed an accusatory finger at CNN and the AP . ‘We believe Israel has a right to defend . itself, and they'll make their own decisions about the tactics they use . in that regard,’ deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told . reporters during the president's flight on Air Force One to Asia. Israel on Saturday hit Gaza with nearly . 200 airstrikes, expanding an aerial assault to include the prime . minister's headquarters, a police compound and a vast network of . smuggling tunnels. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred, provided that Hamas stops sending rocket into Israel, Rhodes said. The Israeli government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops, tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with Gaza, signalling a ground invasion could be imminent.

So Israelis have endured far too much of a . threat from these rockets for far too long, and that is what led the . Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza.'

Controversial: After seeing a stag in his garden, MP Glyn Davies declared on Twitter that he wanted to shoot it . A Tory MP who fantasised on Twitter about shooting a deer in his garden has apologised – for naming the wrong weapon to use. Glyn Davies tweeted: ‘Beautiful  antlered stag in the garden, browsing on the shrubs border, “Ooh,” said all the family. I just wished I had my  12-bore handy.’ The Montgomeryshire MP immediately drew the ire of the animal rights lobby, who admonished him for promoting blood sports. But an unrepentant Mr Davies later said on his blog: ‘It seems that some animal rights groups had considered this an offensive comment for an MP to make. ‘I accept that reference to a 12-bore  was wrong. It should have been a .22 or  some other rifle.’ Animal rights campaigners accused the Conservatives of plotting to bring back hunting with hounds. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: ‘It is sad when people can’t see the beauty in a wild animal like this and just want to kill it.’ Joe Duckworth, spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports said: ‘We worry about the Government’s underlying beliefs about the importance of our wildlife. It should be respected.’ Labour MP Kerry McCarthy said the comments typified ‘yet another Tory’ showing ‘his blood-lust for killing animals’. But Mr Davies, a farmer who lives near Welshpool and happens to be parliament’s reigning archery champion, challenged the animal welfare activists to ‘come and talk to me about the damage deer do’. Outspoken: This is the tweet by Glyn Davies which has caused anger among animal welfare groups . He went on: ‘Every year, a few of them . [deer] sneak into our garden, usually during very early hours, and home . in on our most valued shrubs. Adding insult, they normally just spit . out the severed bits uneaten.’ Mr Davies admitted he had not shot . anything for over 40 years but he had considered getting in pest . controllers. He added that he had ‘shot at’ grey squirrels and a ‘horrid . feral cat with an airgun’ but ‘always missed’. Anger: The comments by the Montgomeryshire MP immediately drew an angry reaction from animal welfare groups. A red deer is pictured . He went on that he did not have a gun . or a licence ‘so it can be no more than a dream. I suppose I could buy a . bow and arrow.

"By . Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 18:08 EST, 18 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:28 EST, 19 November 2012 . Grant Harrold, a former butler of Prince Charles, has settled out of court with the Royal Household after claiming he was unfairly sacked . Prince Charles has agreed a secret out-of-court settlement with one of his most trusted servants who claimed he was bullied and compared to shotgun killer Raoul Moat before being unfairly dismissed. Under butler Grant Harrold said he was forced out of his £24,000-a-year post looking after the heir to the throne and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, at Highgrove, their country estate, last year. This happened after he refused to go to work for them at Clarence House, their official residence in London. In legal papers submitted to an employment tribunal last year, Mr Grant, 34, who had served the prince since 2004, said he was intimidated, threatened and treated as a ‘pariah’ by senior colleagues as a result, despite an ‘exemplary’ record. Eventually he was diagnosed by his doctor with ‘Phobic Anxiety Depersonalisation Syndrome’, which, it was said, caused him to suffer panic attacks when he was in a big city for any length of time. This led one unidentified member of the Royal Household to describe Mr Harrold as being ‘too dangerous’ to work with the prince and to ban him from direct contact with the Royals. They are also said to have likened him to shotgun killer Raoul Moat, who sparked one of the biggest police manhunts in recent times when he attacked his ex-girlfriend and murdered her new partner. He also blinded policeman David Rathband, who hanged himself  earlier this year. Moat eventually killed himself during a stand-off with police. When Mr Harrold launched his compensation claim last year Clarence House insisted that the post of under butler had been made redundant and that a relocation package had been made available to Mr Harrold but he declined. ‘We will be rebutting Mr Harrold’s claim,’ they said. However the Mail has now learned that the Household has backed down on their threat, settled out of court with the former servant and expressed its ‘regret’ for the distress caused to him. It is thought they were keen to settle in light of the damage caused to the prince’s public image by his former secretary, Elaine Day, who took him to an employment tribunal in 2004. Charles and Camilla: Mr Harrold says he holds the pair in the highest regard . Miss Day lost her claim for unfair dismissal, after claiming that the prince ran an ‘Edwardian’ household in which anyone who ‘didn’t know their place’ risked victimisation. Clarence House yesterday confirmed that Mr Harrold’s case was settled ‘amicably’ before it reached the tribunal but declined to comment further. A spokesman for the former butler, who still lives in a cottage on the Highgrove estate with his partner, who also works for the Prince, said: ‘Mr Harrold and the Household have reached a mutually acceptable agreement on confidential terms in order to bring to an end the Employment Tribunal proceedings and other matters relating to Mr Harrold’s employment. ‘The Household regrets the upset caused to Mr Harrold when he was made redundant.’ Mr Harrold told the Mail that while he could not discuss details of the case, he wanted to make clear that he had the highest regard for Charles and Camilla personally. Since the conclusion of his action against the royal household he has started his own business, Nicholas Veitch, which organises fine dining events, etiquette dinners and butlering tuition. The Scot from a council estate in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, said he had dreamed of working for the Royal Family after watching TV documentaries such as Elizabeth R. ‘My father worked in the storerooms for British Gas and my mother had a series of jobs until she got a post as a housekeeper at a big country house in Scotland when I was 18,’ he said . ‘I began working alongside the butler there.' Regal: Highgrove, the country estate of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall . In the late-1990s, Mr Harrold applied to work for the 13th Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey after watching the BBC series filmed there, Country House, and featured several times in subsequent series. After three years he was poached by Prince Charles after his brother, who worked as a footman for the Queen, recommended him. The future king interviewed him personally and Mr Harrold was so well liked by his royal boss that it was even suggested he was being groomed to become Prince William’s valet. ‘When you are a butler you are working with your employer in a very intimate capacity, so they have to be able to trust you,’ he said. ‘It was the best job anyone could have had. ‘I met the Queen on several occasions and even danced a Reel and Six with her and the Prince of Wales at one of the Ghillies Balls at Balmoral. It was one of the most amazing moments of my life. ‘It was also at Balmoral that I almost ran over one of the Queen’s corgis when I was invited out to ride on the estate. Her Majesty was standing there, in her headscarf, and fortunately just smiled at me.’ Mr Harrold said the demand for his services since leaving the prince’s employ had been overwhelming. ‘The most popular service is teaching people dining etiquette, hosting dinner parties and afternoon teas and the like. Even in this day and age there is huge demand for it.’ Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire.

London Mayor Boris Johnson, arriving at the CBI conference today, warned against a tax raid on homeowners . Downing Street yesterday ruled out . creating new council tax bands on £1million homes as Boris Johnson . denounced the idea as ‘absurd’. George Osborne and Nick Clegg have held talks about imposing new taxes on houses worth more than £1million. But No 10 yesterday made clear that . David Cameron will not countenance new council tax bands on high value . properties or the Liberal Democrat demand for a new tax on mansions. Instead, the Prime Minister’s official . spokesman indicated that the Chancellor could introduce a stamp duty . increase for expensive properties in his Autumn Statement next month. Making clear that new wealth taxes . will be introduced, she said: ‘As a point of principle we’ve made it . clear that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest . burden. ‘We don’t think that people who’ve worked hard and saved up to buy a home should be hit with a mansion tax. ‘And we’ve no plans to introduce new council tax bands either – we’ve ruled out a re-evaluation in this parliament.’ But asked if Number 10 was ruling out a rise in stamp duty, she said: ‘This is all a matter for the Autumn Statement.’ The push by ministers to introduce new taxes on the wealthiest puts them at odds with the London mayor. Mr Johnson told the CBI conference in . London: ‘High rates of personal taxation are likely to make us less . competitive. 'We should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd . to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash-poor people who happen to . inhabit expensive houses in London.’ He urged politicians to be positive . about businesses and stop talking about austerity and spending cuts as . this puts ‘a big downer on growth and enterprise’. The Mayor also encouraged foreign . billionaires to sue each other in London and their wives to launch . divorce proceedings here too, even though ministers have repeatedly . called for an end to ‘libel tourism’. Leaders: Prime Minister David Cameron (right) is blocking proposals to impose new council tax bands on high-value properties, which George Osborne (left) is open to . He said London lawyers ‘will be grateful for your business’. He also encouraged couples to come to Britain to divorce, to boost London's legal services. 'I . would never encourage anyone to sue, but if one oligarch feels defamed . by another oligarch, it is London's lawyers who apply the necessary balm . to the ego,' he said. 'I . have no shame in saying to the injured spouses of the world's . billionaires if you want to take him to the cleaners... take him to the . cleaners in London. Because London cleaners will be grateful for your . business.' Senior figures have . told the Mail an increase in the rate of stamp duty on properties . selling for seven figures or a rise in capital gains tax are much more . likely. The Treasury and the . Lib Dems admit that new wealth taxes for the best off are coming to . justify another £10billion of cuts in welfare that are necessary to keep . deficit-reduction plans on track. Mansion tax: Nick Clegg (pictured) has held secret talks with George Osborne to draw up plans for a new tax raid on properties worth more than £1million . Mr . Osborne’s aides yesterday played down reports that he has already . agreed with Mr Clegg to push for new council tax bands, pointing out . that he has publicly described them as unworkable. But . two other sources revealed that the Chancellor has told the Lib Dems he . is not opposed to new bands in principle. An ally admitted he regards . the plans as ‘impractical’ rather than ‘unacceptable’. And . government officials confirmed that some sort of new property tax – be . it stamp duty or council tax – is ‘on the table’ as part of discussions . by the Cabinet Quad of the most senior ministers ahead of the autumn . statement. Mr Cable said: . ‘There needs to be a sense of fairness, and these best-off people in . society have got to contribute more. There are arguments around . taxation, about property taxation. ‘It’ll all be resolved in the next . few weeks. But certainly, the principle is right that the top of . society, the best-off, have got to pay more. This is all under . discussion.’ He added that property taxes were ‘the obvious place to go’ to tax wealth. ‘It isn’t simply that it’s fairer – it’s . that property can’t run off to Monaco and Liechtenstein; if you’re . trying to deal with abuse of the tax system, this is the best way of . doing it.’ 'There needs to be a sense of fairness, and these best-off people in society have got to contribute more. There are arguments around taxation, about property taxation' Vince Cable, Business Secretary . Treasury sources are at pains to claim that the Chancellor is just as keen as the Lib Dems to tax the wealthiest, not just as a quid pro quo for more welfare cuts. ‘We have always said the people with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden,’ one said. ‘We’re committed to that. It’s not just some deal.’ The highest rate of council tax is currently Band H, levied on properties worth £320,000 or more in 1991, but that means the super-rich in multi-million-pound mansions pay no more than many whose properties have simply grown in value to around £1million now. But sources close to Mr Cameron have indicated he does not support any change to council tax. ‘The Prime Minister is no great fan of property taxes and his view hasn’t changed,’ one said.","George Osborne and Nick Clegg hold secret talks over property tax raid .

The male model who last week accused Kevin Clash, the voice of Elmo, of having sex with him while he was underage stands by his story, claims he was pressured into recanting it, and is now seeking legal advice on how to undo his settlement. The $125,000 settlement was struck between the two men several hours before the accuser, Sheldon Stephens, 23, officially retracted his underage sex allegation. Under the terms of the settlement, if Stephens is asked by anyone about his relationship with Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: 'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was an adult consensual relationship.' Scandal on Sesame Street: Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing accusations that he slept with underage boys . Sheldon Stephens now wishes to undo the $125,000 settlement that he signed last week with Clash's lawyers . Stephens reportedly cried during final . negotiations with Clash's lawyer and repeatedly insisted he didn't . want to sign. He has apparently met with . lawyers in Los Angeles and told them he was pressured into recanting his . allegation and insists he's telling the truth when he says he had sex . with Clash when he was 16, reports TMZ. Stephens, a struggling actor/model, is now telling lawyers he will gladly forfeit the $125,000 settlement to restore his name. Accusations that Clash, who is openly gay, engaged in an underage sexual affair set off a media firestorm after they were revealed last Monday. Within 24 hours of the story breaking, Stephens recanted his claim. After Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a . spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to . rest. I will not discuss it further.' Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, . has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the . popular children's TV show on PBS. Resignation: Clash has left the popular children's show but that doesn't mean it's the end of the road for Elmo . Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage . Clash, 52, had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop since the scandal broke . Andreozzi & Associates, the law firm representing Stephens, did not return requests for comment from MailOnline. On his Twitter account, Stephens describes himself as an . 'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor.' On . his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. I'm very spontaneous and random… I'm determined and goal oriented. My . destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and . never will it dim.' Court records show Stephens has . been arrested several times since 2009 on charges including writing a . bad check and reckless driving. His most serious charges were in . September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in his hometown of Pennsylvania . after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles. He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knife-point. Pollard accused Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint. Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California. Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.' The puppeteer told the man almost 30 years his junior . that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New . York, it has emerged. The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser, but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. In emails sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' Iconic: Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, admits he had a relationship with the man, but only once the accuser was an adult . The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want' Sesame Street disciplined Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed . his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials. He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.","Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, was accused of engaging in underage sex with male model, Sheldon Stephens, 23 .

Ex-Chief Whip today denied giving Nadine Dorries permission to abandon her constituents for a month to take part in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here. The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire triggered a storm of outrage when she jetted off to the jungle for a month when she should have been in Westminster. Instead of taking part in Commons debates and helping her constituents she has been seen eating as ostrich anus and performing a woeful stand-up routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather. Write caption here . Tory high command suspended her from the party until she returns, warning she has serious questions to answer. But today one of her daughters insisted she was cleared to take part by Mr Mitchell before he resigned last month. Jennie Dorries told ITV's Daybreak that Mr Mitchell agreed that her mother could take the time off. She said: ‘She did ask for the month off. The chief whip gave her permission. She did all she had to do before she left. She made arrangements for someone to take her place on Remembrance Sunday.’ Miss Dorries did not make clear whether her mother had explained she wanted to take part in a reality TV show on the other side of the world. But Mr Mitchell is adamant that no conversation was had about being away from Parliament for a month, and certainly not to be a contestant on the ITV show fronted by Ant and Dec. ‘Conversations between the Chief Whip and colleagues are confidential,’ a spokesman for Mr Mitchell said. ‘But in this case Andrew is happy to confirm that permission to go to Australia for one month to take part in I’m A Celebrity was neither sought nor was it given.’ As MPs prepared to return to Westminster, Ms Dorries was performing a poorly-received comedy routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather . There is widespread speculation in Westminster that when Ms Dorries returns from the jungle she will reject the idea of a meeting with Mr Mitchell’s successor, Sir George Young, and instead choose to sit as an independent MP on the opposition benches. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after a month of headlines about his foul-mouthed rant at Downing Street police officers who told him to get off his bike. Before joining the show Nadine Dorries defended the decision to be away from her constituents, saying politicians needed to raise important issues on programmes watched by millions of people. She hoped to use the platform to discuss her campaign to lower the abortion limit. Instead she has been voted to take part in a Buchtucker Trial which involved eating various animal body parts including a camel's toe and an ostrich's anus. And her performance in a task telling jokes was deemed so dire she missed out on the chance to go to the jungle pub. One of Ms Dorries's other daughters, Cassie, admitted she has repeatedly voted for her mother to take part in stomach-churning challenges in the jungle. She told Daybreak she could not help but laugh at her mother's efforts on the notorious bushtucker trials, revealing: ‘I have voted for my mum for both of the trials - it's much more interesting to see her do it.’","Jennie Dorries told ITV her mum was cleared by party bosses to take a month off from the Commons .

A jealous and controlling boyfriend brutally battered his partner to death just days after she refused to have a sexual threesome with him and a male friend, a court heard today. Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, was stabbed with a kitchen knife by Muhammad Shafi  then had her skull . shattered with a pair of metal shears, which caused brain damage. Her . body was then dumped in an underpass near her home in Berkshire. Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, left, was brutally battered to death by her 'jealous' and 'controlling' boyfriend Muhammad Shafi, right, a court heard today . She also suffered a number of . broken fingers, caused as the victim tried to defend herself from the . brutal blows which rained down on her head. Jurors were told how Shafi was accused of killing her by smashing her over the head with the pair of metal tinsnips. Days before her tragic death, Tuk, as she was known, . confided in a pal that Shafi had asked her to have a threesome with him . and that he had become enraged when she refused. She had told her . friend that one of Shafi’s male friends was staying with the couple and . that Shafi had wanted the man to sleep in their bedroom. Alan Blake, prosecuting, said: 'Shafi had suggested that he and Tuk should have sex and the friend should join in. 'She refused and the defendant became angry.' But Shafi’s male friend told . police that although he had slept in their bedroom, he had not shared . their bed and there had been no suggestion of a threesome. Shafi, 28, had married his . Thai girlfriend in an Islamic marriage in December last year, the jury . at Reading Crown Court was told. They had sought to register the . marriage under UK law in February but it had to be cancelled after the . victim’s documents relating to the divorce of her German husband were . not in order. Shafi was on a student visa from Islamabad in Pakistan and ran a business placing students onto UK training courses. Mother-of-one Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, died from serious head injuries in a subway in Bracknell, Berkshire . He was granted an extension to stay on the grounds of the couple's serious relationship. While Ms Sprengel had told friends . and family that the pair 'loved each other', her cousin Jurairat . Buncherd became concerned that it was a 'marriage of convenience', . allowing Shafi to remain in the country. The jury of eight women and four men were told that Shafi murdered Tuk and tried to cover his tracks. Mr Blake told the hearing: 'The . prosecution allege that this defendant - Muhammad Shafi - who is 28 . years old, murdered his partner, Tuanjai Sprengel, aged 43 years, in an . underpass in Bracknell in the early hours of May 27 this year. 'He stabbed her in the neck with a kitchen knife but it was not that injury that led to her death. 'The fatal injuries were caused when . the defendant repeatedly bashed her over the back of the head with a . pair of metal tin snips. 'That caused multiple skull fractures and brain damage. 'Her fingers were bruised and fractured as she protected her head from the blows. 'He left her in that underpass and returned towards their home address. 'He deposed of the knife and the metal . tin snips in shrubbery near their house. He changed out of his . bloodstained clothing and put it in a rucksack,' added the prosecutor. 'Later that morning he took that . rucksack to a nearby house where he tried to persuade the people there . to take possession of it. 'But they refused and he himself then took the bag himself and disposed of it.' The jury heard how he arrived at his . friend Idress Haider's home early on Sunday morning and told him 'I've . done a very bad thing' before later confessing that he had 'hit or . killed his wife'. Mr Haider told police that when he asked Shafi 'is she dead?' he replied 'she must be dead by now, when I left she was gasping'. The jury heard that police traced the victim to her rented property where they found the defendant. He was later arrested but answered 'no comment' in interview with detectives. The Thai woman's body was found dumped in the underpass pictured. A passerby earlier heard screams coming from the victim . However, he did make a short statement via his solicitor. 'He accepted there was an argument . with his partner but he did not know what caused the fatality and he . said didn’t intend to cause her any harm,' Mr Blake said. Tuk, a mother-of-one had also told the couple’s landlord that they had argued because she had said he was gay. She told Frank Napier in the days before her death that Shafi had left the house after a row. 'She reported that Shafi had gone . out for the day when Tuk had insinuated that he was homosexual. That . caused a row,' said Mr Blake. The court heard how, on the . evening before Tuk’s death, the couple had gone on a seven hour gambling . spree in a local branch of Ladbrokes where they lost around £1,000. On the same evening, Ms Sprengel . had confided to a woman at the Ladbrokes betting shop in Bracknell that . Shafi was ‘jealous and controlling’ and stopped her from working. The jury was shown CCTV footage of . Shafi twice going outside to get cash and were told they had been in . the bookies from 3pm to 10pm. 'The staff estimated that they lost £1,000 pounds on the roulette machines,' said Mr Blake. The couple got a lift home with a friend of Tuk’s, but were later seen on CCTV heading towards the underpass where Tuk died. Probe: Police officers pictured at the scene where the 43-year-old mother-of-one was found dead . At around 4.45am the following . morning, May 27, a passer-by Charlotte Lenthall walked through the . underpass and noticed a couple, which the prosecution said was Tuk and . Shafi. They were sat cross-legged on the floor facing each other. She heard them talking in a foreign language as she walked through and noticed that the man had a raised voice. When she walked out of the underpass Miss Lenthall heard a woman scream but dismissed it as a 'lover’s tiff'. 'She heard another scream that made her feel uneasy, a second smaller scream,' said Mr Blake. 'She continued her journey to work. 'It was when she returned home that she saw that London Road had been cordoned off and saw the murder reported on the news.' CCTV then showed Shafi walking out of the underpass just minutes after Miss Lenthall. Cordon: Police seal off the underpass in Bracknell, Berkshire, where the Thai-born mother was found dead . Later that morning a cyclist, . Peter Paige, came across what he thought was a mannequin or a drunk, . only to realise he had found a woman’s body. He raised the alarm with some workmen loading a nearby van and they called police. Paramedics arrived at the scene . and tried to perform CPR on Tuk, only to find a wound on the back of her . head which was 'incompatible with life'. A post mortem examination revealed that she had died as a result of a severe blunt force trauma to the head. She had been hit at least nine . times in quick succession, and also had wounds to her face as it hit the . ground from the force of the blows to the back of her head, as well as . the stab wound in her neck. Police found identity documents in . the handbag Tuk had been carrying and went to visit her home, where . they found Shafi who said that Tuk had gone to meet a friend. Evidence: Police pictured moving bags of evidence from the scene in May . 'He was told about the body and was arrested on suspicion of murder,' said Mr Blake. 'He made no reply to the caution.' The defendant, who was wearing a a . grey jumper, blue polo short and beige trousers, denies murdering the . 43-year-old in a pedestrian subway in Bracknell, Berkshire, on May 27. The court heard that Shafi admitted . causing the death of his partner but said he did not intend to kill or . seriously harm her, who he said he loved very much. He told police he did not know what . caused the fatality, and that both parties had the opportunity to leave . at any time during the argument. But Mr Blake argued that the 28-year-old . intentionally murdered his girlfriend during an 'unjustifiable assault' using weapons from their home stashed in his clothing. The jury heard that Shafi may have feared the relationship with Tuk was over when he planned her killing. Mr Blake told the jury: 'For whatever . reason, this defendant acknowledged or foresaw the end of the . relationship with Tuk - a development with several consequences he was . unable to accept. 'This defendant is guilty, not of the . lesser offence of manslaughter which he readily admits, but the offence . of murder of which he is charged.' Shafi of Basemoors, Bracknell, looked relaxed as he listened to proceedings unfold from the dock. None of Ms Sprengel’s family from Thailand were in court for the hearing. The trial continues.

There has been further humiliation for the weatherman whose story was dubbed the 'real-life Hangover' after he was drugged and swindled out of more than . $40,000 by Eastern European bar girls which saw him fired from his job. John Bolaris appeared in a Miami court last Friday to testify against the crime ring which had stolen $43,000 from him. His moment of retribution however was tainted by one of the accused's testimony that during his wild weekend in 2010, he defecated in his pants. Weathering the storm: John Bolaris has been further humiliated after being scammed out of $43,000 in Miami when one of the accused told the court that he defecated himself . Party time! Mr Bolaris, 54, spent $43,000 in a single weekend in Miami after falling victim to a Russian honeytrap scam . The 54-year-old denied the embarrassing incident when asked about it in court and later told Philly.com: 'No. 1, it didn't happen. If it did happen, I would say it happened. He added: 'I am trying to have some dignity.' Earlier this year, Mr Bolaris gave several interviews where he pieced together the weekend's hazy events. The weatherman said he was having a drink at a . South Beach bar in Miami in March 2010 when he was approached by two . women with Russian accents. He explained: 'They come over and they . said, ""Do you want to do a shot?"" And I go, ""No I don't want to do a . shot"". 'Then one comes behind me, rubs my shoulders, pulls back my head . and says, ""Come on, do a shot"". And I said, ""All right, I'll do a . shot"".' Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs . Baited: As part of the scam, women were flown in from Russia and the Baltic States to manipulate men at private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia . After having a few drinks with the . women they took him in a taxi to their friend's art shop. He said after . that the details are very sketchy. 'I remember standing up ... signing something, vaguely. Next thing I know, I'm in a cab with a big painting [of a woman's head]. 'Then I woke up, I had red wine on my shirt, fully clothes and I'm thinking - something happened, but what?' Surprisingly, one of the 'B-girls' called him to say she had his sunglasses and they agreed to meet up . later so he could return the piece of art. He . said he got in a taxi with them and 'next thing I know I'm passed out'. He woke up the next morning feeling sick and very worried before receiving a . call from American Express to tell him $43,712.25 had been charged to . his card - including $2,480 for the painting. American . Express wouldn't let him dispute the charges because a man called Stan . Pavlenko - who was later arrested in the case - supplied them with a . photo of the weather man at the bar showing he was using his own card. Mr Bolaris won a court case in June with American Express to get his money back plus damages. After he gave interviews about his experience to 20/20 and Playboy, his employer, Philadelphia Fox 29 affiliated WTXF where he had worked for four years, fired him. The company issued a statement saying they 'mutually agreed that it was time to part ways'. Mr Bolaris, who recently got engaged to former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman, said: 'On face value, it looks like a ''Hangover''-type movie. It's easy to sit outside and make fun of it.' He added that if it wasn't for the fact he approached the FBI, the gang would not have been caught. On the run: Alec Simchuk fled to Eastern Europe after the FBI investigation but was arrested this week . Ladies' man: Mr Bolaris, 54, is a notorious ladies' man and is pictured here with his former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman . After contacting the FBI, they launched a criminal investigation of the Eastern European criminal activities in the South Beach clubs, using an undercover cop to get information. Alec Simchuk, who was arrested in July, ran some of the Miami clubs where girls would get patrons drunk - while they were throwing out their own drinks - and charge them exorbitant amounts for drinks, enforcing Florida's 'innkeeper law' to force customers to pay. The law requires patrons disputing a charge to challenge the bill with their own credit card company rather than the vendor. Patrons who refuse to sign their bill risk getting arrested. After spending more than a year and an estimated $1million investigating the case, 16 suspects - including almost a dozen b-girls and a handful of male managers and accountants - were arrested after a fake birthday party was thrown by the undercover officer. The case is ongoing. Watch video here: .","John Bolaris, 54, approached by two women in Miami in 2010 who asked him to do shots .

A conman who lived on benefits posed as a billionaire businessman to seduce a Harvard-educated Sotheby’s executive into handing him more than £600,000. Cambridge University drop-out Alistair Stewart, 53, convinced Nina Siegenthaler he was a former Goldman Sachs partner now running his own hedge fund in Switzerland and the owner of a private jet, a yacht and a helicopter. He targeted her by pretending to be interested in buying a £9million property on the Caribbean tax haven of Turks and  Caicos where Miss Siegenthaler is vice-president of Sotheby’s International Realty. Conman: Alistair Stewart, left, seduced Nina Siegenthaler, a wealthy woman out of more than £600,000 by posing as a retired Goldman Sachs billionaire . After catching her at a low point in her life, he spent six months grooming her on Skype, during which time she fell in love with him and agreed to let him invest her life savings. He blew almost all of the cash in only four months by taking trips to see her, buying a £50,000 Mercedes, stays at luxury hotels and helicopter trips to London to shop at Harrods. Stewart, who now faces jail, also cheated at least five other victims including a New York interior designer by pretending to be a super-rich international businessman after researching the role on the internet. In fact, he operated his sophisticated con on his own from a computer in his housing association bedsit in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where he survived for most of the time on benefits. Miss Siegenthaler yesterday said the experience had been ‘absolutely horrendous’ after Stewart appeared at the Old Bailey to admit fraud. The art history graduate, who has completed an executive programme on real estate management at Harvard Business School, said she did not wish to comment fully until next month’s sentencing, but urged others to be alert to the risks of conmen working on the internet. She added: ‘You never believe something like this could happen to you. It is absolutely surreal. It is vital people realise the dangers that are out there. I hope this acts as a warning.’ Prosecutor Ben Maguire said outside court: ‘This man is a sophisticated conman. Victim: Nina Siegenthaler was a real estate agent living in the Turks and Caicos Islands, pictured . ‘He managed to persuade this poor lady he was a billionaire financier with Goldman Sachs who had started his own fund. ‘He groomed her over about six months. She fell in love with him and sent him one million dollars. He then funded a lifestyle that was like that of a billionaire.’ Detective Sergeant Mick Richards, of the Economic Crime Unit at Sussex Police, said: ‘Most people would wonder “how was it possible to con people so successfully?” ‘Only when you meet him do you realise what he is capable  of. His attention to detail was remarkable. ‘He was meticulous in researching every aspect of his scam on the internet, from complex financial systems to types of aircraft used by the very rich so that he could successfully present himself as an international fund manager. ‘Miss Siegenthaler has been incredibly strong through what has been a long investigation and we are very relieved to finally have a successful result for her.’ Stewart received the money from Miss Siegenthaler on September 27, 2010, but had spent almost all of it by January 2011. Only £40,000 has been recovered. The Old Bailey, pictured, where Stewart pleaded guilty to one count of fraud on a 'full facts basis' Stewart also convinced a US interior designer he could offer her work worth more than £500,000 over three years. And he told a husband and wife that he was a former Goldman Sachs partner and could employ them as a captain and cook on his yacht. At the Old Bailey yesterday he admitted one count of fraud on a ‘full facts basis’ which encompasses 12 allegations. Stewart has been staying at The Priory, the private mental health hospital best known for treating celebrities.

Accused: Bobby and Moira Roberts have been charged with animal cruelty after secret footage revealed they allowed their elephant to be beaten (file picture) The former owners of Britain’s last circus elephant instructed workers to keep her chained up and let a groom beat her, a court heard yesterday. Anne the elephant was kept tethered for days with only a scattering of straw and displayed behaviour caused by stress, it was alleged. Prosecutor Helen Law said Anne, who already had arthritis, rocked backwards and forwards which, as in humans, is a sign of distress. At other times her leg buckled under her. Her suffering was described on the first day of the trial of Bobby and Moira Roberts who are accused of animal cruelty. They run Bobby Roberts Super Circus and Anne, a 59-year-old from Sri Lanka, started working for Mr Roberts back in 1957. Her plight was captured in covert footage obtained by campaign group Animal Defenders International which placed a camera in the barn at the circus’ winter quarters where Anne was kept when not on tour. As well as being chained to the ground by one front and one hind leg, it showed she was hit with various tools including a pitchfork by one of the Roberts’ employees. Neither of the Roberts is accused of hitting Anne themselves but they are charged with failing to take reasonable steps to prevent her being hit by their staff. Miss Law told Northampton Magistrates’ Court that the grooms were ‘plainly inadequately trained’ and one clip from the footage showed Bobby Roberts kicking Anne’s trunk in front of a worker. ‘Bobby Roberts was happy to legitimise the use of casual violence on this elephant,’ she said.Other clips showed Anne being kicked and hit on the flank with a pitchfork by a worker.' After the footage was first made public . in the Daily Mail last year, police and the RSPCA visited the site in . Polebrook, Cambridgeshire, and found Anne’s environment had been . significantly altered. Circus: Anne was kept her chained up for 24-hours-a-day and only un-shackled so they could swap which leg she was chained with, a court heard . New life: Anne now lives at Longleat in a giant paddock with its own sandpit for her to play in (pictured) Fragile: Anne is 58 and video shown to the jury included footage of her being kicked and poked . Allegations: The prosecution say Bobby Roberts would boot Anne in the trunk . She was unchained and in an area of . the barn deep with straw and cordoned off by an electric fence. Miss Law . said this was because the Roberts knew keeping her chained was ‘not . permissible under the required standards’. But the RSPCA was still concerned . Anne was not receiving appropriate medication for arthritis which she . was diagnosed with in 2003, the court heard. The owners agreed to hand . over the elephant to Longleat Wildlife Park. Bobby Roberts, 69, claims he instructed the groom only to keep Anne chained at certain times and to let her go outside when the weather was good. Moira Roberts, 73, claims to have had nothing to do with the elephant’s care. The Roberts, of Oundle, Northamptonshire, each deny causing unnecessary suffering to Anne, failing to prevent employee Nicolai Nitu from causing her suffering, and failing to ensure her needs were met. The groom is thought to have fled to his native Romania. The case continues. Watch the whole film here .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:49 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:39 EST, 19 November 2012 . Looking to the future: Louise Robinson says pupils will learn via Skype and video games in the future . A new breed of ‘Star Trek school’ will allow pupils to play video games and learn from their comfort of their homes using web-based lessons and Skype, the leader of the country’s private girls’ schools predicted today. Britain’s school system is failing to keep up with 21st century technology and must modernise to equip pupils with the skills they will need in future, according to Louise Robinson. She said computer games such as ‘immune attack’ – where players attempt to stop the body being taken over by a virus – could be used to assess factual knowledge as well as decision-making and logical thinking. Seeing a character killed off in a game was ‘not a failure’, she insisted. Pupils learned determination and perseverance as they tried new techniques to overcome the setback, she said. Schools in future could also teach pupils topics such as Pythagoras’ theorem at home through internet connections and then reinforce them in class, in a reversal of the traditional approach of school-based lessons followed by homework. Mrs Robinson, president of the Girls’ Schools Association, shared her vision of how schools could prepare children for life in the 2020s in a keynote speech. The self-confessed Star Trek fan and ‘techie’ said many technological advances foreshadowed by the cult sci-fi series had already materialised, such as mobile phones, speaking directly to a computer and light sensors. ‘The Star Trek society is upon us – but where is the Star Trek school?’ she said. ‘We already know we are in a situation where our school-based provision lags behind the technology of the 21st century. The way forward? Children could be learning from home via Skype in the future . ‘The question we must ask ourselves, as education leaders, is what are we going to do about it? ‘We must do more to prepare our pupils for the world as it is and as it will be.’ Her call came days after Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans for a new hi-tech computer science curriculum with the same status as traditional subjects. Pupils as young as seven could be required to learn to ‘code’ or write computer programs. Inspiring a new generation: Louise Robinson is a fan of the popular TV show Star Trek . But Mrs Robinson, head of Merchant Taylor’s Girls’ School in Crosby, Liverpool, said many of Mr Gove’s other proposed reforms to public exams and the school curriculum were ‘taking us back to a bygone era’. She insisted she was not calling for ‘immediate wholesale change’ but more ‘creative curriculum decisions’. ‘If you watch a child playing a game, whether it is a technological game or not, they learn by doing, failing, trying new pathways and techniques,’ she told the GSA’s annual conference in Liverpool. Learning via games: Mrs Robinson says video games such as immune attack can be educational . ‘Being killed off in a game is not a failure. Most children will continue with determination, and persevere for a long time; and before you think it's about ‘shoot and kill’, have you watched an 8 year old playing “build a zoo”.’ Outlining how the ‘classroom of the future’ might look, she said: ‘Will we be able to use online/remote delivery of lessons with local support via Skype or use the gaming world?’ Games involving decision-making and role-playing could help pupils develop problem-solving skills, she said. In ‘immune attack’ for example ‘the teachers can see how well the facts are known by students as they can assess whether the game is approached with logic or by a random approach’. But she added that, although schools in the future ‘may have to avatars or virtual teachers’, teachers will still be needed ‘in some form or other’. ‘Nothing else provides quite the same subtlety and effectiveness of communication our body language and immediate presence can provide.’ Stuck in the past: Louise Robinson said Michael Gove's policies were taking education back to a bygone era . In a wide-ranging speech, Mrs Robinson also insisted that private schools should not be forced to share their facilities and expertise with their state school ‘competition’. Fee-paying middle-class parents were already faced with ‘increasing’ charges due to the growing weight of regulation and red tape private schools are coming under. It was ‘beyond the pale’ to expect schools to share facilities and their ‘DNA’ – such as their expertise in running Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) – with state school parents who had decided against sending their children private schools. David Cameron and Mr Gove have both urged private schools to sponsor state-funded academies and share resources and facilities. Mrs Robinson said private schools were prepared to help, but on their own terms. ‘Many of us happily do this already with a wide variety of schools on our own terms, but when we are squeezed between the tightening rules and regulations being imposed upon us, the rising cost of our provision and the ability of middle-class parents to pay our increasing fees, it seems a bit beyond the pale to ask if we will share aspects of our unique selling point with local competition,’ she said. ‘And competition it is; why should my school offer its expertise and experience to parents who could have sent their children to my school, but chose not to, or to a Government who criticises my morality?’","Video games will help teach pupils factual knowledge .

Allegations: Nurse Rosebud June Fazakerley, pictured, is accused of threatening to beat up a fellow nurse the 'African Way' A care home nurse threatened to teach a colleague a lesson by beating her up 'in the African way' during an aggressive outburst, a tribunal heard. Rosebud Fazackerley allegedly threatened to attack fellow nurse Carla Perestrelo, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told today. 'Ms Fazackerley spoke in loud tones, . she was pacing the room, using her arms, and alternating between . shouting and aggressive body language', said Rachel Ellis, for the NMC. 'During the registrant's rant, she . threatened to wait outside for Ms Perestrelo and beat her b****h's ass . and beat her in the African way, or words to that effect.' Ms Fazackerley's rant came after she had been demoted by manager Sharon Walker at Highlands Luxury Care Home in St Saviour, Jersey, she added. It was claimed Ms Fazackerley had been transferred there after begging colleagues at her former workplace La . Haule Care Home, in St Brelade, to help her sick mother before blowing it on rent and holidays, a hearing was told. Fazackerley borrowed more than . £1,000 from care assistants while telling them it would be used to pay . medical bills, it was said. But she was living in an expensive flat and jetting off on holiday while sponging off workmates, the tribunal was told. Fazackerley, who only paid back £100 . of the various loans, is also said to have obtained a free bed from the . Jersey care home where she worked after claiming she was short of cash. Shortly after being transferred to Highlands Luxury Care Home, tensions mounted between Fazackerley and manager Sharon Walker, the tribunal was told. 'Ms Fazackerley made comments about . Sharon Walker that she was not a proper manager and she would bring her . down', Ms Ellis said. 'The registrant also suggested a care . assistant was transferred to the home because she was having a sexual . relationship with a resident. 'By the way the registrant was speaking, it was not interpreted as colleagues gossiping or having a laugh.' Claims: Nurse Rosebud Fazackerley launched the threatening outbirst to a colleague while working Highlands Luxury Care Home in St Saviour, Jersey, pictured, the tribunal was told . Fazackerley's outburst is said to have . happened during evening handover on October 21, 2010, less than a month . after she was transferred by employers Four Seasons Health Care to . Highlands Luxury Care Home in St Saviour, Jersey. Several of her former colleagues at La . Haule Care Home, in St Brelade, Jersey, which is run by the same firm, . had complained that she had accepted loans and failed to pay them back. 'The registrant approached Tom . Colville, a senior care assistant on May 2009, initially asking for £300 . before increasing the request to £600', said Ms Ellis. 'Mr Colville gave him £600 and the registrant told him she would pay him back when she got paid. 'However, when she got paid she made no mention of the money and did not pay him back. 'She then asked for a further £300 to pay for rent, which Mr Colville loaned her.' Accusations: Rosebud Fazackerley was transferred from working at La Haule Care Home, pictured, in St Brelade, Jersey . Fazackerley has admitted only giving . Mr Colville £100 back of the £900 she took, but denies cheating other . colleagues out of money. She is accused of asking for £100 . apiece from two care assistants, telling them she needed money for her . daughter and for her sick mother's medical treatment. Fazackerley is then said to have taken . another loan from a fourth colleague of between £60 and £75, which she . failed to pay back. Fazackerley, then the deputy manager . of the elderly care home, was investigated by Ms Walker over the loans, . which were made between January and August 2009. 'There are a number of witnesses who . will say the registrant asked to borrow money because she was short of . money', Ms Ellis said. 'Tom Colville will say that after he lent the registrant money, she went on an expensive holiday. 'Another witness, Lee Edwardson, gives evidence that the home gave the registrant a bed because she was short of money. 'He delivered the bed to a top of the range flat he describes as being very expensive. 'All the people she borrowed money from were care assistants, and her means were higher.' Fazackerley has admitted borrowing £900 from Mr Colville and repaying just £100. She denies the eight other charges she faces. If found guilty of misconduct she could be kicked out of the profession.

Michael O'Leary said Boris Johnson's plan for a Thames Estuary airport was 'insane, stupid and hare-brained' Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary kept his language uncharacteristically clean when he told MPs that  the ‘Boris Island’ airport plan was worthy only of language that would be ‘unsuitable’ in Parliament. But pushed by MPs to explain further, he said London Mayor Boris Johnson’s plan for a Thames Estuary airport was ‘insane, stupid and hare-brained’ as well as being ‘insanely and asininely stupid.’ Ryanair chief executive Mr O'Leary was giving evidence to the House of Commons Transport Select Committee. Mr O'Leary erupted when asked for his thoughts about a new airport in the Thames Estuary - a scheme favoured by London Mayor Boris Johnson. Mr O'Leary initially replied that his views of such a plan would involve language unsuitable in Parliament. He added: ‘Such a scheme is insane, stupid and hare-brained. To try to come up with a new green-field site plan with no infrastructure and no motorway or rail links and which would take the rest of my life to build is insanely and asininely stupid.’ Mr O'Leary said it made more sense to expand at airports where there were was infrastructure already. He was keen to see more runway capacity in south-east England to help reverse the downturn in passenger numbers in recent years – including new runways at each of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. This would ‘allow more (overseas) visitors and would grow tourism and grow jobs’. He told the committee he could not join those who welcomed the Whitehall-ordered aviation commission, chaired by former Financial Services Authority boss Sir Howard Davies, which is due to present its final report into airport expansion options to the Government in summer 2015. Insanely and asininely stupid: Mr O'Leary said that airports with existing infrastructure should be expanded . Mr O'Leary said: 'It (the commission) is just another example of kicking the aviation strategy can further down the road.' He said the Government could make a decision on aviation policy ‘by 7pm tonight and we could do away with two years of deliberation’. There was some parliamentary knock-about when Mr O'Leary said passengers flocked to Ryanair, which was now carrying 80million passengers a year. To laughter, the committee's chairman Louise Ellman (Lab, Liverpool Riverside) replied: ‘They may flock to you but I am not sure they love you.’ Huge: Foster and Partners artist impression of the Thames Hub, a four-runway Thames Estuary airport capable of handling 150 million passengers a year . Big idea: Boris Johnson backs the idea to have a new airport in the Thames Estuary . Mr O'Leary told MPs Ryanair could have grown passenger numbers more in the UK but had chosen to take more business overseas due to the 'uncompetitive APD (air passenger duty airport departure tax) and uncompetitive airport charges'. He said APD should be scrapped and he reiterated his long-held views about the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), saying the authority had been 'a complete disaster' in regulating the aviation industry and 'did not know much about air transport at all'. Asked if he recognised that MPs had to take many things into account when supporting new runways, Mr O'Leary said: ‘Do you pander to the noisy, militant few or do you make reasonable decisions in favour of the many? ‘One of the downsides of being an MP is that you are called upon to make sensible, long-term economic decisions."" Simon Buck chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA) told MPs that UK aviation has suffered from decades of non-decision-making, an airline trade association chief told MPs. He said it was vital that politicians of all parties accept the recommendations of the Davies Commission which is charged with outlining aviation policy. Mr Buck said: ‘We have had 30 to 40 years of decisions (on aviation) being put off or not made.’ He said: ‘The commission findings must be accepted by all political parties.’ Non-acceptance and the need for further reviews would be the 'worst possible thing' for UK aviation. Mr O'Leary claimed, to some laughter, that passengers were flocking to Ryanair, which is now carrying 80million passengers a year . Virgin Atlantic government and external relations general manager Sian Foster said her airline was looking for the commission to come up with recommendations for a single hub airport for the UK. But easyJet UK director Paul Simmons told the MPs that most UK airport passenger movements were not at a hub airport.","He labelled plan for a Thames Estuary airport 'hare-brained' and 'stupid'

A few chickens clucking in the back garden provide fresh eggs every morning, more money in your pocket and a little taste of the Good Life. But the 500,000 households across Britain now keeping their own flocks could also pose a major health threat to the poultry industry. Veterinary experts say many of us keeping chickens at home have little understanding of how to control disease in the birds, along with insufficient knowledge of health regulations. Major health threat: Many of the 500,000 households across Britain keeping their own flocks have little understanding of how to control disease in the birds . They warn this could hasten the spread of disease from backyard flocks to commercial poultry farms. A survey by the Royal Veterinary College found most back garden flock owners provided their birds with good living conditions. But 75 per cent did not comply with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs regulations which outlaw birds being fed on kitchen waste. Farmers have been banned from feeding such waste to chickens since 2001, because some agents of disease can survive in household food products. 75 per cent of back garden flock owners do not comply with regulations . Feeding such food to chickens can spread disease. The survey, published this month in the journal of British Poultry Science, also found lapses in biosecurity, with very few owners keeping human visitors, wild birds and rodents away from their flocks. Few properly vaccinated their birds. They found that nearly half of flock owners would not seek veterinary help if their birds became ill, despite RVC guidelines saying chickens should be cared for like any pet. Around 40 per cent said they would dispose of dead birds by burying them in their gardens, when they should be incinerated to prevent disease spreading through groundwater and wild species. Another serious concern was the low awareness of diseases such as Marek’s disease, infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis, all common in backyard flocks in Britain. Keeping chickens is also a major risk factor for diarrhoea in children since the birds’ droppings can contain the disease agent campylobacter jejuni. More than a third of the chicken keepers surveyed had children, which highlights the risk posed to families. Study co-author Iveta Karabozhilova . called for greater regulation of back garden chickens and more . communication between householders and health officials. ‘Making information available and easily accessible is of high priority from a disease control perspective,’ she said. ‘Even though evidence from our study shows that flock owners provide enriched living conditions to the chickens, they ought to realise that their pets are a farmed species and are subjected to regulations.’ Poultry vet Barry Thorp, from the St David’s Poultry Team practice in Scotland, said: ‘A lack of education and awareness by those who buy them certainly make the birds more vulnerable to disease and therefore pose a bigger threat of spreading it.’","500,000 households across Britain pose a major threat to poultry industry .

One of Britain’s richest women was subjected to a terrifying knifepoint ordeal by a burglar who stole jewellery worth £250,000. Patsy Bloom, 72, was confronted while watching TV in bed by a deranged intruder who screamed ‘Give me everything you’ve got.’ He then frogmarched her to a safe and escaped with a huge haul, including a £68,000 pair of 18-carat white gold earrings and a £19,000 diamond pendant. Terrifying knifepoint ordeal: Violent criminal Ricky Gray (right), 30, was jailed for four years after leaving Patsy Bloom (left), 72, 'extremely shaken' by the raid at her £3.5million home overlooking London's Regent's Park . Miss Bloom, who netted £16million with the sale of animal insurer Petplan, was left ‘extremely shaken’ by the raid at her £3.5million home overlooking London’s Regent’s Park. The man responsible was violent criminal Ricky Gray who was in the middle of a spree of offences to fund his cocaine addiction. Two months earlier the 30-year-old snatched an £11,000 platinum diamond solitaire ring from a jeweller in the shadow of the London Stock Exchange. But despite his appalling criminal record of 61 offences including muggings, burglaries and attacks, Gray could be freed from prison in just four years. Judge Henry Blacksell QC branded him ‘uncontrolled’ and prepared to use ‘desperate measures’ as he jailed him for eight years. Gray, who will automatically be released after serving half that amount of time, responded by smiling and yelling, ‘Cheers, thank you!’ as he was led away. Scene: The block near Regent's Park in London where the terrifying raid took place on Miss Bloom's property . The judge said: ‘This was a lone woman, it was her home, and she was entitled to be in her home and feel she was safe. 'This was a lone woman, it was her home, and she was entitled to be in her home and feel she was safe. She was abused by you and terrified into giving you her property. It was audacious, and that is why you are a risk to the general public' Judge Henry Blacksell QC . ‘She was abused by you and terrified into giving you her property. It was audacious, and that is why you are a risk to the general public.’ News of the raid came just weeks after Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe said Britons were safer in their own homes ‘than they have ever been in a generation’. But in Westminster, the latest police figures reveal residential burglaries have soared by almost 40 per cent in recent months. Miss Bloom became one of the country’s best known businesswomen after she shared the £32million sale price of Petplan in 1996. The animal lover, who once had a Yorkshire Terrier named Champers, founded the company more than 30 years earlier to fill a gap in the market. House safety: News of the raid came just weeks after Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe said Britons were safer in their own homes 'than they have ever been in a generation' Her ordeal took place when she returned to her five-storey period home after visiting a friend in hospital in May. 'Her bedroom door opened slowly, and the defendant came into the room. He had a knife, which he was pointing at her. He was using both hands to hold it, and used something to cover the handle' Robert Hutchinson, prosecuting . Prosecutor Robert Hutchinson told . Blackfriars Crown Court: ‘After showering, she got into bed in order to . watch the news and use her iPad. ‘As she did so, her bedroom door opened slowly, and the defendant came into the room. He had a knife, which he was pointing at her. He was using both hands to hold it, and used something to cover the handle.’ After saying he would not hurt her, Gray screamed: ‘Give me everything you’ve got.’ Mr Hutchinson said: ‘She pointed to a safe which contained her jewellery, and managed to handle the situation calmly and take out all of her jewellery boxes.’ The thief made off with an enormous haul – none of which has been recovered – together with an iPad, iPhone, £500 cash, and several jewellery boxes worth up to £400 each. Stolen: The thief made off with an enormous jewellery haul - none of which has been recovered - together with an iPad (left; file picture), iPhone (right; file), £500 cash, and several jewellery boxes worth up to £400 each . Police tracked him down after forensic experts found his fingerprints on a metal cash box in the kitchen. They discovered that just two months earlier he snatched a platinum diamond solitaire ring from a City jeweller, biting the manager’s fist as she tried to hang on to it. Gray stuck at Ernest Jones in Paternoster Square after walking in and asking to look at a £10,999 diamond ring. When staff became suspicious, manager Diawala Odedra silently locked the front doors, trapping the thief inside when he tried to bolt moments later. Mr Hutchinson said: ‘There was then an exchange during which Miss Odedra demanded he hand the ring back, and if he did so she would let him go. 'They were physically scuffling for the course of a minute, and then he handed the ring back.’ Hearing: Judge Henry Blacksell QC at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) branded Gray 'uncontrolled' and prepared to use 'desperate measures' as he jailed him for eight years . Miss Odedra unlocked the doors, letting Gray out, but he immediately ran back inside and bit her hand as he grabbed the ring and made off. Saliva from her hand was matched to a DNA profile recorded against his name on police databases. The court heard Gray was also responsible for three further crimes, including a violent phone robbery and a burglary at his cousin’s home. Avi Chaudhury, defending, said Gray, who has also been convicted of harassment, stole to buy cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine. He said the criminal made little effort to conceal his identity because all he cared about was his ‘next fix’. Gray, of Dartford, Kent, admitted a single count each of robbery, theft, and aggravated burglary and four counts of burglary. A further burglary charge was left to lie on file, while 21 similar offences were taken into consideration.","Ricky Gray, 30, jailed for four years after terrifying ordeal for Patsy Bloom .

A female lawyer for an anti-gay Christian group abducted a teenage girl and forced her to have sex on camera while on bail for child pornography charges, it is alleged. Lisa Biron, 43, was arrested by FBI agents in a Manchester courtroom while awaiting a hearing on district-level charges of possessing pornographic material on her computer. A few hours later, she was taken into a court in Concord, New Hampshire, accused of taking the teenage girl to Canada, making her engage in sexual activity and convincing her to let it be filmed. Biron, who is associated with the anti-gay group Alliance Defending Freedom, was initially arrested after a man walked into the Manchester Police Department claiming he had seen pornography on her computer. After a search of her computer, police found five videos and two pictures of a teenage girl on her computer. Biron was released on bail on seven charges of possessing child pornography earlier this month. After her arrest by the FBI, she allegedly told agents they would find a loaded pistol under her mattress. They didn't find a weapon, but they did discover 200 rounds of ammunition in her Manchester home. At the hearing on federal-level charges, the prosecutor also alleged that: .

But Judge Landya McCafferty remanded her in custody after saying she was 'not at all comfortable' that she would comply with any new bail conditions. She is due to stand trial in January on the federal charges of transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, possession of child pornography and five counts of sexual exploitation of children. She faces up to life in prison if convicted. Biron, who was briefly associated with the Donais Law Offices in Manchester before her arrest, has been suspended indefinitely.

As the daughter of a £13million lottery winner, Ffion Jenkins was perhaps entitled to hope for a pretty special 17th birthday party. Unfortunately for her, that hope was shared by about 200 teenagers who arrived at her house to join the raucous celebrations after the event was advertised on Facebook. While Ffion’s mother, Sandra Fosbrooke, was at the local pub which she co-owns, partygoers were running riot at her six-bedroom home. Jackpot: Sandra Fosbrooke, with former partner Ken Henry in 2005 when they won £12.8 on the Lottery. Ms Fosbrooke was at the nearby Stag Pub in Five Roads, which she jointly runs, while her daughter Ffion's daugher descended into chaos . The police had to be called after the party descended into violence, and six arrests were made amid reports of fights and windows being smashed. Yesterday Mrs Fosbrooke, who won £12.8million on the lottery in 2005 with her then partner Ken Henry, would not comment on the chaotic event. But she may have been left wishing she had spent some of her winnings on hiring a security guard or two for the evening. As for Ffion, despite apparently already having fallen foul of the social networking site, she took to Facebook again after the party to declare that it had put the village where she lives ‘on the map’. Witnesses said it took police 40 minutes to calm the party down at the family home in Five Roads near Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, on Friday night. Lottery winner Sandra Fosbrooke, pictured left, refused to comment after her home was trashed by 200 gatecrashers who read about the birthday party of her daughter Ffion Jenkins 17, right, on Facebook . Home sweet home: Six people have been arrested after Sandra Fosbrooke's house in Five Roads, Llanelli, was trashed by gatecrashers . One said: ‘There were about 200 people, with fights starting everywhere. It was chaos. I think someone threw a flatscreen telly out of the window. The house has been badly damaged.’ In a series of internet posts after the party, Ffion wrote: ‘Five Roads is now on the map of madness :( urrrggg.’ She commented that ‘everything kicked off’ and she did not think she ‘should show my face in this village again!’, adding that her birthday and Christmas had been ruined and that none of her family wanted to talk to her. While she appeared to be at least somewhat repentant, friends complimented her on the party. One wrote on her Facebook page: ‘You had one hell of a party – many thanks, you deserve a pat on the back!!’  while another added: ‘It was brilliant while it lasted!’ High life: Former Asda worker Ms Fosbrooke and former bingo caller Ken Henry shared the jackpot in 2005. Since their win Ms Fosbrooke has gone back to work at a historic pub she rescued from closure . After their lottery win seven years ago, Mrs Fosbrooke, then a £5.44-an-hour supermarket cashier, and Mr Henry, a cleaner in a factory, went all over the world on exotic holidays, including a trip to Las Vegas. The couple, who each had two children from previous relationships, with Ffion being the youngest, splashed out on property and cars as well as buying gifts for relatives. They moved a few miles from their terrace house in a mining village and bought the most expensive house for miles around – a £1.2million gated five-bedroom, six-bathroom mansion mockingly called Buckingham Palace by locals. The pair earned more than £1,750-a-day in interest – but also became members of their local bingo club. When they broke up earlier this year, dividing their fortune, Mrs Fosbrooke moved into a £415,000 luxury property round the corner, which is where Friday’s party was held. Recent move: Lottery winning mother Sandra Fosbrooke moved in to the property earlier this year after breaking up with her partner Ken Henry, pictured above . A police spokesman said: ‘Police attended a property in the Five Roads area of Llanelli following reports of a disturbance. ‘The call was received at approximately 9.20pm on Friday November 16. Six people were arrested for public order offences, criminal damage and possession of cannabis.’ A girl of 18 and boy of 19 are due to appear in court next month. The others, including two aged 17, were freed on bail. It is the latest in a string of teenagers’ parties to be gatecrashed after details were posted online. Earlier this month, a court heard how a 13-year-old girl’s birthday party was stormed by 60 older teenagers who had seen details on Facebook. The girl’s father, architect Shaun Beverley, tried to get the uninvited mob to leave his award-winning £1.1million home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, in July but was punched to the floor, kicked and spat on in a ‘vicious and horrendous’ attack.

A benefits cheat caught building a swimming pool in her back garden has been forced to sell her house to repay the £50,000 she swindled. Mother-of-four Patricia Burland told fraud investigators she was paying for the pool with contributions from her sons. But a judge today ordered the 53-year-old to sell her house so she could repay the taxpayer. Burland made a valid application for income support on the basis she was a single parent, Southampton Crown Court heard. But she failed to tell the authorities that from March 2005 her husband Adrian was again living with her full time. She was caught after the Department for Works and Pensions launched an investigation and carried out surveillance on her home. Surveillance confirmed her husband’s works van was parked outside early in the morning and late at night, in Southampton, Hampshire. Initially she admitted he had been staying with her for a few nights a week but later confirmed they had been living together again. Burland explained she was 'scared' her benefit would stop and her husband would leave her. She was also in arrears with her mortgage. Burland admitted two breaches of failing to declare a change of circumstance and received a 24 week suspended sentence with 12 months supervision. Prosecutor Patrick Moran told the court the fraud amounted to £47,914.28 and her realisable assets stood at £76.569.32. Andy Houston, defending, said Burland . lacked self confidence to stand up to her husband and was clearly . concerned about threats he would leave her.

A teenage burglar has been spared prison on condition that he helps his mother with some light housework. Jamie Froom, 18, was told he  can stay out of jail if he makes his bed, does the washing-up and is nice to his parents. The drug-user admitted breaking into two houses after he had left his family home following a series of rows. But he was allowed to walk free from court – despite accepting that he deserved a jail sentence – after he agreed to move back in with his parents and help around the house. Be good: Judge David Ticehurst, left, told Jamie Froom, right, to wash up, make his bed and respect his parents after he pleaded guilty to two burglaries . Not too harsh: Froom will have to complete 120 hours of unpaid community service and six months of drugs rehabilitation as well as helping out at home . Helping himself: Jamie claims he is handy around the house . Judge David Ticehurst told him: ‘You can make your bed every day, do the washing-up and respect your mum and dad.’ The judge told Froom’s mother to let the court know if he does not pull his weight at home – and her son would be sent to prison. After the hearing, Froom’s 35-year-old mother Melanie, a carer, said she approved of the sentence, which also included her son being ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and six months of drug rehabilitation. The mother of five said: ‘I thought what the judge said was good. ‘I quite appreciated it. I felt the judge was on my side.’ Her son, however, was less welcoming of the verdict – and said it had given his mother an excuse to nag him. Parental duties: Froom's mother 35-year-old . Melanie, pictured left in an old photo, said she appreciated that the . judge had seemed to be 'on her side' He added yesterday: ‘I think he was a bit strict, saying I have to tidy my room or go to prison. ‘My mum and nan were at court and they completely agreed with him. I think I’m quite good around the house. I do my room and sometimes I do the washing. I can’t do anything today though, because I’ve got probation. Since the court case my mum has been on at me to do more. She’s been telling me to do the cleaning, wash the clothes and sort my room out. ‘I am going to try and do it though. I don’t want to go to prison.’ He then added: ‘To be honest, I think he should have sent me to prison for what I did. Out of trouble: Froom will return to his family home, pictured, after he was caught along with two other youths as they fled the second house they had burgled . ‘I’m going to keep out of trouble now. I don’t work, I did media studies at college but now I want to be a mechanic, like my dad.’ The court heard that Froom, from Bristol, had taken part in two burglaries in the city in April. The owner of the first house returned to find property stolen and people fleeing the scene. Bristol Crown Court heard last week that in a raid on the second house three teenagers carrying stolen goods were caught as  they fled. Nicholas Fridd, prosecuting, told the court: ‘All property was recovered, which included computer equipment, euros and a ring.’ Confession: Froom pleaded guilty to two daytime burglaries at Bristol Crown Court and will have to complete 120 hours unpaid work and six months of drug rehabilitation for cannabis use . Two youths aged 15 and 16 at the time pleaded guilty to their involvement and were sent to be dealt with at the youth court. Froom’s sentence attracted condemnation yesterday. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouthshire, said: ‘It is an absolutely disgraceful sentence. People who commit burglaries should go to prison automatically.’","Jamie Froom, 18, was told to make his bed and do the washing up .

Speaking out: Liverpool University vice-chancellor Professor Sir Howard Newby said the issue was an 'unintended consequence' of the sector's overhaul . Thousands of places at top universities were left unfilled this year as a result of the Government’s higher education reforms, a leading academic said yesterday. The 11,500 lost places were an ‘unintended consequence’ of  the overhaul of the sector, according to Professor Sir Howard Newby, vice-chancellor of Liverpool University. And he warned that the same situation could happen next year. ‘One of the startling unintended . consequences is that currently, this year, there are about 11,500 empty . places in Russell Group universities,’ he said at the Girls’ Schools . Association conference. He said the reasons for the empty . places were the ‘downward pressure’ on A-level grades that meant there . were not so many students around to recruit, and there was ‘some . slacking of demand in certain subjects, mainly humanities and social . sciences’. Under the Government’s higher . education reforms, this year universities were free to recruit as many . students with at least two As and a B at A-level as they wanted. The Russell Group, which includes . Oxford and Cambridge as well as other institutions  such as Warwick, . Durham, Bristol and Edinburgh, generally ask prospective students for . higher grades, and are charging up to the maximum £9,000 a year in fees. Speaking after the conference in . Liverpool last night, Sir Howard said that in general Russell Group . universities had smaller allocations to recruit students with less than . AAB. There were also fewer students achieving A grades at A-level, with fewer students applying for degree courses. Changes: Under the Government's higher education reforms, this year universities were free to recruit as many students with at least two As and a B at A-level as they wanted . Next year, ministers have said that universities will be free to recruit as many students with an A and two Bs as they like. But Sir Howard said: ‘We believe, in the Russell Group certainly, we could have a  further round of empty places next year.’ 'One of the startling unintended consequences is that currently, this year, there are about 11,500 empty places in Russell Group universities' Professor Sir Howard Newby, Liverpool University vice-chancellor . It is not known where the empty places are within the Russell Group’s 24 institutions, or if they are spread out evenly. Hilary French, head of Central . Newcastle High School and president elect of the Girls’ School . Association said: ‘It seems to be ludicrous. ‘Our girls got places, but to think there are places sitting there and there were people who would have taken those places.’ She suggested that Russell Group universities should have made their unfilled places available through clearing.

The man who subjected Australian teenager Madeleine Pulver to 12 hours of terror when he attached a fake collar bomb around her neck was jailed for a minimum of 10 years today. As he jailed Paul Douglas Peters, Judge Peter Zahra said in the New South Wales Supreme Court that the terror the 18-year-old would have felt ‘cannot be described’. Wearing a rainbow-coloured ski mask, Peters, now 52, broke into her family’s £8million home in the wealthy Sydney suburb of Mosman on August 3 last year and strapped a black metal box around Madeleine’s neck with a bicycle chain. Sent down: Paul Douglas Peters (pictured) has been jailed for a minimum of ten years after subjecting teenager Madeleine Pulver to 12 hours of terror when he attached a fake collar bomb around her neck . Deranged: Peters told a psychiatrist he had no memory of the crime, but suggested he had taken on the persona of a character in a book he was writing . A note attached to the device – which . was finally found to be a hoax – was an extortion aimed against her . parents, Bill and Belinda Pulver, along with a warning that the box . contained sophisticated plastic explosives. The note added that Madeleine and her . family would suffer from a ‘tragically avoidable explosion’ if they . failed to send ‘funds’ to a supplied email address. Today Madeleine sat with her parents . in the courtroom staring occasionally at the failed businessman as he . wept in the dock while listening to the judge describe the fear that the . schoolgirl would have felt as bomb disposal experts worked carefully to . detach the device. Referring to the note attached to the . fake bomb, the judge said: ‘The contents of the document…was to place . the victim in fear that she would be killed. ‘He was armed. He concealed his face…(Madeleine) was extremely vulnerable. It was a deliberate act of extortion.’ Horrific: Madeleine, pictured emerging from her home with her mother in Sydney, Australia, was used by Peters to try to extort money from her parents . Victim: Madeleine Pulver, who had a suspected bomb attached to her after a masked man entered her family's Mosman home in Sydney . Madeleine Pulver arrives by ambulance at the Royal North Shore Hospital after the siege . Peters, who was carrying a baseball . bat when he broke into the house, had told a psychiatrist that he had no . memory of the crime but suggested he had taken on the persona of a . character in a book he was writing. But the judge said it was . ‘unproductive to speculate’ why Peters chose Madeleine, who was . approached by the masked intruder when she was doing her homework in her . bedroom, as his victim. As Madeleine watched, Peters began to cry as Judge Zahra told of the unravelling of his life in the lead-up to his crime. The court heard he had been left . distraught by the breakdown of his marriage and career trouble, . believing he had lost everything. He told a psychiatrist that he had to . find ‘an ingenious way to trap myself’ because he was drinking heavily . and knew he needed help. ‘I had to catch myself out,’ he told the . psychiatrist. ‘I had to lay evidence along the way to trap myself.’ Millionaire's daughter Madeleine Pulver, 18, who was freed after spending hours with a 'bomb hanging round her neck' The home of Madeleine Pulver, where bomb squad specialists safely freed her after 10 hours with a device attached around her neck, in the Sydney suburb of Mosman . The court was told that Peters had . started to morph himself into John Chan, one of the characters in his . book and he was looking for ‘dual revenge for Chan and for me,’ a . defence the judge said he was ‘not prepared to accept’. Among those in the court was police . officer Karen Lowden, described as a ‘very courageous policewoman’ who . supported Madeleine during her ordeal when she was ‘crying and scared . for her life.’ Evidence was given that Peters was . suffering from a bipolar disorder and was in a state of ‘isolation and . personality disintegration’ when he committed the crime. Although Madeleine’s parents said . after the sentencing that they were still baffled why Peters had chosen . their daughter as his victim, Crown Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen told the . court that he had simply ‘gone to the wrong house’, having initially . intended to extort a wealthy trust beneficiary who also lived in Mosman.

Sentencing Peters to 13 years and six . months in jail – with a minimum of 10 years to be served – Judge Zahra . said the sentence called for a strong element of deterrence, both for . the specific offender and this offender as an individual. 'The offender placed the victim in fear that she was going to die in order to export money from her family. ‘The victim was vulnerable, being . entitled to the sanctuary of her own home…the terror she experienced can . only be described as unimaginable.’ Speaking outside the court, Madeleine . said she was pleased with the sentencing and that she and her family . could now look to a future ‘where Paul Peters’ name is not linked with . mine.’ Her father said: ‘She’s a very, very . special young lady who has handled herself with incredible poise and . dignity throughout this trial.'","Paul Peters broke into 18-year-old Madeleine Pulver's £8m Sydney home .

She told the East London Tribunal that . the pub owner, Michael Burgess, and bar manager Maria Bather subjected . her to months of verbal abuse and even violence between July to October last year. The management of the Commerical Tavern, which is a sister pub to Soho gay bar the Friendly Society, strongly deny her allegations. 'Abuse': Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day said she was pushed down the stairs, invited to gay orgies and threatened with a hammer . 'With my sexuality mostly it was Michael Burgess,' Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day told the pre-hearing review. 'He occasionally used the word ""lezza"". More often he would discuss my sexuality . with customers in the bar and tell them I was his lesbian girlfriend . and discuss lesbian sexual acts. 'Michael verbally and physically . assaulted me because I was gay and I experienced more discrimination . than the other females because of it. 'Michael Burgess only assaults . women.

Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day said bar manager Ms Bather, with whom Mr Burgess is . in a relationship, would join in the homophobic abuse and . even invited her to gay orgies. The claimed the alleged . abuse escalated when she was pushed down the pub’s stairs by Mr Burgess . after he accused her of having an affair with Ms Bather. Just a fortnight later, on October 7, . she said Mr Burgess physically assaulted her and then Ms Bather turned . up at her house to threaten her with a hammer. The bartender, who suffers from bi-polar disorder, also claims she was subjected to belittling comments accusing her of being a 'mentalist' and was refused breaks, despite both bosses knowing about her condition.

She said: 'To a certain extent it was clear that the claimant was making things up as she went along. 'She was unspecific about things. These allegations are bordering on fanciful.' Ms Davies told the tribunal that Mr Burgess strongly denies claims he pushed the bartender down the stairs, and that a case brought against Ms Bather for threatening her with a hammer was eventually dropped by police. Ms Von Kappelhoff-Day is suing Ms Bather, Mr Burgess and Brimheath Developments for sex and disability discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of her sexual orientation and breach of contract.

Negative stories about Elliott leak from the GMA set on an alarmingly regular basis and bosses have been forced to act due to a growing number of complaints from members of the team. Diva-like behavior: Good Morning America co-anchor Josh Elliott has reportedly been forced to attend a showdown with ABC top brass over his on-set behavior . 'He’s being gossiped about in the media, and Josh is lashing out in a passive-aggressive way,' an insider told the New York Post. 'They’re concerned about his behavior and trying to come up with a game plan. He’s a popular anchor, and they want to stop the gossip and focus on developing his talent.' GMA insiders describe Elliott as the most high maintenance of the show’s anchors, someone who regularly ‘lashes out’ at writers when he doesn’t like scripts and who has 'serious trust issues with women stemming from a difficult childhood.' GMA producer Tom Cibrowski issued a denial several months ago, going as far as describing Elliott as ‘the ultimate team player’ - but the allegations have kept coming. A Good Morning America spokesperson described the allegations about Elliott as 'absolutely false' and described the meeting as a 'very productive' discussion about other potential projects for Josh and additional support for him. Elliott has also been in the news over his relationship with WABC-TV anchor Liz Cho, although that has apparently cooled due to his 'trust issues' and flirtations with other women. Reports surfaced earlier this month that Elliott had regularly been spotted doing the 'walk of shame' from Cho’s apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. A source told RadarOnline: 'Josh Elliott, right. has been seen sneaking out of local anchor Liz Cho's apartment way early in the morning. ' The couple were first reported to be in a relationship in September and a source told RadarOnline today: 'Josh has been seen sneaking out of Liz's apartment way early in the morning. 'It's been going on for at least three or four months, and she is in the middle of a really messy divorce.' Ms Cho, 41, split from her husband Evan Gottlieb over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment - where Josh has been seen leaving in the early hours of the morning. Josh is divorced from Priya Narang Elliot, the mother of his three-year-old daughter Sarina, while Ms Cho has a five-year-old daughter called Louisa Simone. The TV hosts were first spotted having . dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling . relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance . and they had been on a few dates. 'Trust issues with females': Josh Elliott has clashed with co-star Lara Spencer, right, but has a better relationship with Robin Roberts, left . On the GMA set, Josh has repeatedly clashed with co-host Lara Spencer . over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair's off-air relationship is anything but amicable. ‘It's . no secret that Josh has major, major issues with women. Josh had a . difficult childhood and as a result, has trust issues with females,' a source told Radar. 'He is extremely insecure and needs constant validation from everyone . around him about how wonderful he is and what a great job he is doing.' 'The only female Josh hasn't fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar. 'He is high maintenance, and if viewers could see what he was like off the air, people would be truly shocked.' Elliot . was given up for adoption at birth. Then at 12 his adopted parents . divorced and his father, who had told the family he was gay, died. In . recent years he has made contact with his birth mom Susan and, briefly, . with his biological father too. Good Morning America is the most popular morning show in the country, but Lara Spencer, left, has reportedly clashed with her male co-hosts . ‘I . got to thank Susan for my life, for not aborting me, for having the . strength to ask that she be blindfolded in the delivery room (she said . she never could’ve gone through with it, had she seen me) so she could . give me what she believed would be a better life,’ he told The Big Lead . in 2009. The . upbeat vibe and jovial mood of ABC's Good Morning America is one of the . key reasons it has toppled rival NBC show Today in the morning ratings . battle this year. On . camera at least, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Josh Elliott, . Sam Champion and Lara Spencer have created a winning formula. Robin . Roberts is currently absent from the show while she receives treatment . for the blood and bone marrow disorder MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome). Roberts . is considered a steadying influence on the show and insiders say things . are more fraught in her absence. Co-anchor George Stephanopoulos . particularly misses her professionalism and isn't a fan of Lara Spencer, . who has been standing in for Robin.

Speaking after the case he said: 'Kasid Hussain was instrumental in providing information about his customers which enabled others to burgle their homes. 'It was an abuse of a position of trust, with unsuspecting fares chatting to him about their plans, not realising they were setting themselves up to become a victim of crime. 'We became involved after a victim reported an attempted burglary after nipping home in Hussain’s taxi to get money.

'One of life's beautiful people': New mother Kirsty Treloar was stabbed 29 times by violent ex-lover Myles Williams . A controlling lover who sent a New . Year text message to his girlfriend vowing to . stop hitting her before brutally stabbing her 29 times hours later was jailed today. Myles . Williams, 19, was jailed for a minimum of 28 years at the Old Bailey after he was found guilty in September of killing Kirsty Treloar, . 20, in front of their baby daughter and wounding the young mother's brother and sister. Miss . Treloar was stabbed just hours after Williams sent her a text message . at 11pm on New Year's Day saying: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs . ressy is that I aint going to hit u again and I won't hit u 4 this yr . next yr the yr after that the next yr after that. He . added: 'But I wont u to swear on (their daughter's) life u wont p*** me . off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.' (sic). She was killed just three weeks after giving birth to the couple's baby, who was showered with her blood. Williams stabbed her for being a 'white bitch' who was taking him for a fool. Sentencing . Williams, Judge Nicholas Cooke said: 'Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you . represent an exceptional danger to any future female partners,' He added: 'Exceptionally, this was a fatal attack in the presence of a 26-day-old child. 'That . child has been left fatherless and motherless, and some time in her . life she will discover that her father killed her mother. 'That baby was left covered in blood, probably her mother’s - a terrible thing.' Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, told the trial of Williams’s empty promise at New Year. He said: 'This can only be described as a conditional New Year’s resolution. It lasted only until the following morning.' 'Dangerous': Myles Williams was jailed at the Old Bailey for murdering Kirsty Treloar . Seven hours after sending his text, . Williams received a reply at 6.30am on January 2 from Miss Treloar . saying she did not want to see him. He broke into her family home in Hackney, east London, through the kitchen window and launched the knife attack on the trainee nursery nurse. When . her brother Dean, 23, and sister Gemma, 24, tried to help they were . also stabbed, Mr Treloar in the chest and his sister cut on her arm. 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that I aint going to hit u again and I won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that. But I wont u to swear on [their daughter's] life u wont p*** me . off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.' (sic) Myles Williams New Year's text message . Williams . dragged Kirsty into the back of his mother's Fiat Stilo and drove her away. She was later found . dead behind wheelie bins near the abandoned car two miles away. As he left the scene he boasted to a bystander that she was a 'white bitch' who had taken him 'for a fool' and added that she 'needs to die'. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC praised the young mother for her 'courage of the highest order' in protecting her family as she was being dragged away. Her sister Gemma pleaded with Williams not to take her but she whispered 'Gem, let me go' fearing that he would attack her family again. He added that Williams had added 'humiliation to brutality' by dumping her body by bins, rejecting his claims that he was trying to get her to hospital. Williams, who has an IQ of just 66, calmly spent the night with another woman before his arrest. Miss Treloar’s mother Pamela said in a statement that Williams had devastated a close family. She said: 'Myles Williams has taken a decent, loving, close family and ripped us up. 'Kirsty . was one of life’s beautiful people. She was gentle and had a heart of . gold. Kirsty loved life and was always smiling. She could not wait to . start her life as a new mum. 'Family ripped apart': Kirsty Treloar's sister Gemma, left, and brother Dean, right, photographed outside the Old Bailey during the course of the trial, were both wounded as they tried to protect their sibling from her violent ex-boyfriend Myles Williams . 'She called her daughter her little princess. We will one day have to explain to her what happened to her mum.' The . court heard the couple began their relationship a year earlier when Miss Treloar met Williams as he swept streets outside Hackney Job Centre. He manipulated her into seeing him by lying that he was 23 and hiding the fact he had already fathered two children by two other older women. But their relationship quickly began to go downhill, with Williams erupting in fits of jealousy, during which he would lock his lover in her bedroom for days. Soon . Miss Treloar was pregnant and the affair had turned sour. In December last year Williams was charged with threatening behaviour after he dragged Miss Treloar along the street. He . was taken to court and given bail on condition that he did not contact . Miss Treloar, who days earlier had given birth to their daughter, said . Mr Aylett. Despite the bail conditions the pair continued to meet up over the Christmas period. Scene: Myles Williams, 19, burst into Kirsty Treloar's family home in east London on January 2 and stabbed her 29 times . But on January 2, Williams kicked in a . kitchen window and then kicked in the bedroom door where the two . sisters had locked themselves in and rang the police. In a recording of the 999 call, Miss Treloar can be heard to plead: 'Myles, please don’t.' Mr Aylett said: 'He hit her a number of times. He then started stabbing her with the knife.' Dean Treloar was stabbed after hitting Williams over the head with the bar of some weights in a vain attempt to get him to stop. Williams then went back to Miss Treloar and began stabbing her in the chest. Mr Aylett added: “The defendant then dragged his half-dead girlfriend out on to the street and bundled her into his car. Detective . Chief Inspector Andy Yeats said after the case: 'This was an appalling . and violent attack by an individual with a propensity for violence . towards women.'","Myles Williams, 19, murdered Kirsty Treloar after forcing his way into her family home and stabbing her 29 times .

A disability benefits cheat nicknamed 'Fit as a Fiddler' after he was caught completing a 34 mile triathlon escaped jail today. Keep fit fanatic Anthony Connor, 39, said a debilitating stroke left him with a limp and he could only walk 75 metres in five minutes. He pocketed over £17,000 in state handouts after saying he needed help getting in and out of the bath and getting up and down the stairs. But Connor’s run of luck ran out after . investigators secretly filmed him swimming, cycling and running for a . total of 55km during the Tatton Park triathlon in Knutsford, Cheshire. The . footage showed Connor swimming for 5 kilometres whizzing past spectators on his bicycle during a 40k race and later raising his arms . in victory as he completed a 10k run. He completed the entire course in . just two and a half hours. Today . Connor, from Baguley, Greater Manchester had been facing jail after he . admitted a charge of failing to notify the DWP of change of . circumstances. But he was . given 12 weeks prison, suspended for a year, and ordered him to carry . out 100 hours of community service by magistrates in Manchester after . they were told how he had lost the respect of his friends and family. The . court heard Connor had initially claimed benefit legitimately in 2006 . after suffering a stroke that year. As well as disability handouts he . also claimed income support, housing benefits and council tax benefit. Prosecutor . Mr Paul Darnborough said: 'On a medical form provided to the DWP, it . put him at a higher rate for mobility and lower rate for care due to a . stroke suffered that left him with a weakness to the left side, . virtually unable to walk and only able to walk 75 metres in five . minutes. 'He was left with a . limp and needed someone with him when he went outdoors. It permanently . affected him 24/7. The lower rate was because he needed help getting in . and out of the bath, tying his shoelaces and preparing his food. 'It is accepted that his disability were not commensurate with the claim he made. 'Surveillance was made between August 2010 and February 2011 at considerable costs.

Sporty: Connor is seen racing over the finishing line raising his arms in victory after finishing a 5km sprint . 'He completed the event in a very respectable time, two hours 30 minutes. He was seen the previous day covering his bike. 'He was employed during labouring duties, his employer was aware that had had a stroke and missed only 10 jobs out of 81. The fraudulent abuse of the benfits system prejudices the very needs of the proper applicant who are wholly dependent on this type of benefit for these vulnerable and needy people.' The court heard the over payments from June 2010 to July 2011 were £5850.29 in income support, £3997.64 in disability living allowance, £6187.34 in housing benefit and £1.057.80 in council tax benefit. Fit: The footage also shows Connor whizzing past spectators on his bicycle during a 19k sprint . Benefits: As well as disability handouts Connor also claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit . In mitigation defence lawyer Chris Joseph said: 'It is the case that although he suffered a major attack in 2006, the affects are still on going and he has difficulty moving, and if speaking for any length of time his speech becomes slurred. At work he is often accused of having a drink over lunch time because of his speech. 'All that seems hollow when he completed a triathlon in a good time. Prior to 2006, he was an athlete who regularly took part in events of this nature. The assessment was that he couldn’t walk any further than 75 metres.' He said Connor got back into training because he 'wanted to become fit and healthy again', adding: 'It was a challenge to himself to see if he could do it again. But a month later he suffered a mini stroke. 'Had he not taken this decision, he is of the belief that he would not be as well as he is today and would still be in receipt of a genuine benefit claim,' said Mr Joseph. He went on: 'He accepts that he claimed benefit when he shouldn’t have. He has said that at the time when he continued to claim benefit his future was uncertain and had suffered two mini attacks. 'He planned to set up a business but didn’t know if it would be successful, there was a very convenient safety net underneath him. You can see how easy it was for him to fall into the trap when deep down he knew he shouldn’t have. 'He has now set up a floor polishing business with a partner. It has never been something that he kept secret. He is now working and no longer in receipt of benefits and he wants to pay back the over payments he accepts he had become over reliant on. 'He has lost work as a result of the publicity and lost all the respect of friends and family.'","Anthony Connor, 39, said .

An official spokesman for the Co-operative Food said: 'We are not responsible for posting this photograph on our Twitter feed and are currently investigating how this happened.' The photograph was deleted in due course - but not quickly enough for the blunder to spread like wildfire across the internet.

Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was the first black British Army officer . A campaign to honour Britain's first black Army officer with a posthumous medal for courage in the First World War was launched yesterday. Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918. He displayed 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe. But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation that he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops. Now Brian Binley, the Tory MP for Northampton South, where 2nd Lt Tull lived, is supporting an online petition started by Phil Vasilion the Number 10 website calling for the soldier to be recognised 94 years after his death. He has been backed by members of the soldier's family and Michael Morpurgo, the author of War Horse, who has written a new novel, A Medal For Leroy, which draws heavily on his story. Edward Finlayson, 61, 2nd Lt Tull's great nephew, said: 'Since we were very young we knew the story and as a family we have always been proud of him.

'We fully support the campaign to have the Military Cross he was recommended for awarded posthumously.' He added: 'For us the most striking, moving and pleasing aspect is that his life is being used for good and as role model for others - his life is now included in the school curriculum and is used to promote anti-racism.' Second Lt Tull was born in Folkestone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman. By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London.

On the outbreak of war in 1914, he volunteered for the Football Battalion, part of the 17th Middlesex Regiment, and fought in many fierce operations, including the Battle of the Somme in 1916. He was commissioned as an officer in May 1917 and sent to Italy where he led his men and was mentioned In dispatches for bravery at the Battle of Piave. Second Lt Tull was transferred to France to take part in a push to break through the German lines at Favreuil, in the Somme Valley. In March 1918, aged 29, he was killed. His men tried to retrieve his body from No Man's Land but they were beaten back by heavy enemy machine gun fire.

Mr Binley said: 'I will be pushing the Government to award the Military Cross posthumously to Walter Tull. 'He was an incredible guy and this would be a great way of putting right a bureaucratic mistake from many years ago and one that would highlight a very important role model. 'I believe the reason why the bureaucrats turned it down in the first place was because he should not have been made an officer because he was black and it went against Army regulations at the time.

The descent of the David Petraeus case into a media circus has been accelerated by the appearance of Natalie Khawam, Lebanese-born twin sister of Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, at a press conference alongside celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. In an apparent bid to gain leverage for her client in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband over their four-year-old son, Allred portrayed Khawam's case as 'extremely important to single moms across the nation'. Petraeus, who resigned as CIA director after his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell was revealed when Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing emails from her, wrote a letter in support of Khawam's case. Tears: Natalie Khawam, the sister of Jill Kelley, addresses her part in the Petraeus scandal on Tuesday . General John Allen, Nato commander in Afghanistan and under investigation for potentially 'inappropriate' emails in a correspondence of up to 30,000 pages, also wrote a letter backing her. Allred paid tribute to Petraues and his wife Holly at the press conference in the Ritz Carlton in Washington on Tuesday afternoon. 'Both have known Natalie and her son personally for many years, and have had numerous opportunities to observe them together,' she said. 'They have loved Natalie's child and emotionally supported her and her son through the toughest time in Natalie and her son's life. Speaking out: Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is representing Khawam, a friend of Petraeus and his wife . Business: Khawam was flung into the limelight after her sister contacted the FBI about threatening emails she was receiving from Petraeus' mistress - which led to the discovery of their affair . 'They both spoke up through their court declarations in support of Natalie about what a loving, protective mom she was.' Khawam, 37, who wiped away tears as she stepped forward to speak, declined to answer any questions but spoke of her relationship with her sister. 'My sister Jill and I aren't just twins, we're best friends. Literally inseparable,' she said. 'During my darkest time... she and my brother-in-law, Dr Kelley, took me in with my son when we needed refuge and protection. Jill is the kindest, most generous person I know. 'We played tennis together. She played net and I served. We also played softball together. She was the catcher and I pitched. We love to cook. I usually bake and she sautees. Emotion: At the press conference, Khawam said Petraeus and General John Allen had written letters of support to judges on her behalf as she battled her ex-husband for custody of their child . Sisterly bond: Khawam described her sister, Jill Kelley, as her best friend and loyal supporter . Gloria Allred has a long history of standing up for downtrodden women and of trotting out female clients who claim to have revealing and damaging stories about high-profile men. The California attorney's clients have included the family of Nicole Brown Simpson in the O.J. Simpson trial and former Spice Girl Mel B for her paternity case against Eddie Murphy. She has represented two of Tiger Woods' alleged mistresses, Rachel Uchitel and Joslyn James, and worked for Ginger Lee, who claimed Anthony Wiener had encouraged her to lie during his sexting scandal. More recently, she represented Sharon Bialek, who claimed Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain had groped her - which he denied - and the girlfriend of the former girlfriend of Rudy Eugene, known as the 'Miami Cannibal'. 'We used to study together. I love math, she loves science and she excels in chemistry. We love to play piano and play chess. 'Jill has lovingly supported me through the years and I plan to love and support her unconditionally.' Khawam lost an ugly child custody dispute with ex-husband Grayson Wolfe despite the letters written on her behalf by Petraeus and  Allen. The judge said he had serious concerns and reservations over her mental stability and her grasp on reality and accused her of 'outrageous conduct', 'bad faith litigation tactics', and 'illogical thinking' before awarding full custody to the father, who had been unable to see his child for more than a year. According to the New York Post, Wolfe, . won sole custody of the boy after the judge found out Khawam, a lawyer, . repeatedly lied under oath and filed false domestic-violence and . child-abuse claims against her husband. She . was also accused of defying court orders to allow her estranged husband . access to their son and sent emails to his friends and colleagues . telling them he was a 'horrible father and husband'. Friends: Khawam, left, smiles alongside (from left) David Petraeus, her sister's husband Scott, her sister Jill Kelley and Holly Petraeus at a garden party at her sister's Florida home .

Asked by MailOnline whether Khawam had, as reported, visited the White House, Allred said she had been there 'essentially for a tour' but declined to say who had been the host. Neither Allred nor Khawam would speak about Allen or go into any detail about Petraeus. On Friday, as news coverage of Kelley . and Broadwell persisted as their roles in the scandal became . increasingly clear, Allred blasted the media's obsession with the women. 'Inseparable': Khawam, pictured right with Jill Kelley and Senator Marco Rubio, also used the opportunity to laud her 'kind, generous' sister and describe their lives growing up together .

She told the Daily Caller: '[M]y . personal feeling on this matter is that women are being depicted in a . negative and stereotypical manner which appears to be very unfair to all . of them.' Allred's clients include a string of high-profile women, including former porn star Joslyn James and nightclub promoter Rachel Uchitel, for whom Allred helped win $10 million from Tiger Woods. She is renowned as the go-to lawyer for women who find themselves caught up in celebrity scandals and has has defended women against stars such as Charlie Sheen, Eddie Murphy, and Rob Lowe.","Natalie Khawam was swept up in Petraeus scandal after her sister Jill Kelley tipped off the FBI about threatening emails from his mistress .

Historic cobblestones in a picturesque market town have been ruined after council workers made a clumsy attempt to paint double yellow lines over them. Residents in Stamford, Lincolnshire - dubbed 'England's most attractive town' by poet John Betjeman - were furious when they saw the Georgian cobbles daubed in thick, yellow paint. The paint has run amongst the stones, which were laid in the Georgian era, leaving an unsightly mess in St Mary's Place in the town, a popular tourist destination. What a mess: Bungling council workers have enraged residents in the picturesque market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, after wrecking historic cobblestones by covering them with thick yellow paint . James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence from the council. 'Surely if you get professionals in they should realise that liquid will run around obstacles like cobbles? 'Now our taxpayers' money will have to be forked out again just to re-do something that should have been done right first time.' Liz Heesom, 20, who lives in the road, said: 'This beautiful medieval church precinct has been spoiled by the careless and unsightly ladling out of thick yellow paint.' Period farce: Yellow paint is smeared messily across the cobbles in St Mary's Place, Stamford . Blight on a beautiful town: Stamford residents say the yellow paint has ruined the historic streetscape . Tourist favourite: Visitors flock to the historic market town all year round, drawn by the period architecture and specialist shops . Lincolnshire County Council's area highways manager Kevin Brumfield said the lines would be repainted before Christmas. He said: 'We are currently refreshing the lines for when parking enforcement starts on December 3 so that the parking restrictions are clear to motorists. 'It is always harder to put material on road surfaces like this but our contractor is going back to see if the appearance can be improved.' Dating back more than 1,000 years, Stamford prospered as a wool town under the Normans. By the 13th century, it was one of the 10 largest towns in England with a castle and 14 churches. As the wool trade moved away, the town declined, but local man William Cecil restored its fortunes. When Cecil became secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth, he built Burghley House for his mother just outside Stamford. Improvements to the Great North Road in the 17th century helped trade as everyone who travelled north passed through the town. Prosperous local merchants built grand houses which now help the town's tourist and film trade. The BBC filmed George Eliot's Middlemarch in the town, which was also the setting for scenes in Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth. Stamford's George Hotel was an important coaching inn in the 17th and 18th centuries and still enjoys huge popularity with visitors today. Noted guests have included King Charles I, William III, and Sir Walter Scott.","Residents of Stamford, Lincolnshire, call attempt to deter parking 'absolute incompetence'

Call of the wild: The surprise discovery led to the premises being shut after the inspector visited during the lunchtime rush . The inspector said the deer may have been roadkill but he could not be certain. Jeff Hershberger from the city health board, told KCTV that live and dead cockroaches were also found inside the restaurant. In total, there were 13 health code violations including employees not washing their hands correctly and dishes not cleaned to a proper standard. The deer, however, was the main reason behind the closure. Mr Hershberger said: 'It still had the head, the hooves, the horns, the skin.' While it is not illegal to pick up roadkill - although it is risky - the health inspector said it was not allowed to be served in restaurants. Los Alamos owner Agustin Juarez told the local TV station that staff had been caught at a bad time during the lunch time rush.
