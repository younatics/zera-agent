"Police have rescued a dog who was found frozen to the ground of a garage. The 10-year-old chow, nicknamed Elsa after the movie Frozen, had bleeding paws and frostbitten ears with her lead wrapped around her leg as wind chill temperatures hovered around -10F in Ecorse, Michigan. A frozen bowl of water was inches away, just out of reach, police said. Scroll down for video . Frozen: It took rescuers half an hour to unfreeze Elsa's leg from the floor of her owner's garage in Ecorse . Officers were called to her rescue by a neighbor who heard whimpering inside the building at 9.30am on Tuesday. 'It took about a half an hour to get her unfrozen from the ground,' Patricia Trevino of the River Rouge Animal Shelter told WJBK. 'They had to pour warm water on her. Her two legs were frozen. The side of her face and her side, she was literally lying frozen to the ground.' 'The dog was incoherent, was not responsive. She didn't start crying until the water was poured on her,' Trevino said. Speaking from Healthy Paws Medical Center in Westland, where Elsa is being treated, Trevino said: 'Her feet are literally bleeding tonight when she walks because they were frozen. They were a block of ice. The toes were frozen together.' The owner claimed he put Elsa in the garage at 5am and did not realize how cold it was. Struggle: She has frostbitten ears and seemed shaken after allegedly being left for days alone in the cold . Wounded: Elsa's foot was bleeding after officials eventually pried her from the inches of frozen water . His neighbor Marylou Rotrock disputes the account, saying he has been out of town for days. He has been cited and police are pursuing animal cruelty charges, according to Fox News. 'I kept hearing (the dog), so I had to walk over there,' Rotrock told Fox News. 'And I'm not one that goes over on other people's property. Something told me I had to. 'Her body was frozen to the ground. 'There was no food in the bowl and some of the excrement had plastic bag pieces in it.' Donations for Elsa have surpassed $1,000, Fox News reported.

"Keep dancing: Sir Bruce and his third wife Wilnelia . As he celebrates his 87th birthday tomorrow, Sir Bruce Forsyth will treat himself to a Pink Panther, a refreshing mix of champagne and cranberry juice. ‘It’s delicious,’ he said. ‘I’ve never been a massive drinker, but it’s lovely.’ Mixing his food groups is usually a no-no for the former Strictly Come Dancing host, however. He is an ardent follower of the Hay diet, which advises against mixing proteins with carbohydrates. Indeed, he credits his longevity to his healthy eating regime, lots of exercise and the enduring love of his third wife Wilnelia, to whom he has been married for almost 32 years. A weekly massage and a handful of vitamin D, E and C supplements each day have also helped Sir Bruce to maintain his stamina. Lifting the lid on his maintenance regime, he said: ‘I never miss taking my supplements and I regard massage as a medicine. ‘I have a masseuse called Alicia who comes to the house. I do the Hay diet where I don’t have potatoes with meat or fish and I drink lots of water.’ Sir Bruce, who has enjoyed a seven-decade career, does, however, admit to some vices. ‘I love chocolate. I can’t go a day without chocolate. I love dark chocolate. Green and Blacks and Lindt and Belgian chocolate. I do have a few squares a day,’ he said. Despite retiring from hosting Strictly Come Dancing, the veteran entertainer has no intention of slowing down – with performances of his one-man show planned for across Britain in the coming weeks. The star said he is especially pleased to be returning to the London Palladium. ‘It’s the first time in ten years since I have performed [there] and I am really looking forward to it. When the day comes and I can’t do this any longer then so be it. But I will do it as long as I can because it’s in my blood.’ The Hay diet is based on the principle of segregating certain food types, such as not mixing proteins with carbohydrates and having three regular meals a day. It was created in the 1920s by New York physician William Howard Hay after he developed a life-threatening kidney disease. Modern-day fans include actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Catherine Zeta Jones. The science underpinning the diet has been called ‘unfounded’ by experts because it ignores the fact that carbohydrate-rich foods contain significant amounts of protein. Sir Bruce is currently enjoying himself in Puerto Rico, where he spends four months of the year with Wilnelia. He said of his birthday: ‘To celebrate I am hoping to do what I did last year and that is to have a game of golf in the morning outside in the lovely 80 degree heat. ‘Then I will have lunch in a hotel in San Juan with some friends, which of course would not be complete without Bruce’s Pink Panther. 'In fact I think we will let the Panther loose! You put about an inch of cranberry into a glass – you must always do that first – and then you pour champagne over it. It’s delicious.’ After a nap, Sir Bruce will watch the Oscars – which are also celebrating their 87th birthday this year – until 1am. ‘At some point I will speak to my son and daughters on the phone as well,’ he said. ‘I have nine grandchildren and three great-grand children. They make me feel proud but at the same time, it makes me feel old!’ The former Strictly Come Dancing host, pictured with fellow presenters Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly, credits his longevity to his healthy eating regime, lots of exercise and his third wife .","Sir Bruce is an ardent follower of the Hay diet, which advises against mixing proteins with carbohydrates .

"A Canadian parliament member had the chamber in tears after he admitted to leaving his seat during a vote because of a pair of ill-fitting underpants he had recently bought on sale. Pat Martin, a representative for Winnipeg, told the House of Commons he had trouble sitting for a long period of time because he 'bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me'. 'I realize I did inadvertently leave my seat briefly in the middle of the debate, but I can blame it on a sale that they had down at the Hudson's Bay,' Martin said. 'They had men's underwear that was on for half-price.' Canadian parliament member Pat Martin, from Winnipeg, admitted to leaving his seat during a vote on Friday because a pair of ill-fitting pants he had bought on sale were too small and made it uncomfortable to sit . Martin violated formal procedure by stepping away from his chair and then returning to cast his vote on whether to adjourn debate on an anti-terrorism bill, according to the National Post. His absence was brought to Deputy Speaker Joe Comartin's attention by member Royal Galipeau, who asked if Martin's vote was still valid because he had breached protocol. Caught in the act, Martin confessed to his too-tight underwear. 'I apologize if it was necessary for me to leave my seat briefly, but I did not mean to forfeit my right to vote,' he said. After the chamber erupted into laughter, even Comartin had to get it on the fun. Martin bought the half-price briefs from department store Hudson's Bay, which capitalized on the publicity to make sure people knew the 50 per cent off sale was still going strong . Political columnist John Ivison offers Martin some advice. Martin had left his seat in the Chamber before returning to cast his vote on whether to adjourn a debate about an anti-government bill . Although it is technically against parliamentary rules to leave one's seat during a vote, House of Commons speaker Joe Comartin validated Martin's vote because he had been present when the motion was read . 'I had no briefing on this type of motion,' he said, before validating Martin's vote because he was present when the motion was read. Hudson's Bay, a Canadian department store, capitalized on the free press and tweeted out that their 'manties' 50 per cent off sale was still going strong. 'Pants are overrated,' the tweet claimed. One Twitter user also tried to give Martin some advice. 'Sympathize with Pat Martin and his underwear dilemma,' political columnist John Ivison wrote. 'As he's of solid Scottish stock, and a regular kilt wearer, the solution is obvious.' Another user felt he had received a lesson in government. 'I think we all learned a little something about democracy today. And Pat Martin's shopping habits.' One user even got artistic, photoshopping Martin's head to another famous Canadian's body. 'I have a feeling I may have been a little generous with this photochop', the user said as he shared a picture of Martin's head on Justin Bieber's recent Calvin Klein briefs ad. Some Twitter users even got artistic, photoshopping Martin's face to the body of Justin Bieber, another famous Canadian, in his Calvin Klein brief ads.","Pat Martin left his chair during House of Commons debate before returning to cast his vote .

"A Washington florist who refused to provide flowers for a gay wedding rejected an offer from the state to settle a discrimination case by paying a $2,000 fine. Barronelle Stutzman, a 70-year-old grandmother, wouldn't provide flowers from her shop in Richland, Washington, for the 2013 wedding of Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her 'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. Scroll down for video . Barronelle Stutzman wouldn't provide flowers from her shop in Richland, Washington, for a 2013 gay wedding . When a longtime customer came to Arlene's Flowers (above) about his wedding, Stutzman refused to help him . The situation began because Stutzman wouldn't provide flowers for the wedding of Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed (pictured above) Her rejection led to multiple lawsuits, including one from Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson. If the lawsuits are successful, Stutzman could be required to pay damages and legal fees that far exceed the attorney general's offer to settle the matter. In addition to the $2,000 fine, the settlement Stutzman rejected said if the florist chose to continue selling flowers for weddings she would have to sell the items to all couples, including same-sex couples. In a letter to Ferguson, Stutzman wrote she 'never imagined that using my God-given talents and abilities, and doing what I love to do for over three decades, would become illegal'. She added: 'Our state would be a better place if we respected each other's differences, and our leaders protected the freedom to have those differences. 'Since 2012, same-sex couples all over the state have been free to act on their beliefs about marriage, but because I follow the Bible's teaching that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, I am no longer free to act on my beliefs. 'Washington's constitution guarantees us ""freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment."" 'I cannot sell that precious freedom.' Video by Alliance Defending Freedom . If the lawsuits against her are successful, Stutzman could be required to pay damages and legal fees that far exceed the attorney general's offer to settle the matter for $2,000 . Stutzman (left) and other at her shop. She wrote she 'never imagined that using my God-given talents and abilities, and doing what I love to do for over three decades, would become illegal' The offer from Ferguson came after Benton County Superior Court Judge Alex Ekstrom rejected arguments that Stutzman's actions were protected by her freedoms of speech and religion. The First Amendment protects religious beliefs but not necessarily actions based on those beliefs, Ekstrom ruled. The state has the authority to prohibit discrimination and Stutzman can be held personally liable for damages if she breaks bias laws, according to the judge. Kristen Waggoner, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, called the ruling 'terrifying' and said Ferguson was targeting Stutzman, Fox News reported. She said: 'He's using the full power of his office to personally and professionally destroy her. 'He's trying to send a message — you better shut up if you disagree or you are going to lose everything you own.' Ferguson maintains his objective is not Stutzman's financial ruin. He said: 'My primary goal has always been to bring about an end to the defendants' unlawful conduct and to make clear that I will not tolerate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'Before this case began, my office wrote to Ms Stutzman, asking her to comply with state law. Had she agreed to no longer discriminate, my office would not have filed suit, and Ms Stutzman would not have paid any costs, fees or penalties. 'After lengthy proceedings, the court has ruled, the law is clear, and the state prevailed on all counts.' Stutzman plans to appeal Judge Ekstrom's ruling.","Barronelle Stutzman owns Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington .

"If there's one British designer who knows how to do wearable fashion, it's Jasper Conran. Season after season he serves up super feminine designs that women actually want to wear and garments that they'll look and feel good in. Talking FEMAIL through his AW15 collection backstage ahead of the show on a blustery Saturday morning, he made his mission clear. 'When I design for women, I want them to walk into a room and look good,' he said. Jasper Conran unveiled a wearable collection of cashmere dresses and hair-on-calf A-line skirts inspired by Japanese paintings at London Fashion Week today . 'I'm thinking about their lives and I ponder: ""does this actually work? Is it a real thing? When they walk into a room, are they going to look ridiculous or great?"".' Judging by his collection of fitted cashmere dresses, hair-on-calf  A-line skirts and the sexiest silks, Jasper has hit the nail on the head. Jasper unveiled a wearable collection of bold and graphic printed silks and cashmeres . Shapewise, Jasper aimed to make his collection easy and loose and not overly tight for AW15 . Taking inspiration from 19th century ukiyo-e prints from the Japanese designer Kunisada, Jasper's dreamy silk and cashmere designs were emblazoned with graphic woodblock patterns. Broken stripes and chevrons in viridian green, rich chocolates and berry hues were broken up with bursts of brighter colours. Comfort was key, as always, and pleated silk skirts, chunky hand knit tunics and cosy chocolate cashmere reigned supreme. 'Shapewise, it's easy and loose and not overly tight this season; it's voluminous,' he said. 'The collection is so wearable,' concluded Jasper. 'These are cashmere knits you can live in. You don't need a house anymore when you've got these! '.

"Radamel Falcao's miserable start to his Manchester United career has continued with news that he faces a further two weeks out with injury. The Colombian international must impress manager Louis van Gaal over the course of the season if his big-money loan at Old Trafford is to be turned in to a permanent deal at the end of the year. However, as United prepared for a trip to Arsenal on Saturday with crippling injury problems across their defensive line, the long-term future of centre forward Falcao continues to be in doubt. Radamel Falcao (right) pictured in action for Manchester United against West Ham in September . Falcao (left) was unveiled with Daley Blind (right) on arrival at Old Trafford - both are now injured . United boss Van Gaal said last night: 'No, he's not available. He has an injury and that takes time. 'Now it's four weeks already and next week he shall train with our selection and then he needs two weeks. It's always like that. 'It's a pity, but players in football are injured.' Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that Van Gaal already has doubts about Falcao's ability to withstand a long Barclays Premier League season. Certainly, statistics that show just one goal and three league starts already go some way to showing why the United manager is concerned. Having let England striker Danny Welbeck go to Saturday's opponents at the end of the summer transfer window, Van Gaal knows that decision could come back to embarrass him at the Emirates but insists he does not regret his decision. Colombia played at Craven Cottage last Friday, and Falcao was in attendance to watch his team-mates . 'He could have also played for Manchester United but we have decided that he could go and he has taken the benefit of it,' said Van Gaal. 'He does very good at Arsenal. Now I shall see him [play] and I shall judge him. 'He has taken all the benefits of playing every week. That was always the question mark here. 'But I don't think it is so important how I judge him because he is now playing for Arsenal. 'He's not a Manchester United player anymore so now we have to beat him also. He's not alone, we have to beat Arsenal.' Van Gaal has had better news this week regarding goalkeeper David de Gea who has recovered from a dislocated finger suffered on international duty and will play on Saturday. Louis van Gaal claimed he is 'always a worried man in Manchester', because of his side's injury problems . David de Gea dislocated his finger on international duty but has recovered in time to face Arsenal on Saturday . VIDEO Man Utd injury problems . However, United will be without first choice defenders Rafael da Silva, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and perhaps Luke Shaw. Dutch international midfielder Daley Blind, meanwhile, will not know the extent of his knee injury suffered playing for Holland until he removes a brace in 10 days' time. 'It's difficult to say how long because he is still sitting in his brace,' said Van Gaal. 'We will then scan him again. 'It is not as bad as the doctors thought after the first match but it could still be a long story. It isn't six months or so, though.' United winger Angel di Maria will play at Arsenal after recovering from a knock he picked up playing for Argentina on Tuesday. Van Gaal watched on from the Old Trafford stands as Argentina played Portugal in a friendly on Tuesday . Angel di Maria picked up an injury during the match at Old Trafford, but is fit to face the Gunners on Saturday . Asked if he been worried, Van Gaal said: 'I'm always a worried man in Manchester because we have a lot of injuries. 'It's unbelievable. But we have to manage. We can speak about all the injuries, but we still have to manage that. 'I've said that also to the players. It's a pity, but we have enough players to do the job.'","Radamel Falcao has not played for Manchester United for the last month .

"Jurgen Klopp has admitted he would be open to offers from Premier League clubs, saying England is the only other country he would consider working in. The Borussia Dortmund manager has long been linked with a move to England, with Arsenal the most likely option when Arsene Wenger decides to move on. And now the popular German has hinted that a move to these shores would be an attractive proposition. Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted he would be interested in working in England . He told BT Sport's SportsHUB programme: 'I think it's the only country where I should work, next to Germany because it's the only country I know the language a little bit and I need the language for my work. 'If somebody will call me, then we will talk about it.' Klopp's Dortmund have struggled to replicate the form of previous seasons and currently sit just above the Bundesliga relegation zone by virtue of goal difference only. They will try and rediscover their winning form when they travel to Paderborn on Saturday afternoon. Klopp said England was the only other country he would consider working in . Klopp, 47, has achieved considerable success during his time at the Westfalenstadion, winning back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012, and guiding them to the Champions League final in 2013. Before that, he was a legend at Mainz, making 337 league appearances as a player and then managing them for seven years. But he insists he has never thought about his legacy at either club and prefers to concentrate on the present. He said: 'Not when I was starting no. I was 18 years at Mainz and I thought, that's it enough. I love this club in Mainz, I love this city, for a long time. My home town and so on. 'When I came here I thought OK now I can work as a normal coach, two or three years - next club, next city. I'm really interested in life, it's not important for me to stay for a long time in the same place. Marco Reus has been linked with a move away from Dortmund, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea interested . 'My children are old enough to stay alone, that's not the problem. I am here for more than six years, I don't know when it will end, I don't think about this. 'But it's not my idea to build a legacy. We will see, as long as it's successful and we can develop everything, we shouldn't change.' There has been plenty of speculation about the future of Dortmund's star asset, Marco Reus, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea among the interested clubs. On his future, Klopp said: 'We had very successful years and we couldn't keep all these players. Not all of them stayed here. They had their own dreams their own situations different ideas, whatever. So we will see. 'The most important thing is the story of this club will go on. We'll have to do it with other players. 'It's not our idea to keep this team together until the end, until their 34 and they go away. That was not the idea. We did it because of the potential of these players.' Mats Hummels, the centre-back, has also been linked with a move away from the Bundesliga side . Watch the interview in full on SportsHUB, BT Sport's news and information show, tomorrow (Saturday 22nd) on BT Sport 1 from 3pm.

"Arsenal are monitoring Hamburg midfielder Tolgay Arslan. The club have sounded out his representatives and will be keeping tabs on the player, who is out of contract on June 30, 2015, and would be available for a free transfer next summer. The player is seeking wages of around £40,000 per week to make the move to north London. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is keen to bring in a defensive midfielder and Arslan would fit in with the Frenchman's style of play. Hamburg's holding midfielder Tolgay Arslan (left) is out of contract in the summer, with Arsenal interested . The 24-year-old is a hard-worker in front of the back four in the centre of midfield with a tidy, short passing game. He started out as a striker and was then considered an attacking midfielder early on in his professional career, but has since developed the defensive side of his game and is seen more as a defensive midfielder. Born in Germany to Turkish parents, he initially represented Turkey's Under 19 and 21 side but has more recently played for Germany's Under 20s and 21s. Growing up, the player modelled his game on Zinedine Zidane and George Hagi. In 2010 he said: 'Since my childhood I admire a great deal Zinedine Zidane and George Hagi. I enjoy watching these two players.'

"A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. She had also been drinking heavily. Scroll down for videos . A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub . Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier . Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.' She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident. Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31. She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.","Multiple sources claim Bobbi Kristina Brown was using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before she was found unresponsive in a bathtub .

"Burnished to a deep shine, the iconic Art Deco statuettes at the center of the annual Academy Awards seem the epitome of easy perfection. But, just like the actors and movie-makers who hold them aloft before the world, the Oscar's iconic statuettes do not face an easy road to their glitzy presentation ceremony in Los Angeles. Indeed, their road to California's epicenter of celebrity is almost 2,000 miles long, and begins in an outwardly unremarkable Chicago workshop. There the figures, 13.5 inches tall and a hefty 8.5lbs, are painstakingly manufactured by the skilled craftsmen of R S Owens, who have made the Academy's highest award since 1983. Although the value of the raw materials is already around $900, once awarded the worth of the statues can catapult - despite an official ban by the academy on selling them on. Scroll down for video . The birth of Oscar: The statue, made of five metals, is shown above at each stage of its metal plating. Front-right, the base statuette, made of pewter alloy brittanium, is shown. The figure is then coated in copper (front left) nickel (second row on right), silver (back left) and, finally, the recognizable gold finish (back right) Although they shine golden, and are clad in a hefty coat of 24-carat gold, at their core an Oscar is made of a variant of pewter - a special alloy called britannium made especially for Oscar figures. The liquid metal, at a scorching 570°F, is poured into a mold in the shape of a European knight, holding a downward-pointing longsword in both hands. Each statuette is made individually, and there is only one mold, which is used for every single Oscar. The whole process, according to TIME magazine, takes 10 days from start to finish. It was first designed by Cedric Gibbons, the art director at MGM, who came up with the first sketches of the Art Deco-style figure in 1928. Each one stands on a reel of film, which has five spokes, to represent the five original branches of the Academy. At first they were known by their full name, the Academy Award of Merit. The moniker Oscar came later - exactly how is disputed - and was adopted by the Academy in 1939. Fresh out of the smelter: The awards are seen above straight after being cast at the R S Owens factory in Chicago. After this step they are sanded down, polished and coated with other metals . Burnished: The statues are painstakingly sanded by hand to match their iconic 1928 design. The slightest blemish leads to the figure being scrapped and started over . Row on row: The figure shows a stylized knight wielding a longsword while standing atop a five-spoked reel of film . Plating up: Shown above, R S Owens artisan Nunzio Giganti dips an Oscar into a electro-plating bath to coat the statuette in gold . On the way out: This Oscar is nearing the end of its laborious, ten-day creation process, and is seen in the last electro-plating bath . After being cast, the figures are sanded down then polished until the britannium alloy glimmers - even though it will not be the final coat on display. The Oscar is then treated to remove any grease of specs of other material, and engraved with a serial number. Around fifty of the awards have been made each year. So far 2,947 have been awarded, with at least 25 more to come Sunday. Next, the statue is dipped is electro-plated - a chemical technique which creates an even coating - in a metal bath. First the models are coated in copper, then nickel, then silver - and finally in 24-carat gold. Between each stage the figure is polished again to deepen its luster ahead of the equally glitzy presentation ceremony. Done deal: The figures are finally attached to a black nickel base - but are left unlabeled until after the ceremony to preserve the secrecy of the winners . Would you believe it? The stylish Oscars are made at R S Owne's Chicago workshop, pictured above . For the last step, the Oscar is covered in a lacquer to protect it from knocks and scratches. Finally, they are packaged in Styrofoam and flown under guard to Los Angeles for the final ceremony. If at any stage in the days-long process an Oscar does not come out perfectly, the figure is destroyed and a new one started to replace it. But once the statue is finished, it is guaranteed for life, and actors can send damaged figures back to have them replaced or brought back to their original brilliance. Eventually each newly-cast Oscar will be affixed with a plaque bearing the name and category of its recipient. At first the statues were taken back by the Academy while the plaques were engraved - but now eager stars can have their statues built up at the ceremony itself. Oscars themselves are meant then to be a priceless memento for the actors and their families - but time and again winners and heirs have found ways to convert them into cold, hard cash. Originally there were no restrictions on the Oscar trade, though it was frowned upon. The record sale, a Best Picture award for Gone With The Wind dated 1939, is an astonishing $1.5million, paid by Michael Jackson in 1999. However, since 1950 the Academy has insisted winners sign a contract promising neither they nor their heirs will try to sell the award without first offering it to them for $1. But, according to Forbes, the trade has persisted in the shadows, with film collectors buying up awards technically covered by the agreement - which some legal scholars have said would be difficult to actually enforce. It remains the case, though, that all of the highest sales - eleven of which have exceeded $250,000 - have been of pre-1950s Oscars, which can be traded much more openly in auction houses around the world.","Iconic figures, first designed in 1928, are made by Chicago manufacturers R S Owens .
They are made of unique pewter alloy, then coated successively in copper, nickel, silver - and finally 24-carat gold .
Figures are cast by hand then sanded, polished and burnished before electrical playing - and only one mold exists .
All of the almost 3,000 statues produced have been deemed perfect by makers - any flaws lead to them starting again ."
"Winning an Academy Award is the pinnacle of success for those in the film industry and so it's perhaps no surprise that many have been overcome with emotion in their moment of triumph. While most over the decades have been able to accept their Oscars with dignity, grace and a stiff upper lip, others have not been able to hold back the tears. Gwyneth Paltrow is arguably the most famous Oscar cry baby as she sobbed through her acceptance speech when she won Best Actress for Shakespeare In Love in 1999. Scroll down for video . Gwyneth Paltrow sobbed in her acceptance speech as she thanked her family when she won the Best Actress gong for Shakespeare in Love in 1999 . Tears rolled down the cheeks of Halle Berry as she was the first black woman to win an Oscar in 2002 . Anne Hathaway held it together for her speech but cried backstage after winning in 2013 . Hilary Swank wipes away a tear as she accepts the Oscar for best actress in 2007 for Million Dollar Baby . She was already struggling to hold back the tears as stepped on to the stage to collect her trophy from Jack Nicholson but managed to hold it together as she thanked the cast and crew she'd worked with. But when she started to thank her family, she couldn't stop crying with her voice becoming squeaky and at times inaudible. It was thanking her family that reduced Angelina Jolie to tears too when she accepted her Oscar for best supporting actress in Girl Interrupted in 2000. Her voice broke as she sang the praises of her brother, James, mother Marcheline Bertrand, who died in 2007, and her father, actor Jon Voight - with whom she has since had a turbulent relationship. Octavia Spencer said, 'I'm sorry, I'm freaking out!' as she wept during her acceptance speech in 2012 when she won best supporting actress for her role in The Help . Charlize Theron cried as she accepted the Oscar for best actress in 2004 for her role in Monster . Nicole Kidman struggles to compose herself as she accepts her best actress award for The Hours in 2003 . Halle Berry gave Gwyneth a run for her money as the biggest blubber when she received her best actress award in 2002 for Monster's Ball - making her the first black woman to be given the honour. 'Oh my god,' she sobbed with tears streaming down her face, 'this moment is so much bigger than me.' Jennifer Hudson could barely start her speech in 2007 when she won the best supporting actress award for Dreamgirls as she was so overcome with emotion. 'Oh my god, I just have to take this moment in, I just cannot believe this, look what god can do, if my grandmother was here to see me now...' she gushed. Natalie Portman can be forgiven for her tears as she won best actress in Black Swan in 2011 as she was pregnant at the time and at the mercy of her hormones. Jennifer Hudson could barely start her speech in 2007 when she won the best supporting actress award for Dreamgirls as she was so overcome with emotion . Natalie Portman was pregnant when she won in 2011 and became teary when she thanked her husband for giving her her greatest role yet - motherhood . Ben Affleck choked on his words during his speech in 2013 as he became emotional as he won Best Picture for Argo, which he produced, directed and starred in . Jennifer Lawrence looks teary backstage in 2013 as she poses with fellow winner Daniel Day Lewis... Perhaps Jennifer's tears came as she recalled this embarrassing fall as she took to the stage when she won . She sniffed her way through an otherwise eloquent acceptance speech with tears in her eyes as she thanked her husband Benjamin Millepied for giving her the greatest role of all as a mother. Octavia Spencer was given a standing ovation as she accepted her gong in 2012 for The Help and the reaction meant she struggled to speak though most of her speech. 'I'm sorry, I'm freaking out!' she wept. Anne Hathaway maintained her composure when she made her acceptance speech in 2013 when she won for her role in Les Miserables but it all caught up with her backstage when she burst into tears at the photocall clutching her gold statue. Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Hilary Swank are other notable A-listers who wept as they won their Oscars. Actress Meryl Streep should be used to the emotional rollorcoaster of the Oscars with 19 nominations and three victories under her belt, but here she sheds a tear as she hugs Peter O'Toole on stage in 2003 . Kim Basinger has tears in her eyes as she gives her acceptance speech after winning in 1998 . Julia Roberts looks teary backstage as she poses with her award in 2001 . But it's not just the women who have struggled to hold back the tears. Ben Affleck struggled to contain his emotions as Argo - which he directed, produced and starred in -won the Best Picture Oscar in 2013. He became emotional as he thanked his wife - actress Jennifer Garner - for working hard to make their marriage last and his voice broke as he dedicated the award to their children Violet, Samuel and Seraphina. So as the 87th Academy Awards takes place this Sunday evening, let's hope the nominees have all packed their hankies and practiced their speeches.","Winning an Academy Award is an emotional moment .
Many stars have broken down in tears making their acceptance speech .
Thanking their families made Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie cry .
Halle Berry sobbed saying 'this moment is so much bigger than me'
Others like Anne Hathaway held it together for speech but cried backstage ."
"As I was speaking to a meeting of 200 small businesses in Southampton last week, I was asked a question that is increasingly on my own mind. 'With the economy suddenly looking so rosy,' said one employer, 'how come David Cameron and the Tories are not on for a convincing victory at the next General Election?' Twenty-four hours earlier, the same query was put by a member of the audience during BBC1's Question Time. It's a fascinating subject. Because there is no denying that in recent weeks, the economic news has been good. Lord Digby Jones, former trade minister under Labour, claims Ed Miliband and Ed Balls were wrong on the economy . Unemployment has fallen again and again – it's now at its lowest level for more than six years. In fact, so low are the jobless figures that in some cases, it's almost time to talk about the unemployable rather than simply the unemployed. The number of jobs continues to soar. There are now almost 31 million Britons at work – a record figure. And while the jobs figures are on the up, inflation and interest rates are on the way down. At long last, wages are outstripping the cost of living – a just reward for workers after years of coping with soaring costs and no pay rises. On high streets up and down the country, you can almost touch the sense of confidence returning as consumer spending rises. As a result, people are able to pay more tax to fund the public services we depend on. Of course, much of the recent good news is nothing to do with the Tories – it's due to a welcome fall in oil and petrol prices. In that respect, George Osborne is not so much an economic genius as just plain lucky. But just as Napoleon preferred generals who were lucky, there's no reason why we shouldn't prefer Chancellors with 'bonne chance' – especially if they seem to understand business and its importance to the country. The former Labour minister said Ed Balls (pictured) issued dire, nightmare predictions of rocketing unemployment . Which brings me to Labour and Ed Miliband. I served in the last Labour government as Gordon Brown's Trade and Investment Minister. I was a non-party political appointment – I've never joined a political party – but it pains me to say that on the economy, Miliband and his team have called it wrong time and time again. They issued dire, nightmare predictions of rocketing unemployment. Wrong. They drew a gloomy picture of an economy by this stage of the cycle, becalmed at best, in freefall at worst. Wrong. Miliband did appear to score some successes – for example, his pledge to freeze energy prices was popular with many voters. But with the fall in worldwide oil costs, even that policy is looking threadbare. Yet my biggest reservation about the Labour leader is not what he's committed to, but what he won't say. I'm still waiting to hear Ed Miliband pay tribute to business, salute the massed ranks of small firms up and down the country that are the backbone of the economy. From time to time, Chuka Umunna, Labour's industry spokesman, and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls do say warm words about business. But that doesn't matter until and unless we hear it from the lips of Miliband himself. I live in hope that Miliband will make a speech praising profit and congratulating people who create wealth. Instead, the Labour leader prefers – as he did at one of his most important conference speeches – to talk instead about the evils of 'predator' capitalism, not the benefits business brings. From time to time, Chuka Umunna, Labour's industry spokesman, does say warm words about business . Without a thriving UK Plc, we can't have a wonderful NHS or any other viable public service for that matter. The fact that that is a Tory Election mantra, unfortunately for Labour, doesn't make it any less true. All this may be why, as I meet businesses across the country, I detect a real worry at the thought of Ed Miliband getting his hands on the economic reins. They feel we're finally going in the right direction and the last thing we need is a change of management – especially one that seems to have no empathy with business. They have another worry – Miliband's avowed admiration for French president Francois Hollande's economic policies. UK businesses don't want Britain turning into France, with a French-style equivalent of a straitjacket for business. As for Europe, it is true that businesses hate the uncertainty of Cameron's proposal for an in/out referendum on our EU membership – a poll that is unlikely to take place before the end of 2017 at the earliest. Far more preferable for company bosses would be a faster resolution of that debate. BUSINESSES don't want an unreformed, sclerotic Europe that fails to encourage wealth creation and innovation. This is no Little England view. The people I talk to are as keen to see a prosperous Athens and Madrid as any Greek or Spaniard because more wealth on the Continent means more money to buy British exports. I'll mention one final worry business owners have shared with me – the prospect of Miliband only getting the keys to No 10 with the help of the SNP. They are horrified at the idea of a Labour Party which has failed to win England being propped up in power by a party that wants to destroy the UK. Which brings me back to that burning question – why, in the face of all these factors, are the Tories not on course for a majority or even a landslide on May 7? Well, one big factor is this: despite all the economic good news, not everyone is benefiting. The Coalition has been forced to take many hard decisions, and some of those decisions have hurt many people's jobs and lifestyles. But here's one straw in the wind. The week before last, the Tories had a terrible week – starting with the ill-timed 'Black and White' donors' ball and ending with a barrage of damaging publicity about tax avoidance. Despite that, they did not slip back in the polls. Their ratings withstood the storm. I make no prediction about the Election outcome – we must wait till May 7 for that. But just over two months out, electoral logic suggests that the 2015 Election could be like the 1992 one – Labour seemingly on course to win until the last moment when voters balked at the thought of Kinnock and stuck with Major and the Tories. Lord Jones, a cross-bench peer, served as Trade and Investment Minister under the last Labour government.","Digby Jones claims Ed Miliband and Ed Balls were wrong on the economy .

"University of Bolton vice chancellor Professor George Holmes has been given a £1million loan by his employers so he can move nearer to the campus . A struggling university was slammed yesterday for loaning its vice-chancellor £1million for a luxurious Edwardian house. Professor George Holmes of the University of Bolton had a 100-mile round-trip to work, from his home in Yorkshire. But it has emerged the university gave him a two-year £960,000 loan to buy a house nearer Bolton, Greater Manchester, without selling his existing property. The sum could buy seven average £133,400 houses in the town. But the 53-year-old spent £920,000 on an imposing detached house, described by estate agents as a ‘sublime’ example of the Arts and Crafts movement. With the university faring badly in measures such as student satisfaction, and staff facing delays in pay rises, the move drew fierce criticism yesterday. Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour, was made vice-chancellor in 2006, two years after Bolton Institute of Higher Education became a university. In 2013 it ranked worst in the country in two university guides. That year, he received the biggest pay rise of any vice-chancellor in the country, with a £47,200 bonus to ‘incentivise’ him to stay. With a £198,200-a-year salary, this took his annual pay package to a reported £256,200. In November, after eight years of travelling from Wakefield every day, Professor Holmes announced his intention to move his family to Bolton, saying it would allow him to ‘play a greater role’ in the university and the town. The university’s accounts reveal its board unanimously approved a £960,000 bridge loan to enable the father-of-two to buy a house nearby. The loan, at a 3.25 per cent interest rate, will be paid off once his Yorkshire home is sold. The academic was said to be unavailable for comment yesterday at his £965,000 detached red-brick house in Wakefield, which did not have a For Sale sign outside. It belongs to a woman understood to be his new partner. His wife, who lives nearby, declined to comment. The four-bedroom home with four acres of land, near Bolton, bought by the vice-chancellor . Professor Holmes' current home near Wakefield, a 47-mile drive from the University of Bolton campus . Land Registry documents show he has bought a four-bedroom Edwardian house with four acres of land for £920,000. One neighbour said it was ‘an incredible amount of money paid by tuition fees’. Aktar Khan, 21, one of the university’s 4,500 students, said the ‘excessive’ sum ‘could be used now for facilities’. The university was recently accused of being the only higher education institution not to award staff a 1 per cent pay rise. A University and College Union spokesman said: ‘The priority for a university should be looking after all staff, not lending the vice-chancellor tens of thousands of pounds.’ John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added that the money should go towards ‘delivering high-quality education, not into glorified mortgages’. A university spokesman said Professor Holmes’ loan and relocation ‘has helped secure the continued services of an excellent vice-chancellor’. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said ‘day to day financial management decisions’ were a matter for the university and its board. Prof Holmes is paid almost £200,000 a year to run the university, which charges £9,000 tuition fees .","University of Bolton loaned vice-chancellor £1m for a luxurious house .

"Kyle Busch will miss Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season-opening Daytona 500 after breaking his leg during a support event accident. The 29-year-old is the younger brother of 2004 champion Kurt, who has lost his final appeal against his indefinite suspension after a judge said the former champion almost surely choked and beat his former girlfriend - who has previously referred to as an assassin. It means both drivers will miss the 57th edition of 'The Great American Race'. Kyle's Toyota slammed into an inside retaining wall at high speed late in Saturday's race and he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Scroll down for video . Case: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch leaves the IMC building after an appeal hearing on Saturday. He lost and has been suspended from the circuit indefinitely . Ruled out: Kyle Busch's Toyota slammed into an inside retaining wall at high speed on the Daytona track late in Saturday's pre-event race and he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment . He sustained a right lower leg compound fracture and left mid-foot fracture in the crash with eight laps remaining. His team Joe Gibbs Racing said he was undergoing surgery on his right leg. On Saturday, Kurt lost his last-ditch appeal, ending his already-slim hopes of racing  in the season-opener. On Friday Family Court Commissioner David Jones concluded that Busch lilkeyabused Patricia Driscoll by 'manually strangling' her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September. He however has claimed she is an 'assassin' and a bad-ass, and once came home covered in blood. 'Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made,' NASCAR said in a statement. Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said the driver will appeal, and NASCAR said it will be expedited. Still, SHR said Regan Smith will drive Busch's car in the Daytona 500 regardless of the appeal outcome. 'We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,' Hardin said in a statement. A judge concluded Busch likely abused Patricia Driscoll (pictured right)  by 'manually strangling' her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September . 'It is important for everyone to remember that the Commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch.' Busch becomes the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Chairman Brian France had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on Busch's eligibility - and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series' behavioral rules. Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil. Chevrolet immediately suspended its relationship with Busch. A short time later, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker '#41 Ray Rice,' a reference to the former Baltimore Ravens running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year. Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet. Procedures: Kyle (pictured just before the crash) sustained a right lower leg compound fracture and left mid-foot fracture in the crash with eight laps remaining. It means both of the brothers are out of the blockbuster season-opener . The 36-year-old Busch has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation, but the judge said Driscoll's version of the incident was more credible than Busch's. Driscoll said she was never motivated to have Busch punished by NASCAR. 'I reported a crime, just like anybody else who has been abused should do, because no one is above the law,' Driscoll said. 'I'm very encouraged that NASCAR is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue, and I hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it.' She urged NASCAR to develop a confidential reporting mechanism that partners of drivers could use to report domestic abuse without fear of threats or reprisals for coming forward. 'NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry,' NASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell said. 'I want to make it clear that any inference that there's a culture or a tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false.' Response: The 36-year-old Busch (pictured with Driscoll) has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation .

"A judge's racially insensitive Christmas email may derail his nomination to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. An email that Judge Thomas Kistler, 57, forwarded to 22 friends and colleagues shows a black man in an orange jumpsuit and woman on opposite sides of a prison visitation phone with the message 'Merry Christmas from the Johnsons'. A message included in the Centre County judge's email said 'Touching and heartwarming. Merry Christmas to ALL! JK'. A 2013 email from Centre County, Pennsylvania, Judge Thomas Kistler contained this offensive image and the subject line 'Best Christmas card ever' The judge said that he sometimes uses the abbreviation JK, which often stands for 'Just kidding', to mean 'Judge Kistler'. The subject line of the December 2013 message, which had pictures of Santa, was 'Best Christmas card ever'. The image of the black man and woman is believed to be a normal photo that was put into a Christmas card format by Internet users. Members of the criminal justice system including prosecutors and members of the probation department received it, according to the Centre Daily Times. Judge Kistler, a Republican who has been a judge in Centre County since 1997, confirmed that he had shared the email but that it was not racist. He said  that 'The last thing I would do would be to express some racial bias and send it to 20 friends'. 'It was a comment about how lightly people take being incarcerated.' The judge had told the Philadelphia Inquirer Thursday night that he did not remember sending the email and that  it did not sound like something he would say. He interpreted it as saying 'Christmas goes on, even for the people we put in jail'. 'I don't think it conveys humor at all. I don't find that humorous,' he said. Governor Tom Wolf (pictured) nominated Judge Kistler for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court but now said he is reviewing the controversy caused by the email . The email may cause trouble for his nomination to the state's highest court. Democratic governor Tom Wolf had reached across the political aisle to nominate Judge Kistler along with a member of his own party to fill two vacancies until an election later this year. One of the empty positions on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was vacated because a previous justice resigned amid a scandal over emails he sent and received that allegedly contained pornographic material. Judge Kistler said he did not think the headlines he has made because of his email will affect the confirmation process, which he has a hearing for Tuesday. Governor Wolf said through a spokesperson that he 'does not condone that email or emails like it' but was waiting to gather more facts about the controversy, according to The Patriot News. One of the Pennsylvania legislature's powerful African-American members, Democratic Sen. Vincent Hughes of Philadelphia, said that the email image was troubling and offensive, a spokesman said.","Judge Thomas Kistler, 57, forwarded 'Merry Christmas from the Johnsons'

"Bobbi Kristina's beau has issued a hysterical plea to her family on Twitter - insisting his presence in hospital will bring her out of a coma. Nick Gordon took to social media insisting that the 21-year-old would wake up if she heard his voice. It follows reports Whitney Houston's daughter was using cocaine, heroin and drinking heavily on the night she was found unconscious in a bathtub. On Saturday, Gordon wrote: 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' Scroll down for videos . Nick Gordon (pictured outside the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, when Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized) took to social media insisting that the 21-year-old would wake up if she heard his voice . Plea: Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insists his presence will help the 21-year-old . Demands: The extraordinary outburst also included a request to massage her once she heard his voice . Ink: He then posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo with his partner's name on, saying it was healing nicely . He then added: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.' In the rant, he also posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.' It is the second public appeal he has made following weeks of being frozen out by his family. Reports suggest he is also subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. On Wednesday, Gordon’s lawyer Randall Kessler said his client ‘desperately wants to be with the one he loves.’ Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claims Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay ‘hands on him’ if he shows up. Kessler said, ‘[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub . Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. He sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family just days ago when he had the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. A new report which surfaced on Saturday claims that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier . Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.' She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident. Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31. She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out. Couple: Bobbi Kristina with Nick Gordon in 2012. She said she had married him although, after her drowning, that was denied by her father. They were brought up together since he was taken in by Whitney Houston .","Nick Gordon took to social media, urging her family to let him visit .

"With the Oscars just hours away it is perhaps a good moment to remind ourselves of the anticipated form that comes with the Academy Awards. These awards are taken very seriously indeed – celebrating the tremendous cinematic successes of the past year. The Americans do take this supposed jewel in the awards season’s crown terribly seriously and perhaps one of the unspoken rules of the red carpet would be to not shatter this pretense and confuse it with the British Soap Awards. Dame Helen Mirren took a tumble on the red carpet during the Woman In Gold premiere in Berlin earlier this month, and William isn't a fan of her 'Shrek' coloured dress . How to greet your idols . Although you may not see normal members of the public but there are some in attendance who will be forgiven for being star-struck as this year’s cannon of glitterati process into the Kodak Theatre, and even the idols have idols – the form to follow is two fold for meeting the stars. Firstly, if you are just Joe Public then avoid rushing over to someone. Not only will you alert security but you will look desperate and a total parvenu. Keep your cool and act cool. Stage a chance encounter with them instead if at all possible. Look radiant, smile and catch their eye. If you are an idol yourself then best find a mutual friend or co-star to introduce you. It is still preferable in social situations to be introduced rather than introduce yourself. How to dress . Fashions come and go, and we see far too many stars get it horribly wrong when it comes to their wardrobe. Admittedly, men have it easier with more guidelines and rules to follow than their female counterparts, but the ones who get it right are usually those who stick to tried and tested conventions, shunning an attempt to reinvent the wheel. The dress code for the Academy Awards is Black Tie. It is never good manners to shun what the invitation says, although it’s increasingly often done. William was not a fan of Henry Cavill's bow tie on the red carpet at the BAFTAs which he said was wonky . Men, if you are going to wear a bow tie (as is correct) then make sure you can tie it properly and avoid looking like Henry Cavil did two weeks ago at the Baftas with a dickie-bow that looks like it’s been on the cooking sherry. Credit where it is due, Gerard Butler’s bow tie for 2014’s Academy Awards was a fine attempt – unlike Leonardo DiCaprio’s, which looked suspiciously ‘ready made’. Ladies, avoid being a slave to fashion. Yes, by all means follow colours and cuts but make sure you can move, walk (and maybe even dance) in the dress. Try it on before the day and walk about a bit to make sure you look elegant and relaxed in it. Working the red carpet . You’ve got the threads right and now the world’s gaze is upon you as you step out from your car onto the plush red passage below. Nothing could be more embarrassing than falling over (apart from losing to a staunch rival). Leading ladies need to make sure they can walk in their heels. Remember that the heels shouldn’t be too high or uncomfortable – award ceremonies are not known for their brevity and you will be in these all night. Three or four inch heels will be sufficient. Never rush down the red carpet, however shy you may be inside. Take your time and allow the lens to capture your elegance. Douglas Booth committed a fashion faux pas by wearing a green velvet smoking jacket to a black tie event . Etiquette expert William Hanson also instructs women on the correct way to walk in high heels . Poor old Dame Helen Mirren had a bit of stumble recently at the Berlin Film Festival – clearly reeling from the realisation that she had borrowed her costume from Princess Fiona in Shrek. Pacing yourself down the carpet is key so the flash bulbs capture your radiance. Avoid standing still and keep changing the pose every two to four seconds. Over beaming grins are not becoming to the occasion – as proud as Hollywood stars may be of their pearly teeth there is no need for us to see them this evening. Although seasoned pros will be aware of this, red carpet ingénues may forget that the red carpet is also the way out, not just the way in and it’s just as important to look your best as you egress. The fans . As antisocial as actors can sometimes be, now is the not the time. Work that red carpet, greet fans with smiles of equal vigour, answer the questions and sign those autographs (refrain from passing comment that autographs are now a tad passé, it’s all about selfies and camera pics, dontcha know?) Selfies . Ah yes, the selfie. Thanks to last year’s host Ellen DeGeneres’s now infamous and tediously recreated selfie there is perhaps a clunky inevitability that this bizarre way of taking a photograph will return. It may seem churlish to refuse to participate when asked by a fan, but one method to retain your dignity but please your fan would be to agree, but pull a pained expression during the capturing. People will clearly see you are uncomfortable with the whole thing and the odd expression will explain away why you don’t look very good in the snap (no one ever does). Last year's Oscar selfie became the most famous - and star-studded - in the history of the genre . Eddie Redmayne poses with his wife Hannah on the red carpet, William says it is good to cash in on your partner's fame . What to do if your partner is more famous than you . Is your wife, husband or significant other a little better known than you? If so, best stay side by side as you parade down the red carpet to ensure you are snapped and cash in on their fame. Acceptable acceptance speeches . Keep it tight and bright. Don’t do a Michael Moore and use it to make some profound political point. Wrong moment, dear. Remember to thank who you need to thank and unless you are a known wit keep it sincere rather than attempting any humour. Most people soon forget what you said anyway so no point fretting too much over it. Handling Oscar . In Britain it is illegal to place a stamp on an envelope with The Queen’s head the wrong way round. In America, short of anything similar, they have made it bad form to hold your trophy incorrectly (see Kevin Kline). The correct way is for the right hand holding the base of the trophy, left hand should be clasped around the legs. Thank you . Finally, even if you are the talk of Tinseltown following the ceremony, thanks to picking up multiple gongs, no one is exempt from writing their bread-and-butter thank you letter the next day. Not sure who to write to? Your official host is the President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is Cheryl Boone Isaacs… Get writing! FOR HIM: . Bow tie . Don’t even think about rolling up in something pre-tied. They look awful and people won’t need a long lens in close up to spot them. A bow tie isn’t that hard to learn to tie – practice tying it on your leg, chaps. The collar . Winged collars have not been correct with evening dress for some time, instead they are the reserve of full evening dress (aka white tie). Turn-down stiff collar is what is required. Jacket . Douglas Booth may have toyed with a green velvet number at the recent Baftas (the jacket couldn’t decide if it was a smoking jacket or a dinner jacket) but stick to something in black or midnight blue and you won’t go wrong. Never remove it until you are back in your hotel room with the curtains drawn. Socks . Make sure you wear them! There will be some spiv who decides that shunning the socks and flashing a bit of ankle instead will look bang on trend. It doesn’t and never will. FOR HER: . Bag . You don’t see many bags on the red carpet (they usually get carried by a nearby flunky) but the form is usually a clutch bag. These look elegant but can be a total pain for the Governor’s Ball afterwards where you may have to juggle finger food, a drink as well as shaking hands. A small evening bag with a thin strap will serve you better. Wardrobe malfunctions . Any dress that has to use toupee tape and other sticky trickery is perhaps best not worn to an event where hundreds of cameras will be pointed at you. Avoid pandering to fashion and opt for something that is less likely to leave you red-faced. Heels . It’s a formal evening affair, which calls for closed-toe shoes. Leave those peep-toed sling backs at home. Heels can be longer as it’s a nighttime event but nothing over three or four inches, please. It’s for the best.","The UK's number one etiquette coach shares awards ceremony advice .

"Chelsea is now the most popular part of London for super-rich homebuyers, figures reveal today. The upmarket area of West London accounted for 18 per cent of the total sales of homes costing more than £6.5million in the capital. Fourteen per cent of sales were in Knightsbridge, while Kensington took third place on 12 per cent. Making up the rest of the top five were South Kensington on 11 per cent and Notting Hill on 7.5 per cent. Chelsea is the destination of choice for super-rich house hunters, with 18 per cent of all home sales of £6.5million and more taking place in the area last year. Above, a property on the Chelsea Embankment . Despite being one of the most sought after property addresses in London, Mayfair only saw 7 per cent of super prime property sales in 2014. Belgravia has a 4 per cent of the market share, with the West London district of West Brompton made up 3.5 per cent of sales. Estate agent Russell Simpson analysed 2014 sales figures from LonRes. It said the market success in Chelsea and Kensington was driven by a 45 per cent increase in domestic buyers looking for large family homes, rather than foreign investors. This is according to high end estate agency Russell Simpson, which analysed 2014 sales figures from LonRes. Jake Russell, director at the estate agency, said: 'Domestic buyers have been resurgent in the ultra prime property market in 2014. Knightsbridge, the home of luxury department store Harrods (left) was also on the list while Mayfair, where a seven-bedroom townhouse was once priced at £20million (right), saw seven per cent of high-priced sales . 'We saw an upturn of 45 per cent in the number of domestic buyers in West London, predominantly purchasing family homes, second properties and first homes for adolescent children. 'We believe the upturn in sales is due to a higher proportion of large family homes available in Kensington and Chelsea, which are favoured by domestic buyers, compared to the West End, which has a higher proportion of flats and smaller apartments, which tend to attract more overseas buyers looking for homes for dependants and pied-a-terre residences. 'The leafy districts of Chelsea, Kensington and Notting Hill demonstrate that they are some the most sought after areas for buyers at the top end of the market.'","West London area accounted for almost 20 per cent of sales over £6.5m .

"More than half of voters want to leave the European Union, a surprise new opinion poll shows. Some 51 per cent of people want to sever ties with Brussels, while 49 per cent want to remain in the EU, the Opinium survey for the Observer shows. It comes as Norway warned Britain not to copy its own situation outside the EU, which leaves it unable to influence key economic rules it must abide by to trade with the 28-nation bloc. More than half of people would vote to leave the European Union, according to a new opinion poll . David Cameron has promised that if he remains Prime Minister after May's general election he would renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Recent opinion polls have suggested support for remaining in the EU, especially after reforms to its workings, was growing. However, the Opinium survey shows more people would vote to leave in a referendum. The poll also found that 41 per cent of people think that the EU is generally a good thing for the UK, while 34 per cent said it is generally a bad thing. Labour has accused the Tories of creating unnecessary uncertainty by raising the prospect of a referendum in two years' time. Privately some Labour figures think it is the party's only policy which has the backing of business leaders. However, 29 per cent of people say they most trust the Conservatves to handle the UK's relationship with the rest of the EU, compared to 23 per cent said they most trust Labour.

Some Conservatives have argued Britain could leave the EU and have a similar relationship to Norway, which has access to the single market as part of the European Economic Area. However, Vidar Helgesen, Norway's minister for Europe, has warned of the downside of not being part of the rule-setting process in Brussels. He told the Observer: 'We [Norway] are fully integrated into the EU single market as members of the EEA, but what we don't have is the right to vote on those regulations that are incorporated into our law when they are made by the council of ministers.' 'You would not have all those Brits staffing the commission where the decisions are made. 'Britain being on the outside would obviously not have that amount of people on the inside. You would find it more difficult, as a result, to affect the regulations.' Peter Wilding, director of pro-EU group British Influence, said: 'Eurosceptics who peddle the myth that Norway is the best [model] for a non-EU Britain are deceiving the public. They say leaving leads to more democracy and security. This is nonsense. 'We now have the Norwegian Europe minister telling us to get a grip, get real and get involved in shaping Europe. Little England cannot be an option.'","51% would vote to leave, while 49% of people would choose to stay .

"More than 60 Islamic State terrorists have been killed after fierce fighting broke out overnight in northern Iraq, Kurdish officials have said. Their bodies were piled into a digger claw and onto the back of a pickup truck today in the strategic village of Sultan Abdullah, which extremists have targeted repeatedly in the past two months. The bloody assault came just a day after U.S. officials revealed they are planning a 25,000-soldier invasion of Mosul - which was seized by Islamist militants last June - in as little as six weeks. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Death: More than 60 Islamic State militants have been killed near the Iraqi village of Sultan Abdullah . Grim work: The men's bodies were piled onto a pickup truck by Kurdish Peshmerga forces today . Photos taken today showed Kurdish forces, known as Peshmerga, amassing the bodies of Islamic State militants at their heavily-attacked headquarters in the village of Sultan Abdullah. A spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic Party's Foreign Relations Office told MailOnline: 'ISIS militants have attacked Peshmerga frontlines twice in the last three days in the heights of Sultan Abdulla and on the Makhmour front. 'In each case the militants were defeated, and repulsed in such a way they reportedly left behind 60  bodies.' A statement on the Kurdistan Democratic Party's website today added at least 50 jihadis' bodies were found on just one front after last night's fighting. 'The terrorists [Islamic State] launched overnight attacks on our units in three areas', it said. 'The Peshmerga forces confronted them strongly and with extermination. 'This was the eighth attack by terrorists [of its kind], and each one has had worse luck than its predecessor.' Fierce fighting: The Kurdistan Democratic Party told MailOnline the attack was the second in three days . Preparations: A Kurdish fighter aims as Islamists burn tyres in the distance to obscure his field of view . Mosul is the largest city in northern Iraq and has become one of the key strongholds for Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Iraqi soldiers fled in June last year when the terrorists marauded through the country and seized Mosul, setting up a caliphate which enforces an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam. The U.S. is helping Iraq plan a massive offensive to recapture the city, which will involve up to 25,000 soldiers battling just 1,000 or 2,000 militants. Iraq's soldiers are set to be joined by Peshmerga fighters and former Mosul police officers for the attack, which a U.S. government official said was planned for April or May. The source told the Associated Press that forces wanted to retake Mosul in the spring, before the summer heat and the holiday month of Ramadan kick in. The plan comes after months of U.S. air strikes designed to cripple Islamic State. Mass death: Peshmerga forces carried dozens of bodies of Islamic State militants using a digger today . Amassed: The attack was the latest of several near the city of Mosul, and one of the bloodiest for ISIS . A Swedish journalist has reportedly been freed from a week-long detention by Syrian government forces. Joakim Medin, a 30-year-old freelance reporter (right), told a Swedish newspaper he was seized at a road block along with his Kurdish interpreter Sabri Omar while working in the town of Qamishli, on the border with Turkey. Both were reportedly freed late last night. He told Expressen he was not subjected to violence but was interrogated and held in solitary confinement in a tiny cold dark cell 'full of dirt and blood'. 'I was there to report on the situation and hadn't entered the country the official way via the Syrian government,' he said. Washington is also training up and equipping the Iraqi military to be better-placed to recapture the territory. But today Iraq's defence minister criticised the U.S. for declaring a timeframe for the offensive, saying military commanders should not show their hand to the enemy. Khaled al-Obeidi added the official who predicted the attack for April or May had no knowledge of the issue. 'This is urban warfare and we have civilian populations,' he said. 'It is very important to take time and accuracy in setting the plan for this battle. 'A military official should not reveal the timing of an offensive. The battle for Mosul starts when preparations are complete, and selecting the time is up to Iraqi military commanders.' 'I don't know where the American official got this information... They absolutely do not have knowledge on this issue.' Following the criticism Ash Carter, the new U.S. Defense Secretary, told reporters  he would not confirm the precise timing of the attack. Across the border in Syria, Kurdish forces launched a separate assault last night aimed at retaking the northeastern town of Tal Hamis. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights,  run by a Syrian exile in Coventry, Warwickshire, the Kurds 'managed to advance and took over some 20 villages, farms and hamlets'. At least 12 jihadists were killed in the fighting, it said. It was not known if Kurdish forces lost any fighters.

One official said the damage had made parts of the prison 'uninhabitable', according to the Associated Press. Video taken by KGBT Action 4 News captured the chaos as prisoners jumped and shook security fences and whooped as smoke from the fires filled the air. The recreation area can be seen filled with inmates while more and more state trooper and sheriff cars park onto the other side of the fence like a barricade and a helicopter patrols the air. Officers can also be seen watching from a prison tower. Two officers and three to five inmates received minor injuries during the violent protest, according to the San Antonio Express-News. Negotiations were still occurring Saturday and the staff have not yet regained complete control of the prison, according to FBI Spokesman Erik Vasys. 'The situation is not resolved, though we're moving toward a peaceful resolution,' he said. Issa Arnita, a spokesman for the contractor operating the penitentiary, said officers used tear gas and 'non-lethal force' to try and control the protests. He added that there was no danger to the nearby public, as the facility has been placed on lockdown and the security fences have not been breached. Local, state and federal agencies are also patrolling the prison's gates, according to Willacy County Sherrif Larry Spence.

The prison's inmates are primarily 'low-level' offenders who immigrated to the U.S. illegally. It is unknown what specific medical services the inmates were protesting, but a 2007 American Civil Liberties Union study revealed that poor access to health care was one of the most common grievances by imprisoned immigrants. The report included complaints that it could take up to a week or longer before prisoners were seen by a practitioner, as well as that they were often withheld emergency services and medication.

"The number of female drinkers suffering from liver disease has soared in the last ten years. Older women and teenage girls are particularly vulnerable, according to new data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Treatment for women aged under 30 has increased by an incredible 58 per cent since 2004. The youngest girl hospitalised with the disease was a 19-year-old from Cambridgeshire. The number of female drinkers suffering from liver disease has soared in the last ten years. A clubber lies on the pavement above after she collapsed from alcohol in a club in Bristol . Alcohol-related liver disease refers to liver damage caused by alcohol misuse and binge-drinking. It has increased rapidly over the years and is now the third main cause of premature death. The disease can lead up to a build-up of fats in the liver. Symptoms include feeling sick, weight loss, yellowing  eyes and thickening ankles. If untreated it can progress to alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can be fatal. There is no set cure and those suffering from the disease are advised to stop drinking for the rest of their lives. Women are thought to be more vulnerable due to their body size. Current guidelines suggest they should not drink more than 28 units a week. Last year 5,214 females aged over 30 were also diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease - up from 4,210 in 2004. Women are thought to be more susceptible due to body size. Experts are blaming binge-drinking for the rise in the condition. Recent  figures show that teenagers are consuming twice as much alcohol  - 10.4 units a week compared to 5.3 units a decade ago. Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said that liver disease in the UK was 'spiralling out of control'. He said: 'Unfortunately the increasing amounts and regularity in which women are drinking are causing these shocking increases in alcohol related liver disease. 'Many women are now drinking most days, whether that is a few drinks after work or opening a bottle of wine when the kids have gone to bed, and this is leading to drinking too much on a regular basis. 'Liver disease is now the third main cause of premature death. The government and the alcohol industry must make it a lot clearer what is a safe amount to drink. 'They must also very importantly encourage anyone who drinks to take at least two or three consecutive days off every week. 'We encourage everyone to complete the liver health screener to assess what risk they maybe at, get clear advice on what to do and if necessary what to discuss with their GP.' Kingsley Manning, chair of HSCIC, said: 'This paints a powerful picture of the many impacts that alcohol has on patients and the NHS in this country.'

"Suspect: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty . High school friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have publicly turned against him as the start of his trial nears. The Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School graduates said they now have trouble trusting people and are afraid of being connected to the alleged bomber. And they blame Tsarnaev for the fact that two of their close friends are now sitting in jail facing charges in connection to him. Most of Tsarnaev's friends, who had known him for years, only spoke to the Boston Globe on the condition that they could use their middle names - so afraid were they to be connected to him. That's not an option for Steven Silva, whose identical twin brother Stephen was arrested for providing a gun to Tsarnaev that was later identified as the weapon that killed MIT police officer Sean Collier. Collier was shot dead three days after the Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan allegedly set of two bombs next to the marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring 264 people. Tsarnaev, whose brother was killed in a shootout with police, faces charges for Collier's death. Silva, who at first posted Twitter messages that said he believed Tsarnaev could have been framed by the FBI, said he no longer believes his former friend is innocent. 'I don't doubt he did it,' he said. Stephen Silva's lawyer said he had nothing to do with the bombing or Collier's murder. According to the Boston Globe, federal criminal law specialists expect Silva will appear in Tsarnaev's trial and is likely cooperating with the prosecution in his case. Silva also faces unrelated charges for selling heroin to an undercover informant. His most serious charge carries a maximum 40-year prison sentence. Robel Phillipos, 21, is another former friend of Tsarnaev currently behind bars. Phillipos faces up to sixteen years in jail after lying to federal agents about where he was the night Tsarnaev and his brother were on the run. He later admitted he had been present when two friends removed a computer, a backpack containing fireworks and other incriminating items from Tsarnaev's dorm room while authorities were looking for the suspected bombers. Phillipos' lawyers said he was a frightened 19-year-old who was intimidated by the FBI and too high on marijuana to clearly remember what he did that night. The defense called several friends who said Phillipos smoked marijuana a half-dozen times that day. The Globe reported that Tsarnaev's ex-classmates believed Phillipos to be anxious at the time he made false statements to federal authorities. Classmates: Tsarnaev is seen on the left in a high school yearbook photo with Robel Phillipos. Phillipos, seen on the right , was convicted in October of two counts of lying to federal agents . One friend, who wanted to be known only as Chris, said he believes he might have reacted similarly to Phillipos and still finds it surreal to see his friend in so much trouble. 'Robel's facing prison time, and I'm having a beer with friends.' The friends told the Boston Globe they believed their friend initially panicked when he was approached by federal investigators. They said they think the prosecutors are being especially hard on him so that  look 'tough on terrorism'. Another friend, going by the name Junior, said he still supports Silva. But Junior said the same cannot be said for Tsarnaev. 'I can't forgive him for what he did,' he said. 'My heart toward him is ice cold.' Defense: Members of the legal defense team for  Tsarnaev, including Miriam Conrad, far left, Timothy Watkins, second from left, William Fick, second from right, and Judy Clarke, far right, are seen January 5 . Many of Tsarnaev's old friends said they have trouble trusting people now after they realized they didn't know how much their friend was keeping a secret. Only after Tsarnaev was arrested did they learn his parents had gotten divorced and that his brother was involved with a radical form of Islam. Chris said he wondered if Tsarnaev left hints of his own change on Twitter. He posted one message that said the friends' hometown in Cambridge, Massachusetts could be 'fake'. Later that day, according to the Boston Globe, he posted: 'I don't argue with fools who say islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.' The friends have cut off all connection with Tsarnaev. The only thing that still connects them now is their alma mater. Chris said he was recently asked during an interview if he knew Tsarnaev because of the familiar high school on his resume. He responded that Tsarnaev was merely an acquaintance. The defense also called former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to testify for Phillipos. Dukakis, an old family friend of Phillipos' mother, described a phone conversation he had with Phillipos five days after the bombings. Dukakis said Phillipos told him he had been questioned by the FBI for five hours but was so confused he didn't remember what he said. Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, Robel Phillipos and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are seen together in this March 2013 photograph . The defense also claimed that Phillipos' alleged confession was coerced by FBI agents. Phillipos' attorneys said they would ask the judge to vacate the convictions and also appeal the verdict based on their argument that any statements he made to the FBI were not 'material' to the bombing investigation. Phillipos was charged with two counts of lying during a terrorism investigation. The basis for those charges was nine lies he was accused of telling the FBI during two separate interviews. The jury found him not guilty on several of the supposed lies, but concluded he did lie in some instances, leading to the two convictions. Prosecutors said Phillipos first told the FBI he hadn't been in Tsarnaev's dorm room that day and hadn't seen the backpack containing fireworks, only to later confess to being in the room with two other friends. The jury, however, found that Phillipos wasn't lying when he told the FBI he didn't see the backpack or fireworks in Tsarnaev's dorm room. Defense attorney Susan Church said that showed the jury 'clearly rejected the so-called confession.' Phillipos was not accused of participating in the bombings or knowing anything about the planning. Church said Phillipos was 'absolutely mortified' when he learned Tsarnaev was a suspect and had feelings of 'shock and betrayal' that his high school friend could do such a thing. During the trial, prosecutors scoffed at Phillipos' marijuana defense, telling the jury that he was able to remember many details about April 18 and lied about his activities that night because he knew he had done something wrong. After the guilty verdicts were announced, at the time U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said Phillipos 'lied to agents when he could have helped' and 'concealed when he could have assisted.'

'He is the first person to survive a fall from World's End.' Troops used ropes to reach Mr Lendas and winch him to safety. Some 40 soldiers were involved in the initial rescue which was later backed by a military helicopter. Mr Lendas had to be evacuated from the area on the shoulders of troops, who carried him over a distance of three miles to the nearest point at which he could be driven to hospital. Mr Lendas, who suffered no major injuries, told reporters that the ordeal 'was very scary and very painful as well. Rescue operation: A team prepares to climb down and rescue Mr Lendas, who survived a 4,000ft fall off a cliff known as the World's End . Saved: The 35-year-old groom was rescued by Sri Lankan troops and is the first person in history ever to survive the fall . Pure luck: Mr Lendas, seen being carried off on a stretcher after being rescued, fell as he was taking a picture of his new wife at the Sri Lankan tourist spot . Lucky: The Dutch tourist survived the 4,000 foot fall when he landed on a tree . 'I was making pictures and I had a misstep and I fell down backwards. 'Then I sat there for three and a half hours - the longest three and a half hours of my life.' The World's End cliff is the main attraction at the Horton Plains nature reserve in central Sri Lanka and is a key tourist attraction in the country. In 2011, Christopher Pilther, a 53-year-old Australian, fell to his death off the mountain top whilst visiting on holiday.

"Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is firmly in favour of three-parent babies . I fear I will be in trouble once again with some the Church as I find myself, in conscience, having to go against the line churches are taking on so-called three-parent babies. I am, to be clear, firmly in favour despite opposition from some of my colleagues and a powerful lobby of critics from abroad. A Commons Bill passed earlier this month will allow for a procedure in which a small proportion of a third person’s DNA is used to create an embryo in order to prevent potentially fatal genetic disorders. Scientists have found techniques to replace faulty mitochondrial DNA – mitochondria are energy-generating structures in human cells – with donated DNA, and Britain is set to be the first country to endorse the practice. It has proved hugely contentious. Yesterday 55 Italian MPs asked our House of Lords to reject the Bill, claiming the consequences ‘cannot possibly be contained’ within the UK. But this sort of opposition is unfathomable to me. This is an exciting medical intervention for families suffering rare conditions which prevent them from having children naturally. The idea of ‘three-parent babies’ is a distraction because the mitochondria are a mere fraction of what makes us human. This is much more like an organ transplant. Only one in 5,000 Britons suffers from mitochondrial conditions but an estimated 2,500 women are carrying these faulty cells which could be passed on to their children. Vicky Holliday is likely to be one of the first to receive this new treatment. She already has a daughter, Jessica, who has Leigh syndrome caused by her mother’s faulty cells. Vicky loves her daughter but knows she will never walk or talk and is likely to die as a result of organ failure. She says: ‘When you are given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope. It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child.’ Let us be in no doubt, the new techniques, the result of amazing research at Newcastle University, offer hope to those families who are at the mercy of such a terrible condition. They are now being given hope through the donation of healthy DNA – a technique that could prevent their children suffering a gradual and painful death. Viscount Ridley, the science writer and a supporter of the technique, has accused the churches of leaving families in great pain and suffering. He has written: ‘Surely… most church-going folk are not in the business of denying people hope merely to avoid the remote theoretical possibility of – well, of what exactly? I still cannot see a reasonable objection to this magnificent piece of technology in the service of human compassion.’ I have to agree. It is heartbreaking to see the churches once again opposing medical advances which have the potential to end great suffering. Living in hope: Vicky Holliday passed faulty DNA to her daughter Jessica. The baby now has Leigh syndrome . Compassion is at the heart of the Christian faith. The love of God and of our neighbour comes first and last. The link between faith and healing is very close. Look only at the number of hospitals named after saints. I long for the Church to end what some scientists feel is an overly negative opposition to extraordinary medical advances. One of the first steps is to address realistically the issue of pain at the end of life which has led so many of us to call for assisted dying. But it is time also for the churches to approach science and medicine more positively. The Church risks being seen as irrelevant. Conservative Christians have opposed transplants, IVF, embryo experimentation and stem cell research. Furthermore, the Church and science are always portrayed as being at odds even though this is often a misreading of history. Thankfully, most Christians are not flat-earthers. We embrace modern science and the vast majority of its developments. The Church of England has long been involved in the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). We have resisted the notion that every single development is a ‘slippery slope’ to one peril or another. The primary motive must be compassion and the relief of suffering. So why have we become trapped in doubt and fear about medical advances involving the beginning of life? I am constantly puzzled that Christians who believe in a gospel of hope find themselves in a perpetual state of opposition to scientific gains. The Bishop of Swindon, Lee Rayfield, who played a key role in the consultation, is largely supportive . The truth is that in spite of a few reservations about whether hereditary characteristics would be affected by the technique, there are absolutely no grounds for opposition. The Bishop of Swindon, Lee Rayfield, who played a key role in the consultation, is largely supportive. He said recently: ‘This has to begin with compassion. Compassion towards those who are sick and suffering and for those who long to bear children.’ He wants there to be proper safeguards. I agree. But let us remember that this week in the Lords we are being asked to agree regulations to enable the HFEA to consider each family’s treatment on a case-by-case basis, taking expert advice into account. Our country has an enviable tradition of responsible and thorough testing of research, and we can trust these experts to continue their painstaking work to enable families affected by serious mitochondrial disease to have healthy children. The main opposition is not from the Church of England, and I find it surprising that bishops seem to be preparing to support a delaying motion from the Roman Catholic peer Lord Deben. It would be received by families as a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation, consultation, parliamentary discussion and scrutiny. I respect the Catholic position but it is an absolutist position with no room for compromise. Like most peers I have received many emails and letters on the issue. Much opposition is coming from well-organised campaigns from Catholics from Latin America and Eastern Europe. But if we cannot make any alteration, then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions. Turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving. We live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work.","Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey is in favour of treatment .

"Less than two weeks after The Simpsons producer dismissed a theory that Homer has been in a coma for two decades, an astronomer has come up with another conspiracy: Springfield is in the southern hemisphere. In the latest episode of the show, SpaceX's Elon Musk guest starred and spends time at the Simpsons' home. At one point he stands by the dining room window, looking out at the night sky as the family sits behind him eating dinner. In The Simpsons' scene with SpaceX's Elon Musk, who was guest starring on the episode, the tips of the waxing crescent moon face right - how they would in the southern hemisphere . In the northern hemisphere, the tips of a waxing crescent moon face left, pointing away from the sun, unlike what was seen in the new episode . The waxing crescent moon is important to note, according to astronomer Phil Plait. In the northern hemisphere, the tips of a waxing crescent moon face left, pointing away from the sun. But in The Simpsons' scene with Musk, the tips of the waxing crescent moon face right - how they would in the southern hemisphere. 'This is the moment that changed everything for me. The frozen moment of time when I realized that for 22 years, The Simpsons has been lying to us,' Plait wrote on Slate. Plait, 50, does not reveal, however, why he believes the show to be lying for only 22 years of its 26-year span on television. But the fact that there are places called Springfield in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, makes this theory entirely possible. There are places called Springfield in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, which makes this astronomer's theory entirely possible . Astronomer Phil Plait, 50, does not reveal in his article why he believes the show to be lying for only 22 years of its 26-year span on television . Two weeks ago fans of the satirical cartoon proposed that Homer Simpson never awoke from a coma he fell into during an episode in 1993 and that everything that occurred on the series after that happened inside Homer's head. While seeming outlandish on the surface, the theory is gaining a lot of traction in online The Simpsons forums, with even the most devout of followers declaring they believe it. The theory lays claim to why the characters never age, and how the show moved from mundane episodes in the early '90s, such as Bart cheating on an IQ test, to plots that saw Mr. Burns capturing the Loch Ness Monster. But producer Al Jean said that the coma theory can be stashed in the 'intriguing but false file'. Jean said the theory, and a similar one that claims Bart was killed in an episode that never aired, is false, according to TMZ. He said: 'It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors. 'I'm afraid it goes with the 'Dead Bart' episode in the intriguing but false file.'

"Swollen breasts, the constant urge to wee and broken nights are  problems expectant mums know all too well and men have been unable to share - until now. So what happened when three dads became nine months pregnant? Jason Bramley, Steve Hanson and Jonny Biggins are discovering exactly what it's like to have a baby on board by wearing pregnancy suits to honour mums in the run up to Mother's Day on Sunday, March 15. Scroll down for video . Dads Jonny Biggins (left), Steve Hanson (middle) and Jason Bramley (right) are discovering exactly what it's like to have a baby on board by wearing pregnancy suits for an entire month . 'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task,' says Steve, 46, (left) who has a 12-year-old son Saul with his wife Kate . While most mothers would be happy with a bunch of flowers, the married dads, who are behind a new personalised Mother's Day book called Book Of Mum, are wearing pregnancy suits all day every day for a month. Currently on day eight of the project, the publishing directors, are charting the  ups and downs of impending parenthood in an online diary. Steve, 46, who is married to Kate and has a 12-year-old son, called Saul, said: 'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task.' The trio, who are from England but all work at an office in Barcelona, are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash. Jason, 44, who is a father-of-one mused on day five: 'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs.' 'I have a chair in the office with wheels and this is a blessing. I can glide effortlessly across the office to my desired destination.' The trio are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash . 'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' says company director Steve, from Doncaster, pictured on his laptop while wearing the belly . Steve's son Saul is pictured resting his head on his fake breasts, making for quite the funny sight . But it's not all fun and games. The 'empathy belly' comes complete with fake breasts and weighs two and a half stone - the average weight of a full term baby bump. It is designed to put pressure on the bladder, stomach and lungs, and cause abdominal distention and the inability to get comfortable. 'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' said company director Steve, from Doncaster. 'My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' said Steve (pictured in his 'empathy belly') 'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs,' dad-of-one Jason, 44, (pictured) wrote in his diary . The suit weighs 33lb, the average weight of a full term baby, and is designed to cause abdominal distention and put pressure on the bladder, stomach and lungs . 'I tried to make a small city out of pillows around my bump. My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' he added. 'They were way too warm and hung on my arm, sending it to sleep and waking me at the same time.' By day three the constant swinging motion of his belly forced Jonny, 45, from Surrey to visit his local pharmacy and seek medical help. 'I unzipped my jacket, exposing my belly and explaining my predicament to the woman behind the counter,' says Jonny, dad to Enzo, five, and Leo, one. 'I expected her to crack a smile or reel back in shock but she nodded professionally like she's seen it all before, opened a drawer and placed an elastic waist strap on the counter. Despite the trials and tribulations caused by faking pregnancy, the Steve, Jonny and Jason said it has made them appreciate what their wives have had to go through . 'A few minutes later, with belly strapped firmly in place, I waltzed out of there with a new-found spring in my stride. It was wonderful, I could move again.' Yet despite the trials and tribulations just one week in Steve admits to bonding with his 'baby'. He told his  diary: 'It seems to be taking on a personality. It has a name, and its name is Bump. I cradle it, pat it, rub it and I just caught myself talking to it while patting it.' As well as writing down their experiences the dads are also uploading videos of their pregnancy journeys to their online diaries - and all three are looking forward to Mother's Day when they can remove the suits for good. 'Huge respect goes to all you pregnant mums out there. Every single one of you,' said Steve.","Three fathers are  wearing two-and-a-half stone baby bumps for a month .

He said: 'My work takes me around the world, but I rarely have the time to get behind the wheel myself.' Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Rolls-Royce's official announcement that it's to build its first ever 4x4, creating hundreds of new jobs.

Rolls Royce officially announced this week that they will be building their first ever 4x4 and creating hundreds of new jobs - this photograph demonstrates how the new 4x4 could look . He said: 'The Government will do everything we can to support you because it is something the country needs more of.' The new super-luxury offroader (as imagined by Auto Express above) is set to go into production within three years, adding to a line-up which includes the Phantom and Ghost limousines and variants, plus the Wraith fastback. It will be a high-bodied allterrain vehicle with all-new aluminium architecture, which Rolls-Royce says is 'worthy of carrying the Spirit of Ecstasy into the future'.","The company have put a great deal of attention to detail into this model .
The new Zetec is both effortless and nimble to drive .
Ford have listened to their customers and simplified the car's interior .
Were it not for a Press leak, this would be a test of the latest version of the Ford Fusion. That was the name planned for the mid-size hatchback, which in 1998 replaced the longrunning Escort. But Ford's then boss, the mercurial Jac Nasser, was so incensed that the cat had got out of the bag, he changed the name and revealed it just seconds before the curtains came up at its Geneva Motor Show launch. Now with 12 million sold worldwide, we're on the third generation.
Ford does so many things without fuss that it's easy to take its cars for granted. A big mistake. The company puts a great deal of attention to detail into each model. So this newcomer is both effortless and nimble to drive, but also engaging, thanks to a crisp six-speed manual gearbox linked to a willing, yet frugal and award-winning, 1-litre 125bhp EcoBoost engine.
The base price of the car I drove was £18,795, but it came with a few extras including Frozen White paint (£250), door edge protectors (£85), but most significantly the Ford Sync2 DAB navigation system (£500) with a big 8in touch-screen with on the central dashboard. It includes a splitscreen display, voice-control of audio, satnav, climate control and mobile phones, spoken street names, 3-D highway, junction and landmark views and even the Michelin guide. A chunk of money, but well worth it.
The ergonomics make it easy to sit in and drive. Buttons tend to be where you want them.
Ford said it's listened to customers who asked for simplicity inside the car with fewer controls and switches to navigate around.
So a sensible de-clutter results in a cleaner, more modern feel to the interior with black satin trim and chrome detailing. Sufficient space in the back. The boot is big enough for the weekly shop.
Good economy at around 60mpg — almost 50mpg in town, helped by stop-start technology. Acceleration from rest to 62 mph is 11 seconds which, while it won't break any speed records, is fine for family motoring. CO2 emissions are low at 108g/km.
My Zetec trim level is the third of six which range from basic Studio to Style, Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium and Titanium X. Standard equipment includes 16 in alloy wheels, a quick-clear heated windscreen, air conditioning, remote central locking, hill-start assist, Thatcham category 1 alarm, halogen headlamps, sports-style front seats and a driver-seat lumbar adjust.
Exterior styling has been refined to make it look more streamlined, but the main brief seems to have been, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Up against tough competition such as the Volkswagen Golf which, although more expensive, is a hard act to follow.
There are some handy parking aids on offer, which use ultrasonic sensors to locate parking spaces and steer the car into them automatically. Sadly on the model I tested, they were not fitted.
Having plumped for a midrange model, you might ask what else is on offer. Beyond the standard Titanium X trim there's the 135mph ST, with its 250 bhp 2-litre EcoBoost petrol engine, which hits showrooms this month from £22,195. There's also a 185 bhp diesel with a top speed of 135mph and 19in alloys, and a high-performance 320 bhp 2.3-litre allwheel drive RS — the 30th vehicle to wear the RS badge since 1968."
"A five-month-old baby suffering from flat head syndrome must wear a £2,000 specialist helmet every day for up to six months to help correct his misshapen skull. Oakley Porter-Mcaveeney, from Coventry, suffers from brachycephaly – a rare condition which is better known as flat head syndrome - and has to wear the special helmet to remould his skull. His mother Stephanie Mcaveeney, 28, first noticed her son's unusual condition when he was just eight-weeks-old but was told treatment to rectify his head shape was not available on the NHS. Scroll down for video . Oakley Porter-Mcaveeney (pictured with his mother Stephanie) suffers from brachycephaly – a rare condition which is better known as flat head syndrome - and has to wear the special £2,000 helmet to remould his skull . The five-month-old baby has 'one of the worst examples' of the condition ever seen (left) but doctors said treatment was not available on the NHS. Ms Mcaveeney put out an appeal on Facebook for donations to help . Doctors told Ms Mcaveeney, a stay-at-home mother, that it was the worst case of the condition they had ever seen  but admitted that she would have to fork out £2,000 to buy the specialist helmet. However, after posting her story on Facebook, donations piled in and she was able to afford the helmet. Young Oakley now wears the hard hat – which is designed with his name on the front - for 23 hours every day. Ms Mcaveeney said: 'He's adapted to life with the helmet really well. 'Oakley is only five-months-old so he's just taken it all in his stride and seems to be as happy as ever. 'I can already see an improvement and it's now just a matter of waiting for the helmet to work its magic. 'He will have to be reviewed every two weeks and it could take between four to six months to fully correct the shape of his skull. Young Oakley now wears the helmet – which is designed with his name on the front - for 23 hours every day . It is hoped that after he has worn it every day for six months, his skull will be remoulded to the correct shape . 'I'm very confident my lovely little boy will be okay now. It's a wonderful feeling knowing that he's receiving the correct treatment and I can't thank the people who've donated enough.' Oakley will wear the helmet for 23 hours each day for up to six months to counteract his flat head. Brachycephaly is caused when part of a baby's head becomes flattened due to continued pressure on one spot and can also affect the jaw and ear alignment. In extreme cases it can affect speech and hearing. Ms Mcaveeney added: 'It was emotional to see the helmet finally being fitted. All the research I have looked through says that this is the best thing for him. 'At first I thought this was a cosmetic issue but it didn't take a lot of research to realise that it's far more serious than that. I'm delighted that Oakley will be OK now. 'He's adapted to the change really well and is happy taking naps in it.

"Last month Myleene Klass landed herself in hot water among Britain's middle class mums when she mocked an email sent to fellow parents asking for cash donations for a child's present. Amid the fall-out - compounded by her own sarcastic response on social media - the 36-year-old was confronted at the school gates by mothers who felt betrayed, and was even ticked off in a round robin email from the £5,000-a-year school's headteacher. But in a new interview with Fabulous magazine, the designer and Classic FM presenter said: 'This is why I keep getting myself in trouble. I can't keep my mouth shut. But that's who I am.' Myleene Klass in 2011 with her daughter Ava, now seven, says she 'can't keep her mouth shut' Opening up about her decision to post two emails from mothers of her seven-year-old daughter Ava's classmates, Myleene said: 'I want my children to receive yo-yos and give yo-yos, not Kindles. Being happy is not about stuff. 'I know it doesn't make me popular but this is what I stand for. I wasn't raised like that.' The designer, who has a line of Littlewoods clothes, considered the potential backlash and reaction to posting the emails last month - which it has now emerged could be a year old - but went ahead anyway. She shared two emails from her fellow mums which were sent out to help organise a group present for their daughters, with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram. The messages, which Myleene posted under the hashtag #bonkers, soon went viral. The first email read: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9. ‘If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’ Myleene looked unworried by the furore at The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel premiere last week . A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: ‘Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.’ Myleene then posted her own response with the sarcastic heading, 'let's put the fun back into birthdays' saying she was going to collect money to buy Ava a unicorn and that she'd 'like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.’ And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com. But the designer, who has her own Littlewoods brand of clothes, underwear, hair and beauty products, says she's undaunted by controversy, describing herself as 'fearless'. Myleene Klass caused a backlash from mothers around the country when she posted fellow school mums' emails about collecting cash contributions for their daughter's presents . Myleene caused further outrage with her sarcastic response titled, 'Let's put the fun back into Bdays!' She further explained her rationale in an article in the Telegraph, explaining she was 'amazed' by the emails when she first received them and posted - what she thought was - a 'humourous response'. Myleene wrote: 'One mum did explain that she feels 26 presents is an awful lot for any child to get, and a lot of it is plastic rubbish. 'She saw the email as problem-solving, and I understand what she meant, but the joy of getting a gift of some felt-tips and a yo-yo when you’re a kid can’t be diminished. Surely that’s what you’d rather have for your seventh birthday, not a Kindle or a desk.' Myleene, whose career was rebooted by starring on I'm A Celebrity and notably featured her showering in a white bikini, also opened up to Fabulous about the end of her marriage to celebrity minder Graham Quinn, the father of her two daughters and husband of six months. She said that for the first year after their split, she was 'reeling from the heartache'. But she believes in 'the sanctity of marriage', adding, 'you're either in or you're out, you can't just be half in it and because I believe in those things so strongly, when those beliefs are rocked you question so much.'

"The former colleagues of the ex-solider charged with killing American Sniper author Chris Kyle and another man say the veteran on trial in Texas is not the Marine they had come to know in Iraq. They say Eddie Ray Routh respected and cherished people who had jobs like former Navy SEAL Kyle. Routh, 27, is charged with capital murder after allegedly killing Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a gun range in Stephenville, Texas, in February 2013. Scroll down for video . Eddie Ray Routh posing with an AK-47 at Camp Fallujah in Iraq. He is on trial for murdering American Sniper author Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a shooting range in Texas in 2013 . Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper was allegedly shot to death by Routh . Members of the Combat Logistics Battalion 8 for the US Marines - Routh's unit (he is is second from from left) - pose for a picture at Camp Fallujah in Iraq . Men who served with 'Routhy' in Combat Logistics Battalion 8 at Camp Fallujah in 2007 and 2008 believe something must have happened to turn him from a gung-ho Marine into an alleged double murderer. Former Cpl. Ryker Pawloski said: 'The Routh I knew looked up to people who did that kind of job. 'He respected war fighters like you wouldn't believe. 'None of us who deployed with him know what's wrong. ''We want to know what's wrong, and we want him to get help. 'Because all of us kind of have the collective feeling of, you know, we let our brother down.' A solider who shared a metal trailer with Routh at Camp Fallujah, Corey Smalley, said: 'It just doesn't fathom. 'He wasn't the picture-perfect Marine, even though that's what he wanted to be. 'And the people he looked up to the most were people like Chris Kyle. 'He always wanted to be those people - be the people that Marines from now on will always be talking about.' Prosecutors will seek life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty if Routh (above) is convicted . Routh (seen in 2008) was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back to the United States from his military service . Taya Kyle, the wife of the murdered former Navy SEAL, has been in court watching the capital murder trial . Shortly after the unit reached Fallujah, Routh was ordered help guard Iraqi prisoners at Balad Air Base, . Although Routh had no love for the captured fighters, Smalley said he was disturbed at how they were treated. He told Smalley some guards would use the leashed prisoners' heads to push open the metal cell doors and 'he just didn't feel like that was called for'. Smalley did see a glimmer of the man he knew when Routh confessed and asked if he could apologize to the families of Kyle and Littlefield. He said: 'I'd love to have an hour to just sit down with him and talk to him. 'I would put money on it, that he wasn't in his right mind. 'That there was something going on that, he made an unconscious decision to make that mistake.' Men who served with 'Routhy' say something must have happened to turn him into an alleged double murderer . Routh reportedly wanted to meet with Kyle's parents, Wayne and Deby (above), so he could apologize to them . Routh was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back from his military service. His defense has argued that when Routh killed Kyle and Littlefield 'he was in the grip of a psychosis' so severe he didn't know it was wrong.' The prosecution has argued otherwise and said that Routh killed the two men because he was upset Kyle had brought Littlefield to the range, NBC News reported. A psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution, Dr Michael Arambula, said: '[Routh] didn't have issues with Chris [Kyle], only Chad [Littlefield], but because Chris would shoot him for shooting Chad, he had to shoot Chris. 'And that makes sense and is not psychotic thinking.""

Meanwhile wave swells of up to 50ft are expected off the Republic of Ireland within 24 hours, with ‘super tides’ forecast until tomorrow. These are caused by the astronomical tide being at an 18-year peak, although the height will not be unusual because the weather is normal for winter. However, strong winds and higher tides than average have prompted a warning over a flooding risk brought on by large waves in coastal areas. The Environment Agency said it was urging people to ‘take care near coastal paths and promenades and not to drive through flood water’. Overnight rural parts of England saw freezing temperatures, with -6C (21F) in Benson, Oxfordshire, and -7C (19F) observed in the Scottish Highlands.

Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: ‘It's set to be a very wet and windy day for most parts. ‘Across northern parts temperatures will reach a maximum of around 5C (40F), while the South West will briefly hit 10C (50F).’ Another forecaster, Chris Page, said wind gusts of up to 60mph are likely, especially in coastal areas, adding to the blizzard-type conditions. He said: ‘It doesn't necessarily mean that every single place within the warning zone will see snow. It's a hit-and-miss scenario [with the showers].’ Icy conditions are forecast tomorrow and Tuesday, as slow melts away leaving a risk of slippery patches on untreated surfaces. A Met Office warning for 4in of snow today was valid from 6am to 5pm, covering all of mainland Scotland and most of northern England. Forecast: The Met Office said today will be 'very wet and windy' in most areas - with temperatures only expected to hit 10C in the South West .

Environment Agency flood watch: More than 50 flood alerts and nine warnings were in place for England and Wales this morning . Snow in red, rain in blue: Blizzard conditions are expected, with heavy snow on high level routes and some accumulations at lower levels . A separate alert issued from midnight tonight until 3pm on Tuesday covers as far south as the Peak District and also includes a warning for ice. There was only one report of severe delays on a motorway this morning - between junction 7 and 6A of the M1 near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. In the Lake District, motorists got into difficulties on higher routes. Cumbria Police's road traffic unit tweeted: ‘Kirkstone Pass and The Struggle closed. ‘Several vehicles stranded and RTCs (road traffic collisions). Treacherous conditions. Please do not go there.’ Yesterday snow was seen in parts of Surrey and a light dusting visible in the early hours in London, while Cumbria was covered in several inches. Commonly referred to as super tides, spring tides or 'super moon' tides, they are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. In a blog on its website, Met Office analysts said these tides occur when the pull of the sun and moon align and combine. When the gravitational pulls offset each other, we get smaller tides known as neap tides. We are currently at the height of these pull increases. The experts added: 'However, there is a longer cycle at work too, associated with the gravitational pull of the planets in the solar system. 'This means we can see additional, albeit relatively small, increases and decreases in the size of spring and neap tides over long periods of time.' This is the moment a deer swam through a flooded wetland after being caught out by the highest spring tide in 20 years. With water rapidly rising to about 7ft, the animal battled through water with only its head above the surface. But the deer made it to the other side of Steart Marshes near Bridgwater, Somerset, and even stuck its tongue out at the photographer.

They normally move around and find higher ground. ‘But the volume and speed [yesterday] was a different level. They must have thought “oh, we better get out of here”. ‘They are obviously very good swimmers. They just got to higher ground, had a bit of a shake and then basked in the sun for a while.’ Unhurt: It was one of five deer that did not expect the sheer volume and speed in which the wetlands was flooded .

"Activists, actors and politicians gathered Saturday in New York City to honor civil rights leader Malcolm X with a ceremony at the Harlem site where he was killed 50 years ago today. About 300 people converged to hear remarks from one of Malcolm X's six daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz, as well as elected officials, including Reverend Al Sharpton, who said believes the civil rights icon would have been proud of the demonstrators across the country who demonstrated who protested the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The ceremony was held at the Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, formerly known as the Audubon Ballroom. Scroll down for video . In memoriam: Ilyasah Shabazz, daughter of Malcolm X, speaks about her father and family  on Saturday as activists, actors, and politicians remembered the civil rights leader during a ceremony in New York . About 300 people converged to hear remarks from one of Malcolm X's six daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz, as well as elected officials, including Reverend Al Sharpton . Remembering an icon: Ilyasah Shabazz spoke of her father's legacy and keeping it alive, while Sharpton spoke of how he believes Malcolm X would have reacted to the protests over Eric Garner and Michael Brown . A blue light shone onto the floor in the exact spot where he was killed. A mural with images of Malcolm X adorned a wall. 'He was just a young man who gave all that he possibly could,' Shabazz said after a moment of silence marking the time of his death. 'I felt so compelled to try and do whatever it was that I could for my father, not because, again, he was my father, but because of the work he did for all of us,' she added, according to NY1 News. 'So I don't think it's only my responsibility - I think it's all of our responsibilities.' Killed:  February 21 was the 50th anniversary of the assassination Of Malcolm X . Malcolm X, whose full name was El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, was 39 when he was shot in the theater on Feb. 21, 1965, as he was preparing to address several hundred of his followers. By the time he died, the Muslim leader had moderated his militant message of black separatism and pride but was still very much a passionate advocate of black unity, self-respect and self-reliance. Three members of the Nation of Islam were convicted of murder in his death. He had repudiated the Nation of Islam less than a year earlier. In an interview with The Associated Press on the eve of the anniversary observance, Shabazz said she was pleased that the site is now a place for people to get a sense of empowerment. Scene: Human rights activist Malcolm X is tended to as he lies mortally wounded on the stage of the Audubon ballroom in the Harlem on February 21, 1965, after being shot multiple times . 'One of the great things about Malcolm is that he redefined the civil rights movement to include a human rights agenda,' she said. 'So while we are focusing on integrating schools, integrating housing and all these other things, Malcolm said that we demand our human rights 'by any means necessary.' 'And that means ... that we have to address these problems. That we have to identify them, and absolutely discuss them.' Respect: Thousands gathered for the funeral of Malcolm X following his death . Plans for the ceremony also included a keynote address by social and political activist Ron Daniels, and a reading by actor Delroy Lindo of a eulogy for Malcolm X that was written by the late actor and activist Ossie Davis.","Malcolm X was 39 when he was assassinated in Harlem, New York, while preparing to give an address on February 21, 1965 .

"A 37-year-old gay mom is set to spark controversy after she said she'd be disappointed if her six-year-old daughter wasn't gay when she grows up. Sally Kohn a political commentator who has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, describes herself as living in the 'liberal bubble of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where 'yuppies' want their kids to be happy. She said: 'I'm gay. And I want my kid to be gay, too.' Scroll down for video . Family: Kohn, right, is raising her six-year-old girl daughter, Willa, center, along with her partner Sarah, left, whom she met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2003 (Courtesy of Sally Kohn) View: Sally Kohn, 37, a CNN and MSNBC political commentator  said 'I'm gay. And I want my kid to be gay, too' In a lengthy essay in The Washington Post  Kohn explained that, she, like most parents simply wants her child to follow in her footsteps. She writes: 'If we went to college, we want our kids to go to college. If we like sports, we want our kids to like sports. If we vote Democrat, of course we want our kids to vote Democrat.' Kohn said: 'When my daughter plays house with her stuffed koala bears as the mom and dad, we gently remind her that they could be a dad and dad. 'Sometimes she changes her narrative. Sometimes she doesn't. It's her choice.' 'Time will tell, but so far, it doesn't look like my six-year-old daughter is gay. In fact, she's boy crazy.' Kohn, a liberal political commentator, community organizer, and founder and chief executive officer of the Movement Vision Lab, a grassroots think tank is also a contributor to the Fox News Channel. She is raising her six-year-old girl daughter, Willa Hansen Kohn, along with her partner Sarah Hansen, whom she met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2003. Hansen works in philanthropy advising foundations how to best support groups in the social and environmental justice movements. Bond: Kohn, right, and her partner Hansen hold their daughter, Willa, center, in their arms during a trip . Video: In 2010 she posted a Youtube video of her then two year-old daughter entitled 'My 2 year old explains the Bush tax cuts' featuring the precocious little girl . Parenting: Kohn, pictured here with her daughter as a baby said 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life' Kohn, however, is no stranger to controversy. In 2014, she wrote that referring to an undocumented person as an 'illegal immigrant' was like calling a black person the N-word. Meanwhile, she often writes about how her sexuality impacts her parenting style. In a parenting blog for The New York Times she described her experience of being 'a butch lesbian' taking her five year old daughter for a Princess makeover at Disney World. She wrote: I have been a tomboy all my life. When I played with dolls they were usually being sacrificed in some sort of erupting volcano-like mud hole in my backyard or running for their lives.' 'My partner and I certainly didn’t teach our daughter to like pink and ruffles and such. And I can’t fathom some genetic or biological nodule that predisposes my girl to like dolls while little boys like trucks. Baloney.' She adds: 'Even in the midst of our hyper-liberal and hyper-diverse neighborhood with girls and boys of all kinds on display every day, it happened. 'Did I do something wrong? Is feminism mysteriously skipping a generation? Meanwhile, I have to bribe her to wear jeans.' In 2010 she posted a Youtube video of her then two year-old daughter entitled 'My 2 year old explains the Bush tax cuts' featuring the precocious little girl. Kohn said: 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade' And while the pundit is known for her outspoken views, she admits that her straight friends have a massive problem with her wanting her daughter to be gay when she grows up. She wrote: [One friend asked] 'Don't you want her to be happy?' She adds: 'A friend once told me 'I wouldn't even choose for myself to be gay.' It was a sad admission, because she was.' She goes on to suggest that there is a widely-held viewpoint that 'no one would choose to be gay — even in the gay rights movement.' She adds: 'I've never for a single second regretted being gay, nor saw it as anything other than an asset and a gift. 'My parents were ridiculously supportive from Day One, and I had a great community of friends and mentors who made me feel unconditionally accepted. 'By the time my daughter comes of age, she'll have even more of a support network, including two moms, for crying out loud. 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade more quickly. 'I want my daughter to know that being gay is equally desirable to being straight. 'The problem is not the idea that homosexuality could be a choice but the idea that heterosexuality should be compulsory. 'In my house it's plainly, evidently not. We've bought every picture book featuring gay families, even the not-very-good ones and we have most of the nontraditional-gender-role books as well — about the princess who likes to fight dragons and the boy who likes to wear dresses.'","Sally Kohn is a political commentator for  CNN, Fox News and MSNBC .

"A collection of touching letters addressed to best-selling crime novelist Agatha Christie have been published for the first time. The heartfelt notes, many of which date back to the 1950s and 1960s, praise the crime writer for her epic novels and short stories and thank her for helping individuals through hard times. The horde of messages, which have been published to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday, include a letter from author PG Wodehouse, as well as a note from a Polish woman in London, who told how one of Christie's novels helped her survive a war-time labour camp in Germany. Scroll down for video . A series of touching letters to novelist Agatha Christie (left) have been published to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday. The messages, some of which date back to the 1960s (right), praise her novels . The woman explained in her letter how she exchanged a piece of candle for a Polish translation of Christie's novel, The Man in the Brown Suit. In her fan mail, she wrote: 'I read and re-read (it) so often that I almost knew it by heart. 'The first few pages were missing so I didn't know the title or the author but for seven months it was my only link with a normal world. 'I know your writings have given pleasure and amusement to millions of people all over the world but never can one of your books have meant more to anyone than that tattered Polish translation did to me.' Christie, who wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections, also treasured a 1958 letter from a 14-year-old boy in Bristol who started a book club at his school so he could raise funds to buy her work. 'I have bought 28 books by you and this is how I have managed it,' he wrote. 'I charge the boys 3d per book to read at school, and 6d if they wished to take them home. 'With the money I obtained . . . I bought more 'AC' books . . . Now my scheme is bringing in so much money, I can afford to buy one of your books a week.' One letter, dated August 1963, thanks Ms Christie for helping women prisoners escape in Romania (above) by writing her novels. The note references Christie's crime novels including Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple . In the five-page handwritten letter, he later told how he would be 'truly proud' to hold a response from Christie and said he would be able to show it to his children in years to come. He also asked the 'Queen of Crime' at what age she began writing and expressed an interest in knowing the background of her successful career. In her typed response, which Christie also kept a copy of, she replied: 'I was very interested in your letter. You seem to have had a very good idea and I congratulate you.' Christie, who died in 1976 aged 85, also saved a note from PG Wodehouse, the English writer best known for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories. His 1969 letter from New York stated that he was 'pleased and proud' after discovering she had dedicated a Halloween party to him and added 'a new Agatha Christie is always an event'. Praising her choice of title, Wodehouse also revealed that he found 'getting a satisfactory title is the most difficult problem'.

Christie replied saying she was 'very interested' in his note . The heartfelt letters (left), many of which were sent to the best-selling crime novelist's personal address in south Devon (right) have been published for the first time ever to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday . Also in the collection is a letter written in 1963 by a woman who spent more than a decade in a Romanian prison with no access to books. She told the best-selling author: 'During the 12 years I spent in prison I never saw a written page. 'My memory, however, could not be sealed up and thanks to it and to you my fellow-sufferers came to know and to love the works of Agatha Christie.' Christie's grandson Mathew Prichard published a number of the letters and replies to mark her 125th anniversary and encouraged today's fans to share their experience of her writing. He said: 'Knowing what receiving these letters meant to my grandmother, I'm sure she would be moved to see these personal stories shared publicly for the first time. 'As we call to her fans across the globe to share their stories and experiences of Christie, I look forward to discovering how her work continues to inspire today.' Christie, who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died aged 85 having written more than 66 detective novels, most famously featuring her creations Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Agatha Christie (pictured with her then young grandson, Mathew Prichard) wrote a total of 66 detective novels.

"It's the biggest night in the film calendar and actresses have spent months choosing their outfit and getting red carpet ready for the most important night of their career. Yet designer Tom Ford has likened the Oscar red carpet to a 'global game show' and says he doesn't know an actress who isn't terrified at the prospect of the 'glam cam'. Forget the fact that they're the most beautiful women in the world, primped, styled and dressed to perfection - he told WWD that running the gauntlet of the world's press leaves Hollywood's A-list women 'terrified'.` Cate Blanchett (left) and Jennifer Lawrence (right) negotiate the Oscar red carpet at last year's ceremony .

'They're fearful of the glam cam. It's like being on a global game show, and it's horrible. They're terrified.' 'Ford, recently hosted a star-studded autumn/winter 2015 catwalk show in Los Angeles, with a front row groaning with celebrities including Scarlet Johansson, Beyonce and Jay Z, Gwyneth Paltrow and Amy Adams. He typically dresses several men and one woman for the Oscars and was behind Gwyneth Paltrow's 2012 gown. Now he's issued his advice on how Hollywood stars should cope with the world's spotlight.

"A woman was left horrified after she spotted a giant rat outside her home in north London. Sam Firth photographed the rodent, which she estimated to be between 16 and 18 inches, as it peered through her back door in fashionable Belsize Park. The sighting comes as pest controllers revealed the shocking epidemic of mutant rats - some as big as cats - across the UK. The rodents, which have been seen been seen across the country over the past year, are twice as large as normal species and cannot be killed with traditional substances. Scroll down for video . Alarming: Sam Firth spotted this giant rat outside her home in fashionable Belsize Park, north London . Fearless: The rodent, which Ms Firth estimated to be between 16 and 18 inches, approaches the back door . One rodent measuring 20-inches was recently spotted at a food establishment in Swindon, Wiltshire. Kevin Higgins, of the British Pest Control Association, said rat numbers were going up by about 15 per cent each year - and the boom was driven by the availability of food. 'The more food, the more rodents it will attract,' he said. John McNeice, director of Scottish Pest Control Services, said: 'We see big rats in cold stores. The rats grow a very thick fur. That can make them look bigger. 'You might see a rat under a pallet that looks as big as a cat.' Similar stories of giant rats have been reported by pest controllers in Glasgow, the Scottish borders and Swindon. Last week, experts warned of a plague of super rats after it was revealed that pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities. Information released to Labour by councils  has revealed deep cuts in the amounts being spent on controlling vermin. A map details where notable rats have been recorded across the UK since 2010. The rat discovered in Swindon this month was giant at 20-inches, but not considered 'mutant' as it was killed traditionally . Across 200 local authorities in England, pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010. There has also been a 16 per cent cut in the amounts spent on street cleaning. Some authorities insist they have taken steps to provide better value for money, accounting for reductions in budgets. But others admit they have stopped providing pest control services altogether. Super rats are typically larger than sewer rats and cannot be killed by traditional rodenticides. The species has developed a genetic mutation which means substances approved by the EU to control rat populations has no effect on them. Pest controllers are calling for new rules to be made allowing the creation of stronger poisons, though the health and safety risk to humans and the environment this bears is a bone of contention. Most rats are found in food premises, though some have been recorded across the UK in homes. To prevent the creatures from infesting your home or business, experts advise keeping conditions spotlessly clean. Ensuring wheelie bins have proper drain holes is also important, said exterminators. 'A rat in the wrong place is a problem for anybody so you have to be vigilant whether its commercial or residential. 'They'll chew water pipes, electric cables and it puts your property at risk,' said Justin Holloway of exterminators, Prokill. Traditionally, people have been able to call out pest control officers from their local authorities if their homes are infested with mice, rats, wasps or other pests. Many councils have offered free assessments, and then made subsidised charges for proofing, poisons or other recommended measures. The decline in local authority services means more people are likely to attempt ineffective and sometimes dangerous DIY solutions, increasing the numbers of pests, experts said. Reports this year suggest that rats in the UK are becoming bigger, and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control. So-called 'super rats' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year. Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons. In counties including Berkshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent, all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison. Earlier this year, worried homeowners shared photographs of the rodents, some of which were as large as small cats. One, found on an industrial estate in Liverpool, measured two feet, while another in Gravesend, Kent, was the width of a shovel. Researchers at Huddersfield University performed studies on the rodents, with some parts of Britain more severely affected than others. In Gloucestershire and Shropshire, around 20 per cent of rats tested were immune to traditional poisons, while a third in Kingston could not be killed using the substances. In Southampton, 75 per cent of the rodents were found to have the genetic mutation. Spread: This enormous rat discovered in Cornwall last year measured 50cm. Reports this year suggest that rats in the UK are becoming bigger, and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control . Epidemic: This rat found in Swindon is the largest on record for the Wiltshire town. Pest exterminators have warned an influx of super rats may be on its way, with the rodents immune to traditional poisons .","Giant rat photographed outside home in fashionable Belsize Park, London .

"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband will be put on the spot this week when broadcasting chiefs announce fresh details of planned televised Election debates. BBC, ITV and a combined Sky/Channel 4 team will draw lots to decide the scheduling order for three proposed TV confrontations between the party leaders. They intend to show three debates in the six weeks leading up to the May 7 Election, with two programmes featuring seven party leaders and a separate head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband. David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband (pictured left to right) will be put on the spot this week when broadcasting chiefs announce fresh details of planned televised Election debates . But there is continuing speculation that the debates may never be screened because of squabbling between the rival parties and the broadcasters. The Prime Minister has complained that the debates are too close to polling day, Mr Clegg says it is unfair to exclude him from the Cameron versus Miliband showdown and Mr Miliband is worried that allowing Scottish Nationalist Party leader Nicola Sturgeon to take part in two of the debates is a major threat to Labour’s fading hopes north of the border. Veteran political inquisitor Jeremy Paxman has been tipped to host one of the programmes . Some Tory MPs have urged Mr Cameron to boycott the debates altogether on the grounds that with a superior personal rating in the polls to Mr Clegg or Mr Miliband, he has most to lose by debating with them live on television over three hours or more. Channel 4 and Sky TV, which have won the right to broadcast the Cameron versus Miliband clash, are reportedly planning to ‘empty chair’ the debate if the Prime Minister refuses to take part. That could make it tricky for Mr Miliband if he opts to appear on his own as he would face the prospect of being interrogated by new Channel 4 recruit, veteran political inquisitor Jeremy Paxman, who has been tipped to host the programme. Invitations to join the two debates of seven leaders will be sent to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg, Mrs Sturgeon, Ukip’s Nigel Farage, Green party leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. Northern Ireland’s Protestant-dominated Democratic Unionist Party has threatened legal action for being excluded. And if they win, it is certain to provoke similar demands from rival parties in Ulster.

"A Seaside town's plan to officially call a road Hitler's Walk has been scrapped after a flood of complaints. Mevagissey Parish Council agreed the drop the planned sign after it attracted widespread condemnation. The Jewish community had called on holidaymakers to boycott the town if the scheme went ahead. Decision reversed: Plans to officially rename a park in Mevagissey, Cornwall,  'Hitlers Walk' have been scrapped . The pathway, in Mevagissey, Cornwall, has been called Hitler's Walk unofficially for decades after an 'over-zealous park warden'. Old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints that the name was offensive. Last month it was announced that the council had ordered a new sign, but it has now been cancelled. The controversy began earlier this month when the parish council decided to reinstate the Hitlers Walk nameplates, which were removed by Restormel Borough Council in 2005 after complaints they were offensive. News of their decision came five days before the world marked the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp . Controversial: The old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints. Harvey Kurzfield, of Kehillat Kernow, which represents the Jewish community of Cornwall, branded their plans 'ludicrous' and said he was 'astonished and perplexed as to why anyone in this day and age would put up a sign like that'. But the council maintained that the sign was named after an over-officious 1930s park-keeper, and that the area - once called Cliff Park - had been referred to as Hitlers Walk ever since. Liberal Democrat MP for St Austell and Newquay, Stephen Gilbert, said: 'This plan has caused huge offence to many people as well as attracting national and international condemnation and coming on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps it couldn't have been more insensitive. 'I'm pleased that the parish council have abandoned the plan and I am sure that sentiment will be shared by everyone whose family, like mine, fought against the Nazis and all those who rightly remain horrified at the mass extermination of Jewish people, disabled people, gay people and others that Hitler is responsible for. 'Respect, humanity and decency has prevailed at the Parish Council and the plan has gone where it belongs, in the bin.' John Daniel, a councillor who supported the sign, reportedly told the Telegraph: 'The name goes back to a time before the war when whoever was in the charged of the park was a bit authoritarian. It's not offensive, it's just what local people call it.'

Book: The former mayor's father Harold Giuliani went to Sing Sing prison for a one-and-a-half years in 1934 after robbing a milkman at gunpoint, Barrett claims . This was a decade before his son, who later sought the 2008 GOP presidential nomination, was born. Harold Giuliani also allegedly 'broke legs, smashed kneecaps [and] crunched noses' when he served as a 'muscle' for a for a loansharking operation in the 1950s, and got in a Brooklyn gunfight in the 1960s, according to ABC. Direct links between the former mayor and organized crime, however, are hard to find, Barrett told ABC. 'I think Harold Giuliani went out of his way to protect his son from that environment. Rudy has said he was taught to hate the mob when he was growing up,' Barrett said. Giuliani, who was mayor of New York from 1994 through 2001, is credited for taking down organized crime and lowering crime in the city. He also is known for his great leadership in New York after the September 11 attacks. The former mayor has said that has missed his father every day since he died of prostate cancer in 1981. 'He taught me enormously important lessons, including the lesson of being honest, which I've practiced all my life,' Giuliani said when asked about the book in 2001. Barrett's book also reveals information about his romantic relationships with two women that eventually led to a public separation from his wife, Donna Hanover. Giuliani recently hit headlines after questioning President Barack Obama's love of the United States last week.

Giuliani says he is standing by his comments about  Obama and denies that the statements are rooted in racism. But he said he has received death threats - mainly in the form of voicemails - in the wake of the controversial comments. 'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words,' Giuliani told NBC Friday. 'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.' Giuliani told NBC that though he never meant to question the president's patriotism, he absolutely will not apologize for saying what he believes.

"Three-parent babies risk the future of the human race and put Britain at odds with EU law, politicians from across Europe have warned. MPs from Italy claim the 'human species as a whole' will be affected by the controversial technique, while MEPs in Brussels warn it violates 'human dignity and integrity of the person'. But ahead of a vote on the law in the House of Lords, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey dismissed the 'unfathomable' opposition and vowed to defy the Church's line to back the idea. Graphic shows how the three-parent baby process works. However critics argue there is a small risk of diseased mitochondria could be carried over too (point 4) MPs last month voted in favour of Britain becoming the first country in the world to permit the creation of IVF babies with genetic material from three different people, despite warnings from some experts warn it would be an 'historic mistake'. Scientists at Newcastle University have developed a way of swapping the mother-to-be's diseased mitochondria – the 'batteries' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman's egg. Supporters stress that mitochondrial DNA is 0.054 per cent of a person's overall DNA and none of the nuclear DNA which determines personal characteristics and traits. David Cameron backed the law change, insisting it was not 'playing God' but the chance to hep parents have a 'healthy and happy baby'. But some 50 MEPs have written to the Prime Minister calling for him to withdraw the legislation, which is due to be debated in the Lords. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is firmly in favour of three-parent babies . Slovakian MEP Miroslav Mikolásik has called on the European Commission to 'take steps' over Britain's 'lack of compliance' with EU law. In the letter he and 49 other MEPs said: 'We are writing to you to express our profound concern at the intention of the UK to permit the modification of the human genome. 'Your proposals violate the fundamental standards of human dignity and integrity of the person.' Meanwhile a group of Italian MPs have also called on the House of Lords to vote against the plans. In a letter to The Times, they warned the technique 'could have uncontrollable and unforeseeable consequences, affecting future generations and modifying genetic heritage in an irreversible way, inevitably affecting the human species as a whole'. The letter added: 'The greater part of the scientific community maintain that the scientific data currently available is insufficient to even consider intervention on human subjects, and there cannot therefore be any guarantee for the safety of any eventual off-spring'. However, supporters of the technique have rejected the idea that the global scientific community is opposed to mitochondrial donation. Lord Carey said he was surprised that Church of England in the Lords were preparing to support a delaying motion from the Roman Catholic peer Lord Deben. In an article in the Mail on Sunday, he said: 'It would be received by families as a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation, consultation, parliamentary discussion and scrutiny.' He added: 'Much opposition is coming from well-organised campaigns from Catholics from Latin America and Eastern Europe. But if we cannot make any alteration, then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions. 'Turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving. We live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work.' Mitochondrial donation would allow IVF babies to be born with DNA from three different people should be made legal. The technique involves replacing DNA in an egg in order to prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases. WHAT ARE MITOCHONDRIA? Mitochondria are tiny rod-like structures in cells which act as power houses, generating the energy that allows our bodies to function. Unusually, they have their own DNA, distinct from the genetic material within the cell nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) makes up about 0.1% of a cell's total DNA and does not affect individual characteristics such as appearance and personality. WHAT CAUSES MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? Harmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA can prevent the mitochondria working properly, resulting in a number of diseases some of which can be serious and life threatening. They may affect major organs and cause conditions ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting. HOW ARE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES PASSED ON? Children may inherit mitochondrial DNA defects from their mothers, but not their fathers. People with faulty mDNA can develop symptoms or be carriers of the condition without experiencing ill-effects themselves. WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION? Defective mDNA from a mother's egg can be replaced with healthy mDNA from a donor. This will then prevent the harmful mutations being inherited and passed onto future generations. WHAT ARE THE TECHNIQUES INVOLVED? There are two different procedures, one carried out before fertilisation and the other after. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves first removing the nuclear DNA from a donor egg whose mitochondria are healthy. The 'spindle' of chromosomes containing the mother's nuclear DNA is then taken from her egg and inserted into the donor egg. As a result, the donor egg is left with nuclear DNA from the mother and mDNA from the donor. This healthy egg is then fertilised and implanted into the mother's womb. Pronuclear Transfer (PT) is similar but in this case the mother's egg is fertilised first. Its nuclear DNA is then transferred to a fertilised donor egg, containing healthy mitochondria, whose own nuclear DNA has been removed. This healthy fertilised egg is then implanted. HOW SAFE IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION? Animal and laboratory experiments suggest that the procedures are safe, but no-one can say that the risk is zero. Three separate reviews by an expert panel convened by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology's Authority have found no evidence that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use. Critics argue that problems might only arise once the procedure is used to create human babies. For instance, replacing mDNA might have more of an impact on personal traits than had been envisaged. Unknown epigenetic effects, environmental influences that alter the way genes work, may also have serious consequences for the health of babies, it is claimed.","House of Lords to vote on babies being born using DNA from three people .

"Britain's brightest teenagers are most at risk of mental illness caused by smoking a potent form of cannabis . Britain’s brightest teenagers are among those most at risk of mental illness caused by smoking a potent form of cannabis, a leading expert has warned. Professor Sir Robin Murray said it tended to be ‘clever and sociable’ youngsters who were damaged by using the super-strong strain of the drug, known as skunk. Sir Robin, the foremost authority in Britain on the effects of smoking cannabis, led a landmark study with colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry which found that regularly smoking skunk triples the risk of psychosis, as revealed last week by The Mail on Sunday. Now he has given further alarming warnings after his study was published in full in The Lancet Psychiatry. Speaking yesterday, he said that: . Sir Robin said: ‘Twenty-five years ago, if parents, brothers or sisters of a patient with schizophrenia asked me: “Could it have had anything at all to do with the cannabis he smoked?”, I’d have said: “There’s no evidence that’s the case – don’t worry about it.” All the medical journals said cannabis was a safe drug. But now we know there are these risks.’ He said: ‘A lot of people who develop schizophrenia have had problems since they were children. Maybe they had more personality or cognitive difficulties than their brothers or sisters. But the ones who develop psychosis associated with cannabis, they tend to be people who were doing very well. ‘Their parents always say: “No I never worried about them at all – they had lots of friends, were good at school, good at sport.” ‘In some ways their problem was that they were so sociable: they were street-smart and could get cannabis when they were 13. ‘So it’s a different group of people who get psychotic as a result of cannabis: they were cleverer and more sociable before they got ill.’ People who had suffered a single psychotic episode – such as hallucinations or delusions – tended to get better if they gave up smoking skunk, with no long-term effects. Cannabis use was as big a health problem in the young as smoking cigarettes,' said Sir Robin . But, he said ‘sadly a proportion won’t recover’, adding: ‘A third of people with cannabis-induced schizophrenia don’t stop . . . people who persist in smoking cannabis have the worst outcomes. Someone who’s smoked regularly for five years, they don’t recover. It just looks like regular schizophrenia.’ Last week’s study concluded that 24 per cent of ‘first episode psychosis’ cases in South London were caused by smoking skunk. South London is a known cannabis hot-spot. But Sir Robin believed skunk was now widely available ‘across the country’, with research showing three people now smoked skunk for every individual smoking ‘old-fashioned’, weaker hash. Cannabis use was as big a health problem in the young as smoking cigarettes, he said. ‘It used to be that people started smoking cigarettes and then moved on to cannabis. Now, for increasing numbers, it’s the other way around.’ The drug had been ‘effectively decriminalised, at least in South London where I work’, he said, as the police ‘won’t arrest somebody simply because they have cannabis for their own use’. Increasing numbers of teenagers, wanting to stay on the right side of the law, are buying ‘legal highs’ off the internet. These chemicals, marketed as ‘spice’ or ‘incense’, are designed to mimic the effects of cannabis. But Sir Robin said they could be much more powerful than skunk. Users of ‘synthetic cannabinoids’ are far more likely to end up in A&E than those who smoke pot, according to Dr Adam Winstock of the Institute of Psychiatry. ‘Little 14-year-olds who’d like to experiment, but don’t want to do anything illegal, buy things off the internet that are legal, but also more potent,’ said Sir Robin. ‘It’s sad that some kid may end up taking something worse [than cannabis], by getting it in a brown-paper envelope through the post.’","'Clever and sociable' teens damaged by using super-strong skunk .

"An evangelical writer has had his latest book turned down by his Christian publishers after he revealed that he is gay. Brandan Robertson had signed a deal last year with Destiny Image to publish his book, Nomad: Not-So-Religious Thoughts On Faith, Doubt, And The Journey In Between. In January Robertson appeared in a TIME magazine article – Inside The Evangelical Fight Over Gay Marriage – in which he identified himself as a homosexual. Brandan Robertson had signed a deal last year with Destiny Image to publish his book, Nomad: Not-So-Religious Thoughts On Faith, Doubt, And The Journey In Between . Last week when he turned in his manuscript, he quickly received a reply from his publisher who had 'concerns' about his 'media attention'. He alleges that he was then asked to sign a statement that he does 'not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle'. Robertson, who is also a spokesperson for Evangelicals for Marriage Equality, refused to sign the statement, and days later he was contacted by the publisher again and told that his book had been dropped. According to Robertson, the publishers were concern that Christian retailers wouldn’t buy the book because of his public advocacy for gay and lesbian inclusion in Christian communities. Destiny Image had previously agreed to publish the book last year, with no advance payment, after Robertson submitted a proposal while still a student at the conservative Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. The book, described as a collection of essays on his personal spiritual journey from a fundamentalist to a progressive evangelical, makes only a glancing reference to homosexuality . Robertson, who is also a spokesperson for Evangelicals for Marriage Equality, refused to sign the statement that he does 'not condone, encourage, or accept the homosexual lifestyle' Don Nori of parent company Nori Media Group told TIME: 'We did not reject or refuse. As with all books, a publisher decides what is financially viable. 'We released the book back to the author with our sincere prayers for his success. This occurrence happens every season.' According to Robertson the incident illustrates a much larger problem that the evangelical community has with homosexuality. 'This is so symptomatic of what happens in the broader evangelical community—every day, LGBTQ individuals are told that they are no longer welcome in churches, are kicked out of homes, are fired from jobs, and forced in to reparative therapy by those who claim to represent Jesus.'","Brandan Robertson had signed a deal last year with Destiny Image to publish his book Nomad .

"An Air Force Reserve captain whose family believe she was sexually assaulted in Afghanistan killed herself using her handgun. Jamie Brunette, from Tampa, Florida, was found dead on February 9 by Tampa police in the back of her locked sedan near her apartment. It appears the 30-year-old killed herself with her Smith & Wesson .380 handgun, which she purchased about six months earlier according to police, reports the Tampa Tribune. Air Force Reserve Capt. Jamie Brunette was found dead on February 9 by Tampa police in the back of her locked Chrysler 200 sedan near her apartment . The news shocked her family as Brunette, who left active duty after 11 years last June and joined the Air Force Reserve, had not shown any signs of being suicidal . The news shocked her family as Brunette, who left active duty after 11 years last June and joined the Air Force Reserve, had not shown any signs of being suicidal and was in the middle of opening her new fitness business. 'She had so much going for her,' says Jackie Leverich, 40, Brunette's oldest sister. 'She was so full of hope and wonderment and passion and excitement for life.' To the outside world Brunette appeared happy -  the week before her death she was posting photos of her studio being built with the caption 'Doing work today!'. It was due to open in a few weeks time and Brunette was part owner/part instructor. But Leverich says she believes something traumatic happened to her sister in Afghanistan, saying the family noticed a change in Brunette on her return at her sister's wedding. 'She seemed upbeat,' says Leverich, 'but she wasn't really giving us a whole lot of detail about life and what was going on.' Brunette was in the middle of opening her new fitness business next month - pictured here on a bike outside the studio . Leverich says she suspects that her sister was sexually assaulted in Afghanistan - she does not have any proof, but believes there was an incident. 'I suspect she was assaulted, and she didn't feel comfortable reporting it for some reason and internalized the incident so she could finish her deployment, which she did with flying colors,' says Leverich. 'It's not anything she told me, just from talking with all her friends this past week, and piecing those things together. 'I am female active duty, 18 years in the Coast Guard. I am well aware of those issues, and that's my gut feeling.' The following year Brunette left active duty and opted for the Air Force Reserve. In June 2014, Brunette left active duty and opted for the Air Force Reserve . Air Force Lt. Col Kurt Spranger, her business partner  told the Tampa Tribune: 'I do not know the detail, but unequivocally I can say, yes, something happened, something that should never happen to a human,' says Spranger. 'Something happened and it was why she wanted to get out. So she wouldn't have to deploy again.' He said Brunettte had split with her boyfriend two weeks before her death, but she did not give any signs of being outwardly unhappy and was professional at all times. The Hillsborough County medical examiner's initial report states that Brunette had a 'long tobacco and alcohol abuse history' and was suffering from depression and anxiety. Her roommate said Brunette had confided in her that she was seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder from the VA and had been depressed. The VA, citing privacy issues, could not comment. A memorial page set up online has been inundated with comments. One user wrote: 'She was a wonderful, bright, positive, professional, Contingency Contracting Officer and Airmen.

"For most young people, turning 30 is seen as something of a landmark in life. But  Amy Caulton from Hatton, Derbyshire, has celebrated the milestone two years earlier, after giving birth to the child she thought she could never have and two healthy decades passing since her lifesaving kidney transplant. The 28-year-old had the transplant when she was nine and is now the proud mother of five-month-old Seth. Amy Caulton, 28, (right) from Hatton, Derbyshire, had a kidney transplant aged nine and for years she worried it would affect her ability to have a child. She and her partner Anthony (left) are now parents to a five-month-old boy called Seth (centre) Amy said: 'When I was growing up, I always wondered if I would be able to have a baby. 'I had to change all my medication before my fiance, Ant, and I could start trying, but even then I didn't know if I would get pregnant. 'Then it happened and I was over the moon. I think Seth is our little miracle. He's everything we wanted and more.' Even before Amy, who works at Sainsbury's, was born, doctors knew she might encounter renal problems in her life as it was clear on the hospital scans that her kidneys were small. Seth was born six weeks early . When she was seven-years-old, her details were added to the NHS Organ Donor Register and it took two years for a suitable match to become available. She said: 'My blood group is quite rare and that made it hard to find me a kidney. 'When I was little, I knew kids who were having their transplants just a few weeks after dialysis. 'For me, the wait was much, much longer. I don't think I was bothered at the time because I was young and obviously I didn't know the importance of the transplant. 'Now I'm a mum, I can't imagine how my own mum felt about it. She must have been so worried.' Amy received her donation from a young boy, who lost his life after being involved in an accident and many of his organs, including his other kidney, lungs and liver, were given to others. Amy said: 'He saved the lives of so many people, including mine. 'I will always feel indebted to the boy. He saved my life.' But Amy's problems didn't end after the transplant - during the six months after the operation, she developed infections and had to go back into hospital. She said: 'I think my mum and dad regretted the transplant for a while because I had not been so well on my dialysis but after about six months, things settled down and it was fantastic for me to say goodbye to the regular renal treatment.' Amy with her newborn baby Seth, who weighed just 4lb 8oz at birth . But although the procedure was successful, Amy was always left wondering if her condition would affect her ability to have children. She said: 'When I talked to my consultant at Derby about wanting a baby, he was very supportive. 'He said he would have to change some of the drugs I took and that I would have to wait three months for the other medication to leave my system before I could try and get pregnant. 'Anthony and I were really happy. Obviously, we had to be patient because getting the medication right was important but we were in no rush. Three months later, after Amy and Anthony had been given the green light to try for a baby, they received some wonderful news. Amy was pregnant and she says Anthony, a 33-year-old aircraft designer, was in complete shock at the news. At the 20-week scan, special attention was paid to Seth's kidneys to make sure that he was alright . She said: 'It was hilarious really. 'Ant and I had talked about just how long it might take me to get pregnant and I'd told him it could be a while. 'Obviously, because of my kidney transplant and all the medication I took, I thought it could take us at least a year. Luckily, that wasn't the case. 'I got pregnant straight away and I was so thrilled. It was everything we wanted.' Almost as soon as Amy revealed a positive pregnancy test, she was back seeing the renal team at the Royal Derby Hospital. Checks were immediately carried out on her kidney function and doctors were pleased with the results. Amy and Anthony fell pregnant almost immediately . After he was born at the Royal Derby Hospital, Seth was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit . She said: 'I was looked after so very well. It was wonderful to have so many scans and to see the baby growing normally. 'At the 20-week scan, special attention was paid to Seth's kidneys. I guess everyone wanted to be sure that he was alright.' Baby Seth was born six weeks early at the Royal Derby Hospital. He weighed a tiny 4lb 8oz and was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. She said: 'Having a kidney transplant could have stopped me from enjoying life but that has not been the case. 'I've done some wonderful things and my health issues have never got in the way. 'When I wanted Seth, the team at Derby were only too happy to support and help me. 'I don't know what the future holds, no-one does, but I'm so proud of what I have achieved and my son will know all about what I've been through when he's older.'","Amy Caulton from Hatton, Derbyshire, had kidney transplant aged nine .

"Swooping from the sky, all Synwell the lonely bird of prey really wants is to find a mate. But being one of the world’s biggest and most powerful owls, with a 5ft 6in wingspan and talons like scalpels, his advances might seem a little forceful. Woefully misguided too, as unfortunate victims of the eagle owl’s indiscriminate love bombing in a Cotswold market town can testify only too well. Take Sue Dunn, 70, a retired nurse who ended up with a broken arm after she caught Synwell’s enormous orange eyes one night when she tried to photograph him perched on a lamppost, hooting. Synwell the owl has been swooping down on frightened residents in Wotton-on-Edge in his search for a mate. Left, he lands on Graham Ellis in his garden and right, Sue Dunn, whose arm was broken by his wings . ‘He was making such a noise, so I went outside and shone my torch on him to try to get a picture,’ she said. ‘He didn’t seem to like that. He drew his wings up and took off – flying straight at me.’ She tried to run back to her house but while dodging the bird, which stands over 2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog, she tripped and fractured her right forearm as she broke her fall. ‘If he was being romantic, he should have gone to Specsavers. I had no time to run from him, he just dive-bombed me. He’s certainly got no fear of humans,’ she said. It is the latest in a series of incidents in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, involving Synwell, who was named after an area of the town by locals. Margaret Carruthers, 74, has been swooped on in the street, and her husband Robert, 66, was targeted outside their home. Mr Carruthers said: ‘We were so shocked by the incident that my wife won’t go outside the house now without taking an umbrella for defence. If he comes at you, there can be no warning.’ Despite his misadventures, Synwell has become so popular since he took up residence two years ago that residents have created a Facebook page for him to record sightings, incidents and photographs – and he has amassed 457 followers. Of course, some can’t resist posting updates about the twit-twooer on Twitter too. Eagle owls are found all over Europe, but are rarely seen in Britain. They have been known in captivity in this country since at least the 17th century, says the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and remain popular with falconers and collectors. The owl perched atop a tree in the Gloucestershire village. Synwell has left other residents with claw marks on their foreheads and in fear of being swooped upon . But dozens of eagle owls, which feed on small mammals but can be trained to kill foxes, escape every year. Synwell has tags on his legs and is thought to have been born in captivity before escaping or being abandoned. Experts say that explains why he seems so eager to get to grips with humans. Jemima Parry-Jones, from the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Newent in the Forest of Dean, said: ‘Captive birds think their mother was human, so new humans are potential partners, hence it flies at them. ‘He’s not actually attacking, but he’s a big bird with dirty great talons, so it’s certainly a nerve-racking experience if he takes a sudden fancy to you.’ The centre is keen to rescue the bird, if the town approves. But support for Synwell is so strong that even Mrs Dunn bears him no ill-feeling, although her husband Alex has bought a sonic scarer to deter him from further visits. ‘If he is looking for love, he’s certainly taking bold risks,’ she said. ‘A lot of people are concerned he might get hurt if someone takes the law into their own hands.’ For Graham and Glenys Ellis, both 67, Synwell is a welcome visitor. Mrs Ellis can even call him down by mimicking his hoots – although her husband always steps in at the last second so the owl lands on him (pictured above). Mr Ellis said: ‘He does a little tap dance then flies off again. I’m not frightened of him, he’s beautiful.’ Others, however, have wondered what might happen if Synwell swooped on a small child. His Facebook page also contains warnings about his behaviour. ‘Do not leave the house if the owl is out! He just swooped at me as I walked down my drive,’ posted Samii Buckland. ‘Claw marks on my head!’","Synwell the owl has swooped on several residents in Wotton-under-Edge .

"Disposable contact lenses have been developed which mimic the surface of the eye – making them the most comfortable yet, according to wearers. They have been created specially for middle-aged people who have trouble reading but have been put off wearing contacts because they irritate the eyes by drying them out. The lenses are made of a new material called HyperGel which has the same water content as the cornea and double that of standard silicone contacts. Scroll down for video . Comfy: A new kind of contact lenses which mimic the surface of the eye and said to be the most comfortable yet are to be marketed specially for middle-aged people who have trouble reading . The Biotrue lenses are also breathable, allowing for 93 per cent transmission of oxygen, just short of the 100 per cent available to the open eye. It all means they not do dry out the eyes as much and become uncomfortable for wearers. The contacts were engineered for people with presbyopia – age-related loss of focus, which affects more than half of adults over 40. The condition occurs when the crystalline lens of the eye ages and loses flexibility. As a result, those with the condition might have to hold newspapers or restaurant menus further away to read them easily. But older people are less likely to wear contacts to correct their vision because their eyes tend to be drier. London-based contact lens optician Wendy Sethi said the Biotrue lenses, which are available on the high street, help avoid dehydration of the eye, with less than 2 per cent of water lost during a day’s wear. ‘It makes them extremely comfortable to wear and the whole process less daunting,’ she said. ‘I had a man in his 50s – a first-time contact lens wearer – in my practice today who said he could not feel them at all.’ Francesca Marchetti, an optometrist and adviser to WINK, an independent eye-care panel supported by Bausch + Lomb, makers of the new lenses, said the one-a-day, disposable contacts have added hygiene advantages. Reusable, soft contacts must be cleaned and disinfected after every use to prevent a build-up of bacteria and proteins. The new contacts cost between £40 and £60 a month, depending on individual practitioners’ prices.","Biotrue contact lenses have the same water content as the human cornea .

"Tory MP Fiona Bruce is attempting to stop 'femicide' - the termination of pregnancies if the mother finds that she is expecting a girl . MPs will mount a bid tomorrow to make it a criminal offence to abort a child on the grounds of gender. The move, being spearheaded by Tory MP Fiona Bruce, is an attempt to stop ‘femicide’ – the termination of pregnancies if the mother finds that she is expecting a girl. Campaigners say that the practice is well established in some ethnic minority communities in the UK, where a greater value is traditionally placed on a male child. Mrs Bruce has tabled an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill which would ‘put beyond doubt’ that it should be a prosecutable offence for a doctor in the UK to abort a baby on the basis of gender. The MP, who claims wide cross-party support for the measure, says the reform is required because in 2012 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge two doctors who were caught agreeing to abort female babies. The then Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said the law did not ‘in terms, expressly prohibit gender-specific abortions’. Tomorrow’s debate will be a free vote, allowing MPs to ‘follow their consciences’ on the matter. When the issue was put to a non-binding vote last November it was passed by 181 votes to one. In support of her move, Mrs Bruce points to university research which has found evidence of a shortage of girl babies in some ethnic minority communities. She says that women have come forward to say that they were kicked and punched repeatedly in the stomach by husbands trying to cause a miscarriage if they were carrying girl babies. Last night, Mrs Bruce was backed by her Conservative colleague Nadine Dorries, who said: ‘In some cultures and religions, the birth of a girl child is a birth of shame. There are reports of women being coerced and forced with the threat of violence into aborting their daughters. ‘There are even stories of women too afraid to leave hospital and return home with a baby daughter. The debate in the House of Commons will be a free vote, allowing MPs to ‘follow their consciences’ on the matter . ‘Some of the mothers are victims of their own upbringing and they believe themselves, and any female child they bear, to be of less value than a male.’ Mrs Dorries added: ‘Labour-supporting websites, publications and prominent figures have this week been calling for MPs to vote the amendment down. But if the vote goes our way there will be young women everywhere who will have no idea that their life once hung in the balance.’ The amendment is also backed by Labour’s Indian-born Virendra Sharma, MP for Ealing Southall. He said that a ‘legal framework’ was needed to send a clear signal to those families where pressure is put on pregnant women to terminate according to gender.","MP Fiona Bruce spearheading attempt to stop 'femicide' of unborn girls .

"A BBC reporter has revealed her battle with skin cancer after becoming addicted to tanning and using sunbeds. Laura McMullan has now called for high street sunbed shops to be banned after a new programme hosted by the reporter branded them as harmful as cigarettes and alcohol. The 39-year-old, who carried out the investigation for BBC1, believes it was her over-tanning that caused the disease. BBC reporter Laura McMullan, who has revealed her battle with skin cancer after claiming she became addicted to tanning and using sunbeds. She is pictured after receiving her diagnosis of malignant melanoma . In the episode of the BBC investigative show Inside Out, to be broadcast on Monday, Miss McMullan walks 19-year-old Jess through the dangers of sunbed usage. Jess works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services. Miss McMullan said: 'I just wanted to shake her and say 'Please, don't keep doing this'. She looks beautiful on the outside but underneath, who knew what damage she was doing to herself. The worst skin to go underneath sunbeds or in the sun is pale skin and blue eyes, which is what she's got. She's a carbon copy of me when I was 19. We didn't know before we started how much damage she had done but I really wanted to make her think.' Miss McMullan was inspired to make the film for the BBC after recovering from her own cancer, which was diagnosed in February last year. She was determined to educate people on the dangers of using sunbeds and of tanning in general. She said: 'You read the papers and you hear peoples' stories that they spend thousands a month on tanning. I read one article from a girl who said that even if she got skin cancer she would still go on sunbeds. Miss McMullan, pictured before being diagnosed with skin cancer, says she first started using sunbeds at the age of 16 and soon became addicted to having a tan . 'If she could go through one day of what I've been through she would totally take that comment back. People don't think of skin cancer as a serious type of cancer, they think they can just get it cut out and move on, you go through hell. 'I really, really, really want to hit home to people that just for the sake of a tan, you are risking your life.' Miss McMullan first began using sunbeds at the age of 16, when her family would hire a home sunbed once every three weeks for about a week at a time. It triggered a 20-year addiction to tanning, for ten of which she was using sunbeds almost daily. After being diagnosed with skin cancer and now being in recovery, pictured, Miss McMullan always covers up, even on the beach on holiday . She said: 'I'm convinced it started was when my older brother had hired a sunbed at home, we used to have them brought to the house and dropped off. I thought I would just pop under and have a go. 'It was one where you put it over your bed and you hop in and you do one side and then the other side and I just thought 'this is lovely and warm and I've got a bit of a glow'. 'I believe UV rays do promote serotonin, which is a happy hormone. I've always been pale growing up, I think you just try it one and you like it, you try it again and you like it and you do it more and more. I really was addicted, you just can't buy that feeling in a tonic. 'You start to see yourself in the mirror and think you like to have a healthy glow. I eventually thought I didn't look like me anymore when I was pale, so I kept on going.' She hopes her report will help educate others on the dangers and allow them to avoid the mistakes she made. She added: 'It was never pointed out by a professional person or anyone who worked in the tanning salons or who dropped the sunbeds off at home but my mum used to say to me 'Laura, what damage are you doing to your skin?' 'My dad is pale too and he would tell me I would damage my skin in years to come but it just made me feel good and when I started working on the radio I was office based and I had a lunch hour every day and I would pop off to use a sunbed in my lunch hour. 'My colleagues used to say: 'Laura, what are you doing?' It was standing joke at work, whenever I went on holiday, they would ask 'What shade are you aiming for?' and I would say mahogany. Lots of people around me were saying things but it took me getting a devastating diagnosis for me to actually stop and for it to hit home. 'I'm not blaming anybody, I chose to do that but what I have got an issue with is that I was never given an informed choice. 'Not once in all the ten years I was using tanning beds did anyone ever say to me, you've got pale skin and blue eyes be careful what you do with your skin, or that if you do too much you might get skin cancer. 'There was no warning signs in the shop of anything. A lot more education is needed, especially with young people.' With more than 11,000 new cases of malignant melanoma in the UK each year, Miss McMullan believes tanning salons are a significant contributor to this. The BBC Midlands reporter has now carried out an investigation for BBC1, where she looks into the dangers of tanning. She is pictured receiving a spray tan after recovering from skin cancer . Official guidance across the EU sets a maximum UV intensity to be used by commercial sunbeds. This figure must be adhered to by all members of the UK Sunbed Association. However, with only 20 per cent of the industry affiliated to this body, Miss McMullan thinks it would be safer for sunbeds to be banned entirely until a tougher regulatory system is put in place. Research funded by Cancer Research UK revealed that out of 400 sunbeds tests, 90 per cent had UV light intensities exceeding the EU recommended limit, sometimes up to double. Miss McMullan added: 'It's like cigarettes and alcohol, people have their vices. Cigarettes come with a health warning, so does alcohol but sunbeds don't and I totally think they are on par. It's a hot topic of discussion but I totally think sunbeds should at least come with a warning that they can cause cancer. 'Some people will say if you use them responsibly you will be fine but sunbeds are so open to abuse and the majority of them are not regulated. During her programme for the BBC, Miss McMullan meets 19-year-old Jess, pictured, who works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services . During the show, the pair visit Staffordshire University, where Jess's skin is analysed to see how much tanning is affecting her face . 'So, if there was a proper regulation and licencing program then that would be great but until then, and that's a long way off, I would like to see them banned.' This is a call echoed by Deemesh Oudit, a skin cancer expert and Miss McMullan's consultant. He told the BBC1 programme: 'I would definitely like to see sunbeds banned. Because the UV radiation has a significant risk of patients developing melanoma [skin cancer].' And speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'As a consultant at The Christie [cancer centre], I see first-hand the harm that UV radiation does to the skin and the impact that melanoma has on patients. Sadly, despite our best efforts, many people do not survive melanoma. 'Therefore, I believe there is a strong case for sunbed use to be controlled more strongly and personally would like to see them prohibited.' But Gary Lipman, chairman of the Sunbed Association, said: 'Our members have followed a strict Code of Practice for more than 20 years with requirements that exceed the current calls for extended legislation which The Sunbed Association was a full participant in and which we fully support. A computer analysis of Jess's skin shows how much it has aged through using sunbeds as part of the BBC1 programme . 'When interviewed by Laura McMullan, I provided her with the evidence that clearly demonstrated there is categorically no scientific data to support a link between professional sunbed use and melanoma, it is purely and simply a statistically skewed myth. 'Responsible sunbed use in a salon in membership of the Sunbed Association is an entirely safe way to tan for those people who can tan and want to tan. 'The research about sunbeds emitting higher intensity levels was conducted in 2011 which was around the same time that the new emission level regulation came into effect. If that research was undertaken today the results would be completely different. We know this as fact from our own research covering thousands of sunbeds, activity undertaken by local authorities and the fact that compliant sunbeds tube sales have risen by more than 500 per cent.' The episode of BBC Inside Out featuring Miss McMullan's report will be broadcast on Monday at 7.30pm on BBC One (West Midlands). It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.","BBC reporter Laura McMullan first started using sunbeds at the age of 16 .

"Explosive scenes: Dame Helen Mirren plays the Queen in the Broadway production of The Audience . It is one of the most extraordinary confrontations in recent British political history. The Queen pleads with Tony Blair to call off the planned 2003 invasion of Iraq in a fraught private audience at Buckingham Palace, imploring him to seek a diplomatic solution from the United Nations. But with British forces poised to join the US in bombing and ground assaults the next day, he says: ‘The right thing to do is to go in now, and go in hard.’ This explosive scene is in a new Broadway production of controversial play The Audience, with Dame Helen Mirren as the Queen. Publicity material for the play says it will ‘break the contract of silence’ around private audiences between the Queen and her Prime Ministers. It describes the meetings as both ‘intimate’ and ‘explosive’. It’s the first time Blair has been in the play, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Daldry. It ran in London depicting meetings with seven Prime Ministers including Churchill and David Cameron. Royal experts denounced a scene suggesting the Queen had a negative view of the invasion. She asks Blair: ‘You don’t want to give it more time?’ A defiant Prime Minister says it will lead to the overthrow of a tyrant and the creation of democracy, saying: ‘We confidently predict liberated Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign.’ Blair refers to bombing taking place ‘tomorrow’, placing the alleged meeting on March 19, 2003, the day before the Allies launched their ‘shock and awe’ campaign. But the court circular, which lists the Queen’s official engagements, makes no reference to the meeting. The discrepancy will increase pressure on Morgan to justify claims in the play, which premiered in London in 2013 and is to return to the capital this year. The playwright, now working on a £100 million blockbuster about the Royal Family called The Crown, has never revealed his sources, saying much of it was based on ‘anecdotal information’. He said: ‘If transcripts exist, I’m confident she’d emerge with credit.’ But historian and constitutional expert Andrew Roberts last night said: ‘The idea the Queen would oppose the war because she is the Left-wing conscience of the nation is rubbish. It is easy for playwrights to impose Left-wing views on the Queen, secure they will not be denounced.’ Private chats: The Queen with Mr Blair  in 2002 - the year before the Allies launched their campaign in Iraq . The scene is controversial because Britain’s case for war, including Blair’s close relationship with President George W Bush, the ‘dodgy dossier’ of evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and the legal advice of former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, are all under scrutiny in the long-delayed Chilcot Inquiry. Roberts said last night: ‘There is no sense the Queen would be with people opposing the Iraq War on the streets. BLAIR: We confidently predict that liberate Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign . QUEEN: [pleading] You don’t want to give it more time? Just get back to the United Nations and see that a diplomatic solution can be reached . BLAIR: [insistent] No ma’am, the right thing to do is go in now, and go in hard . 'She would have intelligence reports people demonstrating on the streets wouldn’t have. She is close to the Armed Services. Her family understands military dangers.’ Constitutional expert Professor Vernon Bogdanor, who advised on the original production, said the Queen prized the confidential meetings and would probably distance herself from anyone who betrayed a confidence. But he called the play’s depictions of the audiences as highly plausible, as was the idea the Queen could ask a question about Iraq. He said: ‘I think her manner is to ask questions rather than to argue. ‘She might have asked, do you not think it a good idea to go to the UN? He might have said no. But I think Mr Blair would have been more deferential.’ Royal biographer Penny Junor said: ‘I suspect the Queen would voice concerns. That’s what she’s there for.’ It is not clear if the scene will be in the London revival this year, with Kristin Scott Thomas in the title role. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Tony Blair. Morgan and Daldry were unavailable for comment.","Explosive exchange is in new Broadway production of play The Audience .

"The Orthodox Jewish tradition known as oral suction circumcision reaches back to biblical times but it has created a modern-day dilemma for New York City health officials, who have linked it to 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000. Two died and two others suffered brain damage. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration, which came into power a year ago with a promise to reconsider an existing regulation on the ritual, is now negotiating with a group of rabbis over how to protect children's health while still preserving religious freedom. 'The talks are ongoing but I cannot go into particulars,' said Avi Fink, the mayor's deputy director of intergovernmental affairs who has been leading the talks. 'Our goal is to achieve awareness of the risks.' Tradition: Abraham Romi Cohn is handed a scalpel during the bris, or ritual circumcision, of Yosef Sananas in New York. Officials in the city are negotiating with Orthodox Jews over oral-circumcision, which has been linked to 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000 . Such oral suction circumcisions are relatively rare, even in New York City, which is home to more than a million Jews — the largest Jewish population outside Israel. City health officials estimate more than 3,000 babies are circumcised each year using the oral suction method — formally called metzitzah b'peh in Hebrew. A 2012 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised against the practice, saying it increases the risk of herpes infection in baby boys by 3.4 times that of other male newborns. Oral suction circumcisions first came under scrutiny during Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, and the city's health board voted in 2012 to regulate the practice by asking a parent or guardian to sign a consent form indicating possible risks. Health officials point to a number of factors they say have linked the known cases to the ritual. They look for lesions on the genitalia, indicating that's where the virus started. In addition, lab tests have showed that the timing of the infection coincides with the circumcision. Two cases were recorded after oral suction in 2013 and four last year. In the most recent case, diagnosed in November, a baby boy was found to have lesions on his penis. But of those six cases, parents refused to identify the person who performed the circumcision — called a mohel — in four. Precaution: Cohn uses mouthwash as an antiseptic before performing a bris. Mayor Bill De Blasio's administration is negotiating a medical protocol following concern over the practice . In the two cases in which the circumcisers were identified, both declined to be tested, the Health Department said. They were banned from performing the ritual. The consent forms remain the regulatory standard for now, but most ultra-Orthodox rabbis have told their faithful not to comply, and the city acknowledges it does not collect them unless there is suspicion of herpes. Cohn, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor and native of what today is called Slovakia, is chairman of the American Board of Ritual Circumcision, which has certified 90 mohels, says he doubts the oral suction method had anything to do with spreading herpes. Cohn believes the infants may have been infected by the mother or another source. 'They're wild accusations without any basis,' Cohn said. 'I've done 35,000 circumcisions and never had an infection, of any kind.' The rabbi does warn parents that circumcision, in general, has its risks, just like any medical procedure. His association mandates herpes testing and rinsing with mouthwash before the ceremony, in addition to scrubbing and sterilizing hands. The rabbi followed those precautions one morning at Brooklyn's Congregation Shaare Zion, where he circumcised week-old Yosef Sananas. Cohn first administered a topical anesthetic, wrapping gauze around the child's legs to isolate the sterilized area. Then the baby, on a white pillow, was carried into the main worship space. Invited guests watched as Cohn did what he's done thousands of other times. Concerns: The rabbi does warn parents that circumcision, in general, has its risks, just like any medical procedure . 'He's the best mohel in New York,' says the boy's mother, Becky Sananas. 'We chose him because we trust him.' While New York City wrestles with the issue, suburban Rockland County — itself home to thousands of Orthodox Jews — seems to have found a solution. For any suspected case after circumcision, county health officials use DNA testing to try to link a baby with the source of infection. Since the county introduced the protocol in 2013, three infant boys were diagnosed with herpes; the DNA of two mohels did not match the boys' and the third test was inconclusive. Members of the Jewish community participate voluntarily in the process, working with Dr. Oscar Alleyne, Rockland's director of epidemiology. 'That proves that they trust us,' Alleyne said. 'We have cooperation, along with a scientific approach.'","Health officials say 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000 have been linked to the tradition, which dates back to biblical times .

"John Prescott is to make a surprise comeback to the political frontline, after Ed Miliband called on the bruiser to 'bash heads together'. Despite Lord Prescott frequently criticising Mr Miliband's party handling, he is to become the Labour leader's special adviser on climate change. The appointment of Lord Prescott, who once punched a voter on the campaign trail, comes just weeks before the general election amid claims Mr Miliband is at 'logger-Eds' with his shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Ed Miliband has sparked surprise by recalling John Prescott (pictured) to the political frontline - despite the former Deputy Prime Minister's previous criticism of the Labour leader's Election strategy . The decision to call on Lord Prescott ahead of the general will be seen as an attempt to turn the clock back to when Labour used to win elections. The move was backed by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, who also pledged to join the effort to get Mr Miliband elected. The involvement of senior figures from the last decade contrast with Mr Miliband's repeated claims to have moved on from the New Labour era. The Labour leader said that he wanted to exploit Lord Prescott's experience in negotiating the landmark Kyoto Protocol in the run-up to a crucial United Nations summit in Paris at the end of the year. Writing in The Observer, he said: 'His abilities and experience, as one of the architects of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, must be used at this critical time for our future and there is no one better than John at bashing heads together to get a deal.' However, it raises the prospect of him playing a high profile role during the election campaign. Douglas Alexander, Labour's election co-ordinator, told Sky News: 'I fully expect that as well as that policy role, he will continue to support the Labour campaign in the months ahead and I welcome that.' However, just months ago Lord Prescott launched a scathing attack on Mr Miliband's 'too timid' approach to winning in May. Lord Prescott said: 'He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech, 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition.' The Labour leadership is in the grip of a crisis, amid claims of deep divisions between Mr Miliband and Mr Balls. The Labour leadership is in the grip of a crisis, amid claims of deep divisions between Ed Balls and Ed Miliband . Tensions have mounted over how to pay for Mr Miliband's flagship pledge to cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000. A meeting last week designed to thrash out how to fund the plan 'did not end well', according to a report in the Sunday Times. Problems at the top are now so bad that Labour MPs refer to ""the Ed aches"" or the two leaders being ""at logger-Eds"". Mr Miliband is now being urged to ditch Mr Balls from the key economic brief if he wins the election to prevent a repeat of the deeply damaging clashes between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government. ""They don't like each other and they don't respect each other,"" another insider said. A new poll for The Observer put the Tories ahead in an Opinium survey for the first time in three years .

Tory hopes of an Election victory were boosted last night as a second opinion poll in under a week put them ahead of Labour. The survey sees David Cameron's party rise two points to 35 per cent, with Labour on 33. Ukip are on 15, the Greens on seven and Lib Dems on six. It's the first time in three years that pollsters Opinium have put them ahead of Ed Miliband's party, and follows an ICM survey last week which gave the Tories a four-point lead over Labour.","Former Deputy PM brought in to advise Miliband on climate change policy .

"Ministry of Defence scientists have been exploring the possible use of Ebola as a biochemical weapon, newly released documents confirm. Staff at the MoD's research centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have been assessing the risk of the virus being used by terrorists such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda to attack the UK. The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that scientists have been looking into at least three potential scenarios . Bio weapon: Ministry of Defence scientists have been assessing the risk of the Ebola virus being used by terrorists such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda to attack the UK . The request from an unnamed source was for Porton Down staff to provide 'guidance on the feasibility and potential impact of a non-state actor exploiting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.' Three potential scenarios are outlined in the document, marked 'UK secret UK eyes only', although the details are withheld. No information is provided regarding the first scenario, and the only detail revealed about the second scenario is that it would be both logistically and technically challenging for a non-state group to undertake'. Following the blacked-out scenario, the team concludes: 'Clearly there are practical issues involved with such a scenario that of themselves are often not insurmountable but taken together add enormously to the complexity of successfully undertaking this attack.' A third, also heavily redacted, scenario 'constitutes the most technically challenging of the scenarios considered here', The Observer reports. Porton Down: The site in Wiltshire has been the centre of the UK's chemical weapons research for 100 years . This comes after yesterday's report  that the nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa. Ebola is virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. Ebola spreads via direct contact  with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. The incubation period is 2 to 21 days, but the humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms. First symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. People remain infectious as long as their blood and body fluids, including semen and breast milk, contain the virus. The current outbreak in west Africa is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. There have been more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but two potential candidates are undergoing evaluation. Source: World Health Organization . Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics having their 'fitness to practise' assessed by regulators. According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported. In theory, if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards, they could be 'struck off'. Last year's outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has been recorded as the worst in known history with 22,894 cases and 9,177 deaths reported around the globe so far. A majority of confirmed cases have been found in Guinea, Libera and Sierra Leone, with the latter the worst affected, with 10,934 cases to date, according to the World Health Organisation. The steep decline in case numbers has leveled off over the past month and the development is a cause for concern, the WHO said this week. The United Nations has said ten times fewer people are being diagnosed with Ebola each week than in September. Over the past four weeks, however, the line of the graph has flattened out, with the rate around 120 to 150 new cases a week. Health officials have expressed optimism in recent weeks that the tide seems to be turning in the fight against the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. The presidents of the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, this week said they hope to reduce the number of new cases to zero by April 15. MailOnline has contacted the Ministry of Defence for comment.","Scientists at MoD research centre explored use of Ebola as bio weapon .

"MPs and ministers are preaching the public about the need to eat healthily while helping to chomp through 100,000 chocolate bars in Parliament every year. Kit Kats, Twix bars and Snickers are revealed as the biggest sellers in the cafes, shops and bars in the Houses of Parliament, with almost 200,000 sales of confectionery and sweets in the last two years. Health campaigners raised concerns about the 'astronomical amount' of chocolate sold by lawmakers and their staff. New figures show how in 2013 and 2014 almost 200,000 chocolate bars were sold, including 40,000 Kit Kats, 23,300 Twix and 18,200 Snickers bars . David Cameron once railed against shops selling cheap chocolate at their checkouts, blaming He WH Smith for fuelling the obesity crisis with half-price Chocolate Oranges instead of real oranges. The Prime Minister has also spoken of his battle with his own weight, moving to cut out bread to shed the pounds. And just last week he suggested obese people should be refused out-of-work benefits. But details have emerged of the scale of the chocolate addiction in the corridors of power. Information on sales of chocolate and sweets in the Houses of Parliament were released under Freedom of Information laws. In 2013 and 2014 there were 199,966 items of confectionery sold, according to the Sunday Times. More Kit Kats were sold than any other snack, totalling more than 39,000 in two years, including almost 2,000 Kit Kat Chunkys and more than 3,100 dark chocolate versions. The second most popular was Twix, selling more than 23,300, followed by Snickers (18,235), Maltesers (14,150) and Mars bars (13,916). Crunchies, Galaxy, Bounty bars, Yorkies and Picnics complete the top 10 most popular chocolate bars in Parliament.. Health campaigners said politicians should 'lead by example' and not indulge in so much chocolate . Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum charity, said the 'astronomical amount' of sweets and chocolate sold in Parliament suggested politicians had a sugar habit 'that should be kicked in the can'. He told the Sunday Times that 'nobody should be denied a treat', but added: 'This is no example to give the electorate. Members of parliament should lead by example.' A letter sent to every MP and peer last year ordered them to measure their waistline in an attempt to get Parliament to set an example to the nation. They were urged to check that their waist is less than half their height - a key indicator of having a healthy weight. Former surgeon Lord McColl of Dulwich stalks the corridors of power to put pressure on Labour, Tory and Lib Dem members who he accuses of 'eating too much of the gross national product'. Lord McColl said overweight politicians could not be seen lecturing the public on their eating habits. 'I think the whole nation is at fault. We have got to get the whole nation moving on this. 'It looks bad if politicians are telling the people what to do and they are not doing it themselves.' A Commons spokesman said: 'The House of Commons is keen to promote healthy eating to all those who work on or visit the estate and who use the catering facilities. 'For example, at our 'Wellbeing Day' events healthy eating is strongly promoted. Our menus rate dishes for fat content using a traffic light system.'","New figures reveal chocolate sales inside the Houses of Parliament .

"Elaine Rhoades had to be taken to hospital by ambulance after she suffered 'broken heart syndrome' following a day filming death scenes . When actress Elaine Rhoades spent the day repeatedly filming a goodbye scene with her son on her character's deathbed, she never expected the emotional stress would have an impact on her personal life. But the next morning the mother-of-four from Epsom in Surrey, was rushed to hospital in an ambulance with a life threatening condition known as 'broken heart syndrome.' The condition, which causes the heart to stop beating is often caused by someone suffering a period of intense stress or grief. It can be fatal because the syndrome can lead to heart attacks. Ms Rhoades spent five days in intensive care and had to have blood thinning treatment before she was well enough to leave. 'It's very odd why it should happen,' Ms Rhoades told the Sunday Mirror. 'They said it was like I'd had a major trauma or massive shock. Doctors can't really explain it.' The 53-year-old had been filming scenes for C.O.O.L.I.O in which she plays a gangster's mother. She appears in the film alongside Kellie Maloney, who plays herself as a boxing promoter. Ms Maloney filmed the scenes before she started sex change surgery. Ms Rhoades said she had tried to get into the emotion of the scene by imagining how she would feel if she was forced to say goodbye to her own son. She added: 'I pretty much spent the whole day dying, to get the take right.' The actress was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting in south west London by ambulance and doctors told her she could have died from the condition. Rhoades was filming scenes for C.O.O.L.I.O when the next day she had to be rushed to hospital . They were also surprised she had managed to survive the night after filming without going to hospital. Around 6,000 people each year suffer heart attacks which are believed to have been caused by broken heart syndrome. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the medical term for broken heart syndrome. It is a temporary heart condition that affects people who have suffered intense grief or emotional stress. It is thought a temporary rush of stress hormones can weaken the heart muscle and cause the arteries to constrict. The condition causes a weakening of the heart muscle, affecting its ability to beat - making it known as 'broken heart syndrome.' Symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath. It affects women more than men. The syndrome is different from a heart attack which is caused by a complete or near blockage of the arteries to the heart. The syndrome is different from a heart attacks because blood flow is reduced.","Elaine Rhoades spent the day filming emotional death scenes for film .

"Islamic State has acquired a cache of deadly chemical weapons in Libya which pose a significant threat to European security, a British expert has warned. According to Middle East reports, the terror group has unconfirmed quantities of sarin and mustard gas after defeating government forces in southern and central Libya. Former British Army officer Hamish de Bretton-Gordon told The Mail on Sunday that the weapons remain dangerous, even though they are likely to be ten years old, and in a degraded state. Mr de Bretton-Gordon based his warning on President Assad’s use of one tonne of sarin in Ghouta, Syria, in August 2013, which killed as many as 1,000 people. Islamic State has acquired a cache of deadly chemical weapons in Libya, an expert warned. Pictured, shells contained mustard gas near the southern Libyan town of Waddan in 2011 . Speaking from the Gulf, where he advises the Iraqi government on chemical weapons, he said: ‘We saw what a single ton of not very good quality sarin did in Ghouta. ‘While we don’t know how much IS has acquired, and though the Libyan sarin dates back to the Gaddafi era, it would still have a toxicity and pose a danger. ‘Libya is virtually Europe and so the fear factor from a European perspective is huge. I should think the security forces will be watching this situation very closely.’ IS has used chlorine as a weapon in Iraq and has acquired significant expertise in chemical warfare from those who previously developed chemical weapons for Saddam Hussein.

"An important announcement on the way cancer can be diagnosed is due today – that will hopefully pave the way for simple blood tests to replace painful biopsies. Scientists at Stanford University in California have long been trying to develop a pill that makes cancer cells release certain proteins into the blood. In theory, those proteins would then be detected using a quick and easy blood test. It is hoped the drug will be sensitive enough to work on even the earliest cancer cells. Diagnostic breakthrough: Researchers at Stanford University are trying to develop a pill that will help detect cancer by releasing certain proteins into the bloodstream if tumours are present . The latest research by John Ronald and Sanjiv Gambhir is to be published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Two years ago, the scientists presented early results from their research at the World Molecular Imaging Congress. They said at the time:‘We envision a powerful new cancer management paradigm that involves tumour detection via an initial blood-based assay, tumour localisation via molecular-genetic imaging and tumour treatment.’ Such a test would detect the cancer cells released by tumours into the blood. Scientists know that these unique cells are there, but the volumes are so small that so far have found it difficult to detect them. The Stanford team’s approach involves giving people a drug containing circular pieces of DNA which are to break into tumour cells. The DNA - called minicircles - prompts the cancerous cells to secrete a specific protein into the bloodstream. Breast exam: Any tests of the drug are likely to be initially targeted at those known to be at risk of cancer . Their conference paper in 2013 said: ‘We have developed tumour-specific mini-circles [of DNA] that drive the expression of secretable alkaline phosphatase or firefly luciferase [proteins], and validated them for detecting tumours. ‘These can be assayed via serum and non-invasive imaging to differentially identify tumour-bearing from normal subjects. ‘Importantly, they should have broad applicability in many patient populations ... across many different tumour types.’ Such tests would most likely be initially targeted at people known to be at risk of cancer.","It is hoped the drug will be sensitive to work on the earliest cancer cells .

"A beluga whale who was on loan to under-fire SeaWorld has died after fracturing his jaw during an 'interaction' with two other whales and later contracting an infection, it has emerged. Nanuq, who was around 31 or 32 years old, entertained millions of visitors at the firm's Orlando, Florida, theme park  while on a long-term breeding loan from Canada's Vancouver Aquarium. But during a recent encounter with two of the three beluga whales he lived with, the 2200lbs marine creature suffered a fractured jaw. He later developed an infection and passed away on Thursday. Although Nanuq had been undergoing treatment for the infection at the time of his death, a post-mortem examination has been arranged to confirm the cause. The results are expected in weeks.

During a recent encounter with two of the three beluga whales he lived with, Nanuq (pictured) suffered a fractured jaw. He later developed an infection and passed away on Thursday . It comes just a month after SeaWorld's chief executive resigned following low visitor numbers in the wake of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which criticized the firm's treatment of killer whales. Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. On Friday, SeaWorld Orlando paid tribute to Nanuq, who was a hit with a number of celebrity visitors  to the attraction, including actor Will Ferrell and actresses Isla Fisher and Sarah Michelle Gellar.

The park, operated by SeaWorld Entertainment, added that the whale's fractured jaw 'resulted from an interaction between two animals that were part of a compatible social group'. During his time at SeaWorld Orlando (and earlier, SeaWorld San Diego), Nanuq interacted with members of the public as part of an $119-plus scheme called the 'Beluga Interaction Program'. On its website, the park says the 'intimate' program offers visitors 'a rare and wonderful opportunity to learn more about the amazing Arctic and connect with one of its most charming inhabitants'.

Getting up close: Sarah Michelle Gellar (left) and Kelly Clarkson And Clay Aiken (right) are seen with Nanuq . On Friday, Scott Smith, a University of South Carolina assistant  hospitality professor, said Nanuq's death could be potentially damaging to SeaWorld following the release of Blackfish. 'It really is one of the worst times this kind of news could come out,' he said. 'Any other time, it probably wouldn’t even make a blip on the radar, but now everyone is watching SeaWorld.' Longtime SeaWorld critic and Animal Welfare Institute marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose added that in the wild, suffering a broken jaw from an 'interaction' with another animal seems unlikely. Speaking to the Orlando Sentinel, Ms Rose said: 'If he died because of something related to that infection he got related to the broken jaw, then he died of being in captivity.'

Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years.

"The wonderful thing about having older children is that they change from travel dependents to travel companions. My 19-year-old daughter Christie I seem to have missed out on the ski bunny gene (unlike other family members), so we wanted to find an exciting short-haul getaway with minimal travel and maximum show-stopping thrills. The trouble with being out of season is that any traditional hot-spots are out of the question, yet anywhere else takes too long to get to for a five day break. TV presenter Carol Smillie and her 19-year-old daughter Christie visited Marrakech for five days . As it turns out, easyJet now offer weekly flights direct to Marrakech in Morocco from Glasgow, flying out on Saturday and returning on Wednesday, which was ideal for us. I visited Marrakech many moons ago as a reporter for BBC Holiday. I fell in love with the vibrancy of the frenetic souks, as well as the pungent scents and vivid colours of local life, and vowed I would return someday. Christie had never been there, and I wondered what it would be like wandering around with such a willowy beauty - would I be deluged with offers of 2,000 camels for her and forced to beat them off with sticks? Carol visited Marrakech many moons ago as a reporter for BBC Holiday and wanted to revisit the busy city . They stayed for two nights in a beautiful riad with an open courtyard walking distance from the main square . Luckily, I didn't have to worry. Marrakech today is still like something from a film set, and the locals are just delightful. We stayed for the first two nights in one of the many beautiful riads, or bijou hotels, with a glorious open  courtyard. We wanted to be within walking distance from the Djema El Fna, Marrakech's main square, which is the perfect starting point to explore the city. By day, the colourful square is a bustling hub of carpet sellers, snake charmers, musicians and even a tooth puller (yes really!). Carol and Christie ride on camels during their trip to northwest Africa, just a short flight from the UK . They took the wise decision to hire a guide to show them around so they wouldn't miss any 'hidden gems' At night, however, it takes on a truly magical appearance with twinkling lights, a myriad of pop-up restaurants, henna artists, performing monkeys, fire eaters and story tellers - set amid the pungent smell of incense. We loved it, and I wondered how it was possible for one location to appear so different within the space of 24 hours? On our first day we took the wise decision to hire a guide to show us around and allow us to get our bearings a little. The duo visited Yves Saint Laurent Gardens, Mederassa Ben Youssef, and the Bahia & Badii Palaces . Khalida from TravelLink was brilliant, and although she wasn't cheap she was worth every dirham. As well as covering all the major important sights - Yves Saint Laurent Gardens, Mederassa Ben Youssef, and the Bahia & Badii Palaces - she also gave us a flavour of local life that we'd never have discovered on our own. These hidden local gems included the shared underground ovens, a hamam furnace attendant who played his lute and offered us delicious mint tea and tiny pieces of thread tied to the church railings by people hoping to cure their various ailments. The locals were friendly and genuinely kind, and respectful  when we didn't want to buy any of their wares. They had so very little, it seemed, but wanted to share their bread with anyone who needed or wanted to try it. The colourful square is a bustling hub of carpet sellers, snake charmers, musicians and even a tooth puller . With many restaurants vying for our attention, we were relieved to have a couple of excellent recommendations for dinner. Le Salama and Le Tangia are both visually stunning, and serve a delicious selection of authentic local dishes with a little belly dancing thrown in for good measure. If shopping was a sport, I am its Olympian, and for me, this was manna from heaven. The markets were overflowing with beautiful lamps, gorgeous fabrics and carpets, intricate jewellery and metalwork, fine leather slippers; the list was endless, but sadly my purse was not. After two days of pounding the streets, and all the associated sights and sounds, our next destination was a very welcome five star retreat set a little distance from Marrakech's bustling Medina. Carol says she is a champion of shopping and markets were full of lamps, gorgeous fabrics and carpets . Just 20-minute drive from the Marrakech's centre, Tigmiza is a breathtaking, romantic retreat with its own unique style and sense of tranquility. It was here where we tried our first hamam, a kind of giant sauna, where you are placed on a hot slab, washed by hand in black soap, and scrubbed until you feel as if your skin might fall off - before realising that it actually has. But although it sounds revolting, my skin has never felt so soft. After another cup of mint tea it was time for bed, and the most marshmallow-comfortable beds we've ever slept in. Next morning we were invited to attend a cookery lesson with Tariq, a rather rotund and jovial chef (just as they should be), to teach us how to prepare a 'tagine' - a delicious Moroccan dish that's typically made with chicken or lamb. Local herbs, spices and fruits are added and cooked slowly for a number of hours, making the meat melt-in-the-mouth tender. Dinner was at the retreat's beautiful Berber-inspired restaurant, which was followed by a movie in the private cinema - complete with popcorn. Morocco was a truly magical experience that came to an end far too soon, and a wonderful mother-daughter trip that, turns out, is right on our doorstep.

"Actress Patricia Hodge has revealed how she was forced to take the heartbreaking decision to put her dementia-suffering husband into a care home. Peter Owen, who was a successful music publisher, now barely recognises the award-winning star. He was diagnosed with the illness two years ago but his condition quickly deteriorated. Ms Hodge, who played Miranda Hart’s mother Penny in the popular BBC sitcom Miranda, said: ‘Dementia is a devastating illness. Fifteen months ago Peter went into a home. Rapid deterioration: Award-winning actress Patricia Hodge, 68, with her husband Peter Owen in 2001 . ‘Sometimes he does know who I am and can recognise me and the family. But he does not know at times that I am his wife. It varies.’ The couple married in 1976 and have two sons – Alexander, 26, and Edward, 23. Ms Hodge added: ‘It’s all so sad. This illness is horrific.’ The 68-year-old actress was speaking at a ceremony to mark a £28 million revamp of her old drama school, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). In an interview last year, she spoke fondly about life with her husband before his dementia took hold. She said: ‘He was such a strong dependable figure in the boys’ lives, so we live with great sadness in our hearts, but you just have to get on with life. These have been a difficult few years for our family.

"A killer who murdered his wife has been granted legal aid to fight for custody of her four children. The man, known only as X, is serving a life sentence for the 'particularly horrible' murder of the children's mother and has refused to have a paternity test to prove he is their father. Judges at the Court of Appeal upheld a decision that DNA collected from the murder scene could not be used to prove paternity, so the issue of his and his family's access to the children - aged between three and nine - will be decided without this evidence. Court of Appeal judges ruled that DNA collected from a crime scene when a man murdered his wife will not be used to prove he is the father to their four children - despite his refusal to take a paternity test - as he receives legal aid to fight for custody of the youngsters who are aged between three and nine . The case began when the local authority and children's legal guardian challenged the decision by Theresa May, the home secretary, and the police not to allow the DNA to be used to prove paternity, the Sunday Times reported. The man is not named on any of the children's birth certificates. Sir James Munby, president of the family division of the High Court, initially allowed the application and ruled that the DNA could be used to determine paternity. He said: 'One cannot ignore the enormous implications for these children of what happened to their mother. 'Their futures will be indelibly marked by it. They need to know if the man who murdered their mother, the man who they believe to be their father, is in truth their father.' But after the ruling was challenged the Court of Appeal overturned Sir James Munby's decision. The man, who is referred to only as X, has refused to have a paternity test to prove he is the children's father . The judges said allowing evidence gathered from the crime scene to be used would damage the integrity of the DNA database. David Green, director of Civitas, a think tank, branded the case 'extraordinary.' He added: 'For the sake of the long-term care of the children and the feelings of the wife's family he should not be allowed any continuing role in their upbringing.'","Man, identified only as X, murdered his wife and mother of four children .

"The food company which imports the frozen berries at the centre of the hepatitis A outbreak that is sweeping across Australia has said there no firm link between their Nanna's Berries and the health scare. Patties Foods says its imported Chinese berries were recalled on health department advice despite a lack of proof from accredited laboratories of a link to the hepatitis A virus (HAV). 'At this point, we have not been provided any remaining consumer product to test from the 13 confirmed HAV cases to clinically verify there is indeed a link with the Nanna's Mixed Berries,' managing director and chief executive Stephen Chaur said in a statement on Friday. Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A, as four more people were diagnosed with the disease on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Up to 450,000 people may have eaten the frozen berries suspected of transmitting hepatitis A . 70,000 packets of the Chinese berries are sold each week in Australia, putting nearly half a million people at risk and sparking concerns over potential future cases. 18 people in total have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, which has an incubation period of seven weeks, leading health experts to believe that more cases will come to light. Mr Chaur insists the company had rigorous testing that went beyond the Australian standards requirement that five per cent of imported fruit containers be tested. 'Patties Foods' documented test regime is amongst the highest, testing 20 per cent of all the containers when they arrive in Australia,' he said. But Mr Chaur said sample testing for microbial and viral markers had been increased to 100 per cent of imported frozen berries from all countries. The company has checked quality control testing documents back to June 2014 and says they're satisfied no biological indicators outside Australian guidelines have been detected. Recalled products are being tested further at laboratories in Australia, Europe and North America with results expected in a fortnight. Production of recalled products has been stopped until the formal results are known. The health department says the source of the virus is still unconfirmed but the berries are the only common exposure in all cases. The Department of Agriculture is asking all companies importing Chinese berries for more information about their sources and food safety management. Food Standards Australia New Zealand will review of the risk status of frozen berries. Approximately two percent of the country's population may have consumed the berries, said Finn Romanes, public health physician and Victorian government medical adviser. 'We are still working on this outbreak and we think that there will be more cases come to light,' Mr Romanes told The Australian. Consumers are being urged not to buy or eat Nanna's Raspberries one kilogram packs, Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries one kilogram packs and 300 and 500 gram packs of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. While only the Nanna's Mixed Berries product has been linked with the outbreak, and the other products have been recalled as a precaution, a Health Department spokesperson said that the source of the disease was still unconfirmed. Four frozen berry products imported by Patties Foods, and sourced from China's Shandong province, were recalled this week due to fears they are linked to the viral disease Hepatitis A . 'However, the berries are the only common exposure for cases,' the Heath Department said in a statement on Saturday. Despite the Federal government refused to release statistics relating to the scare, it has been revealed that three Victorians were the first to contract Hepatitis A, between  Christmas and New Years. The Victorians were all interviewed by health authorities, and found that all three had consumed the berries, corroborating similar findings in NSW. An estimated one in 100 people who have eaten the contaminated berries will develop the disease, a figure which the Federal Health Department labelled as 'worse case scenario'. The Department of Agriculture is contacting companies that have imported Chinese berries to find out about the source of the berries and supply chain food safety management systems. Early last week, the Red Cross Blood Service banned those who had eaten the berries from donating blood for two months, but lifted the ban on Saturday when they found the blood supply was not at risk. It has been revealed the frozen berries  are from the Shandong province in east China, the Daily Telegraph reports. A river which flows in the Chinese village Jinling in the Shandong province is one of China's most polluted areas, reportedly where frozen berries are grown and packed before they are imported and sold in Australian stores . Cities and villages in Shandong are reportedly plagued by chemical and industrial waste pollution, with farming land laying adjacent to factories and petrochemical plants. One river running through the village of Jinling is so polluted by nearby chemical factories that the water is red coloured and has a foul smell, according to local Chinese reports. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City, according to the Epoch Times. The small town of Jinling in east China's Shandong province is located near the Qilu Chemical Industrial Park in Zibo City . In previous reports, there have been claims that the company releases chemical distribution into the river, which was once sparkly clear but has now visibly been contaminated and also emanates a stench. Residents also say there's a 'cancer virus' floating around the village as cancer is quite common in the town. This comes as reports emerged that health tests weren't conducted on any frozen berry products imported to Australia while similar goods have been tied to hepatitis breakout in North America and Europe,The Australian reports.","Patties Foods say there's no firm link between their berries and hepatitis A .

"Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg is planning to build a waterside town next to the firm's San Francisco headquarters. The 200-acre plot will be turned into Facebook's own company town, complete with supermarkets, hotels and homes for 10,000 of its employees and their families. The extravagant plans will see the conurbation - dubbed 'Zee-town' - have its own roads, as well as accommodation ranging from luxurious villas for high-paid executives to dormitories for trainees. Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg is planning to build a waterside town next to the firm's San Francisco headquarters, with the help of architect Frank Gehry (right) The 200-acre plot will be turned into Facebook's own company town, complete with supermarkets, hotels and homes for 10,000 of its employees. Pictured, plans from 2012 . Facebook recently spent $400million (£260million) on a 55-acre industrial park next to their main offices at 1 Hacker Way near San Francisco's Menlo Park, the final plot needed for construction to begin. Mr Zuckerberg has hired architect Frank Gehry, 85, who designed the visually-striking Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for the job. The Sunday Times reported that the town will have 'real streets'  for outsiders to visit. Mr Gehry was asked to tone down some of the plans for the $200billion (£130billion) company's town, with the architect told to make the buildings blend into nature. Most of the offices will have oak trees planted on 40ft high roofs with Facebook hoping the site will look like a grassy hill from the outside. Critics of 'Zee-town' say that workers will be dependent on cars to get to the settlement, going against Facebook's eco-friendly ethos, however the company argues it has alternative plans for transport. The extravagant plans will see the conurbation - dubbed 'Zee-town'  - have its own roads . Facebook moved into its Menlo Park headquarters in 2011. The campus previously was home to Sun Microsystems . Mr Gehry designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the museum of modern and contemporary art in northern Spain . Business writer Sarah Goodyear said it 'epitomises the planning failures of the past three generations in California and avoids connecting with a real messy place like San Francisco'. Mr Zuckerberg already has a $10million (£6.5million), five-bedroom 'starter home' 20 minutes away from the site, so he is unlikely to be moving in once the town is complete. The tycoon also owns four houses on the same street. Mr Zuckerberg, the 15th wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes, is not the first boss to try to build a town for their company. The Cadbury family built Bournville - and named their plain chocolate bar after it - in the 19th century after the confectionery makers needed to move the factory to a new site in Birmingham. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, also plans to move his company to its own independent settlement, using the unconventional method of building rockets in an attempt to colonise space.","Facebook plans to build its own town on a 200-acre plot in San Francisco .

"The brother of condemned Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has told of his brother's love for Indonesia as reports emerge that fighter jets have arrived in Bali to escort the two men to their deaths. Speaking on behalf of his brother outside Kerobokan prison today, Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew Chan are very grateful to the Indonesian people for their respect and help during their ten years in jail. 'Myu and Andrew love Indonesia, they have a great respect for the Indonesian people and its culture,' Chinthu said. Scroll down for video . The executions of Andrew Chan (L) and Myuran Sukumaran who are on death row in Indonesia for drug smuggling have been delayed . 'It was through the support of the Indonesian justice system that they were able to help set up many programs that have helped a lot of Indonesians and has also helped better themselves and they are very grateful for that', Mr Sukumaran told Perth Now. It comes after four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport. It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan. Michael Chan (left) and Chinthu Sukumaran (right) outside Kerobokan prison today to visit their brothers Andrew and Myuran . Chinthu Sukumaran arrives at Kerobokan Prison in Bali last week to visit his brother Myuran who is facing execution by firing squad in Indonesia with fellow Australian Andrew Chan . The presence of the fighter jets only adds fire to speculation that the men may be flown from Denpasar to Nusakambangan in helicopters, instead of taking the traditional route of sailing there. Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters the family barely speak when they visit Myuran in jail and said he does not need the added strain of seeing his beloved family members crying at the moment. 'We were all standing around barely talking,' Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters of the morning his family had gathered at the prison to say what they thought were their last goodbyes. 'We were trying to tell each other there was still hope but it just felt like we were lying to each other' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. The family had understood the move would 'definitely happen this week.' Both Michael and Chintu spoke on behalf of their brothers who are awaiting execution at the prison . Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew love Indonesia and the respect they have shown them during their 10 years in prison . Chinthu Sukumaran said his brother Myuran was comforting his family on Tuesday as they collected his artworks and wept. 'He was trying to be strong,' he told the Herald. 'It was very difficult. For him to stay strong at a time like that, he really didn't need people crying around him.' When news reached the Bali Nine pair at midday that their transfer to Nusakambangan 'death' island  would be delayed, Myuran Sukamaran got back to his painting and had something to eat with his loved ones. Four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport.It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan . 'Myuran said he could actually taste the food. That hadn't happened for a long time,' his younger brother told reporters. He also slept for the first time in a long while. Indonesian authorities had planned to move Sukumaran and fellow prisoner Andrew Chan to the island at midnight but announced a last-minute delay because of 'technical matters.' It leaves the men more time to spend with family visiting from Australia, and more time for their lawyers to prepare a legal challenge. The men have been locked-up in Kerobokan prison for almost 10 years for trying to smuggle drugs to Australia. Despite the delay,  President Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead as planned, telling Indonesian media on Friday that it was the nation's 'legal sovereignty,' and that the postponement was 'only about technical matters'. An earlier picture of Chinthu Sukumaran (left), his mother Ranjini and sister Brintha with a photo of Myuran Sukumaran, one of the 'Bali Nine' condemned to die by firing squad for drug trafficking in Indonesia . Indonesian President Joko Widodo has claimed that 'technical issues' were to blame for the postponement . Indonesia's Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo explained that isolation rooms and executions fields on the island were not ready for the pair,The Sydney Morning Herald reported, but said the pair's execution should take place 'the sooner the better.' The reason was later disputed by officials on Nusakambangan island, following claims that the families of Chan and Sukumaran were entitled to more time with the pair. Meetings to plan the transfer continued on Friday, but no date has been set. 'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters. On Thursday, Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons.' Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island. The news came after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia. Andrew Chan's and Myuran Sukumaran's families speak to journalists at a press conference in Jakarta last week. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead. Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported. But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'. President Widodo told local media that Ms Bishop had clarified the remarks, speaking directly with Vice-President Jusuf Kalla. 'She has explained that it wasn't the intention. Actually we wanted to say something but since it has been explained, we cancelled it,' said Widodo. Senior government figures were concerned Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo, after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's (right) carefully crafted campaign to spare their lives . The comments had previously sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'. 'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax . Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad. 'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.' Chan and Sukumaran are enjoying a few days' reprieve from the firing squad after Indonesia delayed moving them from their Bali jail cells . 'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) The temporary reprieve gives the condemned men's lawyer, Michael O'Connell, precious time to progress their case. Mr O'Connell says it's a strong one, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles to determine whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president. Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well. 'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday. 'They are very grateful for it and they simple wait and hope.'","Chinthu Sukumaran has told of his brother Myuran's love for Indonesia .

"A councillor kicked out of Ukip has insisted she is not racist despite being filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features'. Rozanne Duncan, who was a member of Ukip in the seat where Nigel Farage will run to be an MP, said she did not like 'negroes'. Ms Duncan was expelled from the party after the comments were revealed by the makers of a fly-on-the-wall documentary by the BBC, but she still says she does not regret her comments. Scroll down for video . Rozanne Duncan says she is not racist despite being filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features' The councillor for Thanet South, in Kent, was filmed telling Ukip press officer Liz Langton Way that she has 'problems with negroes'. 'I have to watch my tongue because I can be very outspoken and it goes against the grain to be careful what I'm saying,' Ms Duncan said. Insisting there was 'absolutely no way I'm a racist', she added: 'The only people I do have problems with are negroes. And I don't know why. 'I don't know whether there is something in my psyche or whether it's karma from a previous life or whether something happened to me as a very, very young person and I've drawn a veil over it - because that sometimes happens, doesn't it? Ms Duncan denies being a racist, saying the 'only people I do have problems with are negroes' 'But I really do have a problem with people with negroid features.' Ms Duncan went on to explain that things were different when she was brought up. She said: 'I used to say to my daughter, by way of some sort of justification, you need to remember that I was born in the late '40s, early '50s when, especially down in Thanet, there weren't any and I wasn't brought up with them. Now that's no justification at all, it doesn't answer the question ""why is she like that with them and not anybody else.""' Her comments were revealed in BBC documentary Meet the Ukippers, which airs tonight. After Ukip booted her out of the party over the comments, Ms Duncan claimed there had been a 'hidden agenda' against her and she felt 'betrayed'. 'I still honestly believe that what I said was never at any time racist or derogatory,' she said. 'I used the word ""negroes"" as you would do Asians, Chinese, Muslims, Jews. It's a description, it's not an insult - in the same way as you would say ""what do you mean by Jewish?"" Well, they belong to a community, they have got a certain faith, they have usually got noses that have got a bit of a curve to them, married women - if they are orthodox Jews - wear wigs. It's description.' She added: 'I don't regret saying it. I don't regret anything, that's the truth. ‘I was not expelled for having an ""association with or membership of an organisation incompatible with membership of the party"", nor have I links with a far-right or any other group. ‘The only group I’ve ever belonged to is the Conservative party — unless you count Mensa, the Women’s Institute or the Order of Women Freemasons.’ The former Ukip councillor made the comments to party press officer Liz Langton Way, pictured with fellow press officer James Langton . Ukip local chairman Martyn Heale is shown discussing his past membership of the far-right National Front . The documentary also shows local Ukip chairman Martyn Heale attempting to draw a line under his past membership of the far-right National Front. He said: 'For Christ's sake, I was never a member of the Gestapo. I was not a member of the Stasi, I never served a term of imprisonment in my life. Ms Duncan was elected as a Ukip councillor in a by-election in the Cliftonville East ward of Thanet South in May 2013 with a 41 per cent share of the vote. The landlady, who owned four properties in Margate when she was elected, was brought up in Kent. She stood in a council election for the Margate Central ward in 2007 for the Conservative party, but was not elected after finishing third with 192 votes. After she was expelled from Ukip, she continued in her role as an independent. 'I was a f***ing member of the Conservative Party for 22 years, I was a member of the National Front for one year and two months. Why don't they just let it go?' He added that when he joined, he did not realised the organisation was 'as extreme as they said'. The controversy is just the latest row over racism to hit Ukip. In December, Mr Farage defended a disgraced Ukip candidate taped referring to a Chinese woman as a ‘Chinky bird’. The Ukip leader said he felt sorry for Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments, which were not considered offensive in TV shows like Only Fools and Horses. Mr Farage hit back at claims it was not further proof that Ukip is racist and homophobic, claiming people who live in London are ‘snobbish’ about ‘colloquial language’ which is common amongst people who live in council houses. He initially refused to sack Mr Smith, with Ukip insiders hoping an apology would help the row to ‘blow over’. Eventually he stood down ‘by mutual consent’.

"Former Australian Test player Brett Lee has been dragged into the Glenn McGrath hunting controversy after an image of the pair posing with a dead animal emerged. Daily Mail Australia has uncovered a photograph of the cricketers in the company of two young boys, smiling next to a bleeding deer. Lee has one hand placed casually on the dead animal and the other around a child's shoulders. A spokesman for the 38-year-old confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'yes, that photo was taken on a farm in South Africa'. The new image comes just a day after McGrath attracted mass criticism for a series of images from a 2008 African hunting trip. The fast bowler is pictured holding a gun and smiling with his kill, including an elephant, water buffalo and hyenas. A spokesman for Brett Lee (second from left) confirmed that this photograph was taken at a farm in South Africa. Glenn McGrath is pictured on the far right . A series of photographs of ex-cricketer Glenn McGrath posing next to dead African animals, emerged the day before the image of McGrath with Brett Lee . In 2006, McGrath opened up about the hunting trips he has enjoyed on his New South Wales country property with Lee and fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie, in an interview with Australian Shooter. He explained that Lee enjoys hunting, whilst Gillespie was an amateur with firearms. McGrath is a life member with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia and defended the practice in 2006, explaining that he sees it as a 'bonding' activity between himself and his mates. 'I don't expect people to feel the same way about [shooting], and at the same time, I don't expect others to force their opinions on me,' he told AS in 2006. 'I do have a passion for hunting and it is something I do want to continue once I've finished with cricket.' Social media users slammed the former cricketer on Twitter and Facebook . Some went as far as to announce they would boycott his cancer charity the McGrath Foundation . However, McGrath issued a statement on Twitter soon after the images surfaced on Saturday, saying he 'deeply regretted' the experience. 'In 2008 I participated in a hunting safari in Zimbabwe that was licensed and legal but in hindsight highly inappropriate,' McGrath wrote. 'It was an extremely difficult time in my life and looking back I deeply regret being involved'. The 'difficult time' McGrath referred to in the statement is understood to be a reference to the death of his wife Jane McGrath, who died of Breast Cancer in June 2008. She died at the age of 42, eleven years after she was diagnosed, after co-founding the McGrath Foundation with her husband. When the images emerged, the photograph of a beaming McGrath sitting in front of a dead elephant in Zimbabwe with a gun in his lap was considered particularly distressful amongst Twitter users. African elephants are classified as 'vulnerable' by animal welfare groups.

However, another Twitter user pointed out that the cancer patients would suffer greatly if charity was targeted. 'We need to look at the foundation and Glenn McGrath as two separate identities... don't kill Jane's dream,' tweeted Vivienne. 'Boycotting The McGrath Foundation and the women it helps is pathetic. Get a grip,' tweeted another. User Sandy Lanceley wrote: 'Just lost an enormous amount of respect for @glennmcgrath11, hunting in Africa? Hang your head'.

"A collection of eight New York bartenders has shared what it's like to 'sit back and enjoy the show' of couples who meet on the mobile phone app Tinder meet each other in their restaurants. Tinder, through which prospective couples can arrange dates if they both 'like' each other, now makes 10million matches a day, sending users into bars to see each other in person. Patrons may not want to add any extra pressure by having their meetup become a spectacle, but bartenders are adept at knowing when a couple comes in on a Tinder date, according to a video from The Daily Share. Eight bartenders explained what it is like to watch some of the dating app Tinder's 10million matches a day meet each other for the first time . The restaurant workers agreed that they could always tell when a couple had met online and enjoyed watching the show . 'Usually they're dressed a little bit too well and they're showered a little bit too recently' said Bryan, who works at The Jakewalk in Brooklyn. Bartenders said they text their coworkers and other bartenders they know when they see a particularly entertaining date. While Tinder date customers look to end their loneliness, they also often recruit a friendly bartender to their side to share the awkwardness of their first encounter with a potential new flame. Kerryn, who works at Greenpoint Heights,  said that once a woman arranged to touch her forehead to signal if her date did not look like his picture on the app. She ended up vigorously smacking her brow. Bad dates sometimes end with one of the parties simply taking off when the other is going to the bathroom, leaving bartenders to break the news that the date had been ended to the other customer. Another woman told her date that she was leaving to go find her missing glove, but never came back. Junior, who works at the Brooklyn bar Commonwealth, said that seeing failed goodbye kisses is like 'watching a dog get put down' Goodbyes may be the most dramatic part of the first date ordeal, with multiple bartenders saying that women often turn their head to the side when a man goes in for a kiss. 'It's a heartbreaker. It's like watching a dog get put down,' said Junior, who works at Commonwealth. But a lack of connection doesn't deter some app-users. One bartender named Carla said that she once saw a woman bring in three Tinder dates to her restaurant in the same night, according to Your Tango. Other customers on bad dates will use their dating app again before even saying goodbye to a failed romance. The bartenders said it feels rewarding when the dates go well, even if it sometimes ends up with customers wildly displaying their new-found affection in public. The best dates from the amount of laughter, said Kerryn. Bartenders said that it feels good when new Tinder couples end up having a good date at their establishments .","Eight bartenders said they can always tell when a Tinder couples come in .

"Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, claimed Vladimir Putin is 'testing' Britain's reaction times . Planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by Russian jets in a highly dangerous 'game of chicken', a former head of the armed forces has warned. Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, claimed Vladimir Putin is 'testing' the resolve of Britain and its Nato allies in the stand-off in Ukraine. He accused Moscow of pursuing an 'aggressive' strategy of probing UK defences, using flights by Russian long-range Bear bombers off Bournemouth and the coast of Cornwall. Two Russian bombers last week skirted British airspace off the coast of Cornwall, where they were intercepted and escorted by the two RAF Typhoon fighters. It came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth last month. Lord Stirrup said the flights were not 'joy rides' but 'mission rehearsals' designed to test Britain's capability to react. He told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: 'They are becoming more aggressive. These aircraft - Russian Bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides. They are mission rehearsals,' he said. 'These aircraft launch stand-off missiles against Western targets and just as they used to do in the Cold War they are practising those profiles. 'They are testing us, they are testing our defences, they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that's very dangerous. 'So we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision, not between RAF and Russia aircraft, but between Russian aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing.' Official figures show that RAF jets have been scrambled to deter Russian plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014, including 8 times last year. A third of all incidents in which RAF pilots were deployed involved a plan from Russia. Lord Stirrup suggested that Britain should now consider supplying arms to the Ukraine government to counter the superior firepower of the separatist rebels who are being supplied by Moscow. 'Nato over the years, in the eyes of Putin at least, has become weak. Putin views the West as weak all round and that is a very, very dangerous position for us to be in,' he told Sky News's Murnaghan programme. 'My concern is that Nato is not spending enough resource on defence. If Nato is weak or is perceived to be weak by Putin then the risk of miscalculation is much greater and our security is much lowered as a result.' Scroll down for video . Footage of British and French fighter jets escorting a Russian bomber was released by a Kremlin-backed TV station . Lord Stirrup, who was head of the armed forces at the time of the 2010 strategic defence and security review, said the 'swingeing cuts' to defence spending had left the forces 'right on the limit' and needed to be reversed. Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: .

He was backed by Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, who said that all the political parties now needed to commit to maintaining the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. 'This is absolutely central. Every party must in their manifesto commit to 2% spending on defence,' he told Sky News. 'That is what Nato is about. It is passing the message to Putin that Nato is a serious organisation that is prepared to defend its territory. 'Deterrence is about psychology. That 2 per cent figure is something he is going to be looking at very carefully because that is what we used to show that we are serious.' Increasing aggression from Russia has led to calls for military support for the Ukrainian government. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox has said the West should now consider arming the government in Kiev. But the idea was rejected by Commons Leader William Hague, who said that the right approach was to ratchet up sanctions if Russia continued to de-stabilise Ukraine. 'We are not planning as the UK to send arms to Ukraine. It hasn't been our approach in any recent conflict in recent years to send arms into those conflicts,' Mr Hague, who was foreign secretary until last year, told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show. 'We want to see a diplomatic solution. We believe that that long-term economic price toRussia and all of those other penalties are the right penalties for Russia to pay. You have to think very carefully before you send additional arms into a conflict.'

"Tina Bayliss had no idea a man she had gone on several dates with was a convicted child killer until he strangled her 13-year-old daughter in the family home. Jade was gagged and strangled in her Christchurch home in November 2011 by Jeremy McLaughlin - a man with criminal past that no one, not even the police, warned Ms Bayliss about. The mother of three was devastated to learn her daughter had been murdered, but she was dealt another cruel blow when she found out Jade's death could have been prevented. Scroll down for video . Jade Bayliss, 13, was gagged and strangled to death in her Christchurch home in November 2011 by convicted child killer Jeremy McLaughlin . McLaughlin was sentenced to 23 years in jail in 2013 for Jade's murder, stealing items from her family's home and torching it. Now, Ms Bayliss is determined to change the system that let her daughter's killer slip through the cracks. Ms Bayliss, completely unaware of his dark history, had been on a few dates with McLaughlin in the six weeks prior to Jade's murder. When she started to distance herself from him, Ms Bayliss said she became concerned when he started stalking her and sending inappropriate text messages. Four days before Jade's death, Ms Bayliss went to police. 'I asked if I should be worried about Jeremy McLaughlin,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was informed that I had nothing to worry about and was given a trespass order to serve to Jeremy if he came to my home. 'They typed his name in, but to this day I don’t think anything came up on the computer. If they knew and just gave me a trespass order, that’s pretty sick.' Tina Bayliss (right) had been on several dates with the man who murdered her daughter Jade (left), but she wasn't told of his dark criminal history when she complained to police that he was stalking her . Jade stayed home from school sick on the day she was killed and left to perish in the house fire in 2011 . Sadly, the day McLaughlin did return Ms Bayliss wasn't home. Jade stayed home from school sick on the day she was killed and left to perish in the house fire. 'It still is the worst day of my life,' she said. 'I had a gut feeling, but when they said suspicious circumstances, I said straight away it was Jeremy.' Ms Bayliss was soon informed McLaughlin had been deported to New Zealand after he was found guilty of killing a 14-year-old boy in Western Australia in 1995. Phillip Vidot and his friend Tyron Williams had been beaten with a cricket bat, run over and robbed of their clothing. McLaughlin was sentenced to 12 years for the manslaughter of Phillip, but only served six before he was deported back to his native country. McLaughlin who was sentenced to 23 years in jail for killing Jade, had been deported to New Zealand after he was found guilty of killed a 14-year-old boy in Western Australia in 1995 . McLaughlin was sentenced to 12 years for the manslaughter of Phillip Vidot, but only served six before he was deported back to his native country . Ms Bayliss said if police had known of McLaughlin's criminal history she could have been better equipped to protect her 13-year-old daughter Jade . 'I was shell-shocked because I had been into the police station before,' Ms Bayliss said. 'I just kept thinking, if it did come up on the system that he hurt a child, surely they could have provided me with protection. I was pretty devastated.' Now more than three years on, Ms Bayliss is determined to change the system. She has launched an online petition  calling for a register to help monitor criminals deported to New Zealand and Australia after serving time in other countries. 'We all should have the right to protect ourselves and our loved ones from potential harm, especially if the person has served time for committing a serious crime,' she said. 13-year-old Jade (left) was home sick the day she was killed, while her younger sister Amber and brother Harvey went off to school . Ms Bayliss, pictured here with Jade, has now launched an online petition calling for a register to help monitor criminals deported to New Zealand and Australia after serving time in other countries . She wants Australia and New Zealand to set up a serious crimes register so that police informed when someone is being deported after serving time. At the moment there's no such register, only one for sex offenders. Ms Bayliss is also campaigning for deported criminals to meet the same parole conditions as those who have served time in New Zealand. 'If this information was available to the police and they could have informed me of McLaughlin's serious criminal history I would of been better equipped to try and protect my family,' she said. 'Things could have been a lot different.' Ms Bayliss' petition is available on change.org.","Jade Bayliss was strangled in her Christchurch home in November 2011 by convicted child killer Jeremy McLaughlin .

"An apologetic Vanilla Ice has given his first proper interview following his arrest this week, saying he is struggling to eat and sleep and that he has never felt worse. The rapper turned renovation show reality star - charged with burglary and grand theft after allegedly pilfering property from a foreclosed home in Palm Beach,  Florida - seemed teary as he said he has barely eaten or slept since turning himself into police on Wednesday. 'I'm a family man, I've got kids, I'm sorry to everybody for whatever this is,' Van Winkle told WPBP News as he left Florida for Columbus, Ohio, on Friday. 'I really love the community, where I live here in Palm Beach, I do a lot of things... hopefully people can see who I am, the real me.' Scroll down for video . 'I'm sorry to everybody': Vanilla Ice gave his first proper interview since being released from lock up earlier this week while leaving Florida on Friday bound for Columbus Ohio. He was teary, apologetic and upset . 'Worst day': The 47-year-old maintains he was trying to purchase the home that the property - left behind furniture - was stolen from, after it went into foreclosure . Van Winkle has told investigators he was 'going to purchase' the home that the stolen property was removed from. He is accused of breaking into a vacant home and stolen furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 'I'm still actively trying to by this house,' he told the network. 'It's just sad the way this has played out. It's not me.' 'I feel horrible. It's the worst day of my life.' The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's personal home, police say. It has been reported however that Van Winkle told his work crew that he owned the home, and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show inside an adjacent home . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (above), bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture (above), 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home (pictured) have been returned to their owner . Van Winkle in a 2001 mugshot (left) after he allegedly threatened a man and in a 2008 mugshot (right) after an assault charge . According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show. He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don't know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.","Vanilla Ice, 47 - real name Robert Van Winkle - was arrested in Lantana, Florida, on Wednesday and charged with burglary and grand theft .

"As a country known for its lavish tipping practices, there has always been a debate in America over how much to leave at the end of a meal. For customers who have ever wondered how much staff at restaurants actually earn, new data has revealed on average, they receive a median salary of $13.30 an hour. That includes a base salary of $9.90 an hour and earning $3.40 an hour in tips. Surprisingly, the IRS estimates that up to 40 per cent of tips go unreported, meaning there is an estimated $11billion in unrecorded income, according to the Atlantic.

"A Los Angeles man taken off a United Airlines flight the day after the massacre at the Paris offices of Charle Hebdo because a flight attendant believed he was one of the murderers has spoken out about his unhappiness at how the airline treated him following his ordeal. Elliot Pembrook was detained by federal agents upon arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport on a United flight from Frankfurt, Germany, where he had been visiting his fiancée. United had contacted the feds after a member of the flight crew grew suspicious that Pembrook, 31, might have been Al-Qaeda extremist Said Kouachi, 34, who was shot by French police outside Paris later that day. Elliot Pembrook, right, was marched off a United Airlines flight the day after the massacre at the Paris offices of Charle Hebdo because a flight attendant believed he was Said Kouachi, left, who along with his brother Cherif had forced his way into the Paris offices of the satirical weekly newspaper Charle Hebdo and killed 12 people . Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif had forced their way into the offices of the satirical weekly newspaper and killed 12 people on 7 January. After being marched off the United flight, Pembrook was held for two hours before he was eventually released and allowed to continue his journey home to Los Angeles. Pembrook told NJ Advance Media that he had no issue with being detained by the feds - who he says were just doing their job - but believes his ordeal could have been avoided if the concerned flight attendant had simply spoken to him and realized he was clearly an American rather than French citizen. The passenger's fury concerns the fact that no one from the airline sought him out to check how he was doing or even to apologize after his release . Instead, Pembrook only heard from United after he contacted them days later to see if they planned to make amends. Three weeks later he received a belated apology via email and a $500 credit. Elliot Pembrook was detained by federal agents upon arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport on a United flight from Frankfurt, Germany, where he had been visiting his fiancée . 'We hope that he will understand that our apology is sincere and that he will give us another chance,' read the email, which Pembrook has described as a 'slap in the face.' 'I wanted an apology, and I just wanted some kind of explanation from the flight attendant, a specific apology from her,' Pembrook told NJ Advance Media. Pembrook, who is mixed race, has acknowledged he matched a broad description of the suspect, but says he deserved to be treated with more respect. 'Customs said that United's decision was stupid but that they had to act, and the U.S. Marshal that showed up simply asked, 'Is this the guy?' and then immediately left,' he said. Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif pictured outside the Paris offices of the satirical weekly newspaper Charle Hebdo: A Los Angeles man was taken off a United Airlines flight the day after the massacre because an attendant believed he was one of the murderers . 'No one from United ever showed up during any of this or at the end to even blurt out an, ""Oops I'm sorry.'"" A United spokesman insists that the crew responded appropriately during the flight. 'Whenever a crew member or a customer has cause for concern, relaying that concern to the proper authorities is absolutely the right thing to do,' said Rahsaan Johnson. 'The authorities are the right ones to determine whether the threat is legitimate.' He did however concede that United should have apologized immediately to Pembrook.","Elliot Pembrook was marched off a United Airlines flight because a flight attendant believed he was one of the Charle Hebdo murderers .

"The number of children in Britain who have been snatched has increased with almost 900 youngsters taken by strangers or their parents in the last year, a new report reveals. Figures gathered by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the charity Parents and Abducted Children Together (Pact) show that child kidnappings have increased by almost a fifth. During 2013-14, kidnappings and abductions of children under 18 rose by 13 per cent since the previous year. Five-year-old April Jones, who was abducted after being seen getting into a car near her home in Wales in October 2012. Mark Bridger, 46, was later found guilty of abduction and murder . Kidnappings alone, which are defined as using force or fraud to remove a child, increased at a faster rate, rising by 18 per cent over the same period. Most abductions, 401 out of 559, were carried out by people other than the children's parents, while 321 were kidnapped. The number of children being abducted by parents was 158, up by six per cent on the previous year. And the charity believe the increase in numbers since 2012-13 could be down to a different attitude in recording such crimes in the light of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. Alice Gross, left, who was abducted and murdered by Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns last year. Right, Talia Belaid, who was kidnapped by her father and taken to Libya in 2012 at two weeks old . Shannon Matthews, who was abducted by her mother Karen and her partner's uncle in Dewsbury in 2008. She was found alive 24 days after going missing . Natalie Horrell, left, who was taken from her mother aged five months in May 1988. She was found 200 miles away. Right, Alex Griffiths, who was snatched from St Thomas' Hospital in London in 1990 by a woman posing as a health visitor. She was found two weeks later . Pact's director of research Geoff Newiss said: 'I would imagine that (Rotherham) is something to do with it. 'I wouldn't be surprised if forces are more sensitive now to the need to record what comes their way.' The highest rate of child abduction and kidnap was in Northern Ireland, with 11.6 offences per 100,00 children in the last year. Meanwhile the lowest was in Wales where there were 4.5 offences per 100,000 children. The largest forces such as the Metropolitan Police recorded the highest number of cases, while kidnapping and abduction offences in Lancashire doubled and there were also significant increases in Kent, North Yorkshire and Northumbria. Mr Newiss added: 'Our analysis shows quite alarming rises in child abduction and kidnapping over the last two years. Vishal Mehrotra, left, was abducted from Putney, west London in 1981 aged eight and murdered. Right, Martin Allen who was last seen at King's Cross station in November 1979 aged 15. He has never been found . 'However, it's difficult to say whether this is a consequence of victims being more likely to report crime, changes in the way police record it, or a genuine increase in offending. 'It is important to stress that child abduction or kidnapping is relatively rare. 'However, we know that many incidents go unreported to, or unrecorded by, the police.' While Susannah Drury, Director of Policy for Missing People, said: 'The report has uncovered worrying increases in child abductions and kidnapping offences - highlighting the importance of a quick and effective national response to these crimes. ' The Association of Chief Police Officers say there has been a significant increase in the recording of these kinds of crimes due to a 'considerable focus' on improving crime-recording practices.","Number of child kidnappings in Britain increased by a fifth in the last year .

"She's the favourite to win the Best Actress Oscar for her role in Still Alice tonight but Julianne Moore is by no means just an actress. In fact, the 54-year-old has written a series of children's books and is such an experienced interior designer that she's picked out the pieces decorating the green room at the Oscar ceremony itself. However, in an interview with The Telegraph, she admitted her true life goal: 'I really wanted a family, I really wanted children and I didn't want to compromise on that.' Julianne Moore (pictured on Saturday) counts interior design and children's fiction writing as just some of her outside passions, but the real thing that drives her is being a mother to her two children . Although she's struggled to balance work and family - calling it 'hell' at times - the actress, who plays a woman with early onset Alzheimer's in the highly praised film, said she has 'loved every minute' of motherhood. Julianne has two children with director husband Bart Freundlich, Liv, 12, and Caleb, 17. The dream of a family was instilled in her from a young age by her mother, who died in 2009. 'She always told me that you can have both [career and family]. I think that it was important to realise what I valued, what I wanted, and to find a way to make them both happen,' she said. Another thing Julianne inherited from her mother is an acute eye for interior design, which has been further enriched by her brother-in-law, architect Oliver Freundlich. In fact, the Oscar nominee was even enlisted to select the furniture and decor for the green room backstage at the Oscars this year, a task that has previously been assigned to designers including David Rockwell, who teamed up with Susan Sarandon, and Madeline Stuart. '[My mother] always told me that you can have both [career and family],' said Julianne (seen in January with son Caleb, daughter Liv and husband Bart Freundlich) Julianne, who collaborated with Los Angeles-based design studio Commune on the design project, chose a Hollywood Hills theme, with the aim of making the room feel as if Joan Didion 'invited you over for a drink before the Oscars,' according to Roman Alonso, a partner at Commune. She said her mother, who was Scottish, cared about where her family lived and made their houses look beautiful. 'And that's something that I got from her and now I can see it in my daughter. I'm always fascinated by the urge to decorate. It doesn't seem to be a necessity and yet we've done it for centuries.' When she's not exercising her eye for design or spending quality time with her kids, Julianne also writes children's stories, including 2007 bestseller Freckleface Strawberry, about a young redhead girl finding confidence in a world full of blondes and brunettes. Julianne is nominated for a best actress Oscar for her role in Still Alice, the story of a professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at age 50, which hits UK theatres on March 6 . She has another book, Backpacks, launching in July as part of a five-book contract with Random House. With all these non-Hollywood skills and interests, it's easy to forget the reason why Julianne Moore is a household name in the first place - her three-decade-long acting career, for which she has earned five Oscar nominations, two Golden Globes and four BAFTA nods, among many more accolades. But it's certainly not something she takes for granted. She recalled a conversation with her father who remarked that she'd been acting for 30 years. Julianne said: 'I thought, oh my God, I feel lucky that it's gone on for that long and that I've had the experiences that I've had.'","Julianne Moore, 54, is nominated for best actress at the Oscars tonight .

"Thousands of British troops may have withdrawn from Afghanistan after the 13-year conflict came to an end last October. But demand for traditional English food has remained sky-high and one entrepreneur has capitalised on this by opening British-style chippy Mr Cod in war-torn Kabul. The fish and chips shop, which is the first of its kind in the country, is the brainchild  of Afghan-Canadian entrepreneur Bashir Halimi.

"A single mother on benefits has admitted spending £3,000 of taxpayers' cash on a dream round-the-world trip to far flung destinations with her 10-month-old baby daughter. Kay Bird, 28, from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, is unemployed and lives comfortably with her middle-class parents. Her mother Jill, 54, and stepfather lawyer Bob, 61, pay for all her rent, bills and all other outgoings. Unemployed single mother Kay Bird, who has admitted spending £3,000 of taxpayers' cash on a round-the-world trip to far flung destinations with her 10-month-old baby Chloe. She is pictured with her daughter in Dubai . Miss Bird and her young daughter splash around in the Indian Ocean during the trip. The young mother receives more than £8,500 in various benefits . But she still receives more than £8,500 a year in child benefit, income support and tax credits as it is considered that she has a low income. And now she has admitted that she has spent £3,000 of her welfare benefits on a five-week-long trip with her daughter Chloe, where she visited places such as Australia, Bali and Dubai. Miss Bird says she could work but chooses not to so she can take care of her young child. She said: 'No, I don’t need the money as such and I didn't need to go travelling either but I wanted to so I did. 'If someone’s offering you free money and telling you to take it, you’d have to be a fool not to – that’s all I did. 'Once it’s in my bank account it’s up to me how I use it and I decided to spend it on taking the trip of a lifetime. Miss Bird, pictured with her daughter Chloe, says she doesn't need the benefit money as her parents pay for all of her rent and other outgoings but would be a 'fool' not to take 'free money' The round-the-world trip began last month when Miss Bird jetted off to Sydney, right, with Chloe via London. She also visited destinations such as Bali and Sri Lanka, left . 'I don’t feel guilty and I don’t regret it. It started off just as a ­holiday to Athens, then things started to fall into place. 'Each time some more money landed in my account, I booked something. 'I started booking flights and accommodation in Europe in October and was booking something with every payment until a few days before I went.' Miss Bird set off on her round-the-world trip last month when she flew to Sydney via London on January 10. She also visited Athens, Istanbul, Dubai, Colombo in Sri Lanka, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bali and Darwin before returning home via Amsterdam. In total, she spent four months worth of her benefits cash on the trip, paying for 13 flights, travel visas, accommodation and spending money. Her benefits continued to be paid into her bank account while she was away and she returned to the UK just before the five-week travel limit imposed on people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance. It is reported that the 28-year-old spent four months worth of her benefits cash on the trip, paying for 13 flights, travel visas, accommodation and spending money for her and daughter Chloe, right . She added: 'I went to the job centre and told them I wanted to go travelling and they told me there was a five-week limit. I came home just within those five weeks so my benefits didn't get cut off.' Miss Bird had been living in Rome after studying psychology at La Sapienza university in the Italian capital when she became pregnant. After she found out she was expecting a baby, she returned to the UK to live with her parents and visited her local Jobcentre Plus office. Soon after she was claiming £90 a week income support, £90 a month child benefit and £230 a month in tax credits. She said: 'I told them I wanted to register back in the country and they told me I was already eligible for Jobseekers’ Allowance. 'Then a couple of weeks later they said I could switch to income support which meant I didn’t even have to apply for jobs. 'Then I was told I could get tax credits, too. I was really shocked at how generous it was but I wasn’t going to turn it down.' However, she does not receive any money from her daughter's father, a professional rugby player she met in Rome but now lives in Australia, saying she asked him not to pay maintenance because she doesn't need it. Now she says she is planning her next luxury trip for herself and daughter which will be to New Zealand. Among the places that Miss Bird visited were Athens in Greece, left, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, right . But Miss Bird says her way of life could help change the perception of single mothers on benefits. She explained: 'I’m not your regular single mum on benefits who spends it all in McDonald’s and never leaves the town they were born in. 'I’m changing the image of what it is to be a benefits mum and proving that if you do it the right way, you can have ­anything you want. 'They've chosen to eat takeaways and buy the latest gadgets. I chose a different route. 'OK, I don’t have any outgoings so I have been lucky to spend my benefits on this amazing experience but I think single mums get more than enough. 'Of course people are negative and many people get very jealous. 'But I had only been out of Europe once before I went on benefits and now I’ve had the chance to see some incredible things from tropical beaches to the ­skyscrapers of Dubai. 'I never would have been able to afford it without benefits.'","Single mother Kay Bird, 28, is on benefits and lives with her parents .

"Pope Francis has told members of the Italian Mafia they will be welcomed by the Roman Catholic church if they repent their sins and give up organised crime. The Pontiff told an audience of pilgrims and anti-crime activists at the Vatican that they would be free to join the church, if they promised to stop 'serving the cause of evil'. Many of those gathered to hear the Pope had come from the diocese of Cassano allo Jonio in the southern Calabria region, home to the 'Ndrangheta, the mainland Italy equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia. Pope Francis arrives for a special audience at the Vatican with pilgrims and anti-crime activists from the southern Calabria region, home to the Italian Mafia . He told his audience: 'Open your hearts to the Lord. The Lord is waiting for you and the Church will welcome you if your willingness to serve good is clear and public as your choice to serve evil was.' Last June, Pope Francis travelled to Calabria, where he accused organised crime groups of practicing 'the adoration of evil' and said Mafia members had excommunicated themselves from the Church by their actions. His visit to the region last year came after he promised to meet the father of a three-year-old toddler, Nicola 'Coco' Campolongo who was shot dead alongside his grandfather in the town of Cassano allo Ionio. The murders were apparent mafia assassinations over money and the discovery of their bodies in a burnt-out Fiat Punto sent shockwaves through Italy. The Pope greets a baby at the Vatican as he arrived to address an audience. He told them that the Italian Mafia will be welcomed by the Roman Catholic church if they repent their sins and give up organised crime . Pope Francis told the audience: 'Open your hearts to the Lord. The Lord is waiting for you and the Church will welcome you if your willingness to serve good is clear and public as your choice to serve evil was' During his visit to Castrovillari prison, the Pontiff met Coco's father, who was serving time in prison alongside the toddler's mother for drug crimes when their son was killed. It was here that he also denounced the 'Ndrangheta for what he called its 'adoration of evil and contempt for the common good.' 'Those who go down the evil path, as the Mafiosi do, are not in communion with God. They are excommunicated,' he warned. The Pontiff told pilgrims and tourists in St Peter's Square that he and his top aides would be starting a spiritual renewal retreat until Friday in Arricia, a suburb of Rome. The 'Ndrangheta, which makes most of its money from drug trafficking, has spread from Calabria to northern Europe and North America. A 2013 study by Demoskopia, an economic and social research institute, estimated the 'Ndrangheta's annual turnover at some 53 billion euros in 30 countries, equivalent to about 3.5 percent of Italy's total official economic output. It has been much harder for investigators to combat than the Sicilian Mafia because its structure is more lateral than hierarchical and its tightly-knit families are harder to penetrate. Last month 163 people were arrested in a major police crackdown on the 'Ndrangheta with 1,300lb of drugs also seized. Italian police arrest members of the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia gang- said to be the most powerful crime organisation in the country . The Pope's message to the mafia comes as he announced he would be leaving the Vatican for a few days alongside his advisers to work. He said he would be 'correcting the many defects that we all have.' The Pontiff told tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists in St Peter's Square that he and his top aides would be starting a spiritual renewal retreat. Until Friday morning, they will spend time listening to reflections, meditating and praying in Ariccia, a suburb of Rome.","The Pope has urged the Italian Mafia to give up a life of organised crime .

"Treasury minister Danny Alexander said there should be a new offence of 'corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime' Firms which give advice on how to avoid tax will be treated as harshly as tax dodgers themselves under a new law set out by the Lib Dems today. Treasury minister Danny Alexander said there should be a new offence of 'corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime'. He likened the new law to prosecuting someone who acts as an accomplice to a burglar breaking into homes. The Lib Dems set out details of the new laws, which they say will form part of their manifesto if they cannot be put on to the statue book by the coalition before the election. The centrepiece would be a new offence of a corporate failure to prevent economic crime, including aiding or facilitating tax evasion. There would also be a penalty for those that facilitate others to commit tax evasion, so they face the same financial penalty as that repaid in tax and fines by the evader themselves. Codes of practice that apply to tax advisers would also be toughened to make it harder to help people and businesses to avoid tax. Mr Alexander said the idea would also see organisations who encourage tax evasion or make it easier for it to be carried out face the same level of fine as the evaders. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One, Mr Alexander said the idea would create a much stronger deterrent to companies helping tax dodgers. He said: 'Organisations, be they accountants, banks or whatever, who help people evade tax will be liable for this new offence and crucially liable for financial penalties. 'So, for example, if their customers have to pay back hundreds of millions of pounds in tax then those organisations should have to match that with hundreds of millions of pounds of their own money and I think that's a very tough disincentive to them to get involved in this in the first place. 'This is taboo. This is something that absolutely mustn't happen in our society and we still have a problem with some people thinking they can get away without paying their fair share of tax.' Mr Alexander went on: 'This is a Liberal Democrat idea for our manifesto. We've delivered a lot from our last manifesto tackling avoidance, tackling evasion. 'But I am going to seek to pursue this within Government over the next few weeks because I think we do have time potentially in the Budget or through other processes that are going through to take these ideas forward. 'But what I can say is if it we're not able to do that then we absolutely will be making this one of our key things in the general election.' The Lib Dems say their plan also includes making a commitment for the government to see the 'tax gap' - the difference between the total tax owed to the Exchequer and the amount actually collected - fall in each year of the next parliament. Mr Alexander said he wanted to make tax evasion as socially unacceptable as benefit fiddling or drinking and driving . In a statement, Mr Alexander added: 'These new measures will build on the successful strategy that is making tax evasion as socially unacceptable as benefit fiddling or drinking and driving. 'It is a crime, plain and simple. If someone helps a break into your home they end up in the dock as an accomplice. It should be the same if some helps a tax evader.' For Labour, Chris Leslie said nobody will believe Mr Alexander's 'warm words' as the Lib Dems have 'broken their promises on tax'. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: 'Along with the Tories, they have totally failed to tackle tax avoidance and cut taxes for millionaires while raising VAT on families and pensioners. 'The amount of uncollected tax has gone up by £3 billion under Danny Alexander and George Osborne. 'This Government has refused to close loopholes which Labour has highlighted. And ministers still need to explain why there has been just one prosecution out of 1,100 names in the HSBC case and why the head of the bank was made a Tory minister.' Mr Leslie added Labour would have an immediate 'root and branch' review of HMRC to ensure it is 'up to the job'.

"A brave Aussie nurse fighting the war against the devastating disease that is Ebola has shared her story from deep inside 'the Ebola death zone'. Anne Carey, 56, from Esperence in Western Australia has been on the front line in Africa since the outbreak of the killer virus, and has no regrets despite playing almost daily witness to suffering and fatality. She was one of the first Australians to arrive in Sierra Leone, as the disease began to take a deadly hold on the west African country, and speaking to 60 Minutes she revealed the horror and heartbreak of her work. Scroll down for videos . Anne Carey has told of the horror and heartbreak that comes with working as a nurse caring for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone . The West Australian woman said the virus does not discriminate and affects anyone that comes into contact with it . As a volunteer for the Red Cross, Anne is currently on her third trip to the high-risk region, and describes the deadly Ebola crisis as 'an unfair bully' As a volunteer for the Red Cross, Anne is currently on her third trip to the high-risk region, and describes the deadly Ebola crisis as 'an unfair bully'. ‘Sometimes you have to take the bullies on, and win,' she told reporter Michael Usher. Anne recalled the first patient she ever saw just as she had stepped inside a treatment centre, set up especially to treat Ebola patients. 'I got dressed up in the protective suit and there was a mother with her four-week-old child, and that child as soon as I came into the centre  it convulsed, so it fitted, and it proceeded to bleed from everywhere and it just bled to death,' the nurse recalled. She told her story to 60 Minutes on Sunday evening, revealing what the past months have been like for her in Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone . All the volunteers at the centres must take exceptional care when getting 'suited up' to enter the centres . Journalist Michael Usher and a team from 60 Minutes travelled to the deadly zone to report on the crisis . When that young baby died that mother lost her seventh child. 'When this child died she had nothing to live for,' Anne revealed. 'It’s an angry virus yes, it takes everybody. It doesn't matter who you are if you let it in it will take you,' Anne said. During the program she also tells of her struggle to even get into the country, as most commercial flights to the region were cancelled as the outbreak escalated... and then the heartbreak of seeing the virus afflict young and old and how it would claim so many victims, many of those she had cared for. 'It doesn't matter who you are, it affects everybody,' she said, admitting that death is around her, every day. Anne said how sometimes the job is about 'comforting' the sick and dying . The awful reality of working in Ebola afflicted areas in west Africa, as Red Cross workers bury another victim of the virus at the nearby cemetery . 'It doesn't matter who you are, it effects everybody,' Anne Carey said about the Ebola virus which has claimed almost 10,000 lives across parts of west Africa . The 'violent and deadly virus', which has threatened the population of West Africa, has seen already more than 23,000 people infected, with at least 10,000 known to have died from the causes of Ebola. The West Australian nurse started working with Red Cross about 10 years ago. Her previous assignments include missions to Lokichoggio on the Sudan/Kenya border, tending to war-wounded patients at the Red Cross Hospital and she was also stationed at Darfur, Sudan, in the local feeding centres. While working to try and get the Ebola epidemic under control, Anne revealed although lives are always at stake, the process or transferring and treating patients must be meticulous to avoid spreading the deadly virus. At the centre where Anne works there are a number of tents organised by how seriously a person is thought to be suffering. They are arranged in order of severity from suspected, probable to confirmed cases. It was also revealed that victims of the horrific disease may arrive at centres knowing they will die there. Patients become even more contagious after death, and therefore bodies and body bags have to be drenched in chlorine to prevent contamination. Anne Carey places her protective suit on before going to work as a nursing volunteer in Sierra Leone's so-called 'death zone' Red Cross nurse Anne Carey celebrates Christmas at the Red Cross Ebola treatment centre in Kenema with local volunteers who have been working and saving lives since the disease first broke out .

Anne is on her third assignment to help people survive Ebola and control the disease in that part of the world, working as a clinical nurse with the international Red Cross near the town of Kenema and in the Kono district. It's considered among the most seriously affected parts of Sierra Leone. Anne Carey is one of 27 Australian Red Cross aid workers sent to tackle Ebola, working with more than 200 international Red Cross staff members and upwards of 6,100 local volunteers in West Africa. Australian Red Cross is one of the few Australian agencies working on the front-line, trying to help bring the disease under control. Also helping fight the deadly disease is a survivor of Ebola, Edwin. The nurse said she's 'knows when people are going to die', as this man tragically did just the day after filming . Edwin is an Ebola survivor who contacted the disease while working as a nurse. He now has immunity and is continuing to help others fight it . He was exposed to the virus during his work as a nurse, but was one of the lucky ones who survived. He now has immunity from Ebola and is back working with Anne, donating his blood to help others who have contracted the virus. When asked if it felt as though Anne had been to war, she responded that the war wasn't over. 'I feel like I still am, but I feel like we’re going to win the war. 'I think we've got to win the war but I feel like we will, I think in the end we’ll get there,' she said.

Scares remain, however, Sierra Leone placed hundreds of homes in the capital under Ebola quarantine recently after the death of a fisherman who tested positive to Ebola. Less than a month after it lifted all restrictions on movement, the government said 700 properties had been locked down in Aberdeen, a fishing and tourist district of Freetown.

During the official three-day humanitarian visit last week, the Danish Royal visited a refugee camp in Gambella and spoke with locals in the Afar region - one of the hottest places on earth. The mother of four was met by a group of ethnic Afar men performing a welcome dance when she arrived in the region in her United Nations four wheel drive. Scroll down for video . Crown Princess Mary of Denmark spent three days in Ethiopia on an official United Nations humanitarian visit last week . The Danish Royal spoke to  villagers in Afar about the reality of female genital mutilation and child marriages in the African nation . With the Danish Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation, Mogens Jensen, by her side Princess Mary spoke to brightly dressed villagers about the reality of female genital mutilation and child marriages in the African nation. 'You do get shaken up by the knowledge that such a practice still exists but we have to think beyond judging it,' Crown Princess Mary told TV2 Denmark. In the Afar region, newborn babies or young girls have their clitoris cut off with a traditional knife before the opening is sewn closed so only a small hole remains. Princess Mary listened intently as mothers shared stories of their daughters suffering infections and complications from the procedure, which the United Nations condemns as a violation of human rights. She also visited a refugee camp known as 'Tierkidi' in Gambella. The mother of four met and spoke with refugees during her visit to a camp known as 'Tierkidi' in Gambella .

Dr Hamlin, who has lived in Africa for 55 years, embraced Australian-born Mary as she toured the hospital speaking with patients, staff and even visiting a baby girl born on the day she arrived. The philanthropist has made it her mission to cure the women who suffer from obstetric fistula, a condition endured from obstructed labour. 'Mary was taken on a tour of the main ward and she was able to meet staff and patients,' Lucy Perry, CEO of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia in Australia, said. 'She didn’t stand back from them, she went right up to the patient’s bedside and was engaging with them. 'It was a major thrill for staff to meet royalty from Europe.' The Danish Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation, Mogens Jensen (right), took part in the visit with Princess Mary . Last week's visit to Ethiopia was the second and longest trip for Princess Mary, who is a United Nations patron . Princess Mary toured the refugee camp with the help of local children, some of which were carry water cans . The future Queen of Denmark got her hands dirty helping to plant trees at the refugee camp . Princess Mary then joined Dr Hamlin for tea in her cottage on the hospital grounds. 'Mary bought Catherine a set of Danish tea cups, which is so spot on for Catherine,' Ms Perry said. 'They mainly talked about eradicating obstetric fistula in Ethiopia once and for all.' While obstetric fistula was eradicated in the western world in the 1920s, many developing countries still have hundreds of thousands of women who suffer from the injury, which is a hole in the bladder or bowel, that requires surgery. Dr Hamlin established the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital and the Hamlin College of Midwives in the 1950s, and then expanded the operations to five other hospitals.

"A South Carolina family have now spent nine months quarantined in their home and had little to no contact with humans for the past 280 days in a bid to protect their daughter with a rare condition. Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara have opted to stay away from other people to help their daughter Eliza, five, who has the rare metabolism disorder, Sanfilippo syndrome. But they are determined to make sure she does not miss out - recently Eliza's school held a Frozen-themed dance, but as the five-year-old could not attend, her family recreated the dance at their home - much to Eliza's delight.

Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara and their son Beckham have now spent nine months quarantined in their home  to protect their daughter Eliza with a rare condition (all pictured).  Recently Eliza's school held a Frozen-themed dance, but as the five-year-old could not attend, her family recreated the dance at their home - much to Eliza's delight . Glenn O'Neill and Eliza dance in their living room to the Frozen song. Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens . Eliza danced with her father and swayed happily as her parents took to the 'dance floor' in the touching video. But the family are still anxiously waiting for the outcome of a clinical trial they have been raising funds for - so far $2.2million has been donated to the foundation. Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens. Mr O'Neill told MailOnline: 'She is holding on as best she can. We are now nine months into our self-imposed isolation. For 280 days our family has had little to no contact with any people directly, or anything people have touched.' Quarantine: Five-year-old Eliza O'Neill (pictured), who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), has not left her home in Colombia, South Carolina, since May after her family started a voluntary quarantine . Family: Eliza (pictured with her father, Glenn, mother, Cara, and brother Beckham) was born with the terminal disorder . Father and daughter: The youngster (pictured with her father) lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function, causing a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate -  which leads to leaning and behavioral problems . In May Eliza and her brother, Beckham, eight, were pulled out of school and Mrs O'Neill left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Mr O'Neill now works from home as a purchasing consultant. 'Science often does not move at the speed a parent or child would hope, particularly one with a degenerative disease urgently waiting a chance at life,' he said. 'Multiple teams are working on it, but to a parent of a child now 5 years & 3 months with Sanfilippo, time is not on our side. 'We thought we'd be closer to a clinical trial start date by this point. As things stand, even if we get news of success in the drug making soon, we are still likely at least 6 months away. We won't ever give up though. The family do leave their home but only to 'open fields, empty beaches, a state forest.' At home and in hospital: When Eliza's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago, they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday . Sick: And although the five-year-old can still talk, her father, Glenn O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. Above, Eliza is seen in hospital with her mother . The children Skype with teachers and grandparents. The family's food shopping is done by grandmom and everything that enters the house is wiped down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else they need is ordered on Amazon and other online shopping. While they hope the quarantine will keep her healthier for longer and increase her odds to be a candidate for a life-saving clinical trial, Eliza's family realize the only way to really save her is a cure. Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births. Victims lack an enzyme that is essential for normal cellular function. The condition eventually causes a buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Sufferers typically die before they are out of their teens. There is no known cure. They had expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday, which was in November. Although she can still talk, Mr O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. But he added: 'She still is speaking, reciting her letters and counting.' They launched a fundraising campaign for the disease nearly a year ago. They have already gained more than $1.8 million on a GoFundMe page, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza. Although there is no guarantee that the treatment will work - or that Eliza will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try. He said the family will remain in isolation until there is progress and admitted the decision had been 'the hardest of our lives.' 'But, if Eliza were to build up immunity to the AAV9 virus that they are using to deliver the drug product, she would not be selected for the trial...her only chance at life,' he added. Siblings: The O'Neill's have already gained over $2million on a GoFundMe page, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza (seen with her brother) The family's food is ordered online and all of the groceries have to be wiped down with disinfectant wipes when they arrive at the house .","Eliza O'Neill, of South Carolina, suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A)

"A series of adorable images of a baby boy and his pet dog are guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Taken over several months, the photographs show the pair dressed in a range of identical costumes. Rescue mongrel Zoey and ten-month-old baby Jasper are seen wearing anything from Mexican sombreros to bunny ears and space helmets as they sit  side-by-side in all the shots. How fetching! Ten-month-old Jasper and his pet pooch Zoey star in a photo series wearing a huge variety of matching costumes, including astronaut helmets, sombreros and bunny ears . Zoey, a rescue dog, wears a viking hat in complete with braids, while Jasper smiles next to her . The  photographs are the brain child of Jasper's mother Grace Chon, 34, from Los Angeles, who came up with the idea after dreaming up ways of getting creative between nap times. Incredibly, Zoey needed little training in front of the camera and in fact eagerly sits in her special spot each time the costumes come out. Since Zoey has joined the family, both baby and pooch have become inseparable despite Zoey's initial fear of humans. Tragically, Zoey was found shivering in the gutter outside a restaurant in Taiwan but was rescued by a passing student. The dynamic duo sit patiently while wearing a pair of colanders for size . Ay carumba! The brains behind the adorable photo series is Jasper's mum, Grace Chon, 34, from Los Angeles, who came up with the idea after dreaming up ways of getting creative between nap times . Jasper and his furry friend do their best Easter bunny impression - but Zoey looks less than amused . Hipster cool: The pair are too cute in knitted hats complete with bobbles and beards . Zoey and Jasper look adorably studious in thick-framed Harry Potter-style glasses . But it was only after searching on the internet for a dog to adopt that Grace discovered Zoey and instantly fell in love. Grace said: 'It surprisingly wasn't difficult when I started the series to get both Zoey and Jasper looking straight into the camera. 'Usually when I photograph dogs, I use high reward treats or toys to get them to cooperate and look into the lens, however, Zoey for some unexplainable reason just loves dressing up and loves the camera. According to Grace, Zoey 'for some unexplainable reason just loves dressing up and loves the camera' Oh, la la! The friends channel their inner Frenchmen in berets, with Jasper sporting a drawn-on moustache . They got kitted out in rainbow workout gear for one of the cute photos . 'As soon as she sees the hats come out, she goes to her spot and poses, without the help of any enticing treat. 'There weren't very many places to take Jasper other than the grocery store or with me running errands, and I was looking for something fun for us to do in between his nap times. 'One day I put one of Jasper's hats on Zoey and had the epiphany that baby hats look really adorable on dogs, I shot an image of them sitting side-by-side wearing the same hat and the series was born.' The duo do casual style in matching purple hooded sweatshirts . Grace said of adopting her dog: 'One day on a pet adoption website I spotted a little puppy's face staring back at me and I just knew in an instant that I had to adopt her' Tragically, Zoey was found shivering in the gutter outside a restaurant in Taiwan but was rescued by a passing student . Jasper pulls a cute face as they strike a pose in identical orange headphones . Grace said of adopting her dog: 'One day on a pet adoption website I spotted a little puppy's face staring back at me and I just knew in an instant that I had to adopt her. 'Her mother gave birth to Zoey and her siblings in front of a restaurant in Taiwan, but the owner of the restaurant came and promptly hosed them away because it was considered bad luck to have black dogs by the restaurant. 'Zoey was the runt of the litter and very sickly, so she's extremely shy and terrified of new people. I honestly wasn't sure if she would ever warm up to Jasper at all. Grace said that Zoey started out being very shy around people, but now she is the first to run into Jasper's room when he wakes up . 'Every new moment Zoey and Jasper share is a true triumph for Zoey overcoming her fears and I couldn't be prouder of her,' said Grace . The pair are two peas in a pod as they pose in matching party hats . The photographer has two other rescue dogs - Maeby and Funke - she and her family have adopted in addition to Zoey . Grace said she is 'so proud of Jasper for being such a gentle, compassionate little boy' 'When Jasper was seven months old, Zoey rolled over to show Jasper her belly and asked for a belly rub. 'It was such a huge turning point for her, because before this she wouldn't let him get near her, after that, she warmed up to him so quickly that she would be the first to run into his room in the morning when he woke up. 'Every new moment Zoey and Jasper share is a true triumph for Zoey overcoming her fears and I couldn't be prouder of her, I am also so proud of Jasper for being such a gentle, compassionate little boy.'","Grace Chon, 34,  snaps photos of baby Jasper and her rescue dog Zoey .

"The Islamic State is being funded by black-market oil trading, illegal drugs and internet cafes, a local activist group has claimed. The group claims that the most important financial resources of ISIS-controlled areas in Syria are secret deals with the Assad regime to sell the government electricity and gas from dams controlled by the militants. The Islamic State is also imposing strict taxes on its citizens, charging for electricity, phone bills and customs on imported goods, anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently reports. Scroll down for video . Oil, drugs and taxes: A report on how the Islamic State is funded has revealed that the militants have a secret deal to sell electricity to the Syrian government and is growing cannabis which it sells in Turkey . Unlike the core al-Qaeda terrorist network, ISIS gets only a small share of funding from deep-pocket donors and therefore does not depend primarily on moving money across international borders. Despite several attempts by the coalition forces to cut off funding to the Islamic State militants, the organisation continues to thrive and find independent ways to create capital . Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently(RBSS) is a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression ISIS has brought to their home city. In its most recent report on ISIS's funding, RBSS outlines ten ways the militants fund their crusade to create a Muslim caliphate. The group claims that ISIS and the Syrian government has struck a secret deal which enables the militants to sell electricity and gas to the Assad regime. Crude ways: The leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, funds his organisation by fining citizens who break sharia law and extracting oil from fields in areas under ISIS control . Terrifying rise: Despite several attempts by the coalition forces to cut off funding to ISIS, the organisation continues to thrive and find independent ways to create capital . Growth of terror: Since its formation as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in 2013 - it has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya - while building support among marginalised Muslims in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . Fightback: The majority of ISIS' territory lies inside Iraq and Syria but there have been recent reports of defections in Syria, while Iraq plan to retake its second city of Mosul from the Jihadists . The Islamic State controls several important dams as well as a gas field in its occupied areas of Syria. 1. Sales of electricity and gas to the Syrian government through ISIS-controlled dams and gas fields. 2. Taxes on citizens of the Islamic State . 3. Customs revenue on import and export of goods in the caliphate . 4. Exporting goods such as fruits, vegetables, grains and fabrics . 5. Internet cafes . 6. Religious taxes – punishment for smokers, missing prayers and breaking sharia law . 7. Confiscating private lands and selling it on public auction . 8. Selling crude oil on the black market in Turkey . 9. Growing and selling drugs and black market cigarettes and alcohol . 10. Looting museums and selling artefacts on the black market . Source: Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently . Even though the citizens of Raqqa and Islamic State live under strict sharia law, ISIS leaders appear to have no qualms about growing and selling illegal drugs to others, with cannabis being grown on the outskirts of the city to be sold on to Turkey. The report also reveals details of the of taxes and fines imposed on citizens of Raqqa, ISIS's 'de facto' capital. This includes flat-rate taxes on electricity, 'hygiene services' and use of the telephone network, paid in cash to ISIS's very own revenue agency, called Al Hisba, as well as customs on imported and exported goods. Another interesting source of income is Internet cafes, which RBSS calls 'one of the most profitable trades for ISIS'. The number of internet cafes in Raqqa has increased from 20 to 500 since the Islamic State came to power, according to the group. As reported by the U.S. Treasury Department last year, ISIS is earning about $1million a day from black market oil and fuel sales by using primitive ways of extracting crude oil from fields in ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq and Syria. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently also lists fines on breaking sharia law by smoking or being late to prayer, looting and selling historical artefacts and confiscating private land from locals who disagree with the ways of the caliphate  and selling it at public auction.","ISIS has secret deal with Syria to sell electricity and gas, say activists .

"Want to know what boho babes Poppy Delevnigne, Kate Moss and Sienna Miller will be wearing next season? Look no further than Matthew Williamson's AW15 collection. Taking the crown for best show venue, Matthew unveiled his designs at the decadently designed Criterion restaurant in central London on Sunday. The mystical and bright hued collection was inspired by the signs of the Zodiac and by taking such a point of reference, he maintains that his designs cater to  every woman's tastes. Matthew Williamson's beautifully bohemian designs for AW15 were inspired by signs of the Zodiac . Flowing silk dresses came slashed to the hip and were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by  birth flowers, horoscope signs and stones. Fur is officially in fashion come autumn, if Matthew's catwalk is anything to go by. Shaggy Mongolian lamb and shearling in topaz,  teal, and pink sent Instagram into a furry frenzy. Want to know what Poppy Delevingne and Sienna Miller will be wearing next season? Just look to Matthew's upcoming collection for a clue . Flowing silk dresses were given an injection of sex appeal with slashes . Glittering jumpers and dresses were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by birth flowers, horoscope signs and stones . Beauty-wise, Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon created a look echoing the garments we saw on the runway. 'I wanted to do something that complimented the feminine curves of his clothes and the zodiac signs, which are very structured,' she told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show. Lisa explained that she wanted Matthew's girl to be a cool Brit - a muse he sticks to season upon season and one that reflects his clientele. After prepping the skin and eyes, Lisa added volume and definition to the models' brows with cult product, Gimme Brow, brushing up the inner corners for an 'undone' look. The brand's Boi-ing concealer was the key product behind the look and Lisa used it to prep eyes before 'layering and layering' cream and metallic shadows six times. Black bad gal waterproof eyeliner was used on the upper lash and water line and Lisa reapplied concealer to fill in gaps and add depth. 'Using concealer is perfect because you can also cover any mistakes without having to use makeup remover,' she said. The brand's best-selling They're Real mascara was used on only the top lashes to keep eyes 'looking wide awake'. The beauty look echoed the designs and Lisa Potter-Dixon explained that she wanted Matthew's girl to be a cool Brit - a muse he sticks to season upon season and one that reflects his clientele . Hello Flawless Oxygen Wow gave a glowing complexion and Hoola bronzer provided the contouring. Rather than using a liquid highlighter, Lisa opted for long wear powder shadow in Gilt-y to highlight. 'I've applied it onto the bridge of the nose and cheekbones and buffed it in to complement the jewel tones of his collection and the beautiful building we're in,' she explained. 'Matthew's girl will literally blend in with the ceiling.' For lips, boi-oing concealer came into play once more, and was mixed with hydra-smooth lip colour in Air Kiss. Lisa shunned lip liner and simply patted the duo into models' lips with a slick of gloss for a 'healthy' finish. Benefit beautified the models, left, while Mark Hampton for Toni & Guy Hair Meet Wardrobe coiffed their locks to perfection, right . Mark Hampton for Toni & Guy Hair Meet Wardrobe coiffed the models' locks to perfection. 'We're going for that cool 70s girl; she's very Matthew,' he told us. He began by prepping the hair with heat protecting mist and hair was given some oomph courtesy of 3d Volumiser. Glamour Sky High Volume Dry Shampoo was used to take off any shine before he created movement, waves and bends using two different size tongs. He did a touch of backcombing at the crown to give it a 'hippy Woodstock' vibe (something we witnessed here last season, too). Two pieces of the models' hair were then clipped back by their ears using invisible elastic bands, which Mark explained stopped it from looking 'too retro' or 'puffy'. 'The girl this season is older and cooler,' he added. 'It's a punky 70s vibe but real, as though the girl had done it herself. 'It's organised chaos.'","Matthew's AW15 show was held at glittering Criterion restaurant .

"It's a label adored by the Duchess of Cambridge - and the one she wore to announce her engagement to Prince William in 2010. But with a new creative director taking over the helm at Issa, there was potential for a huge shake-up. Luckily for Kate - and Issa's army of loyal fans - new creative director Jamie O'Hare stuck to the tried and tested method that has made the brand so popular in royal circles. Jamie O'Hare unveiled his debut collection for Issa in London today . Adding his own touch, the trademark jersey dress was given an asymmetric hem and came emblazoned with more interesting prints. The 70s throwback (which is being championed all over the catwalks) was omnipresent, with coats and dresses coming heavily fringed. Models stomped down the runway in textured jumpsuits, turtle neck dresses with bold stripes and statement red dresses, which were worn almost exclusively with black boots. Ultimately, Jamie's play-it-safe debut collection will no doubt please customers (including a certain royal one). Models stomped down the runway in flowing dresses with bold stripes,  worn almost exclusively with boots . The brand's trademark jersey dress - loved by Kate - was given an asymmetric hem . Beauty-wise, Vidal Sassoon Global Ambassador, Duffy, aimed to capture the collections ethos of 'movement' when coiffing models' hair. 'I was asked to create a curtain of hair that could float, with a strong silhouette that played to the underlying gothic element within the collection,' he told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show. 'The collection is precisely worked, with an attention to detail and couture-like craftsmanship in the clothes and this inspired the beautiful, ""high quality"" hair.' As with the collection, Duffy was aiming for an element of effortlessness with an undertone of attitude. Requiring little more than freshly shampooed and conditioned hair and a salon-quality blow dry, the look is all about simplicity. 'I was asked to create a curtain of hair that could float, with a strong silhouette that played to the underlying gothic element within the collection,' Vidal Sassoon Global Ambassador, Duffy, told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show . Hair was kept flat at the roots and a round brush was used to add body through the lengths and ends to create movement. The minimal styling gives the hair looseness so that the lengths part as the girl walks. Duffy added: 'The intention was to exaggerate the healthiness and recreate the look of virgin hair - and the result is a strong silhouette of completely clean, heavy, super-shiny hair that amplifies perfection.' Make-up came courtesy of legendary Val Garland using L’Oreal Paris. 'We are chanelling Donatella,' she told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show. She etched on a strong graphic eye in matte black, which was 'cool' and 'a bit gothy'. Lips were pared back in nudey pink, while skin was similarly peachy. 'It's matte, pretty and, above all, wearable,' she said of the final look. Nails, painted by Marian Newman, were metallic blue and beetle winged because, according to the queen of talons, they're back...and we won't argue with her.","Jamie O'Hare stuck to the tried and tested method .

"Councils have been criticised after it emerged an event they are sending workers to has advised packing ibuprofen and vitamin C - to beat hangovers. Around 118 public officials are being flown out to the French Riviera to attend the taxpayer-funded four-day event in March. But organisers of the Marche International Des Professionnels De L’Immobilier (MIPIM) have warned attendees the trip will cause 'exhaustion' thanks to its action-packed party schedule. Council workers have been told to pack ibuprofen and vitamin C to beat hangovers at an international property event in Cannes, France. Attendees are pictured above at last year's event enjoying a cool beer in the sun . Workers will be wined and dined at the prestigious Palais Des Festivals, which also hosts the Cannes Film Festival, as they try to secure future investment for their areas. Individual tickets cost £1,160. A guide to the international property fair, written as part of a blog on the official event's website, said: 'Networking extends into late evening and for some that means the wee hours of morning. 'Yes, it happens to the best of us. And yes, we feel pretty rotten the next day. Magic fix? A good ibuprofen and a heavy dose of Vitamin C usually does the trick. At least until midday...' But the flippant advice has sparked outrage. John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's stunning to see them blow huge sums on a jolly.' A blog on The Marche International Des Professionnels De L’Immobilier's website advises any attendees to be prepared to take a 'heavy dose of vitamin C' The Marche International Des Professionnels De L’Immobilier (MIPIM) is an annual event held in Cannes (above) Workers will be wined and dined at the prestigious Palais Des Festivals (pictured above), which hosts the Cannes Film Festival .

The Scottish Government has also paid £18,500 for tickets for a 16-strong team under its 'Cities Alliance' banner. Two employees from Edinburgh City Council have been given a budget of £2,454 for 'travel and accommodation'. The council was unable to estimate the cost of food and drink. Individual tickets cost £1,160. Delegates are pictured above eating, drinking and enjoying the beautiful view at the 2014 MIPIM show . Cannes is known for its luxury yachts and beautiful scenery. Several delegates do business at the 2014 MIPIM show (above) Glasgow City Council is also sending a team but added that 'it's impossible' to reveal the true cost to the taxpayer until after the event. Highland Council, which is planning to shed up to 1,000 jobs over the next five years, is sending delegates. Local politicians and employees are also attending from Aberdeen, Dundee, Newcastle and Perth. A Cities Alliance spokesman said: 'We can't give final costs.

"The beauty of the world's most famous skylines simply cannot be denied. From Toronto's skyscraping CN Tower, which reaches an impressive 1,814 ft (553 metres), to Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 2,722ft (829.8 metres), these cosmopolitan cityscapes are as imposing as they are impressive. While architectural preferences are subjective, of course, building data and project management website, Emporis, has a definitive ranking of the visual impact offered by skylines in major cities worldwide. Scroll down for video . Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is home to the stunning Petronas Towers, though the city's 608 buildings tally just 8,077 floors altogether . Shanghai's futuristic skyline is not to be missed, especially the Oriental Pearl Radio & TV Tower, which is dotted with LED lights . Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a population of over 11 million, has 5,734 buildings considered by Emporis, with 17,859 floors in total . Toronto's skyline is most recognised for the CN Tower, which stands 1,814ft (553 metres) tall and overlooks Lake Ontario . However, their analysis only reflects completed high-rise buildings and does not include bridges, masts or other aesthetically-pleasing structures, like Sydney's Opera House, for example. Emporis assigns each building points based on its floor count and the point total for each city is calculated. Currently in top spot? Hong Kong, which boasts 7,794 skyscrapers with a combined floor count of 133,531. Hong Kong's closest competitor is New York City, which is home to 6,090 buildings and a score of 43,101. The central business district in Sydney looks gorgeous when viewed from offshore, in particular the iconic Opera House building . The Seattle skyline - photographed from Kerry Park at night - illuminates the majestic Mount Rainier in the background . The Chongqing municipality in China boasts a rapidly rising skyline and has 12 buildings with heights of more than 650ft (200 metres) Rio de Janeiro overlooks the Guanabara Bay and is most recognisable due to the iconic Christ the Redeemer sitting high atop the city . The tiny island of Macau is home to the 47-storey Grand Lisboa hotel which looks like a giant fan reflected over the Pearl River . The Chicago skyline, as viewed from the Sears Tower, is a great Midwestern alternative to the oft-photographed New York City skyline . The downtown Seoul skyline comes in fourth place in the Emporis rankings with 3,023 buildings totalling 21,098 floors . Singapore's skyline has the unique feature of being home to the world's most expensive building: the multi-billion dollar Marina Bay Sands . The Manhattan skyline is one of the most photographed in the world, with the Empire State Building at its centre . Las Vegas is known for its glittering Strip, which includes a mini Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower, among other replica landmarks . Dubai's skyline is home to the world's highest building, the Burj Khalifa, which towers more than 2,722ft (829.8 metres) Rio's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue, though not considered in the Emporis rankings, gives the South American city a boost in our own MailOnline Travel rankings, especially when photographed overlooking the stunning Guanabara Bay. Similarly, Chicago's impressive skyline, set along the shores of Lake Michigan, offers a great alternative to the excessively photographed New York City landscape. Singapore's glittering ferris wheel and the world's most expensive building - the Marina Bay Sands - help this city skyrocket to the top of the list. Meanwhile, Shanghai's light-studded Oriental Pearl Radio & TV Tower  helps to complete the futuristic aesthetic of China's third most-populous city.","Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower, which is the highest building in the world, measures 2,700ft from the ground .

"This river in northern India has become an isolated sanctuary teeming with wildlife thanks to centuries of urban legend, tragedies and bandits who terrified locals with horrendous acts of violence - but it may be undone in just a matter of years. Nearby villagers had long believed that the Chambal River, and the infertile soil surrounding it, was cursed or too dangerous to traverse, making it largely a no-go zone. Their fears allowed the area to become a haven for crocodiles, jackals, river dolphins and endangered birds, which lay small speckled eggs in the sand. India's Chambal River is teeming with wildlife, including crocodiles, but it is facing growing environmental threats from humans . Indian villagers cross the Chambal River on a packed ferry near Bhopepura village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . A man drinks straight from the Chambal River as villagers wade through the shallow waters after crossing on a ferry . Chicks and speckled eggs of the endangered Indian skimmer rest in a pit nest in a sandbar on the banks of the river . What makes the Chambal River so remarkable is that it thrived and remained essentially wild while the rest of the region developed into a deeply-polluted industrial belt. The stench of industrial fumes fills the air in towns and tons of raw sewage is dumped every day into many rivers. But the Chambal itself is now facing threats from humans like never before, raising fears about the fate of its creatures, including several varieties of birds and rare crocodile-like gharials, which can be found nowhere else on the planet. Garbage is piling up, plastic bags blow through the ravines, increased farming has led to fertiliser and pesticide runoff, and factories, construction projects and stone quarries are dumping pollutants straight into the river or its tributaries. An Indian villager follows a camel, carrying a load of firewood, as they cross the Chambal River near Bhopepura village . The Chambal region is home to rare crocodile-like gharials, which can be found nowhere else on the planet . Hundreds of storks, geese, babblers, larks and other birds nest along the river, which is facing an uncertain future . Dr Rajiv Chauhan, a scientist with the India-based Society for Conservation of Nature, told the Associated Press: ‘In the old days, there weren't many people here to interfere with the river. ‘But with the bandits gone, the pressure on the river is now just too much.’ Beliefs that the river was unholy have faded and the last of the famed outlaws was killed by police in 2005 after their political patrons were driven out of office. Indian villagers alight from a ferry after crossing the Chambal River near Bhopepura village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . Development along the river is booming after the last of the bandits, who had enormous power in the region, were killed or driven away . For hundreds of years, bandits, who wielded enormous power, ruled the labyrinth of scrub-filled ravines and tiny villages along the river . Deep pits are visible near the bank of the Chambal River after they were dug out by illegal sand miners near Sagarpada . The bandits held enormous power in the poverty-stricken and lawless region. Now that they are gone, villagers regularly traverse the river with camels or boats ferrying people from one side to the other. Yet the river is facing many environmental threats even though a 250-mile stretch was declared an official sanctuary nearly 40 years ago. As people take advantage of cheap land and untapped resources, today’s biggest concerns include corruption, which is leading to deforestation and illegal sand mining for concrete production, and India’s undertrained and underfunded wildlife agencies. For years villagers were afraid to venture near the river because of the presence of bandits and the belief that it was unholy . Labourers who are paid $15 a day load sand onto tractor trolleys at an illegal sand mine on the banks of the Chambal River . Villagers prepare for the cremation of an elderly woman on the banks of the Chambal River near Bhopepura village in Uttar Pradesh . Flames rise from the cremation pyre of an elderly woman along the banks of the river, which is under threat from pollution and corruption . One of the illegal sand mines can be found near the village of Bhopepura, where men can earn an attractive $15 a day (just under £10) to shovel sand for bosses who they claim have paid off local officials. One of the labourers, Gopal, told the Associated Press: 'What is a sanctuary? What is a mammal? What is a bird? I don't have time to worry about these things.' Hemruda Singh, an aristocrat with a crumbling family fort overlooking the river from Bhareh, has watched the transformation as dirt paths became paved roads, making villages easily accessible from the outside world. He worries about the future of the region as corruption takes hold and people ignore the environment, adding: ‘We were so isolated for so long.’","Northern India's Chambal River is teeming with wildlife, including crocodiles, river dolphins and endangered birds .
Villagers had long believed the river and its infertile soil were cursed or too dangerous to traverse .
There were beliefs that the river was unholy, and bandits terrorised locals with violence and robberies .
River is now being pumped full of pollutants as people take advantage of cheap land and untapped resources ."
"New parents Yasmin and Michael Burley say all they want is a screaming child and long, sleepless nights. Instead, their six-week old baby, Tate, is quietly fighting for his life at Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital. Tate was born at 35 weeks with an extremely rare brain disorder, Miller Dieker Lissencephaly Syndrome, which means he will never cry or feed properly, and will probably not live past the age of five. 'We just want him to cry,' Ms Burley told the Sunday Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Baby Tate was born at just 1.7kg with an extremely rare brain disorder which means he can't cry or feed, and will develop severe intellectual disability . The Miller Dieker Lissencephaly Syndrome affects most of Tate's major neural systems and his parents are told his brain will not develop past the three month stage. Tate's brain is abnormally smooth, without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses. 'I had to come to terms with Tate possibly being blind, deaf and having seizures,' wrote his mother to a Facebook page marking her son's journey. 'The word seizure makes me gasp. It is a fact and it will happen.' A rare birth defect of the brain caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17. People with lissencephaly have an abnormally smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which cause intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and feeding difficulties. Feeding and swallowing problems are common, and can be complicated by aspiration pneumonia. Seizures usually begin before six months of age, and some occur from birth. Children with this condition usually die in infancy or childhood and it is normally caused by respiratory complications. MDS is  usually not inherited from the parents . A milestone for the family was when Tate managed to suck 6-10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed. Another was when they heard him 'squeak'. 'Tate has no ability to cry however we also witnessed a sound today when he got restless .. Not a cry or scream but definitely a squeak!,' Ms Burley posted. But after just four days at home, Tate developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency. His mother thought he was dieing. 'Granny & I watched Tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air, dropping saturations & an excessively weak heart rate, white with blue lips, eyes rolled in his head, body flopped,' she said. Little Tate is now recovering with mum in hospital. She calls him her 'silent fire.' 'Today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things I cannot change for my son and except reality as it challenges me,' Ms Burley wrote on Saturday. 'No one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ...stand up, be an advocate for your child, don't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because I learnt today that I'm educated in what a palliative care patient is.' Yasmin Burley with her son Tate who has been diagnosed with Miller-Dieker Lissencephaly, a rare congenital birth defect with no cure . The Burleys say it is especially hard to explain to their older sons, Zane and Kye, what is happening to their baby brother. But they hope to be home as a family again soon. Friends and family have launched a MyCause fundraising campaign to help pay for Tate's care and more research into the condition. They hope to raise $100,000. 'Research is majorly lacking in Australia,' Michael Burley told Daily Mail Australia. 'The more awareness the better for other families.' The campaign has so far raised over $11,000. 'With this current money we can provide Tate with a respiratory sleep machine, correct bedding and feeding apparatus at home for the next few months without having to worry,' says Ms Burley. For now, the family are fighting with Tate and trying not to think too far ahead. The hardest thing, they say, is 'the not knowing.' Baby Tate Burley has  difficulty taking a bottle by himself and will be lucky to live up to the age of five .

"Rebecca Tootle (pictured) attacked Ashley Meadowcroft with a knife after he turned up unannounced at her house in Blackburn, Lancashire, with a Pit Bull terrier . A devious bride-to-be who claimed she 'legally killed' an unarmed teenager has been jailed for nine years. Rebecca Tootle  attacked Ashley Meadowcroft, 18, with a knife during a confrontation at her front door after he turned up uninvited with his Pit Bull terrier. He suffered a fatal knife wound to his lung and died in hospital 45 minutes later despite efforts to save him. Tootle, 20, told police Mr Meadowcroft had brought the knife to her house and even  scratched her arm before they arrived to make her story more viable. But despite making legal history by being the first defendant to argue under the new defence of 'disproportionate force'  she was found guilty of manslaughter at Preston Crown Court on Friday. Police were called to Tootle's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, on September 4 last year. She claimed she had 'loads of trouble' with the teenager and told police he had stalked her, robbed her and tried to rape her. As officers arrested Mr Meadowcroft she told them: 'He's a f***ing d***, he's stabbed me so I took the knife off him and stabbed him self-defence. 'He could have killed me. He could have definitely killed my fiancé. He broke into my address. I didn't do it on purpose.' Paul Reid, prosecuting, said that before the killing Tootle was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two  friends who had all fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft. She had previously sent a text message to a friend claiming to know about a new law that would mean she could kill someone and not be sent to prison. It said: 'I’d love to see him [Meadowcroft] break into my house when I’m there because three legal marks on me and I can actually kill him.' The 20-year-old (left) told police that 18-year-old Mr Meadowcroft (right) had stabbed her and even cut herself on the arm to try and make her story more viable . In a  999 call after the stabbing she told operators that Mr Meadowcroft had a dangerous dog and could be heard screaming: 'Help me, help me, I've been stabbed.' Mr Reid said: 'When police got there she showed a small mark on one of her arms and was saying: ""I had to take the knife off him because he's mental"". 'But Mr Meadowcroft never had a knife, he did not try to stab the defendant and he caused her no injury to her arm. 'The defendant was lying about all these matters within a short time of her having plunged the knife into Mr Meadowcroft's chest.' He added that Tootle consciously armed herself with the knife before she went to answer the door. She discarded the weapon in her garden after the attack. He said: 'The idea that a few marks on her would justify her in killing someone who had come into her house was not something that had just occurred to her that night. Mr Meadowcroft (right), a former former friend of Tootle (left; and together, right), suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung. He died in hospital 45 minutes later . 'She had previously spoken about this in messages that police extracted from her mobile phone.' After being told Mr Meadowcroft had died Tootle said: 'I stabbed him but if I didn't it would have been me or my boyfriend. 'I did it, yeah, but he came into the house. It was unlocked and he had an illegal dog. 'What if it was me or my fiancé Mos. I heard the door smash. I went down and he had a knife in his hand. 'Mos was holding his wrist. I grabbed hold of his hand and tried to get the knife and it went in. If I intended to kill him, I would have stabbed him in the heart.' Preston Crown Court (above) heard Tootle - who was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two other friends - had fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft and the group had moved house to get away from him . Police described Tootle as a 'violent individual' who had previously dialled 999 on a number of occasions to falsely claim someone was in her house with a knife. Detective Inspector Andy Cribbin, from Lancashire Police, said: 'Tootle took it upon herself to attack Ashley and then fabricate an account portraying herself as the victim. 'She armed herself with a knife, attacked him and then set about trying to justify what she did and never took any responsibility for her actions. 'Prior to the attack she falsely claimed Ashley had a knife and immediately afterwards she said that she had disarmed him and then used the knife to inflict a minor injury upon herself in an attempt to defend her actions. 'The trial has heaped further misery on the family and friends of Ashley.' Mr Meadowcroft's family said in a statement: 'Ashley was not an angel, he had his mistakes, but he did turn his life around and he did not deserve to die.' A memorial left to their son is pictured above . Judge Tim Holroyde told Tootle she was 'sly and manipulative' and posed a 'danger' to the public. He said: 'Having observed you throughout the trial there can in my judgement be no doubt whatsoever that you are dangerous. By your act, although you did not intend it, you ended a young life.' Mr Meadowcroft's family said in a statement: 'Ashley was not an angel, he had his mistakes, but he did turn his life around and he did not deserve to die. 'Murder and manslaughter are just labels, but Rebecca Tootle got what she deserved.' The trial was the first in Britain where the defence of 'disproportionate force' was put forward under an amendment the Crime and Courts Act 2013. The new law means that if somebody is acting in an 'extreme circumstance' such as a burglary, they can use 'necessary' force to stop the offender.","Rebecca Tootle jailed for nine years at Preston Crown Court .

"Do you think being super-fit, running five miles into work each morning and hitting the gym every evening is the best way to prepare for conceiving a child? Think again. According to Dermot O'Connor, acupuncturist and author of The Fertility Code, women who do lots of exercise are actually considerably less fertile than those who don't do any at all. 'Most people assume that the fitter you are the more fertile you are,' O'Connor told MailOnline. 'But . evidence shows it's almost exactly the opposite; studies have shown that the fitter you are, often the less . fertile you are.' Dermot O'Connor's book The Fertility Code explains how couples can create the optimum conditions for conceiving naturally or with the help of IVF . He continued: 'Before a set of Harvard studies, the assumption was that 45 minutes of exercise a day five days a week would be the optimum amount of exercise a woman could do if she was trying to have a baby. 'But the research - which surprises people - proved that that amount actually dramatically decreases your chances of conceiving. The optimum amount of exercise is no . exercise, or very gentle exercise.' And it is advice that was heeded by the Duchess of Cambridge: Kate is said to have swapped her gruelling gym sessions for light walks in the park with her dog Lupo before she became pregnant. O'Connor added: 'Of course, the results need to be tempered because if you are overweight then losing weight by doing exercise helps fertility. But if you are normal weight or underweight then strenuous exercise is detrimental.' The Duchess of Cambridge, left, is reported to have given up strenuous exercise in order to improve her chances of becoming pregnant . The author and practitioner went on: 'After all, the body is intelligent: if you push yourself to run seven miles in the gym every day the body thinks you are migrating. It doesn't consider that optimum conditions to have a baby so the reproductive system effectively shuts down.' 'By far the best way of both losing weight and creating ideal conditions for conceiving are through diet. The key approach to losing weight needs to be calorific. Exercise comes a very . distant second.' O'Connor has adapted his . latest book, The Fertility Code, from his 2006 best-seller The Healing . Code, which advocates a five-pronged approach to recovering from serious . illness. 'That book dealt with my . own story of being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1998. I . developed an approach to helping my self heal using nuttrition, . exercise, and different therapies including herbal medicines and . acupuncture. I then became a trained acupuncturist.' Dermot O'Connor with his new book, The Fertility Code, in which he explains his five-pronged approach to helping couples conceive a baby . Though O'Connor's own story was about neurological issues, he quickly found that 70 per cent of his clients were visiting him for help with fertility problems. 'If you help someone with a back problem they may tell ten people. But if you help someone have a baby they tell the whole word. So I soon became known as ""the fertility person"". 'My method isn't foolproof, it's a mulch-dimensional approach to optimising a couple's lifestyle to give maximum chance of things happening naturally. 'I have helped thousands of couples conceive - probably around 50 per cent of my clients have had success - and a high proportion within four months of coming to see me. I also work with fertility clinics and totally support work they do.' Everyone knows about the birds and the bees but it's all about understanding ovulation timing' 1. Look at the scientific basics of timing . Everyone knows about the birds and the bees but it's all about understanding ovulation and how important timing is when it comes to trying for a baby . 2. The psychological aspect . This is not to be underestimated. If you're trying for a baby and it's not working you will become stressed, which is not conducive to conceiving. In my method I don't just say 'de-stress', I offer programs explaining exactly how to do this and teach ways of implementing  and mind exercises. 3. Nutrition . There are foods that are helpful to conceiving - such as dark leafy greens and flax seeds - and foods that are injurious, such as meat - red meat in particular. Dairy products are a bit more debatable but my inclination is to avoid them altogether - women who don't eat . dairy products seem to stay fertile for longer than women who do. And I believe dairy is not really meant for human consumption, it's meant for cows. 4. Detoxification . Coffee is not great - even a relatively small intake of caffeine can have a seriously . negative effect on conception. Once you've had three cups of coffee it's the same as smoking 25 cigarettes a day. I discuss ways of eliminating toxins in your body, in particular tobacco, nicotine, caffeine and . alcohol. Unfortunately even relatively small amounts of alcohol hinder . chances of becoming pregnant. 5. Exercise . It seems to have been proved that the fitter you are, often the less . fertile you are. If you are overweight exercise helps, but if you are normal weight or underweight then exercise . is detrimental.

Collette Hempenstall, 46, Bray in County Wicklow, Ireland: . 'For as long as I can remember I wanted a baby. I had a few relationships and during the longest one, we did try, but it never happened. 'In 1996 some cysts were found on my ovaries and I was told conceiving would be hard. I was devastated. I tried to carry on but in the back of my mind were thoughts I would never become a mum. 'After my 30th birthday I started looking into artificial insemination. As I was single there was nowhere in Ireland that would help me, so I found a clinic in London. I looked into all the details, saved the money and went for it. 'It was so heartbreaking when the pregnancy test came back negative, but it only made me more determined. 'It was on my third try that I met my partner Kevin through a dating website. 'We got to know each other very well via phone and text for about a year before we actually met and I'm glad it happened that way. 'I told him about my health problems and that I really wanted a baby, and he was happy for me to try to get pregnant. We tried naturally for about six months, then a friend mentioned acupuncture. 'I found Dermot O’Connor in the phone book, and he was fantastic and so helpful. I went for a few sessions and kept track of my menstrual cycle and ovulation. I saw Dermot weekly at first for acupuncture, then fortnightly, then just monthly. 'He gave me nutritional advice and supplements to take. By this stage, I had given up alcohol, tea, coffee, diet and fizzy drinks, most red meat and was drinking a lot more water.' Collette, Kevin, Emily and Emily's godparents at her christening seven years ago . 'I took Dermot's advice and did as much as I could to be healthy. All of a sudden my period was late. I did a test and to my surprise the stick changed colour straight away. I burst into tears - my God, I’m in tears just typing this, it was one of the best days of my life! 'I did another test the next day - and years later I still have the two sticks. 'I went to the doctor the day after to confirm it.  Dermot had only been seeing me for five months, it was amazing. 'It took so long and so much heartache to get this far so I wasn’t prepared to take any risks. I quit the gym and stopped my hill walking. 'I went overdue by two weeks so I was taken in to be induced on Saturday 20th May and Emily was born at 6.30pm on Sunday 21st May 2006. It was a traumatic birth and I had two blood transfusions but it was the best day of my life. Emily will be seven in May.

"Footage of a driver arguing with a policeman over a speeding ticket has gone viral after the man claims the officer wrongly pulled him over because a radar of speedometer wasn't used.

The officer, who identified himself as Steven when he flashed his name badge, told Mr Smith the fine was based on his 'estimation' and he hadn't used a radar. The video has been shared more 15,000 times and viewed 800,000 times in less than 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Truck driver Chris Smith filmed this police officer issuing him a speeding fine near the Coonabarabran area in NSW and uploaded the video to his Facebook page on Saturday . Mr Smith repeatedly argues that he wasn't speeding, but the officer continues to write him a ticket. 'I want to know how you can book me when I wasn't speeding?' the driver says. The officer replies 'my estimations' before saying there was another police vehicle on the opposite side the road who agreed the driver was speeding. 'You're a senior constable, for guessing speed?' Mr Smith said. 'Estimating speed,' the officer responds. 'So obviously you're some sort of computer,' the driver argues. The officer, who identified himself as Steven when he flashed his name badge, told Mr Smith the fine was based on his 'estimation' and he hadn't used a radar . The filmed argument, which lasts for five minutes, has been shared more 15,000 times and viewed 800,000 times in less than 24 hours . The police officer hits back: 'Expert. I'm an expert at estimating speed'. The video of Mr Smith arguing with the officer goes on for five minutes as he repeatedly says he wasn't speeding. When he asks to check the speed radar, the officer says it wasn't used. 'I didn't check you on the radar. I think you need to realise everything is based on my estimations. All a radar does is back up my estimations,' the officer says. A clearly frustrated Mr Smith suggests the estimation was wrong because the officer's sunglasses put him off, but the policeman just laughs it off. The truck driver repeatedly claims he was speeding and the police was 'out of line' to pull him over . The driver has pledge to take the fine to court, despite officers being able to issue fines via radars, speedometer or an estimate of speed . 'This absolutely ridiculous. I will take it to court because I can't get booked for not speeding. I know I can't get booked for you guessing a speed,' Mr Smith said. 'I wasn't speeding.' The officer tells the driver it's 'my word versus yours then'. It is understood police can issue speeding fines using radars in police cars or speed cameras, a speedometer and from an estimate of speed. A NSW Police spokesperson said the driver was issued an infringement notice for exceeding the speed limit by more than 10km per hour. 'All highway patrol operatives are considered subject matter experts in the eyes of the court in terms of estimating speed,' they said. 'This is included as a part of the training received by potential highway patrol officers. Any LIDAR or radar check that is done has to be reinforced with a valid speed estimation.' Mr Smith now faces a $254 fine and loss of three demerit points, police said.","Truck driver Chris Smith filmed the police officer issuing him a speeding fine and uploaded the video to his Facebook page on Saturday .

"Images showing designs for an artist's potential Bill Cosby sculpture were exhibited Friday night, local media reported. The Cory Allen Contemporary Art Gallery, located in St. Petersburg, Florida, revealed the images, according to WTVT. Rodman Edwards' statue would be called 'Fat Albert Cries for Dr. Huxtable.' Proposal: Rodman Edwards wants to create this sculpture of Bill Cosby, called 'Fat Albert Cries for Dr. Huxtable' In light of sexual assault allegations against Cosby, both Edwards and Cory Allen, who is representing the 15-year-old artist, have alleged that the sculpture represents the comedian's true face. A February 5 news release from the gallery described the project as 'A teenage artist’s protest against Bill Cosby for misrepresenting his TV characters and their messages is proposed as a nude statue of Cosby’s Dr. Cliff Huxtable from The Cosby Show to 'replace' the busts of the legendary performer displayed in front of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Halls of Fame in North Hollywood and Orlando.' The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame Plaza in Orlando is part of Walt Disney World Resort.

Though Cosby has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them, he has denied the claims and has not been charged with a crime .

"Jailed: Rapist Paul Clarke told one victim, 'No pain, no gain' during a ten-year campaign of abuse . A sadistic serial rapist who said 'no pain, no gain' to one of his victims as he attacked her has been jailed for 16 years. Paul Clarke carried out a 'campaign of rape' over ten years from his home in a remote Devon village believing he would always be able to escape justice, Exeter Crown Court heard. He insisted to his family that he was innocent - making his young daughters feel 'broken' when they discovered the truth about his crimes. Clarke, 47, a divorced father of six, became aggressive when drunk and forced three women to take part in degrading sex acts against their will. In one case he laughed off his victim's protests, telling her 'no pain, no gain'. He was investigated on suspicion of rape in the early 2000s, but after he escaped prosecution he was apparently emboldened to carry out further assaults. Clarke, from Chilsworthy in north Devon, told one of his victims: 'I have been accused of rape so I might as well get on and do it.' After being arrested in 2011 and charged with 11 counts of rape, he continued to deny any wrongdoing, but was found guilty of all charges last month. At an earlier trial, he was also convicted of assaulting one victim. Clarke's daughter Michaela, 20, said today that her father's lies had 'torn the family apart' and destroyed the lives of her and her younger sister. She told MailOnline that she had believed her father, who was a 'hero' to her, until just two months before he was convicted. 'He's been an alcoholic all his life, but I never thought he was capable of this', Miss Clarke said. 'Me and Dad were really close - I looked at him as if he was a hero. 'He said he was innocent all along, and I always forgave him for his drinking. 'Why couldn't he be the person I always lay on the sofa and watched TV with? He completely changed and became a different person.' Horror: Clarke's daughter Michaela, pictured with her father, believed his denials for years . While Miss Clarke, a cleaner who now lives in Cornwall, stood by her father until November last year and continued to share his home, other relatives spurned him - leading to a major breach in family relations. 'It's torn my family apart,' she told MailOnline. 'I don't have dealings with any of them any more. He's just torn us all to pieces. 'I want answers to why he did it, and why he couldn't stop his drinking.' Some members of the family still refuse to believe that Clarke is guilty, and his daughter says she and her younger sister have been threatened by relatives over social media. 'It's broken her as well as broken me,' Miss Clarke said. Attacker: Clarke carried out his rapes at home in the remote Devon village of Chilsworthy . Sentencing Clarke to 16 years in prison, Recorder Mr Michael Bowes said: 'Each victim described you correctly as being a bullying and manipulative man. 'There were 11 offences of rape against three separate women and in my judgment, taken as a whole, comprised what can properly be categorised as a campaign of rape. 'One of your victims said that the more she struggled the more you seemed to enjoy it. That assault was very painful and must also have been disgusting. 'The degradation and humiliation the victims suffered almost beggars belief. Your violence has had a profound effect on all of your victims. It is quite plain you have no remorse whatsoever.' Clarke, an unemployed ex-farmer, claimed that the women had colluded to invent false allegations against him and said he could not have had sex while drunk because alcohol made him impotent. After the case, Detective Constable James Rees of Devon and Cornwall Police said said: 'We are extremely pleased with the guilty verdict and the sentence imposed today. 'The defendant's denial of these offences and taking his case to trial has caused the victims further distress in having to recount their ordeals in court.'","Father-of-six Paul Clarke raped three women over ten years while drunk .

"Rail passengers could save millions of pounds a year thanks to a secret computer code which finds cut-price fares normally hidden from the public. Founders of the website TrainSplit.com are helping travellers buy cheaper ‘split tickets’. This means that instead of buying one ticket for a journey, passengers can break their trip up into legs – offering a lower combined fare while travelling on the same train. The website’s founders believe rail companies are overcharging passengers on 42 per cent of tickets sold. Rail travellers can save money by using a new website which allows them to buy tickets for each leg of their journey without having to get off the train . And they say their tool can save an average of 22 per cent on the fares listed on train company websites. For example, a single off-peak ticket from Plymouth to Derby can cost £129.50 using the Trainline site. But buying five separate, single tickets for the route costs just £79.80 – a saving of £49.70. Similarly, depending on the hours of travel, a return ticket between Manchester and London can cost £270. But by using TrainSplit.com to find five separate tickets, that is cut to just £179.50, saving £90.50. The train has to stop at the stations where all the tickets are valid to and from, but passengers need not get off. Hereford-based computer programmer Nick Brown, 45, tried for three years to create a search engine to find cheap fares. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has defended rising ticket prices in the past . But it wasn't until he met rail buff Mark Richardson and his business partner George Sikking that he gained access to the pair’s vast databases of timetables, fares and reservations for the UK rail network. They launched the site last April with freelance software developer Paul Kelly, and it is used by 20 to 30 passengers a day. Mr Brown, 45, said: ‘Before we had access to this massive database, it would take the most hardcore of passengers to actually sit down with the National Fares Manual and go through it to find the cheapest deal. ‘And you can’t stand at a kiosk and ask staff to work out the price of each individual journey. 'They don’t have enough time, and it’s not part of their job.’ Mr Richardson told The Sunday Times: ‘The idea is to take insider knowledge and make it available to the general traveller, so they don’t have to work anything out themselves.’ The four experts now want to extend the service to tickets which include travel on London’s Tube. They are working on an algorithm to show passengers how to buy cheaper fares if they are happy for their journey to take longer. Although it is allowed under the conditions of carriage, train firms have in the past lobbied the government to banish split-ticketing. The MoneySavingExpert.com website also has a split-ticketing search engine, offering only two split legs.","The website TrainSplit.com allows passengers to save money on fares .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a leading Republican contender for the White House in 2016, has said he doesn't know whether President Barack Obama is a Christian or not. Despite the fact that Obama has frequently spoken publicly about his Christian faith, Walker maintained on Saturday that he is not aware of the president's religion. Walker refusal to acknowledge the president's faith, came hours after he had also refused to be drawn on Obama's love for his country in the wake of inflammatory remarks made by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani at a fundraising event for Walker during the week. Despite the fact that Obama has frequently spoken publicly about his Christian faith, Walker maintained on Saturday that he is not aware of the president's religion . On the subject of the president's faith, Walker told reporters at the National Governors Association in Washington that he simply didn't know. 'I've actually never talked about it or I haven't read about that,' Walker said, reports The Washington Post. 'I've never asked him that,' he added. 'You've asked me to make statements about people that I haven't had a conversation with about that. How [could] I say if I know either of you are a Christian?' Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster later phoned the Post to deny that the governor had been trying to cast doubt on Obama's faith. 'Of course the governor thinks the president is a Christian,' she said. 'He thinks these kinds of gotcha questions distract from what he's doing as governor of Wisconsin to make the state better and make life better for people in his state.' Earlier Walker had refused to give a clear answer when asked if he agreed with Giuliani's belief that the president doesn't love his country. 'You should ask the president what he thinks about America,' said Walker. 'I've never asked him so I don't know.' Walker's comments on Saturday came after several days in which he was asked repeatedly whether he agreed with the former New York mayor. President Obama has often talked about his political faith despite some figures on the right repeatedly suggesting that he is Muslim . 'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' Giuliani had said during his dinner speech. Some figures on the right have consistently questioned Obama's faith, with some suggesting that he is a Muslim. Obama, however, has often talked about his Christian faith, as he did recently at the National Prayer Breakfast. Walker accused the media of being fixated on issues that are not relevant to most Americans. 'To me, this is a classic example of why people hate Washington and, increasingly, they dislike the press,' he said. 'The things they care about don't even remotely come close to what you're asking about.' Walker said he does not believe that most Americans care about such matters. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has said he is standing by his comments that the president doesn't love his country despite receiving death threats in recent days . 'People in the media will [judge], not everyday people,' he said. 'I would defy you to come to Wisconsin. You could ask 100 people, and not one of them would say that this is a significant issue.' Giuliani said on Saturday that he was standing by controversial statements even though he had received death threats. The former mayor did not say whether he contacted police about the threatening calls. Giuliani told CNN that despite the death threats, the majority of voice mails left at his office were in support of his remarks made on Wednesday at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Scott Walker. 'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words,' Giuliani told NBC on Friday. 'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.' White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Friday that he felt sorry for the man who was once known as 'America's mayor.' 'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' Earnest said. The White House started the hashtag #ObamaLovesAmerica on Twitter, the hashtag was tweeted more than 50,000 times in 24 hours, with comments both for and against Giuliani's remarks. Critics have called for the author and former politician to apologize, but Giuliani told NBC that though he never meant to question the president's patriotism, he absolutely will not apologize for saying what he believes.","Gov.

On Saturday, Rami's  Facebook page - which has gained more than 4,500 fans in just three weeks and even sells T-shirts in the pup's likeness - publicized his  'ambassador' appointment in a post. The post, written in the pup's voice, read: 'Rami has been chosen to be the MCCHS Ambassador! For all of you that are concerned for my well being, please be assured that I am being well taken care of and loved. I love having the opportunity to meet and greet everyone during the day. 'At night I go to my other home where I can play and sleep with my fosters. No more worries as a dog on the street, now I have food in my tummy, a warm cozy bed, and lots of friends and most important...LOVE!!... I'm thankful to be given this chance to become Ambassador.' And Rami's new position is not his only success - he has received so many offers of adoption that the rescue shelter in 1st Street Northeast has declared it is no longer accepting applications. In training: In his new position at the local shelter - where he currently resides - Rami will train to become a special therapy dog and will work to raise awareness for other dogs and cats in need of loving homes . A popular choice: And Rami's (left and right) new title is not his only success - he has received so many offers of adoption that the rescue shelter in 1st Street Northeast has declared it is no longer accepting applications . Staff are currently reviewing applications for the pup, who was rescued after being spotted wandering the streets of Moultrie last month. He rose to fame just days later. In a Facebook post, the shelter said: 'We will do everything possible to place Rami in a very deserving home, so we ask you be patient with us as every application will be carefully reviewed.' While Rami's body is long, his legs are more muscular like those of a pit bull. According to the dog breeding website Designer Mixes, the mix of pit bulls and dachshunds is called a Doxbull or Pitwee. The cross-breeds can weigh around 25lbs when fully grown. Unfortunately for Rami, his enormous pit bull head has seen him compared to a Tyrannosaurus Rex and even a bobblehead doll. Unusual appearance: Staff are currently reviewing applications for the pup (pictured), who was rescued after being spotted wandering the streets of Moultrie, Georgia last month. He rose to fame just days later . Overwhelmed: The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society posted this message on Facebook earlier this month, encouraging users to visit their local shelters, where they 'may find a dog or cat as unique as Rami' Photos and videos of the dog have been shared more than 40,000 times online. Most users say Rami is adorable. However, others are not impressed, describing the pup as 'freaky looking'. At first, some were even unconvinced and thought the pictures were doctored, or that the animal was not a mix but actually has canine dwarfism, a condition that affects dogs' growth and spines. According to the Humane Society, Rami is 'full of energy', 'hyper' and doesn't 'listen very well'. Rami's ears have also been cut for an unknown reason. Potential owners have been told they will need to go through an interview process and pay for Rami's vaccinations before taking him home. The pup will shortly begin his therapy training with Leigh Ann Facloner, of Bark Busters.","Pit bull-dachshund mix Rami has attracted an enormous online following .

"Miami Beach was the stage, renowned chefs prepared the food and a drag queen DJ set the tunes. This was the scene at celebrity chef Art Smith's massive gay wedding this weekend, where he invited 101 couples to wed in a free ceremony to celebrate a lift on the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The wedding was officiated by chef Guy Fieri and the seven-tier gold cake was made by Duff Goldman, star of the Food Network reality show Ace of Cakes. Pictured are 26 of the 101 same-sex couples who tied the knot at celebrity chef Art Smith's massive Miami Beach wedding in celebration of the lift on Florida's gay marriage ban . Smith, a former chef to Oprah Winfrey, said he was inspired by the film 101 Dalmatians - more specifically its villain - when he decided on the number of couples to invite. He called Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who plans to appeal the legalization ruling and is a staunch opponent against same-sex marriage, the state's own 'Cruella De Vil'. Smith told his guests on the dance floor that he wanted to show the haters 'we're proud, we're happy, we're loud' with the party . 'She was determined that she was going to prevent equality from coming to Florida,' Smith said, according to the Associated Press. 'For a state known for sunshine, it was living in the darkness when it came to LGBT rights and it was important to acknowledge that.' Smith has been hosting the Big Gay Ice Cream Social in Miami for years in protest to the state's same-sex marriage ban. He told his guests on the dance floor that he wanted to show the haters 'we're  proud, we're happy, we're loud' with a party. The wedding was also personal for Smith. The chef met his partner, Jesus Salgueiro, in Miami 15 years ago while he was out buying flowers for Winfrey's home. They married five years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Friends flew in from California and Indianapolis to see couple Nicole Griffin, 43, and Stephanie Swanson, 42, tie the knot. Swanson told the Associated Press she believed the wedding represented a 'defeat' for Pam Bondi, who Swanson said had denied them 'for so long' in her fight against marriage equality. Seth Anderson and Michael Ferguson had legally wed in a Utah courthouse two years before, but joined the ceremony so they could renew their vows at a proper wedding. 'We wanted to come and be a part of this and celebrate with all the other people getting married,' Anderson said. Fieri officiated the ceremony in honor of his late sister, who was a lesbian. Fellow Food Network star Goldman also made the wedding's massive feast, which included fried chicken, grilled lamb, crab-stuffed avocados and empanadas. Goldman, who is a gay rights advocate, said he wanted to help celebrate and make the new law 'true in every state'.

"Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot dead outside a church in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland . A man has been remanded in custody accused of shooting dead his uncle outside a gipsy family wedding. Patrick McGinley, 46, is charged with the murder of Bernard McGinley close to St Mary’s Catholic Church moments before the wedding in Newtownbutler, a village in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, was due to start last week. The 63-year-old grandfather was shot in the chest in front of his wife, Brigid. The accused, who appeared in Omagh Magistrates’ Court yesterday, is the uncle of the bride who was just about to walk down the aisle. Wearing a grey fleece over a blue checked shirt, balding and unshaven McGliney, from Lisfarrell in County Longford, Republic of Ireland, spoke only to confirm his name, address and that he understood the charge he faced during the short hearing. A police officer told District Judge John Meehan that he could connect the accused to the crime. Seamus Leonard, defending, said he wanted to make clear that his client voluntarily presented himself to police in Belfast earlier this week. ‘He provided a very full account of what happened in this tragic event,’ he said. Outside court: Patrick McGinley, 46, is charged with the murder of his uncle outside a gipsy family wedding . Dramatic: The bride and members of the wedding party leave the church after the service earlier this month . The solicitor said his client did not want to apply for bail at this stage but an application would probably be made in the future. Judge Meehan remanded the accused to custody to appear before Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on March 16 via videolink. Last Wednesday's ceremony for the marriage of Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, was delayed for a short period after the shooting but then went ahead. Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned. Just married: Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, are pictured in the hours after their wedding . He explained: ‘They said “father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding”, so I proceeded with the wedding. They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.’ Mr McGinley was flown to hospital from Lisnaskea in a police helicopter but died later. Tributes were later paid to him. Cousin Willie McGinley said on Facebook: 'R.I.P. Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' And Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.'

"David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps . A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s. For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps. His led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908. Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered, the New York Post reported. The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo. After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of  hypodermic syringes at health clinics. Treatment for a common ailment in the area at the time required 36 injections over three years and most needles were used over and over. Quammen wrote: 'Once the reusable needles and syringes had put the virus into enough people — say, several hundred — it wouldn't come to a dead end, it wouldn't burn out, and sexual transmission could do the rest.' French-speaking Haitians who were working in the Congo went home after Belgium gave up the colony in 1950. Quammen added: 'Someone brought back to Haiti, along with Congolese memories, a dose of HIV-1, Group M, Subtype B.' The re-use of needles allowed the virus to spread in Haiti and an infected person or infected container of blood plasma likely brought AIDS to America 'in 1969, plus or minus about three years'. Quammen wrote: 'It reached hemophiliacs through the blood supply. 'It reached drug addicts through shared needles. It reached gay men… by sexual transmission, possibly from an initial contact between two males, an American and a Haitian.' Scroll down for video . In his book, Quammen (left) theorizes that a chimp infected a hunter with a virus similar to HIV in Cameroon . A conceptual view of HIV in the bloodstream. Since 1981, about 78 million people have been infected by HIV . In his book (right), Shilts theorizes the virus could have been brought to the US by a gay Air Canada steward named Gaëtan Dugas (left) The book claims AIDS originated in Cameroon around 1908 and spread down the Sangha River before reaching Kinshasa, the capital of the Congo, sometime in the 1910s or 1920s . The account contradicts the theory put forth in Randy Shilts' history of AIDS, And the Band Played On. In his book, Shilts theorizes the virus could have been brought to the US by a gay Air Canada steward named Gaëtan Dugas. He called Dugas 'Patient Zero' and hypothesized he infected at least 40 people with HIV. 1908: A hunter is infected by an HiV-like virus after he kills and butchers a chimp in Cameroon. 1910s-20s: The hunter spreads the virus by having sex with at least one other person. It gradually begins working its way down the Sangha River before reaching Kinshasa, the capital of the Congo. 1920s-50s: Health campaigns to treat tropical diseases re-use needles multiple times and the virus is spread unknowingly via syringes. 1960: After Belgium gives up the Congo as a colony, French-speaking Haitians head home and bring 'a dose of HIV-1, Group M, Subtype B' with them. 1969: Shared needles at Haitian clinics also spread the virus and it is brought to the US 'in 1969, plus or minus about three years'. 1980: A UCLA Medical Center professor notices a number of gay men suffering from pneumonia because of weakened immune systems and HIV is discovered thereafter. If Quammen is right, there is no way Dugas could have brought HIV to the US. Quammen wrote: 'Dugas himself was infected by some other human, presumably during a sexual encounter — and not in Africa . . . somewhere closer to home. 'As evidence now shows, HIV had already arrived in North America when Gaëtan ­Dugas was a virginal adolescent.' Since 1981, about 78 million people have been infected by HIV. The virus destroys immune cells and leaves the body exposed to tuberculosis, pneumonia and other opportunistic diseases. Thirty-nine million people have died, according to UN estimates. Antiretroviral drugs, invented in the mid-1990s, can treat infection but cannot cure it or prevent it. The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people getting access to the medicines they need to keep AIDS at bay, according to a report by the ONE campaign.","David Quammen traces the history of AIDS in The Chimp and the River .

"Greece's Marxist finance minister Yanis Varoufakis displayed a volcanic temper during fraught talks with European leaders last week, with some observers fearing the discussions could descend into a punch-up. But the explosive style of the so-called ‘rock star’ economist may have been part of a deliberately ‘schizophrenic’ negotiating technique conceived while Varoufakis was a student in Essex in the 1980s, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. After weeks of tense negotiations, European finance ministers finally announced on Friday that they had drafted the basis for an agreement to extend Greece’s bailout package for four months. 'Erratic': Greece's Marxist finance minister Yanis Varoufakis meets IMF chief Christine Lagarde last week . Endorsed by the full 19-member Eurogroup, it should be finalised tomorrow – effectively saving Greece from leaving the eurozone and going bankrupt. During tense negotiations last week, Mr Varoufakis was said to have shouted ‘liar’ at Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the eurozone group of finance ministers, with some observers fearing that punches were about to be thrown. But Mr Varoufakis’s erratic behaviour and outbursts may have been part of an orchestrated plan to build a ‘reputation’ to use as a bargaining tool. The Mail on Sunday has seen Mr Varoufakis’s economic thesis submitted as part of his doctorate at the University of Essex in 1987. The 249-page document, titled Optimisation and Strikes, discusses bargaining positions between employers and unions and is a blueprint for how to win negotiations. In it, Mr Varoufakis, who earlier this month wore a leather biker’s jacket and boots when he met Chancellor George Osborne, states that the workforce needs to accept their leader’s ‘peculiarities’ to get a good outcome. Left-wing: Mr Varoufakis as a lecturer in 1993 . It says: ‘In the aftermath of the strike they will have realised that in spite of his or her peculiarities their manager has come up with the goods.’ The thesis then discusses the merits of negotiating methods and how ‘irrational’ behaviour in the short term may enhance the long- term reputation of the negotiator – and get a better outcome. It says the best negotiator is one who lives up to a ‘schizophrenic ideal’ and builds a reputation. ‘Reputation-building depends on the ability to punish the opposition and the time preference of the party in question, while at the same time, the ability to punish the opposition depends on solidarity which itself depends on the negotiator’s reputation and the level of utility derived from being loyal,’ it says. Tellingly, Mr Varoufakis concludes: ‘Negotiators seeking to maximise the probability of persuading their opponents of their intransigence may attempt to convince themselves first. The ability to switch from “conviction bargaining” to “pragmatic” behaviour at the optimal point in time is of paramount importance. Negotiators approaching this ideal will be maximising their payoffs.’ Mr Varoufakis, who has described himself as ‘an erratic Marxist’, graduated from Essex University in 1981, gaining a 2.2 in mathematical economics. He was awarded a PhD in 1987. The Greek Left-wing government, elected in January after promising to end austerity, stepped back from the brink last week, conceding that the current €240 billion (£180 billion) bailout would be extended pending further talks. Refusing to continue the current bailout had been seen as a ‘red line’ for the Greek government, and accepting that the deal is still in place is widely seen as a climbdown. Varoufakis has until Monday night to present a list of reforms his government will carry out.

"It's fondly remembered as the classic bodice-ripper, with millions of television viewers in the 1970s enthralled by scenes of passion and adventure played out against a backdrop of windswept Cornish landscapes. And now, the BBC's new adaptation of Winston Graham's Poldark novels is again set to shock viewers – but this time because of a lack of sex scenes and nudity. Debbie Horsfield, the acclaimed dramatist who has written the new series, said: 'I am always fascinated by the way Poldark is described as a bodice-ripper. 'There don't seem to be any bodices being ripped in the original material and this new series is very much an adaptation of the source material.' Fresh faces: Aidan Turner as the brooding Captain Ross Poldark with Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza . Horsfield's comments might reassure fans of Graham's 12 Poldark books but will surprise fans of The Hobbit star Aidan Turner, cast as the brooding Captain Ross Poldark in the 2015 adaptation. They have welcomed a 'sexy and steamy' trailer for the show which shows 'a buffed' Turner topless and then has him swimming naked in the sea. One wrote online: 'OMG, Aidan Turner has made me feel things again!' while another added: 'I have Turner fever!' But Horsfield, who created the hairdressing drama Cutting It, said the trailer, which has been shown frequently on the BBC, wasn't necessarily typical of the drama to follow. She said: 'I can't comment on what choices are made for a trailer. I don't think you will be seeing those sorts of scenes every few seconds. My view is that less is more.' Topless scenes: A 'sexy and steamy' trailer for the show shows 'a buffed' Turner topless, pictured as he prepares for a scene during  filming  at Dollar Cove . Screen Shot episode one of the new BBC drama Poldark...mos web grab..20 02 2015..Captain Poldark together with Ellizabeth.Heida Reed in the roles of Demelza and Elizabeth respectively . The Mail on Sunday has seen the first episode of the new adaptation and can confirm there is no actual nudity. The new series will not be short of romance and intrigue, however, as it focuses on an 18th Century love triangle involving Poldark, his former fiancee Elizabeth and the servant girl Demelza whom he eventually marries. The new series will inevitably be compared with the previous adaptation which caused a sensation when it was broadcast from 1975 to 1977. That version, which starred Robin Ellis as Poldark, Jill Townsend as Elizabeth and Angharad Rees as Demelza, proved to be a ratings hit and is still considered one of the best television dramas ever made. Bodice ripper: The new series will inevitably be compared with the previous adaptation starring Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza Poldark . But Horsfield said she didn't give it a second thought when she started work on her own adaptation, which has Eleanor Tomlinson and Heida Reed in the roles of Demelza and Elizabeth respectively. She said: 'I know there is a certain generation that watched the 1970s version. I just wanted to convey the complexity of the story telling. I didn't think of the earlier version when I was writing it. We are sticking much more closely to the novels. The 1970s adaptation diverged quite considerably.' The new eight-part series, which will be shown on BBC1 on Sunday nights, is based on Graham's first two novels. But the BBC hopes to adapt all 12 books if audiences warm to the story. The original series only covered the first seven novels although ITV did adapt the eighth in 1996.","Hit 1970s drama Poldark is remembered as the classic bodice-ripper .

"The Oscar movies this year may be small, but they're packing a lot of drama. When the 87th Academy Awards kick off on Sunday night at 8:30 EST, the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles will be buzzing with something the Oscars haven't always had in recent years: genuine intrigue at who the night's biggest winners will be. The Oscars may also have another sight unusual to Southern California: rain. Light afternoon showers are expected, which could dampen red-carpet arrivals - though the carpet itself is under a glass tent. Scroll down for video . An Oscar statue is uncovered outside the Dolby Theater during preparations leading up to the 87th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, on Sunday night . Organizers have placed a giant glass tent over the red carpet for the 87th Oscars as afternoon showers are predicted over the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles . Neil Patrick Harris and Kerry Washington rehearse during preparations  for the 87th Oscars to be presented at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, on Sunday night . With a co-leading nine nominations, Alejandro Inarritu's backstage comedy Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) flies in with the strongest wind at its back. It topped the acting, directing and producing guild awards, which are often strong predictors of what the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences will vote for. Birdman also won best feature at Saturday's Independent Film Spirit Awards, further boosting its momentum. At the pre-Oscars beachside bash, star Michael Keaton, who won best actor, proclaimed the film 'bold cinema' and 'a game changer,' a judgment shared by many in Hollywood who no doubt recognize something in Keaton's character's out-of-control ego. But the coronation of Birdman is far from assured. Many believe the landmark of Richard Linklater 12-years-in-the-making Boyhood will ultimately prove irresistible to academy members. Best director also appears to be a toss-up between Inarritu and Linklater. Three of the acting winners — Julianne Moore (Still Alice), J.K. Simmons (Whiplash) and Patricia Arquette (Boyhood) — are virtual locks going into Sunday's show, but best actor will be a nail biter. Television reporters stand next to an Oscar statue outside the Dolby Theater during preparations leading up to the 87th Academy Awards on Sunday . It could be the young British star Eddie Redmayne for his technically nuanced performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, or it could be Keaton's career-topper in Birdman, as an actor trying to flee his superhero past. But whether suspense will be enough to pull viewers to the telecast on ABC remains to be seen. Host Neil Patrick Harris will hope to continue the recent ratings upswing for the Oscars, which last year drew 43 million viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in a decade. This year's crop of nominees, however, is notably light on box-office smashes. Clint Eastwood's American Sniper (six nominations including best picture) is the only best-picture candidate to gross more than $100 million domestically. (A runaway hit, it recently surpassed $300 million.) Possibly worse for the Oscars is that the lack of diversity in the nominees this year (all 20 nominated actors are white) turned off many potential viewers and led some to call for a boycott of the broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron are likely to aim for a telecast more inclusive than the nominees. When the 87th Academy Awards kick off on Sunday night at 8:30 EST, the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles will be buzzing with something the Oscars haven't always had in recent years: genuine intrigue at who the night's biggest winners will be . Planned performers include Lady Gaga, Jack Black, Jennifer Hudson and Anna Kendrick, as well as Oscar-nominated original songs: Common and John Legend (Glory from Selma), Maroon 5 (Lost Stars from Begin Again), Tim McGraw (I'm Not Gonna Miss You from Glen Campbell. I'll Be Me), Rita Ora (Grateful from Beyond the Lights) and Tegan and Sara with the Lonely Island (Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie). Oprah Winfrey (a co-star in Selma) will be among the presenters, as will Eddie Murphy, Chris Pratt, Kevin Hart, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett, Channing Tatum and John Travolta. Increasingly, ratings are driven by moments that spark social media frenzy, like when Travolta famously mispronounced the name of singer Idina Menzel as Adele Dazeem at last year's show. Sunday night, he gets a chance for redemption.

"British holidaymakers who hit the slopes in North America without proper insurance could break the bank if they suffer a serious injury, a new report says. The study examined the medical costs associated with winter sport injuries suffered by uninsured travellers abroad and identified the US and Canada the most expensive countries, with sky-high bills for those without travel coverage. It found that treatment for a broken leg would cost a staggering £26,000 in the US (approximately USD$40,000) and almost £15,000 in Canada (approximately CAD$28,000). Uninsured Britons who suffer a winter sport injury in the US and Canada face sky-high medical bills . The average cost per claim for a winter sport injury suffered in the US and Canada is more than £11,000, according to the study commissioned by Allianz Global Assistance UK and the Ski Club of Great Britain. Of all the claims that were included in the study, the most expensive treatment covered by Allianz Global Assistance was for a head injury suffered in Canada, totalling more than £145,000 (nearly CAD$280,000) in medical and repatriation costs. Barry Smith, Underwriting Manager for Allianz Global Assistance UK, said: ‘We have analysed data from hundreds of claims from the past few years and the results are enough to give you a chill even when you're not on a ski slope. ‘The remainder of our top five costs were all from the USA, ranging from £33,000 to £81,000 for various bone fractures.’ Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance . He said an arm fracture suffered in the US would translate into a medical bill of nearly £41,000 (approximately USD$60,000). Austria and Switzerland were named the third and fourth most expensive countries for medical assistance, with average costs of more than £2,000 and £1,200, respectively. Frank McCusker, Chief Executive of Ski Club of Great Britain, urged people to purchase insurance before they travel abroad. The average cost per claim for a winter sport injury suffered in the US and Canada is more than £11,000 . He said: ‘Whilst most skiers and snowboarders do of course return home in one piece, it doesn't take much to cause a serious, and seriously expensive, injury on the slopes. ‘The high costs we've seen in the past few years could leave an individual in financial difficulty if they did not have travel insurance to cover the bills on their behalf. ‘It could be a real false economy to cut out insurance to save a few pounds, and we urge those booking winter sports holidays this season to make sure they purchase good quality insurance to avoid being landed with any unaffordable medical bills. 'As with any type of insurance policy, individuals should read the details carefully to ensure it provides the cover they require.’","Study examined the medical costs associated with winter sports injuries .

"A decorated Upstate New York policeman of 22 years who only retired last month murdered his two teenage daughters before killing himself inside their family home on Saturday afternoon, authorities say. Glen Hochman, 52, who left the force in January, is believed to have killed daughters Alissa Hochman, 17, and Deanna Hochman, 13, inside the family's Westchester County house,The Journal News reported, alongside the three family dogs. He then committed suicide. The three were were found dead about 3.50pm inside their home in the village of Harrison, about 20 miles northeast of Manhattan. Dead: Glen Hochman, 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, is believed to have murdered his two daughters Deanna Hochman, 13 (center) and Alissa Hochman, 17, on Saturday afternoon . Family torn apart: Glen Hochman is seen here with with his wife Anamarie (back right), his two victims, daughters Alissa and Deanna (front) and eldest daughter Samantha (right). Anamarie and Samantha were not home at the time of the tragedy, police have confirmed . Killed: Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna Hochman, 13, were found dead, along with their father, on Saturday afternoon . Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find Glen Hochman, 52, a former local cop, and his two teen daughters dead . Police have confirmed that Anamarie Hochman, Glen Hochman's wife, and Samantha Hochman, the couple's oldest daughter, were not at home at the time of the incident. It is unclear how Hochman and his two children died, however WABC are reporting Hochman shot his two girls and then himself. The network also reported that Hochman and his wife had been having marital issues. Harrison Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said police went to the home after a person reported that no one was answering the door. Investigation: Police are trying to establish what drove Glen Hochman - seen here with his wife Anamarie - to murder his two daughters, before killing himself . Police found the bodies of Hochman and his daughters at 3:50 p.m. He said Hochman's body was found in the garage while the bodies of 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna were found on 'the main level' of the house. Three dogs were shot to death as well, he said. White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement identifying the former officer as Hochman, and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'. Chong told The News Journal the department are 'shocked and horrified by the news'. 'We can only pray for the family,' he said. 'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.' Last year, Hochman won the department's life-saving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived. Hochman suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist, reports Lohud. Murder-suicide: Investigators worked through the night on Saturday inside the home . Victims: Deanna Hochman, 13 (left), and her sister Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, were murdered by their father on Saturday, police say . He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years, since both worked as EMTs with the Harrison ambulance corps. He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway . 'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Roth said. 'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him. ... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.' Residents of the upper middle-class neighborhood discussed the shootings in quiet tones as they shoveled snow Sunday. Howard Hollander, 52, an airline pilot who lives five doors down from the Hochmans, said Hochman 'was always taking care of the property, landscaping, cleaning up the yard.' 'The girls said hi whenever they passed,' Hollander said. 'I remember one was learning to drive and beeped at us as she went by.' He added, 'There was no indication at all of any problem, that something like this would happen.' Another neighbor, Dante Garritano, 52, an engineer, said he went outside when he saw ambulances and police cars Saturday. 'I walked out and I heard a woman crying, screaming, on her phone, 'My God, they're dead. He killed himself,'' Garritano said. In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.' He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time. 'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said. Harrison High School, opened its campus on Sunday for grief counseling.","Police arrived at the home in Westchester County about 3.50pm Saturday .

"A 36-year-old man arrested in connection with sex abuse allegations made by MP's wife Karen Danczuk has been released on bail. Mrs Danczuk, 31, who is the wife of anti-child sex abuse MP Simon Danczuk, claims she was raped and sexually assaulted 'hundreds of times' as a child at her family home in Manchester. The man, who lives a few miles from Mrs Danczuk, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police today and he has now been bailed until April 30. After news of the arrest, Mrs Danczuk tweeted: 'For all those who doubted me, publicly slated me & made me feel like scum for coming out. I will NEVER forgive & NEVER forget!' A man, 36, has been arrested in connection with sex abuse allegations made by MP's wife Karen Danczuk . Mrs Danczuk, who has became well known for Twitter selfies showing off her ample cleavage, claims the abuse took place between 1989 and 1995 when she was aged between six and 12. She said she was regularly abused in the bedroom of her family home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, shortly after her parents' marriage broke up. Her father Martin Burke, now 73, moved out, leaving Mrs Danczuk, three older brothers and an older sister with their mother Susan Burke. Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother, as well as two of her four siblings who challenged her story. Mrs Danczuk claims she was regularly abused in the bedroom of her family home in Greater Manchester . In response to the arrest today, Mrs Danczuk said she would never forgive those who doubted her claims . The family feud erupted this week as Mrs Danczuk publicly claimed her cleavage-baring selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child. She told the Mail on Sunday her 'selfies' are a defiant way of saying: 'I'm sexy – and I'm in control now.' But Mrs Burke, 58, called her daughter an 'attention-seeker' which led Mrs Danczuk to report her claims to the police 'as a matter of urgency, to prove I am telling the truth'. Today, she told the Mail on Sunday that she felt 'more numb than angry' and her rage is instead directed at her mother. Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother Susan Burke (pictured) She told the newspaper: 'I am not a fantasist. I am telling the truth. I was raped or sexually abused hundreds of times. 'She did nothing to protect me and I will never forgive her.' Asked why she had waited two decades to name her attacker, she said: 'Because I am still coming to terms with it. It is a very difficult thing to confront – as any paedophile victim will know.' DI Caroline Ward of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We work hard to support victims of sexual offences and thoroughly investigate all reports of sexual abuse and rape no matter how long ago they happened.

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital, her R&B-singer father claims. Gordon tweeted in anger this weekend, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend in the hospital where she remains in a medically-induced coma three weeks after being pulled unconscious from a bathtub. 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted Saturday. But Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown has refuted the claim that Gordon is desperately trying to visit his daughter. Scroll down for video . Not true: Bobby Brown says his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon  has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital, where she remains in a medically-induced coma. Brown pictured on the right at Emory Hospital on February 6, Gordon on the left outside the hospital when Bobbi Kristina was first hospitalized . Couple: Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in a bathtub three weeks ago, and has been in a coma ever since. Pictured with her boyfriend in 2012 . 'Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,' the R&B star said in a statement through his lawyers. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe.' Gordon's lawyers responded to Brown's statement by saying they advised their client against agreeing to Brown's unspecified terms. In a statement released Sunday, Gordon's lawyers said Brown has 'consistently prohibited' Gordon from visiting Bobbi Kristina, who she 'would want by her side'. 'Mr. Brown has only ""offered an opportunity to potentially meet with Bobbi Kristina"" if Nick were to meet certain conditions, conditions that we, his attorneys, have advised him not to meet, particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access. 'But in an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers. Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart,' the statements reads. Reports suggest Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. In his Saturday rant, Gordon also tweeted: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.' Plea: Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insisted his presence will help the 21-year-old . Demands: The extraordinary outburst also included a request to massage her once she heard his voice . Ink: He then posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo with his partner's name on, saying it was healing nicely . He posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.' On Wednesday, Gordon’s lawyer Randall Kessler said his client ‘desperately wants to be with the one he loves.’ Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claims Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay ‘hands on him’ if he shows up. Kessler said, ‘[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub . Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. He sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family just days ago when he had the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. A new report which surfaced on Saturday claims that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier . Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.' She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident. Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31. She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.","Nick Gordon tweeted Saturday that he had been denied access to the hospital where his girlfriend Bobbi Kristina Brown remains in a coma .

"In its day, it was seen as a celebration of multiculturalism and racial harmony. But when a BBC DJ played Blue Mink’s 1969 hit Melting Pot he admitted beforehand its lyrics might now be seen as inappropriate . BBC Three Counties Radio presenter Iain Lee warned listeners: ‘I think it might be a little bit racist now.’ Spot the difference: BBC Three Counties Radio presenter Iain Lee (left) played a 1969 hit which included a reference to 'yellow Chinkies' - the same song once sung by fictional gaffe-prone DJ Alan Partridge (right) But less than half a minute into the song, after hearing the words ‘yellow Chinkees’ he stopped the track and apologised, adding: ‘At least we know you cannot play that song any more. It’s a different world.’ Listeners heard only the first six lines of Melting Pot: ‘Take a pinch of white man, wrap him up in black skin, add a touch of blue blood and a little bitty bit of Red Indian boy. Curly Latin kinkies, mixed with yellow Chinkees...’ They did not hear the chorus, which includes the lines: ‘What we need is a great big melting pot. Big enough to take the world and all it’s got.’ In 1969, the song was seen as a statement against racial intolerance by a five-piece British band fronted by black American singer Madeline Bell. It reached No 3 in the singles chart and spent 15 weeks in the Top Ten. There have been several cover versions but the most recent, by Boyzone in 1996, changed ‘yellow Chinkees’ to ‘Oriental sexy’. Good intentions: Pop act Blue Mink (pictured) said racial integration was a 'beautiful dream' Mr Lee’s producer told him she had not checked the lyrics before he played it on Three Counties, which covers Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. After stopping the track, he said: ‘I humbly apologise. The intention was good, the way it was phrased was very poor. If anyone was offended by that you have my sincerest apologies. ‘You know it’s not our intention to offend anybody on this show.’ Mr Lee had to apologise in August after he told his producer to ‘go and do the black and Asian show’ during a pretend on-air row. The BBC described the exchange as banter, but said the comments were unacceptable. Yesterday the BBC said Melting Pot had been played shortly after 8.50am on Friday after it was mentioned during an on-air discussion about the impact of immigration on the NHS. A spokesman added: ‘It was clearly not played to cause offence. The production team have been reminded of their responsibilities to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’ The programme, including the song, was still available to listen to on iPlayer yesterday. Ofcom said that if it receives a complaint it will see if broadcasting rules were broken. The regulator’s website states that ‘Chink’ is a ‘term of racial offence/abuse’. Last April veteran BBC Radio Devon DJ David Lowe lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On, unaware that it included the N-word. He was later offered his job back but declined.","BBC Three Counties host Iain Lee played Blue Mink's hit Melting Pot .

"A 45-ton humpback whale entangled with heavy crab line and buoys for more than a week in Hawaii waters is finally free. A response team cut away several hundred feet of fishing line from the 45-foot-long whale's tail using a pole equipped with a knife, according to the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. Their inflatable craft came within ten feet of the marine mammal as it sidled up next to it during the rescue attempt along the leeward coast of Maui. Once released from the line, the whale swam free with only a small piece of line lodged in a wound remaining, but the fragment will fall off as the would heals, said Ed Lyman, Large Whale Entanglement Response Coordinator for the sanctuary. Scroll down for video . A 45-ton humpback whale entangled with heavy crab line and buoys for more than a week in Hawaii waters is finally free (above rescuers using a knife making the last cut to free the whale) The entangled whale was first spotted on the afternoon of February 13, 45 miles northwest of Hilo, according to the Star Advertiser. The whale's conditions were documented and a tag was attached to it so it could be tracked on satellite by the West Hawaii Marine Mammal Response Network. It was not seen again until Sunday and was reportedly carrying a red buoy along the Kona Coast. A response team cut away several hundred feet of fishing line from the 45-foot-long whale using a pole equipped with a knife, according to the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (above the whale's tail entangled in crab line) But as the whale moved into unreachable waters with treacherous currents near south Point, the sanctuary had to halt plans for a rescue effort last Monday, as they stood down and waited for weather conditions to improve, according to West Hawaii Today. From Tuesday to Thursday, the whale was tracked traveling around the Big Island before being seen again Thursday evening off Maui's south shore. The entangled whale was first spotted on the afternoon of February 13 off the Big Island's Kona Coast, 45 miles northwest of Hilo (above the response team in an inflatable craft  approach the whale off Kona) Males measure between 40 and 48 feet, while females measure between 45 and 50 feet. They can weigh between 25 and 40 tons. Their flippers are very long, usually between a quarter and a third of their body length; and their tails can be as long as 18-ft wide. They live mostly in polar to tropical waters, including in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Humpbacks migrate at three to nine mph and can travel over 3,100 miles  during each seasonal migration. On average, these incredible creatures have a life expectancy between 45 and 50 years. The following morning, a response team  assembled at Maalaea Harbor. When the response team on the rescue vessel arrived just before 8am, they found the whale's fluke tangled in at least five wraps of gauge line, according to the NOAA. Crew held the line and attached more buoys to keep the whale from diving and at surface level, while they successfully cut the line. 'There was no sudden thrashing. It would trumpet blow, which is a sign of stress,'  said Lyman. 'It definitely wasn't happy with us being there. It didn't understand.' Tissue samples were taken from the animal to determine its health before it was let go, and the rescue vessel returned to the harbor at 2.30pm. Entanglements like this could result in drowning, starvation, infections and increased susceptibility to ship strikes, according to authorities.","The 45-ton marine animal had several hundred feet of fishing line cut away .

"Britain’s foreign aid budget worth £11billion should be immediately suspended with the money diverted to help areas in the UK devastated by flooding, Nigel Farage said today. The Ukip leader insisted ‘charity begins at home’ and urged the government to step up its response to the colossal damage to homes, businesses, roads and railways. The call came as David Cameron was again forced to defend the government’s response from claims ministers have been slow to act and ill-prepared, even turning up to flood hit areas without wellington boots. Ukip leader Nigel Farage insisted 'charity begins at home' and demanded foreign aid money be redirected to help communities hit by flooding . Flood waters have risen over night in Moorland, Somerset, where residents have been advised to evacuate their homes . Heavy rain and gale force winds continue to batter much of southern Britain today, with new warnings of further flooding. Homes across much of the Somerset Levels have been evacuated while ministers are drawing up an emergency plan to repair a vital rail link at Dawlish near Exeter after its collapse when huge waves whipped up by high winds smashed a 100ft section of sea wall. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced an extra £30million for this year and £100million next year to pay for repairs, urgent work in Somerset extra maintenance. But Mr Farage insisted it was not enough. He said: ‘Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that a government’s primary duty is to the well-being of its own citizens. Charity begins at home and it is not mean-spirited to say that, it is just basic common sense. ‘The amount of damage caused by the floods and storms across a large swathe of the south west and other regions too is colossal. ‘Yet the Government’s response is both lethargic and inadequate. People would be forgiven for thinking that they don’t really care and that ordinary British families are not their priority.’ Residents in Moorland have been advised to evacuate their homes, as floods continue to cause chaos . High tide strikes again at the Dawlish train station in Devon where the train line has been exposed by the wild storm . David Cameron today leapt to the defence of his minister who visited flood-hit areas in black polished shoes. The Prime Minister rejected claims that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson had arrived in Somerset dressed like he was going to the Ritz. Mr Cameron said: 'I completely disagree with what you said about Owen Paterson who knows a lot about  rural issues and the countryside. 'He sits for  a rural seat, he was absolutely on top of those flooding issues. 'He went to visit the floods. He was not dressed as if he was going to the Ritz. He was dressed as if he was going to floods. 'He had a pair of wellies but because he was harassed as soon as he got out of the car he didn’t have a chance to put them on.' The government and the Environment Agency have faced mounting criticism for the handling of the floods and the response as more rain and high winds swept across the country. Today Mr Cameron was forced to defend his response during an interview on BBC Radio Manchester. He insisted: ‘We have been very pro-active we have an emergency planning system in government called cobra which we called on straight away. ‘We’ve been planning this across government. I chair a meeting yesterday which has everyone around the table, the police, the fire service, the local authorities, all ready to help with whatever we can.’ But the Prime Minister was critical of the Environment Agency's decision to cut back on dredging rivers over the past two decades. 'The fact is, since the Environment Agency was founded in the late 1990s, it took a view - and increasingly other organisations took a view - that dredging wasn't appropriate,'he said. 'I think that's wrong. I have a constituency that does flood frequently. I pushed for dredging and some dredging has taken place and it does make a difference. 'We've got to make sure that our system is focused on protecting people above all else, so some of the arguments against dredging have to be taken on and we need to start dredging again more systematically. The Environment Agency now accepts that.' He added: 'The scale of these weather events and the scale of the flooding has shifted even more something that was beginning to shift anyway. The Environment Agency had taken a very anti-dredging view for many years. That was beginning to change and now it's changing faster, and that's something I welcome.' Downing Street revealed the army could be called in to help rebuild the Dawlish railways line in Devon.","Ukip leader condemns government's 'lethargic and inadequate' response .

"A Liberal Democrat candidate said he 'regrets' using a selfie he took in front of a crematorium furnace as his profile picture on a mobile dating app. Josh Mason took a photo of himself posing at the Kirkleatham Memorial Park and Crematorium near Yearby, North Yorkshire, and later uploaded it to Facebook and dating app Tinder. The 26-year-old, who will stand as the party's parliamentary candidate for Redcar in the General Election in May, said today he 'deeply regretted' any offence he may have caused. Selfie: Liberal Democrat candidate Josh Mason took a photo of himself posing at the Kirkleatham Memorial Park and Crematorium near Yearby, North Yorkshire, and later uploaded it to dating app Tinder, above . But he stopped short of apologising for the photograph, which has been branded as 'disrespectful' by political opponents. The photo was first published on website Political Scrapbook, who claimed it was taken by Mr Mason while he was on a guided tour of the crematorium at its official opening last June. It shows Mr Mason, who is deputy leader of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, pulling a face  in front of the furnace. Roughly 400 cremations had already taken place there at the time. Response: Mr Mason, pictured, said today he 'deeply regretted' any offence he may have caused . Mr Mason uploaded the image to Tinder, which finds potential matches based on a user's location and Facebook information. Users then decide whether they want to make contact with any of the suggested dates - based mainly on the photos on their profile. Mr Mason's photo has been slammed as 'insensitive' by one  opponent, who called on him to apologise. Anna Turley, Labour's candidate for the seat, said: 'I am surprised that he would be so insensitive to families who have lost loved ones and show so little awareness of how his actions could offend.' 'I think he should apologise'. In a statement, Mr Mason said: 'Being born and bred in Redcar and Cleveland, I imagine that one day, Yearby Crematorium will be my own final destination. 'My visit there was a stark reminder of our shared mortality. Indeed, I have already said a last 'goodbye' to a number of family friends and colleagues there. 'Nevertheless, I deeply regret any offence I may have caused.' Mr Mason hopes to replace Redcar's current Lib Dem MP, Ian Swales, who is standing down in May.

"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has expressed his disappointment in former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for saying he doesn't think President Barack Obama loves the United States. In an interview on CNN's State of the Union program, Johnson branded Giuliani's words 'very regrettable.' 'His comments were not helpful...And I'm sorry to see statements like that coming from the former mayor whose response to 9/11 in 2001 I admired very much,' Johnson said. Scroll down for video . Opposition: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told CNN's State of the Union program, that Giuliani's claims that President Obama does not love his country are 'very regrettable' Criticism: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has questioned President Barack Obama's love of his country . Johnson revealed he was once hired by fellow New Yorker Giuliani as a federal prosecutor and the two visited fire stations and police precincts in Lower Manhattan on the September 11 anniversary. But while he admitted that he admired Giuliani's response to the 2011 attacks, he said he was sorry to see the former mayor make his recent statements. He added: 'I think his most recent statements are very regrettable.' The former mayor made his controversial remarks about the President Wednesday at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Governor Scott Walker. Giuliani said: 'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' Since facing a barrage of opposition over his comments Giuliani made an attempt to justify his claims saying it dates back to when the President was nine years old. Opposing view: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, seen here, also said Saturday that he doesn't know whether Obama loves his country . Giuliani said that the President's lack of affection for his country can be attributed to meeting Communist Party members when he was living in Indonesia 44 years ago. He suggested that Obama's meetings with Communist Party member Frank Marshall Davis, when the President-to-be was nine years old has affected his attitude towards America. He told Fox News that he wasn't 'questioning his patriotism', but said his rhetoric did not convey the pro-American sentiment he had heard from Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Yesterday Giuliani stood by his comments despite  receiving death threats on his voice mail in the wake of the controversial statements. 'Troubling': Giuliani suggested that Obama's meetings with Communist Party member Frank Marshall Davis, right, when the President-to-be was nine years old, affected his attitude towards America . The former mayor did not say whether he contacted police about the threatening calls but told CNN that despite the criticism he has also received widespread support. Yet, Democrats, members of the GOP and the White House have condemned his comments. Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said it was 'a horrible thing to say', while Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said it was the time for Republican leaders to 'stop this nonsense.' White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, spoke Friday saying that he feels sorry for the man who was once known as 'America's mayor.' 'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' Earnest said. But Giuliani hit back and told NBC Friday: 'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words.' 'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.'","Johnson made his remarks on CNN's State of the Union program .

"Tony Abbott has revealed he wanted to speak with the gunman at the centre of the Sydney siege but was warned by police it could make the situation worse. Man Haron Monis had demanded to speak with the Prime Minister over the phone after he took 18 people hostage inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in December. Mr Abbott, who released the joint federal-NSW inquiry report into the terror attack on Sunday, said he only learned of the demand on the evening of the siege. 'My response was if he wants to have a conversation, of course he can. (But) advice of police was it could make a bad situation worse,' Mr Abbott said. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott has revealed he wanted to speak with Man Haron Monis, the gunman at the centre of the Sydney siege, but was warned by police it could make the situation worse . The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege. 'Plainly, this monster should not have been in our community,' Mr Abbott said. 'The difficulty is that while he was well and truly on a lot of radar screens, he was routinely assessed as not being a threat to himself or to the community. 'Plainly, at some stage he did become a threat. We obviously do need more checks and more scrutiny in the visa process, in the citizenship process.' Hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson died when the 17-hour siege came to an end at the Lindt cafe in central Sydney on December 16. The gunman was shot dead when police stormed the cafe, ending the crisis.

Manager of the Lindt cafe, Tori Johnson (left) and barrister Katrina Dawson (right) died when the 17-hour siege came to an end at the Lindt cafe in central Sydney on December 16 . Mr Abbott said it was pretty obvious from the report that at every stage Monis had been given the benefit of the doubt. 'The cumulative effect of the benefit of the doubt being given to him time and time again is that he was able to wreak havoc on our community,' Mr Abbott said. He says there is an ongoing debate in a society such as Australia's between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community. 'My judgement is that while having always to respect both, the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn,' he said. Mr Abbott said the report concluded decisions made by various government departments in relation to Monis were 'justifiable under the circumstances'.

A total of 18 hostages were held inside the cafe for hours on December 15 with many escaping and running into the arms of police . 'But plainly, in their totality, the system has let us down,' he said. 'The system has let us down because plainly this guy shouldn't have been in the country, he shouldn't have been out on bail, he shouldn't have had a gun and he shouldn't have been radicalised to the extent that he claimed to be conducting an Islamist death cult attack here in Australia.' Australia needed to re-examine the system and ask itself if it needed to change the 'tipping point' from protection of the individual to safety of the community, according to Mr Abbott. Mr Baird said while decisions made by the various agencies were considered reasonable by the review, the system had let the community down. 'The recommendations that have come forward - we need to act and we need to respond and we will be doing exactly that,' Mr Baird said.

'I have a view it should actually go further,' he said. The report also comments on the need to reduce the number of illegal firearms.

"Georgina Martin, 46, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, claims her daughter's father is Jimmy Savile after he abused her when she was a teenager . A 29-year-old woman fears she could be Jimmy Savile's secret daughter after her mother was sexually abused by the paedophile DJ. The woman, who has not been named, claims her mother - Georgina Martin – was abused by the former Radio 1 DJ when she was just 13-years-old. Ms Martin, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said disgraced Savile had sex with her more than 20 times over a three-year period but ended the relationship when she discovered she was pregnant. The now 46-year-old conceived her daughter when she was 16-years-old and, despite having sex with another boyfriend during the same period, believes Savile could be the child's father. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I have carried the terrible secret that my child is likely to belong to Jimmy Savile for three decades. 'Now I have found the strength to speak out because we need to have a test to draw a line under this for her sake.' Ms Martin's daughter grew up with bright blonde hair, dark eyes and distinctive cheekbones – bearing some resemblance to Savile. She has now been given the news by her mother that she may well be Savile's child – and is demanding a DNA test to try and determine the true identity of her father. She told the newspaper: 'I want to know the truth, but I hope to God I was not fathered by that man. 'It would be the worst nightmare imaginable to find out Jimmy Savile was my dad.' The mother and daughter have now asked detectives from Operation Yewtree for help in obtaining DNA from Savile's family to try and aid their paternity test. Ms Martin claims she was groomed after first being approached by Savile outside Leeds railway station in February 1982. She said she 'instantly recognised' him from Jim'll Fix It and Top of the Pops and said the former DJ asked her if she fancied a cup of tea. She said he later asked for her phone number, which she handed over, and called her three weeks later to enquire about meeting up. After agreeing, she was collected by a man she claims was called 'Vince' – the name of Savile's older brother – and was taken to a penthouse flat on the outskirts of Leeds. Scroll down for videos . Ms Martin claims she was approached by the former DJ outside Leeds Railway Station when she was 13-years-old and later invited to his three-bedroom apartment (above), where they had sex on several occasions . Ms Martin said she was driven to the luxury apartment block in Leeds  where Savile once lived (pictured) and it was there that he had sex with her in the bathroom. They went on to meet up  20 more times in three years . She said the pair discussed his charity work at the three-bedroom flat, which was 'cluttered' and full of framed pictures of himself with other high-profile faces such as Prince Charles. They did not have sex on this occasion. Ms Martin claims she was then called by Savile a few weeks later, just before her 14th birthday, who said she should meet up with him to celebrate her upcoming birthday. She said she was again picked up and taken to his flat, where she was allegedly plied with alcohol before Savile had sex with her in the bathroom. The liaisons went on for more than three years, until March 1985 when Ms Martin informed Savile that she was pregnant. She said: 'At the time I was seeing Savile as well as a boyfriend closer to my age. I did have sex with both of them in the same month but I always knew it was Savile's child.' She gave birth in the December of that year and put her boyfriend's name on the birth certificate. However, she said she always made it clear that he was not her daughter's real father. In response, the boyfriend – who is now aged 52 and lives near Pontefract, West Yorkshire – said he believes he still is the father and claims he had 'never heard that she even knew Jimmy Savile.' A report published last summer charted how Savile became the most prolific sex attacker in living memory. The mass of NHS reports into his crimes revealed how the DJ boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes which he had removed from their bodies. The paedophile also gloated to others that he enjoyed 'posing' with the corpses and said that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds General Infirmary. Savile was revealed to be the most prolific sex attacker in living memory following his death in October 2011 . Investigators discovered that the late TV presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75. Starstruck NHS workers allowed Savile free reign to sexually abuse patients and hospital staff 'didn't want to hear or believe' what his young victims were saying, the report said. They detailed his 50-year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The reports outlined in unprecedented detail the sordid crimes he committed between 1962 and 2009. They revealed how he used his charming and manipulative personality to open the doors of hospitals and access their most vulnerable patients. He also used his fundraising activities as a cover to further his predatory sexual attacks, which targeted men and women, staff and patients. Since his death in October 2011, dozens of victims have come out to say they were abused by the disgraced television presenter and several investigations have been carried out to determine how his abuse went unknown for so long.

But the biggest game changer for Debbie, who is mother to Bradley, 14, and Connor, 11, was when her excess weight stopped her from following her dreams. She said: 'I'd always wanted to do a skydive. It was my life ambition to do one. But when I looked into it, I found out you need to be up to 13 stone to take part. 'I was devastated.' It was then that Debbie finally decided to battle her weight problems. After her GP prescribed her with a gym membership, Debbie started to rapidly shed body fat. She has now lost 13 stone in less than two years and now tipped the scales at 13st 1lb. She said: 'This is not the end, I feel a lot healthier and I have more energy. 'My confidence has tripled and I can now play with my kids and enjoy myself more. It has given me another life. 'The support from my family has been great as well. They have been a massive part of it. I don't think I would have been able to do it without my boys.' Debbie's weight loss was thanks in part to a new gym membership prescribed to her by her GP . After reaching the acceptable weight, Debbie has booked her skydive for May 16 . After reaching the acceptable weight, Debbie has now booked her skydive and has chosen to donate the proceeds to the North Staffordshire Heart Committee, which provided care for her mother Lilian Lovatt, who passed away in 2009 from heart failure at the age of 66. The event will take place on May 16, just three days before what would have been her mother's birthday. Debbie said: 'The heart ward was brilliant in caring for her, so the money I raise will go straight to them and hopefully help other families,' she said. 'I'll be thinking of her throughout the whole flight. But at the moment, when I stretch out my arms, I know she'll be there under me. 'She'll be my wings and I know she would be proud of what I've done.' Debbiehas chosen to donate the proceeds from her skydive to the North Staffordshire Heart Committee, which provided care for her mother Lilian Lovatt, who passed away in 2009 from heart failure at the age of 66 . Debbie's sister Dawn Adey, 47, from Brindley Ford, Stoke-on-Trent, says her sibling is as an inspiration to everyone. She said: 'It is such a fantastic achievement. We're all really proud of her and she has been an inspiration to the whole family. 'At her lowest points, she kept saying she couldn't do it, but we all encouraged her to get off the settee and get moving. 'At first she just started walking, but then she began doing more and more. 'I love her so much and it is amazing she is now doing a skydive. Mum cared for all of us and it means a lot to us that Debbie is doing this with her in mind.'

"A man was shot by Baltimore police officers in front of a huge mural remembering slain teenager Trayvon Martin. The incident took place in the 1000 block of North Fremont Avenue during a traffic stop according to The Baltimore Sun. Baltimore Police Department said an officer stopped the suspect's vehicle, then tased him before shooting him. Investigation: Baltimore police have begun to investigate an incident after an officer shot and tased a man Sunday afternoon on the city's west side . Police: The incident took place in the 1000 block of North Fremont Avenue in Baltimore around 12:30 p.m. Colonel Garnell Green did not say what circumstances led to the confrontation that occurred around 12:30 p.m. 'One of our officers initiated a car stop. During that car stop, the suspect got out of his vehicle,' Green said. 'What happens after that is still under investigation. What I can tell you right now is this: One of our officers did tase the suspect and another officer shot the suspect.' He said: 'This investigation is early on. We're still canvassing for witnesses, checking cameras, and we're asking anyone who has witnessed it to come forward.' Police did not say if the suspect, who is now in critical condition, was armed or how many times the suspect was shot or why officers attempted to pull the vehicle over. The police department did announce on Twitter that there had been an 'officer-involved shooting on the city's west side.' Few other details about the shooting are currently available, but police said the suspect was taken to an area hospital.

"African-American civil rights groups plan to protest outside Sunday's Oscars show, where every single one of this year's 20 acting nominees is white. However small, the demonstration will revive debate about diversity at the Oscars-awarding Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, whose voting members are overwhelmingly white and with an average age in their 60s. 'The goal of the protest is to send a message to the Academy, send a message to Hollywood, send a message to the film industry,' said Earl Ofari Hutchinson, head of the LA Urban Policy Roundtable group. 'And the message is very simple: you don't reflect America, your industry doesn't reflect America. Women, Hispanics, African-Americans, people of color (are) invisible in Hollywood.' Civil rights groups are planning protests outside Sunday's Oscars about Hollywood's lack of diversity. Selma director Ava DuVernay and star David Oyelowo were among those overlooked when the 2015 nominations were announced last month . Notable snubs this year include Britain's David Oyelowo who was widely tipped to receive a nomination for playing Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma . Halle Berry and Denzel Washington were famously lauded as having made a breakthrough for winning best actress and actor Oscars in 2002, but while there has been some progress in the decade since, it remains too little. Critics rounded on the Academy as soon as the nominations were announced last month, with all-white acting categories for the first time in nearly two decades: the last time was in 2011, and before that, 1998. Notable snubs included Britain's David Oyelowo, widely tipped for playing Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. The film's director Ava DuVernay, was also left out, although the movie is among eight best picture nominees. The Academy has defended itself. Its first African American president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, said shortly after nominations were unveiled that they spurred her to accelerate reforms to make the Academy more inclusive. 'Personally, I would love to see and look forward to (seeing) a greater cultural diversity among all our nominees in all of our categories,' she said at the time. But Darnell Hunt, head of the UCLA center for African American studies, and author of 'The Hollywood Diversity Report', said the Academy is heading in the wrong direction. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington were famously lauded as having made a breakthrough for winning best actress and actor Oscars in 2002, but 2015 has seen all 20 acting nominations go to white actors . Hunt, who plans to release an update on his diversity report in a couple of weeks, said that 93 percent of the Academy's members are white, about 70 percent male, while the average age is 63. 'In many ways the Academy is falling further and further behind because America is more diverse,' he said. 'In about two or three decades, we are going to be majority minority (with minorities making up most of U.S. population) and you are going to have an Academy with 90 something percent white? That makes no sense.' Peter Saphier, a member of the Academy since 1978 and former Universal executive who produced Scarface (1983), acknowledged that the body has some work to do. 'There should be more diversity within the Academy itself,' he told AFP. 'They are trying to do something about it. We have an African American president. She is doing all she can to increase the membership diversity.' William Smart Jr, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said: 'This is unjust, to see the lack of African Americans in the presentation. So we're mad! We're upset!' He stressed that there are 'so many' actors from various ethnics and racial groups. 'But the process eliminates them,' Smart said. 'There is an invisible ceiling over their heads, that the Academy has put there. We're calling for them to tear down that invisible ceiling.' Sunday's diversity protest is planned for 2:00 pm (2200 GMT), only minutes before Hollywood's finest begin taking to the red carpet for the pre-show fashion parade, and barely three hours before curtain up on the 2015 Oscars.

"A UFO spotted hovering above a popular beach has sparked mystery in a seaside resort. The unidentified object was caught on camera flying over Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, and has prompted people to take to social media in their droves in an attempt to decipher its origin. The three-pointed object has been touted as an alien UFO, a drone and even a Russian bomber plane after it was photographed last week. Scroll down for video . The mystery 'triangular' object (top right) was caught on camera hovering above Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, and many believe it could have been a UFO, drone, RAF fighter jet or remote-controlled plane . The object has caused confusion among Cornish residents, with many unsure as to what the object could be. The photo was sent to the Cornwall UFO Research Group, which receives about 40 to 45 sightings every year . However, it has now been claimed the mystery object was a radio-controlled seagull, which was fitted with a camera before being flown through the skies. The great UFO mystery began on Thursday when David Gillham, of Cornwall UFO Research Group, posted a photo on his Facebook page of the object. He accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Just received this photo 2 of 2 from a person in Bude. Any ideas what this object could be? 'Taken at Summerleaze Beach, Bude, N Cornwall 17th February 2015. Looks triangular....but I have no idea what it is? The second sighting I have witnessed around N Cornwall in two weeks.' In a post just days earlier, he uploaded an image of a snowy field with a dark, unusual-looking object hovering in the sky above. He captioned the photograph: 'Just received this photo 1 of 2 from a person in Bude. Taken at Davidstow, N Cornwall 3 February 2015.' He said both of the photographs were sent to him by a resident of Bude, who didn't notice the objects when he took the photos and only realised they were in the frame when he downloaded them to his computer. The posts were greeted with dozens of responses who claimed the objects could be a drone or one of the RAF fighter jet's which were sent to intercept two Russian Bear bombers off the coast of Cornwall last week. Mr Gillham also received this photo via his Cornwall UFO Research Group, which was taken by a resident of Bude. He said he could not decipher what the dark object was situated in the top right hand-side of the frame . He said he had tried to zoom in on the object but had only managed to see a dark object due to the resolution . The bizarre object sparked mystery for days until Van Johnive claimed the object was in fact his uncle's remote-controlled seagull. He told the Cornish Guardian: 'I can confirm that the ""UFO"" in the photo was my great uncle's Seagull RC Plane with a camera. 'The photos are of before and during flight of the Seagull before we crashed it upon landing on the cliff. 'Please apologise for the confusion for us. Thanks.' The lightweight model 'aircraft' is inspired by a seagull – complete with lifelike features and colourings – and is operated with an aerial and radio. It is not known whether it was being used for fun or as a deterrent to other birds of prey in the area. It has also not been confirmed by any experts whether it was in fact the 'seagull' which was the UFO in the photographs. The supposed revelation sparked surprise online, with many finding it rather amusing. Jade Louise Ullrich wrote: 'So funny. The councils should get a load of these and use them outside food establishments to stop us getting attacked.' While Lesley Hands added: 'Brilliant! If only all of life's mysteries were solved so easily.' However, Mr Gillham said he was still rather dubious that the object was the remote-controlled seagull and not something more sinister, such as aliens. He told MailOnline: 'I don't know whether it is that. One of the problems with the photo is that it was taken on a low resolution phone. I've tried to zoom in but all I get is a pixelated image. 'I did notice that in the top left-hand side there was a very bright area, a white light. 'One of things you've got to try and work out is the distance from the camera, where the object was seen. 'It's hard to judge because it's over the sea and the camera is quite far away but it seems a bit big to me to be a model seagull.' Mr Gillham said he had never come across remote or radio-controlled seagulls before. He said: 'It's the first time I've ever seen one, it seems he has some pretty hefty gear to fly it with. 'If the resolution was a lot better, I could've zoomed in and actually seen what it was but when I zoomed in you could just see black.' In 2011, this 'UFO' was caught on camera flying through the sky at Trenarren near St Austell, Cornwall. The image was taken by a walker who only noticed the mystery object upon downloading his photos to his laptop . This photo by Michael Potter last year appeared to show a mysterious flash of light (left) above the seaside resort of Mount's Bay. It was never determined what the UFO actually was, but it may have been a meteor . It is not the first time mysterious objects have been spotted above the county and the Cornwall UFO Research Group claims the region has more paranormal activity than anywhere else in Britain. Mr Gillham said he gets about 40 to 45 sightings every year and said they often 'come in waves'. Last year, amateur photographer Michael Potter captured a 'mysterious object' flashing across the sky as he photographed cloud formations above the seaside resort of Mount's Bay. The grandfather's erie photograph showed an unexplained flash of light streaking across the sky and he spent weeks puzzling over the identity of the UFO, which he initially thought was the result of a problem with his camera. The object, which appeared to have a triangular shape, appeared in the so-called 'UFO Triangle', an area off the Cornwall coast where spooky sightings are common. However, while its exact existence was never determined, sceptics suggested that it was likely to be a meteor burning up in the sky as it shot towards Earth. And in 2011, a 'UFO' was caught on camera flying through the sky at Trenarren near St Austell, Cornwall. The image was captured by a walker who didn't notice it in his photograph until he downloaded it to his computer hours later. Mr Gillham, who founded Cornwall UFO Research Group in 1995, said at the time: 'The person who took the photo never saw anything in the area while taking the photo. 'It was only when he got home and downloaded it onto his computer that he saw an object - a disc shaped craft, hovering just above the sea. 'There appear to be two trails of water beneath the object which looks as though they are falling from it in to the sea. 'It could be that the object has just emerged from the sea.' Mr Gillham could not shed any further light on the origins of the object, which left many scratching their heads for an explanation. However, some people pointed out that it could have been a seagull during mid-flight and Mr Gillham himself also said that RNAS Culdrose confirmed to him that it was a seagull.","Mystery 'triangular' object spotted above popular beach in Bude, Cornwall .

"An enormous Cold War-era bomber which first flew in 1962 has been resurrected from the Air Force's scrap heap to serve the nation once more. The B-52, nicknamed Ghost Rider, was mothballed seven years ago at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona - the so-called boneyard where decommissioned planes are kept in storage. It took to the skies once more on February 13 after months of painstaking restoration, which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more. Scroll down for video . Airborne once more: This B-52 bomber, nicknamed Ghost Rider, took to the skies earlier this month after spending seven years mothballed in Arizona . Ready to fly: The long-range attack plane, which first entered service in 1962, was painstakingly restored to airworthiness at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona . Bolted back together: The powerful jet, which can deliver nuclear and conventional munitions almost anywhere on earth, needed extensive replacements, but managed a 1,000-mile test flight without problems . The hot, dry conditions in the desert mostly helps preserve the aircraft, but also had the effect of bleaching Ghost Rider's grey hull to an almost white white. She was flown from Tucson to another base in Shreveport, Louisiana, where it will be tested and receive further repairs before rejoining the fleet. When fully functional, Ghost Rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons, conventional or nuclear, almost anywhere on the planet. The plane, which will be one of 76 kept flying the the Air Force, has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank, and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft. Easy does it: The flight, to Shreveport, Louisiana, was taken on at lower speeds and altitudes than usual for safety reasons . At the helm: Colonel Keith Schulz's, the Air Force's most experienced serving B-52 pilot, flew Ghost Rider on February 13 . However, for its first flight since being decommissioned in 2008, Ghost Rider was limited to 288mph and did not rise above 23,000ft. It also kept its landing gear down the whole way. Air Force chiefs say they waited until after the flight had ended to announce it due to safety concerns. In a published report on the restoration, Colonel Keith Schultz, who piloted Ghost Rider, said: 'I've been flying the B-52s since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years...she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems. Bleached: The hot Arizona weather, which mostly helps preserve the planes, also bleached parts of the B-52 almost white . Back in the fold: When fully restored, Ghost Rider will be one of 76 B-52s which the Air Force keeps active. The planes have been in service since the 1950s . 'It took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed.' The flight was the first time a B-52 has been brought back to duty after being retired. Ghost Rider was needed once more to replace a B-52 which caught fire and was left with a burned-out cockpit, according to the Shreveport Times. The plane was so badly damaged that Air Force engineers decided it would be cheaper to bring back an old plane than try to fix that one.","Bomber, which first saw service in 1962, flew again earlier this month .

"Getting through an airport might not be the most exciting part of a holiday, but it's unavoidable if you want some  winter sun. If you're travelling through a UK airport, though, the experience won't be as good  as it could be in, say, Moscow or Reykjavik. According to passengers who voted in the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards, the best European airport for customer service is Keflavik International Airport in Reykjavik, Iceland, with Moscow Sheremetyevo, Porto, Malta and Zurich completing the top five.

Hlynur Sigurdsson, director of the Leif Eiriksson Air Terminal at Keflavik Airport, said he was surprised the airport had won in the face of a 20 per cent increase in passenger numbers, but put the success down to improving the airport's free wifi service and keeping the public areas clean. He said: 'The 10-point improvement from last year is truly remarkable in light of a 20 per cent hike in passenger numbers and considerable renovation work being conducted simultaneously in the check-in area. 'We have worked diligently with our staff and other service providers to improve the services that are most important to our customers.

"Airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins, a coroner has warned. Pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes, Sheriff Payne said. Demanding an urgent response from airline bosses, the Dorset coroner said: ‘In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.’ Scroll down for video . British Airways co-pilot Richard Westgate (pictured) died aged 43 in December 2012. His family are convinced that he was the victim of 'aerotoxic syndrome' and was poisoned to death by toxic fumes from plane cabins . The warning – which comes after Saturday’s Daily Mail revealed the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes – sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years. The coroner’s intervention is the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy and even death. He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. The coroner said inquiries into Mr Westgate’s death were not yet completed, but he was concerned by his initial findings. Mr Westgate’s parents Judy and Peter, who are awaiting an inquest into his death, last night claimed airlines and regulators had failed to act on evidence of poisoning. Mrs Westgate, 74, said: ‘Richard would complain about his aircraft being smelly. He would go away and come back from work trips feeling worse. It is hard not to believe there has been some sort of cover-up.’ Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset who is currently investigating BA pilot Richard Westgate's death, has warned that those who are regularly exposed to plane fumes face 'consequential damage to their health'. He has now prepared a report which calls for urgent changes to prevent future deaths . Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between so-called ‘fume events’ and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous and can lead to long-term neurological and respiratory conditions, and brain tumours. The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this ‘bleed air’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘organophosphates’. Tristan Loraine (pictured), a former airline captain, believes the only long-term safe solution is 'for all aircraft to be built with the unique bleed free architecture currently flying on the Boeing 787' In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff. But the Dorset coroner said that if a pilot’s judgment is altered, every person on the plane may be at risk of death. Mr Payne has written to British Airways boss Keith Williams and Andrew Haines, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, saying: ‘In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.’ He said he is concerned cabin occupants are being exposed to organophosphates, causing ‘damage to their health’. Aerotoxic Syndrome was first suggested as a medical term in 1999. Two government inquiries have dismissed the risk as minimal. But Frank Cannon of Cannons Law Practice, who is representing Mr Westgate’s family, said he has been approached by more than 50 former airline staff and two frequent fliers, and is preparing legal claims against a number of airlines. ‘It seems there is a mixture of crass ignorance and a cover-up,’ he said last night. ‘The airlines have known about this for a long time – we have seen staff who have been reporting this since 2000.’ Mr Cannon said some people are genetically protected, because they can break down the toxic compounds, but claimed others are vulnerable. He urged frequent fliers and crew to take DNA tests to see whether they are at risk. Former British Airways captain Tristan Loraine, who flew for 19 years, said the problem was airlines’ ‘dirty little secret’. 'Aerotoxic syndrome' is the term given to the 'illness' caused by exposure to contaminated air in jet aircraft. Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have been subjected to long-term illnesses due to the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and 'toxic fumes'. Numerous scientific studies have been carried out since the late 1970s to try and determine whether contaminated cabin air is the cause of chronic health problems. Symptoms of 'aerotoxic syndrome' are said to include: Fatigue, blurred or tunnel vision, loss of balance, seizures, memory impairment, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, nausea, diarrhoea, breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes, nose and upper airways. If Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset, rules in the inquest into the death of British Airways co-pilot Richard Westgate that cabin air was partly to blame for his death, then it will be the first time an independent judge in the UK has put this on record. For years he suffered numb fingers and feet, nausea and a chemical blister on his nose. He was forced to retire in 2006 after becoming disorientated during flights, a problem his doctors have linked to fumes in the aircraft. ‘Like everyone else I trusted the industry … Some of my symptoms could be put down to just flying a lot and jetlag,’ he said. ‘The company doctors, whom I often saw, didn’t have any answers.’ A British Airways spokesman said it would ‘respond to the coroner in due course’. Last week the airline said it saw ‘no trends in sickness rates which would indicate a link with cabin air issues’ and said studies had shown ‘no increase in overall cancer or mortality rates’ among crew. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said government-funded research had found that ‘any link to ill health is unlikely’ but said it would look at the coroner’s report.","Sheriff Stanhope Payne has warned of dangers of exposure to cabin fumes .

"A veteran Labour MP has come under fire for claiming Ukip could not win his seat even if his party selected a 'raving alcoholic sex paedophile' as its candidate. Austin Mitchell claimed there was 'no chance' Labour will lose Great Grimsby, where he is standing down after four decades as MP. The seat is a key Labour target for Ukip, whose candidate accused Mr Mitchell of 'insulting' voters and taking their support for granted. Veteran MP Austin Mitchell claimed Labour could hold his seat of Great Grimsby even if the candidate was a 'raving alcoholic sex paedophile' In 2010, Labour won with 32.7 per cent of the vote, just ahead of the Tories on 30.5 per cent, with UKIP in fourth on 6.2 per cent. However, Victoria Ayling, who stood for the Conservatives in 2010, is now the Ukip candidate. An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft in December put Ukip on 34 per cent, just behind Labour on 35 per cent with the Tories down to just 20 per cent. Now Mr Mitchell has dismissed the idea that Labour is on course to lose a seat it has held since 1945. He told The Independent on Sunday: 'There is no chance we'll lose Grimsby, even if we selected a raving alcoholic sex paedophile we wouldn't lose Grimsby. 'I don't think there is a problem in Grimsby. There will certainly be a rise in the Ukip vote now that they have a councillor and did quite well in the European elections. But when it comes down to it their vote isn't concentrated enough to win any seats.' Labour won Great Grimsby in 2010, with the Tories in second place, but an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft in December put Ukip just one point behind . Ukip candidate Victoria Ayling, who was the Tory candidate in 2010, accused Mr Mitchell of insulting Grimsby voters . However, the remarks have been condemned for playing into the idea that Labour is taking its supporters for granted. In October, Labour came within 617 votes of losing the Heywood and Middleton by-election to Ukip, despite the party boasting on polling day it would win with a majority of more than 3,000. Senior Labour figures privately admit they have struggled to tackle the threat posed by Ukip on one side and the Green party on the other. Ms Ayling, who came within 700 votes of winning the Grimsby seat for the Tories in 2010, accused Mr Mitchell of 'insulting the great people of Great Grimsby'. She added: 'It's exactly the sort of 'take them granted' attitude that is turning people away from the establishment parties. 'Austin Mitchell has been a respected constituency MP but he's assuming that people don't think very carefully about how they vote. People do think very carefully and I don't like Mr Mitchell insulting the people of Grimsby.' Mr Mitchell hit back on Twitter, accusing the Independent on Sunday of bad journalism . Even Labour's own candidate in the seat, Melanie Onn, said Mr Mitchell's comments were 'awful'. Last night Mr Mitchell responded by accusing The Independent on Sunday of 'bad journalism' saying his comment was a response to an attack on Grimsby and the Labour candidate, Melanie Onn. 'Making summation of nowt,' he wrote on his Twitter feed. 'Was a response to an attack on Grimsby and Mel. Grimsby is loyal, Labour & Great.'","Austin Mitchell claims there is 'no chance' Labour will lose Great Grimsby .

"Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has returned to the ringside for the first time since her sex-change operation. Ms Maloney was pictured at Villa Park in Birmingham with close friend White Dee as they watched a match. She was back ringside on Friday night, a day before she revealed that she was considering returning to the sport. Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney returned to the ringside for the first time since her sex-change operation . Ms Maloney revealed that she was having a sex-change in August last year, shocking the world of boxing . Ringside: Ms Maloney was enjoying herself as she watched eight matches at Villa Park in Birmingham . White Dee joined Ms Maloney ringside as the close friends met for an evening of sport in Birmingham . Ms Maloney, formerly known as Frank, helped Lennox Lewis become world heavyweight champion and retired from the sport in 2013. She shocked the macho world of boxing in August last year by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. The 61-year-old has already undergone hormone therapy, electrolysis to remove excess body hair, counselling and voice coaching. She also underwent facial construction surgery in November, which went drastically wrong when she stopped breathing. The procedure left Ms Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, with a severely swollen face and the former promoter revealed that she thought her head would 'explode' after the agonising surgery. Ms Maloney, formerly known as Frank, helped Lennox Lewis become world heavyweight champion . Ms Maloney yesterday said she was considering applying to have her promoter's licence reinstated after a two-year hiatus . The 61-year-old looked on intently as she watched her first live boxing match since retiring in 2013 . She has since recovered and looked to be enjoying her evening at the boxing on Friday night, tweeting that she was 'ringside with lovely Dee' as she watched eight matches. The visit inspired a possible return to boxing for Ms Maloney, who yesterday revealed that she was considering applying to have her promoter's licence reinstated. She was invited to the bouts by boxing promoter John Pegg, and was said to be scouting for talent ahead of her possible return. Her highly successful career, which spanned more than 30 years, saw her manage five boxers to world titles as well as many more British, European and Commonwealth champions. 'I would love to go back and prove that Kellie can achieve the same thing Frank achieved,' she told BBC Radio 5 live. 'If I feel like it, I think I will apply for my licence.'

The two friends smile as they take a picture with a fan during a break between matches on Friday night . Her highly successful career, which spanned more than 30 years, saw her manage five boxers to world titles as well as many more British, European and Commonwealth champions . She also said that she consulted American boxing promoter Kathy Duva over her potential return. Duva is one of the few women to hold a managerial role in boxing and Ms Maloney was grateful for her insight. 'I've been over to New York, met with Kathy and we've chatted and she's told me to go for it, so I'm really considering it,' she said. Ms Maloney also revealed that it was a difficult decision to go public about her sex change last year. 'Transitioning is a very hard thing and a very personal thing and I believe you've got to do it. Frank was a very unhappy person, if I tell the truth.' MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.","Kellie Maloney was seen watching boxing with her close friend White Dee .

"Turkey has launched a military operation into Syria in order to evacuate troops guarding a tomb containing the remains of the 'grandfather' of the Ottoman Empire. Nearly 600 troops and 100 tanks and were involved in the operation to extract soldiers guarding the crypt and to move it to a new location, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Sunday. The tomb of Suleyman Shah, grandfather of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire is sovereign Turkish territory, and some 40 troops have been guarding it since the start of the Syrian Civil War. Scroll down for video . Moving in: Turkish army vehicles drive through Kobane, during the operation to retrieve the garrison guarding the Suleyman Shah mausoleum in northern Syria . Breaking ground: Turkish soldiers put a wire fence around area after Turkish flag is raised  in the Esme region of Aleppo where the Tomb of Suleyman Shah will be placed . Standing guard: Turkish soldiers protect at the new location as the Turkish Army launched a military operation into Syria to evacuate soldiers guarding Tomb of Suleyman Shah . The location of the tomb, in Karakozak village, northeast of Aleppo, is surrounded by ISIS fighters, putting the lives of the Turkish military guards at risk. The overnight operation was split in two, with one group crossing into Syria to reach the tomb to repatriate the soldiers and extract the remains of Suleyman Shah . A second group took control of an area near the Turkish border where authorities plan to move the tomb, Turkish media reports. One soldier was killed in an accident during the operation, Prime Minister Davutoglu said today. 'We had given the Turkish armed forces a directive to protect our spiritual values and the safety of our armed forces personnel,' Davutoglu said in televised remarks. Returning: Turkish soldiers stand guard at the entrance of the memorial site of Suleyman Shah, grandfather of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire, in Karakozak village, northeast of Aleppo, Syria . Incoming: Nearly 600 troops and 100 tanks and were involved in the operation to extract soldiers guarding the crypt and to move it to a new location, . The sun rises as Turkish troops stand guard over what is set to become a new Turkish enclave in Syria . Davutoglu said on his Twitter  that the remains of Suleyman Shah would be moved to a different area of Syria which had been brought under Turkish military control. Turkic leader Suleyman Shah was born circa 1178, and was the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. He is believed to have drowned in the Euphrates around 1236. His followers headed north into what is today Turkey, where they launched the Ottoman Empire. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I, a treaty was signed between Turkey and France, then the colonial power in Syria. The 1921 Treaty of Ankara assigned an area of 8,000 sq.m. northeast of Aleppo, containing the tomb, to remain Turkish territory. The location of the tomb was flooded in 1973 due to the building of a new dam, and Turkey moved the mausoleum. Some historians question official accounts about the Shah's tomb, saying they might have been retrospectively concocted to enrich an imperial identity for Turks. The tomb, once some 22 miles from Turkey on the banks of the Euphrates River, was in Syria's embattled Aleppo province and is considered Turkish territory. The overnight operation was launched 11 months after ISIS militants threatened to launch an attack on the tomb unless Turkey removed its troops within three days. At the time, the Turkish government responded that any attack on the location of the tomb would be considered an attack on Turkish soil. Prime Minister Davutoglu said today that Turkish troops later destroyed the tomb's complex, apparently to prevent it from being used by ISIS militants. Authorities launched the operation around 9pm Saturday and ended it Sunday morning, he said. Kobane was the focus of U.S. airstrikes as Kurdish forces battled militants of the Islamic State group, who hold about a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in their self-declared caliphate. Turkey stayed out of the battle at the time, which saw Kurds ultimately push out the extremists. The U.S.-led coalition forces were informed of the Turkish operation after its launch to prevent any casualties, Davutoglu said. U.S. officials offered no immediate comment.

"A group of young men in Saudi Arabia have been arrested for 'playing loud music and dancing inappropriately' at a private party. The men were celebrating one of the group's birthdays when police stormed the apartment they were in in the city of Buraydah in Qassim province. Officers of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, commonly referred to as the morality police, were acting on a tip off, local media reported. A group of men were arrested in the city of Buraydah in Saudi Arabia (above) after a resident phoned police to report their loud music and 'inappropriate dancing' Buraydah is home to some of the kingdom's most conservative clerics with many residents observing Wahhabism, a strict interpretation of Islam. An unnamed official told the news website Ayn al-Youm the men were found 'in a compromising situation' by police. There was cake and candles at the apartment, he added, but there were no signs the men had been drinking or cavorting with women which are both against the law. None of the men were dressed traditionally, he said, before urging parents in the area to prevent their children from engaging in such behaviour 'because it can lead to immorality and even homosexuality'. Critics took to Twitter to condemn the raid, pointing out that the men had not committed any crimes. Others ridiculed their arrests by sharing photographs of royals performing the traditional Saudi sword dance which is widely accepted as being masculine. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is tasked with enforcing Islamic law in the region and is known to take action against residents they consider to be inappropriately dressed. In 2008 the force arrested an American businesswoman for having a coffee with a male colleague in a Starbucks in Riyadh. King Abdullah (left), who died last month, had appointed a reformist police chief. Upon ascending to the throne however, King Salman (right) gave the position to a different cleric . The 37-year-old mother-of-three said she was strip searched and forced to sign a false confession after the incident which, she said, left her fearing for her life. Police issued a statement defending her arrest, condemning her behaviour as against Sharia law. In October 28 people were arrested after attending a 'depraved' party near Madinah. Officers seized alcohol and musical instruments in the raid which came after 30 people were arrested on suspicion of Satanism and debauchery the previous year. Former police chief Sheikh Abdullatif al-Sheikh was considered as trying to reform the force's practices under the then reigning monarch, King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz. Following his death last month, the newly crowned King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud relieved Sheikh Abdullatif al-Sheikh from the position and appointed Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sanad as the new agency executive. Critics ridiculed the raid on Twitter, sharing photographs of royals performing a traditional sword dance which is considered masculine.

"Formula One driver Fernando Alonso was today taken to hospital after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph. The 33-year-old McLaren driver was taken from the track by ambulance after suffering concussion during the high-speed accident. The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test in Barcelona. Aid: Formula One driver Fernando Alonso was yesterday taken to hospital by helicopter after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph .

Damage: Fernando Alonso's McLaren car is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck in Barcelona . Taken away: The crash was on the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Catalunya . Help: Medical staff hold sheets around Alonso  as he is evacuated from the medical centre to the helicopter . McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'. After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four at the Circuit de Catalunya. Team director Eric Boullier said: 'Fernando's accident was just one of those things that happens in testing. 'Fortunately, he's fine, but was concussed during the accident, which therefore required an overnight stay in hospital as a precaution. That's normal practice after a concussion.' The Spaniard crashed after completing 20 laps. The accident occurred at turn three, when Alonso went off course and the right-hand side of his car hit the wall. Neither the team nor track officials have reported the cause of the crash. Mr Boullier said the car was not badly damaged. A Circuit de Catalunya spokesman said all driving on the course - which is located in Montmeló, in the north of the city - was stopped until 2pm local time (1pm GMT). The spokesman had said: 'We hope that everything's alright and all ends with just a shock.' Leaving: It was unclear whether the crash was a result of a driver error or a malfunction with the car .

Ferrari, the two-time champion's former team, tweeted: 'All the best Fernando.' It was unclear whether the crash was a result of a driver error or a malfunction with the car. Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.","McLaren driver, 33, taken from track by ambulance and then to hospital .

"Rich people in America have better and more sleep than people with lower incomes, a study revealed (above file photo) Rich people get more sleep than people with lower incomes, a study revealed. Ethnic minority students, along with students from lower-income families or those living in urban areas get less sleep compared to wealthier white males, according to the Columbia University study. Researchers surveyed 270,000 students in America from both public and private schools between 1991 and 2012, and asked them: How often they slept for more than seven hours a night and how often they sleep less than they should. The recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours, however students from lower-income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night. This could be due to housing quality, obesity and conditions that disrupt sleep, according to researchers . Surprisingly, while these students received less than the recommended amount, they reported they felt they had received enough rest. Girls reported having less hours of sleep compared to boys. Factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the Internet and social media, and demands of school and extracurricular activities (above file photo) Stick to the same bedtime: Sleep experts believe going to bed and waking up at the same times on a regular basis is vital for healthy sleep. This is because humans have an inbuilt body clock called the circadian rhythm. Controlled by hypothalamus at the base of the brain, it governs the body's daily alternation between sleep and wakefulness. Take a hot bath: Taking a hot bath before bed can help induce sleep, says Paul Martin, author of a new book called Counting Sheep. This is because your body temperature has a strong influence on how fast you fall asleep. A night's sleep is normally proceeded by a slight drop in body temperature and scientists have established that this drop in temperature tells your body to go to sleep. The theory behind taking a hot bath is to raise your body temperature artificially before allowing it to drop again as it adjusts to the cooler environment of your room. The trick, says Martin, is to take a bath one to two hours before bedtime and keep your bath temperature warm, rather than hot. Treat yourself to a hot, milky drink: It may sound like an old wives' tale but taking a hot milky drink can encourage drowsiness because milk contains sleep-enhancing properties. This is thanks to its calcium content, which sleep experts claim can help you relax. It is also rich in tryptophan, which the body converts into serotonin - a natural hormone in the body that can make you sleepy. This compares to coffee - which is twice as stimulating as tea due to its high caffeine content. Sleep experts recommend drinking coffee no later than within two to three hours of going to bed, so that your body has a chance to process the caffeine. This disparity could mean those from lower-income families and ethnic minorities have not received enough education on the importance of sleep when it comes to health. Students from middle and higher-income families who had parents that received a high school education regularly reported having more than seven hours of sleep. The study also found that girls had less hours of sleep a night compared to boys. The recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours, however students from lower-income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night. Over the years, 15-year-old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it dropped nine per cent from 1991 and 2012 (above a graph of the amount of sleep adolescents receive by age group) Over the years, 15-year-old children had the biggest drop in sleep as it decreased a total of nine per cent - from 71.5 per cent in 1991 to 63 per cent in 2012. And generally, there has been a decline in adolescents who are not getting enough sleep, one-third, which could be a public health concern. Factors that are potentially contributing to the decline of recommended sleep includes the increase use of the Internet and social media, and demands of school and extracurricular activities.","Ethnic minorities, students from lower income families or those living in urban areas get less sleep compared to wealthier white males .

"It's 'very likely' Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be moved from their Bali jail cells for execution this week, Bali's chief prosecutor says. Momock Bambang Samiarso says he's only waiting on the green light from Nusakambangan, the jail island where the executions will take place. There has been no word as yet, but it is 'very likely' to happen this week, he says. 'What we want is the sooner the better,' he told reporters on Monday. Scroll down for video . The executions of Andrew Chan (L) and Myuran Sukumaran who are on death row in Indonesia for drug smuggling have been delayed . Advisers to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (pictured) say he should get the executions over and done with . 'If they (Nusakambangan) can be fast, we'll be fast too.' The arrival of fighter jets in Bali has fuelled speculation the Bali Nine pair would be moved soon. The prosecutor didn't comment on that, but said there would be a meeting on Monday to discuss changes to the plan to transport the men by air. Meanwhile advisers to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo say he should get the executions of drug offenders over and done with, as pressure builds from overseas. Australia has been making strong representations for clemency to Indonesia on behalf of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, sentenced to death in 2006 for the Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot. An adviser on corruption to Mr Joko, international law lecturer Hikmahanto Juwana, told Indonesia's Metro TV on Sunday that Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff viewed Indonesia as 'easily pressured'. He argued it would be better for Indonesia to push ahead with the executions before any other foreign 'manoeuvres'. 'If it were me, I'd say just finish the executions,' he said. Michael Chan (left) and Chinthu Sukumaran (right) outside Kerobokan prison today to visit their brothers Andrew and Myuran . Brazil has taken the strongest stance so far, choosing not to accept the credentials of Indonesia's new ambassador, who has now been recalled to Jakarta. Brazilian drug smuggler Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira was executed last month, reportedly without receiving his last rites. Pleas for a Brazilian man set for execution this month, Rodrigo Gularte, have gone unheeded, despite evidence he has a severe mental illness. The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to the execution site of Nusakambangan island was postponed last week after it was found there weren't enough isolation cells for more than five prisoners. This comes after the brother of Sukumaran spoke out about of his brother's love for Indonesia as reports emerged that fighter jets had arrived in Bali to escort the two men to their deaths. Speaking on behalf of his brother outside Kerobokan prison, Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew Chan are very grateful to the Indonesian people for their respect and help during their ten years in jail. Chinthu Sukumaran arrives at Kerobokan Prison in Bali last week to visit his brother Myuran who is facing execution by firing squad in Indonesia with fellow Australian Andrew Chan . 'Myu and Andrew love Indonesia, they have a great respect for the Indonesian people and its culture,' Chinthu said. 'It was through the support of the Indonesian justice system that they were able to help set up many programs that have helped a lot of Indonesians and has also helped better themselves and they are very grateful for that', Mr Sukumaran told Perth Now. It comes after four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport. It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan. The presence of the fighter jets only adds fire to speculation that the men may be flown from Denpasar to Nusakambangan in helicopters, instead of taking the traditional route of sailing there. Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters the family barely speak when they visit Myuran in jail and said he does not need the added strain of seeing his beloved family members crying at the moment. 'We were all standing around barely talking,' Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters of the morning his family had gathered at the prison to say what they thought were their last goodbyes. 'We were trying to tell each other there was still hope but it just felt like we were lying to each other' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. The family had understood the move would 'definitely happen this week.' Both Michael and Chintu spoke on behalf of their brothers who are awaiting execution at the prison . Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew love Indonesia and the respect they have shown them during their 10 years in prison . Chinthu Sukumaran said his brother Myuran was comforting his family on Tuesday as they collected his artworks and wept. 'He was trying to be strong,' he told the Herald. 'It was very difficult. For him to stay strong at a time like that, he really didn't need people crying around him.' When news reached the Bali Nine pair at midday that their transfer to Nusakambangan 'death' island  would be delayed, Myuran Sukamaran got back to his painting and had something to eat with his loved ones. Four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport.It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan . 'Myuran said he could actually taste the food. That hadn't happened for a long time,' his younger brother told reporters. He also slept for the first time in a long while. Indonesian authorities had planned to move Sukumaran and fellow prisoner Andrew Chan to the island at midnight but announced a last-minute delay because of 'technical matters.' It leaves the men more time to spend with family visiting from Australia, and more time for their lawyers to prepare a legal challenge. The men have been locked-up in Kerobokan prison for almost 10 years for trying to smuggle drugs to Australia. Despite the delay,  President Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead as planned, telling Indonesian media on Friday that it was the nation's 'legal sovereignty,' and that the postponement was 'only about technical matters'. An earlier picture of Chinthu Sukumaran (left), his mother Ranjini and sister Brintha with a photo of Myuran Sukumaran, one of the 'Bali Nine' condemned to die by firing squad for drug trafficking in Indonesia . Indonesia's Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo explained that isolation rooms and executions fields on the island were not ready for the pair,The Sydney Morning Herald reported, but said the pair's execution should take place 'the sooner the better.' The reason was later disputed by officials on Nusakambangan island, following claims that the families of Chan and Sukumaran were entitled to more time with the pair. Meetings to plan the transfer continued on Friday, but no date has been set. 'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters. On Thursday, Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons.' Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island. The news came after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia. Andrew Chan's and Myuran Sukumaran's families speak to journalists at a press conference in Jakarta last week. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead. Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported. But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'. President Widodo told local media that Ms Bishop had clarified the remarks, speaking directly with Vice-President Jusuf Kalla. 'She has explained that it wasn't the intention. Actually we wanted to say something but since it has been explained, we cancelled it,' said Widodo. Senior government figures were concerned Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo, after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's (right) carefully crafted campaign to spare their lives . The comments had previously sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'. 'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax . Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad. 'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.' Chan and Sukumaran are enjoying a few days' reprieve from the firing squad after Indonesia delayed moving them from their Bali jail cells . 'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) The temporary reprieve gives the condemned men's lawyer, Michael O'Connell, precious time to progress their case. Mr O'Connell says it's a strong one, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles to determine whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president. Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well. 'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday. 'They are very grateful for it and they simple wait and hope.'","Advisers to Indonesia's President say get executions over and done with .

"Dozens of men have posed in mini skirts in protest about the low status of women  in Turkey after a 20-year-old student was murdered after she is believed to have tried to stop a man raping her. Ozgecan Aslan's burned body was found in woodland after she is alleged to have tried to resist a sexual assault by minibus driver Ahmet Suphi Altindoken who then stabbed and clubbed her to death, it is claimed. Her death saw thousands of people take to the streets of Turkey during several days of protests about the lack of equality in the country, and saw women share their stories of harassment and violence on Twitter. The murder of Ozgecan Aslan has caused outrage in Turkey, with people protesting in the streets about violence against women in a country where females are frequently seen as not equal to men and has now seen men pose in miniskirts in neighbouring Azerbaijan to call for equality in the country . More than 1,500 men have posted pictures of themselves wearing miniskirts in a campaign for equality . Men in neighbouring Azerbaijan, which has strong cultural ties to Turkey, have now started their own social media campaign to call for better rights for women, by posing in skirts and holding up signs bearing Miss Aslan's name. The men have posted pictures of themselves in skirts using the hashtag #y which translates to ‘wear miniskirts for Ozgecan’. The campaign aims to draw attention to the notion that wearing a skirt is seen as provocative, highlighting the poor way women are treated and regarded. And as the anger continues in Turkey a second hashtag has emerged calling for men to don their skirts and go to Taksim Square in Istanbul for further public protests. More than 1,500 men have taken part in the campaign so far. Miss Aslan's death has caused outrage in Turkey where women are frequently killed at the hands of violent men and are seen as having a lower status - a view recently inflamed by comments made by the Turkish president who said women were not equal to men. Her death has also led to calls for the death penalty to be used for her killers. Ozgecan Aslan was allegedly attacked by the bus driver and killed after she used pepper spray against him . Dozens of people took to the streets following Miss Aslan's murder to protest against the status of women . A woman with red tears painted on her face (left) and another with a bullet hole (right) took part in protests . The student was reported missing on February 11 in Tarsus in Turkey. According to reports she was the only passenger left in a minibus driven by Altindoken, who allegedly changed the route of the bus when the other passengers got off and attempted to rape her. It is then claimed that when she resisted him and used pepper spray he murdered her and disposed of her body. Altindoken has been arrested for the murder, as well as two other people who have been held in connection with the killing. Days of protests have ensued, with women taking to the streets with red tears and bullet wounds painted on their faces. Other have marched, bearing placards with the student's picture on.","Ozgecan Aslan, 20, was found burned in woodland near Tarsus in Turkey .

"Three Gold Coast Titans players have been stood down from the team effective immediately amid the cocaine crisis currently rocking the NRL. State of Origin  players Greg Bird and Dave Taylor are the latest players to be implicated in the scandal, and Gold Coast Titans CEO Graham Annesly announced in a press conference on Sunday evening they had been stood down. The big name rugby league players were both served with notices to appear in court on Sunday evening, according to the Courier Mail. Mr Annesly confirmed these reports, but said he didn't have any further information. Scroll down for video . Greg Bird is one of three Gold Coast Titans players stood down on Sunday night amid the NRL club's cocaine crisis . Winger Kalifa Faifai Loa was also stood down on Sunday, after being charged earlier in the day. So far six players have been charged. Faifai Loa and former squad member Joe Vickery were charged on Sunday, whilst hooker Beau Falloon and fringe first grader Jamie Dowling were charged on Friday. Mr Annesly said it was his understanding that no one else from his club was caught up in the controversy, but acknowledged the massive damage it was doing to the club. 'I don’t think anything would surprise me but my information is this is the last of it for our club,' he said on Sunday. 'To be constantly dragged through these kind of scandals this is incredibly damaging for the club.' The CEO also confirmed that players would be forced to cover their own legal costs for the potentially lengthy processes ahead, and said there would be a contractual review for those involved. Dave Taylor is also one of the latest players to be implicated in the scandal . Mr Annesly also revealed that the NRL as a whole had been supportive of the club through recent times of turmoil. 'We've had nothing but support from the NRL right through this process.' Last week it was revealed the career of code-hopping Queensland Reds Super Rugby star Karmichael Hunt was in serious doubt after he was arrested on charges of cocaine supply and possession along with, reportedly, two Gold Coast Titans rugby league players. The charges are a result of an ongoing operation by Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) and local police, focusing on a period between June (when Hunt was still an AFL player) and December of last year. Detectives questioned Hunt on Thursday night, ahead of his arrest. Two other men, one identified by the Telegraph as being Gold Coast Titans player Beau Falloon, 27, are also understood to be facing counts of the same offence. Falloon was the Titans' NRL player of the year in 2014. A woman was also taken into custody. Winger Kalifa Faifai Loa was also stood down on Sunday, after being charged earlier in the day . Queensland Police believe they have broken up a drug cartel and are continuing investigations into other suspects. Eight people have now been arrested in the ring, with four to appear in court on the drug charges. Queensland's CCC said that four men are expected to front court in the coming days. 'Four men will face drug supply offences after being identified allegedly arranging the supply of cocaine during an ongoing drug trafficking investigation by the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC),' a statement released on Sunday said. 'The CCC will allege that during an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in South East Queensland, these men were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine. 'The CCC can confirm the four men were identified during the same CCC drug trafficking investigation as four other individuals who were served with a Notice to Appear in Court on Thursday 19 February 2015.' The CCC statement also revealed a 26-year-old man from Burleigh Waters, a 31-year-old man from Mermaid Beach, a 25-year-old man from Burleigh Waters and a 25-year-old man from Miami were all served notices to appear in court. The 26-year-old is facing one count of possesion, the 31-year-old two counts of supplying a dangerous drug, with the 25-year-old from Burleigh Waters is facing one supply charge. The 25-year-old from Miami is facing seven counts of supplying a dangerous drug. Code-hopping Queensland Reds Super Rugby star Karmichael Hunt was arrested on charges relating to cocaine supply and possession on Friday. Two other men and a woman are also in custody . Three-code Australian footballer Karmichael Hunt faces charges of drug supply after a Crime Commission operation in Queensland . It's believed the charges against Karmichael Hunt follow an ongoing operation by Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission and he was arrested on Thursday night . The Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) also released a statement on Friday, which said four people had been charged as part of an investigation into a cocaine trafficking syndicate in south-east Queensland. Among them, it stated, was a 28-year-old man from Hendra who was facing four counts of drug supply and who is due to appear at the Southport Magistrates Court on March 5. 'During an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in southeast Queensland, these four individuals were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine,' the CCC said in a statement. If proved, the charges threaten to end a glittering sporting career just when Hunt appeared in the mix to cap it by playing for the Wallabies at the Rugby World Cup later this year. It comes just weeks after another former Queensland rugby league representative, Jason Smith, was arrested and charged with trafficking offences. He was taken into custody with a restaurant owner, Jason Wood, and the pair was charged with supplying the illicit substance between June and December of last year. Smith remains on bail and will reappear in Toowoomba Court again on May 6. Police prosecutors will also allege that former New South Wales Origin player Matt Seers had taken part in drug deals. Their bail conditions including having no contact with each other. Hunt left rugby league to try his hand at AFL, playing 44 games for the Gold Coast Suns before signing to play rugby union for the Queensland Reds . Karmichael Hunt, 28, has played three codes of football in Australia. He was a rugby league international during his days as a Brisbane Broncos player before a high profile switch to AFL and the Gold Coast Suns. He is in custody following a police operation which has reportedly busted a drug syndicate . Hunt was on Thursday named at fullback for the Reds in their match against the Western Force at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night but is unlikely to take his place. The crisis led to the Reds postponing a pre-match captain's media conference on Friday morning, as reports of Hunt's arrest spread. Both the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) and the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), were scrambling to respond to the shock news. The Reds, in particular, were in crisis mode with costly off-season signing Hunt having been named to play at fullback against the Western Force at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night. No comment was made but a joint statement was issued: 'The Australian Rugby Union and Queensland Rugby Union are aware of reports regarding Karmichael Hunt.' 'The ARU’s Integrity team and the Queensland Rugby Union are making enquiries into the reports.' Similarly, the Suns released a statement: 'The Gold Coast Suns have been made aware of charges laid against Karmichael Hunt through the media reports this morning.' 'As this matter is now before the court, it would be inappropriate to make any comment.' The Titans issued a short statement acknowledging the reports linking them to the operation. 'The club is aware of current media speculation in relation to police charges on the Gold Coast,' the statement said. 'We are currently trying to confirm the veracity of these reports and a public statement will be made immediately we have been able to do so.' An NRL spokesman added that the game's governing body was 'seeking advice from the Titans on the matter.' Hunt, 28, has played three codes of football in Australia, the only sportsman to have done so at the elite level.

"A tourist attraction popular with children has sparked fury by displaying a model railway version of Auschwitz complete with cattle trucks, labourers' huts and barbed wire. A Holocaust survivor was among those to criticise Birmingham's Wonderful World of Trains and Planes for the 'crass' miniature railway set of the infamous concentration camp. The static train set is a dark addition to the intricate village green, mountain and woodland rail layouts at the venue, which is popular with children and model enthusiasts. A model railway version of Auschwitz, complete with guard towers and barbed wire, at a tourist attraction popular with children has sparked fury . Labourers' huts and cattle trucks are on display as part of the exhibit at Birmingham's Wonderful World of Trains and Planes . The static train set is a dark addition to the intricate village green, mountain and woodland rail layouts at the venue . The detailed model of Auschwitz, where at least 1.3million people were slaughtered during the Second World War, shows a train entering the Nazi death camp. The model of the camp where around a million Jews were murdered is situated next to a 1930s seaside scene and Swinging Sixties London in the tourist attraction. The exhibit claims it 'will take you on a journey of adventure past, present and future'. Matt Lawson, a Holocaust expert from Edge Hill University, said: 'It's a step too far and I really don't understand the thought process. Did someone wake-up one morning and say, ""you know what this place needs..."" 'I think the Holocaust is a vital part of kids' education. But I also think that during a light-hearted, family day out to suddenly be confronted by a model of a concentration camp is bizarre. 'If it was a prisoner of war camp, maybe it would be OK, but this is a concentration camp. Thankfully, it's a static display. Imagine if the train was moving. I do think it's very unusual, I do think it's out of place.' The detailed model of Auschwitz, where at least 1.3million people were slaughtered during the Second World War, shows a train entering the Nazi death camp . A Holocaust expert said it was a 'step too far', while a concentration camp survivor also criticised the model . Mala Tribich, a survivor of both Ravensbrück and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps who now gives talks on the traumatic experiences, also criticised the model railway. The 84-year-old said: 'What are they trying to say? They used trains in wartime and trains played a very big part in the Holocaust, they could not have done what they did without trains. 'They were moving millions of people, but then you have to show the whole exhibition in a different context. As it is, it is useless, frivolous, even.' Visitor to the attraction Simon Hardy said: 'It's just unthinking and crass. Totally bizarre, those are the only words for it. 'It is just not something you put in a train exhibition, it is just not something you put in a fun activity centre where you can play with Scalextric. It's not the kind of thing you buy from a toy shop or even a hobby shop.' The attraction's managing director defended the piece, saying it had proven popular with visitors . Death camp: At least a million Jews were killed at Auschwitz during the Second World War . Peter Smith, managing director of Birmingham's Wonderful World of Trains and Planes, defended the piece and said it had proven popular with visitors. He said: 'It's gone down very well. I have seen people in tears as they realise that without the trains the Holocaust would not have happened. 'For some schools, it's part of their curriculum so we can show it to them. There is nothing moving.' He pointed out that the attraction has a HS2 high-speed rail link scene, adding that 'some may find that more controversial'. 'Our depiction of a concentration camp is meant as a small reflection on those who suffered during the War. It does not represent Auschwitz or anywhere in particular. However, the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz was celebrated in January and so our little model is a timely reminder of that,' he said. Of all of the Nazi's extermination camps, Auschwitz is the most infamous because of the especially large number of people murdered there. Auschwitz, in southern Poland, was the final destination for one in six of Europe's Jews as well as prisoners of war, gypsies and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazis. The original camp, Auschwitz I, was built in 1940 to house Polish and Soviet prisoners, and continued to do so throughout the Nazi period, although Jews were also held in the camp from the start. Auschwitz II-Birkenau was built in 1941 and was designated an extermination camp by SS leader Heinrich Himmler the same year. One of the first death camps, gas chambers were pioneered at Auschwitz and replaced the unreliable gas van method, which saw small groups murdered using the carbon monoxide produced by the exhaust. The technology paved the way for a further five large camps: Chelmno, Sobibor, Bełżec, Majdanek and Treblinka, as well as two smaller camps, Sajmište in what is now Serbia and Maly Trostinets in Belarus. But of all the camps, none murdered as many as Auschwitz which, after mass transports of prisoners began in 1942, was able to ‘process’ 9,000 Jews a day at the peak of its operations. Among those who died at Auschwitz II-Birkenau were 400,000 Hungarians, 300,000 Poles, 69,000 French, 25,000 Belgians, 7,500 Italians and six British Jews from the Channel Islands. Of the estimated 1.3million murdered at Birkenau, 200,000 were children.","Model train set of Auschwitz at children's tourist attractions sparks anger .

"Gullible workers were tricked into trashing their own convenience store by a prank caller posing as their corporate bosses. Two employees at a roadside Circle K store in Globe, Arizona, let off fire extinguishers inside the store, smashed up a computer and threw extinguishers through store windows at the unknown caller's behest. He apparently convinced the pair to destroy their workplace, while customers were inside, by claiming he was calling from Circle K's corporate security department. Trashed: This Circle K store in Globe, Arizona, had all but one of its widows broken by employees who were tricked into throwing fire extinguishers through them . Tricked: Two gullible employees thought the outlandish instructions were coming from their superiors in Circle K's corporate security department . They followed the commands because they were told it was the only way to shut off a silent fire alarm, police said. After smashing the computer, the two realized something was amiss, and stopped their rampage, local news station Fox10 Phoenix reported. By this time the outlet, which doubles as a gas station, was left so battered it was forced to close. Only one window was left intact. The store was open the day after the Wednesday evening call, after the windows had been boarded up.

"Parents have been warned that allowing their children to miss just a week of school can cut their chances of succeeding by up to a quarter. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today released research showing the dramatic affect just a few days absence can have on attainment. She claimed it ‘busts the myth’ that term-time holidays are harmless and vindicates headteachers who take a hardline stance with parents who break the rules. Figures for 2012-13 show the impact of missing just 14 days on pupils' ability to gain good GCSE results . The coalition changed the law so that headteachers can only grant leave from school in exceptional circumstances. But many parents have complained that the cost of package holidays is so much cheaper during term-time that they have no choice but to take their children out of school. However, the Department for Education today released data which it claims shows how as little as a week off each year can put pupils behind those who miss no school. It examined how many pupils achieved the English Baccalaureate, which includes a GCSE at Grade C or above in English, maths, history or geography, the sciences and a language. Some 44 per cent of pupils who missed no lessons achieved the so-called ‘gold standard’ of qualifications. But this fell to only 31.7 per cent of those who missed 14 days over two years of studying for their GCSEs, equivalent of around one week per year. Among those who missed 28 days over two years, just 16.4 per cent achieved the English Baccalaureate standard. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the research busts the myth’ that term-time holidays are harmless and vindicates headteachers who take a hardline stance with parents who break the rules . As a result of the crackdown on term-time absences imposed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days’ holiday a year. Instead, they can allow leave only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ Each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays. A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans. At primary school, pupils who misses 14 days at age 11 were a quarter less likely to achieve level 5 or above in reading, writing or maths tests than those with no absence. Mrs Morgan said: ‘The myth that pulling a child out of school for a holiday is harmless to their education has been busted by this research. Today heads across the country have been vindicated - missing school can have a lasting effect on a pupil’s life chances.’ Under the new rules, each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays. A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans. Mrs Morgan added: ‘This is why we are doing all we can to encourage more pupils back into class by toughening up on term-time holidays and attendance. Heads and teachers are now firmly back in charge of their classrooms thanks to our plan for education and new flexibility over term dates allow them to set term breaks outside of peak times. ‘Fewer pupils than ever before now regularly skip class, while more pupils than ever before are leaving school with a place in education, employment or training. ‘But today’s research shows we must never slip in our mission to ensure all pupils leave school properly prepared for life in modern Britain.’ Roy and Jenny Davies were fined £240 for taking their children Alistair, 14, and Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic year' Last week a couple who took their children on a term-time holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic' year have been dragged into court and fined £240. Roy and Jenny Davies pulled son Alistair, 14, and daughter Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a week so they could enjoy some much-needed 'quality time'. The holiday followed a stressful year in which a family member died and Mrs Davies underwent emergency surgery which left her unable to walk. While the family deemed their circumstances 'exceptional', Alistair's school did not agree, fining the parents £60. Parents have campaigned for holiday prices to be slashed now legislation stops families from taking time off during term time. More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Government to force holiday companies to cut their prices, meaning it could be debated in Parliament. As many as two-fifths of parents would flout the rules so they can get a cheaper summer holiday, a poll found last year. One frustrated father Paul Cookson, 41, was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to Center Parcs with his seven-year-old daughter Phoebe. His Facebook rant  about perceived 'rip-off' prices went viral, with outraged parents sharing the post more than 143,000 times. ‘I think I’ve touched a nerve with this one,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why I should be penalised for sticking to the rules.’","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan releases data on impact of absence .

"Eleven children are among 48 people who drowned in Bangladesh today when a ferry carrying at least 100 passengers capsized and sank. The ferry collided with a cargo vessel and foundered within minutes on the Padma River. It was the second deadly boat accident in a fortnight in Bangladesh, which has a history of ferry tragedies. About 50 passengers were able to swim ashore or tread water long enough to be rescued. Divers were tonight working under floodlights to pick bodies from the water. Officials admitted they did not know the exact number of people missing. Men carry the shrouded bodies of drowned victims of a ferry tragedy on the River Padma in Bangladesh .

Rescues carry the body of another victim to shore as they work through the night to recover the dead . 'Divers have recovered 41 bodies. The dead included 11 children and seven women,' local police chief Rakibuz Zaman told AFP. The death toll has risen throughout the day. Survivors said the MV Mostofa was overcrowded with about 70-150 passengers crammed into the upper and lower decks. They were left scrambling to find loved ones when the tragedy struck. 'I was holding my mother’s hand when the cargo boat hit our ferry from behind,' an 18-year-old who gave his name as Al Amin told AFP at the terminal. 'Within two minutes the ferry was sunk. Before I realised I was washed away to the middle of the river. 'I swam and a ferry rescued me. But I don’t know what happened to my mum.' Police chief Zaman said some 50 people 'swam ashore or were rescued by other vessels'. Local newspaper Prothom Alo quoted one survivor, Hafizur Rahman, as saying tragedy struck 15 minutes after departure. Many passengers were trapped beneath decks and unable to escape. 'I was on the deck of the ferry and fell into the river. Those who were on the deck were able to come out but none of the passengers inside could get out,' Mr Rahman told the paper.

Rescue workers struggle through crowds as they carry another body bag into the ferry terminal . Bangladeshi ferries do not normally keep passenger lists, making it difficult to establish how many are missing after an accident. An official said a salvage vessel was on its way to raise the sunken ferry, adding that the master of the cargo ship and two other crew had been arrested. The ferry was submerged 20ft beneath the surface of the river, said Inspector Zihad Mia, who is overseeing the rescue operation. 'We don’t have a clear picture about how many were exactly in the ferry when it sank,' Insp. Mia told Reuters. 'But I think many have survived.' Rescuers were unloading bodies from small boats at the ferry terminal in Paturia, some 50 miles from the capital Dhaka. People have gathered there to identify the dead. 'We found one body but five are still missing,' Hindu holy man Kumud Ranjan Goswami said. 'We were returning home after the opening of a temple' Authorities ordered an investigation into the accident and a five-member committee has been asked to submit a report within 15 days, the Ministry of Shipping said in a statement.

The Padma river is one of the largest in Bangladesh, a nation formed around the delta of the great River Ganges and criss-crossed by more than 230 rivers. Boats are the main form of travel in many of the remote rural areas, especially in the south and north-east of the country, which is one of Asia's poorest. Capsizes are common. Experts blame poorly maintained vessels, flaws in design and overcrowding for most of the tragedies. This month, at least five people including a child were killed when an overloaded ferry carrying some 200 passengers capsized in an estuary in the south of the country. About 50 people were also killed in August last year when a crowded ferry sank in rough weather in the Munshiganj district. Naval officials have said more than 95 per cent of Bangladesh’s hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized boats do not meet minimum safety regulations.","Divers working through the night to pluck bodies from the Padma River .

"For radicalised Muslim women in Britain and beyond who seek to marry into the blood-stained ranks of Islamic State, Saja al-Dulaimi is the ultimate icon. She is the striking former wife of the supreme IS leader and mother of his child; a smuggler of gold chains worth hundreds of thousands of pounds – hidden under her burka – to finance the IS’s murderous schemes, and a figure so senior she was once central to a high-value prisoner exchange. And now, along with her daughter by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, she has special martyr status. Her home is a cell in the grim Yarze jail, one of the most feared prisons in the Middle East, a military detention centre in Beirut notorious for its dungeons and systematic use of torture. Described by one Lebanese general as a ‘fabulous beauty behind her veil’, the defiant prisoner in her early 30s is barred from receiving visitors. Heavily armed female soldiers on the all-women wing pace the corridors outside as they keep watch over their prized captive. The only picture: Saja al-Dulaimi is the ultimate icon for radicalised Muslim women in Britain and beyond . Dulaimi is probably the most infamous female jihadi operating in the maelstrom of the Middle East – although only one picture believed to be of her exists. Born in Iraq into a family of lethal fanatics, her ex-husband is responsible for spreading bloody carnage across Iraq, Syria and Libya. Dulaimi was caught late last year close to Lebanon’s Mediterranean coast with the couple’s daughter after an American tip-off to Lebanese authorities. She was using false papers and smuggling huge sums of gold under her Islamic dress to fund the murderous activities of militants. Despite weeks of intensive questioning, however, she has said almost nothing and, astonishingly, her daughter Hajaa, thought to be only ten years old, has also refused to crack. To the dismay of local and Western intelligence agencies, neither has given any significant information; reports concluded both are ‘well-trained’ to withstand interrogations. Yet, slowly, security teams are piecing together a hazy picture of a mysterious woman connected by family and three marriages to some of the world’s most deadly firebrands. ‘One day they’ll make a movie about her,’ concluded an observer. Certainly this independent and beguiling woman must have stood out in the sinister world of Islamic fanatics as she flitted around Middle Eastern countries using false names – such a contrast with conventional jihadi imagery of docile women hidden away in homes. One analyst concluded her exploits on behalf of the extremists marked her out as an ‘honorary jihadi man’; another even called her ‘a bit of a superstar’. Such is the secrecy swirling around Baghdadi and his ex-wife, there are few precise details known about their relationship. Baghdadi is thought to have had three wives, although Dulaimi is the only one ever seen in public. Yet she refused to confirm their marriage under interrogation in prison, sometimes responding in an aggressive or rude manner to questions. She even told one senior officer her husband was dead. Lebanese security sources say they wed six years ago in Syria, staying together for only three months. Saja al-Dulaimi is the former wife of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and is the mother of his child . Their union would have come after Baghdadi was freed by the Americans, who held him for three years in the aftermath of their ill-conceived invasion of Iraq in 2003. Having been radicalised in prison, Baghdadi became head of the group now known as IS within a year of his release. DNA tests using samples taken during his detention confirm Hajaa is the daughter of the self-styled successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Yet one senior Iraqi government source said there was evidence the couple married in 2005 – which would fit with the age of their child – and remained formally wed until two years ago. ‘Everyone is very tight-lipped about her,’ said Abdel Bari Atwan, author of Islamic State: The Digital Caliphate. ‘The problem is that these ultra-orthodox Islamists do not like to talk about their wives, and when it comes to Baghdadi there is little known about his wives or children.’ Dulaimi had previously been married to another Iraqi militant leader named Fallah Ismail Jassem, with whom she had her first child. He was gunned down by Iraqi troops five years ago. Iraqi sources believe Dulaimi spent time in the Lebanese port of Tripoli last year before moving to Arsal, a turbulent mountain town on the border, swollen by tens of thousands of refugees from the conflict in Syria. During her months there, she frequently crossed the border wearing gold chains worth up to £25,000 hidden by wearing full hijab, knowing male border guards would not search her, then sold to provide funds for fighters. Lebanese security sources say she was so successful she is ‘implicated’ in providing several hundred thousand pounds to rebels from Al Nusra – an Al Qaeda affiliate group – in the Syrian border regions. She was caught in mid-November at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Madfun near the fishing village of Berbara, with papers claiming to be a Syrian called Mallak Abdullah and two other sets of false documents. She was in the early stages of pregnancy after hooking up with her latest husband, a Libyan or Palestinian militant from another extremist Sunni group who has been arrested on charges of assisting Dulaimi in funding terrorism. One intelligence source, asked what she had revealed, replied: ‘Only the devil knows. ‘My colleagues believe her CV, obtained by Lebanese security, is fraught with false confessions to avoid giving damaging leads.’ Such is the confusion, Iraqi officials have even claimed she is not Baghdadi’s wife but the sister of a senior Al Qaeda commander awaiting execution in their country. Dulaimi’s importance to IS first became apparent amid negotiations early last year to swap 150 women and children held by the Syrian government for 13 Greek Orthodox nuns, kidnapped by Islamist rebels. During tense discussions, negotiators from Al Nusra insisted a woman identified as Saja Khalaf must be among those freed, even postponing the deal several times until this was agreed. ‘The negotiators said she was very important,’ disclosed one security source. ‘They were ready to cancel the deal for her sake.’ The group was finally released in March, ‘Khalaf’ walking out with dainty handbag hanging from her arm and her two children alongside her. When a local official touched her, an Al Nusra operative screamed: ‘Keep your hands away from that woman – no one touches her.’ Days later, it emerged why she was seen as so special. First, a leading local jihadi cryptically tweeted: ‘If only you knew, my brother, who was released in the negotiations, you would have cried a bit and laughed a lot.’ Then, an Al Nusra emir tweeted the truth: ‘Our sister, the wife of Sheik Abu Bakr, God bless him, was freed by us. We did this because it’s our duty.’ Incredibly, the shaky Syrian regime had released the former wife of IS’s leader – a person of immense symbolic and strategic significance to the barbaric group. Now she is a possible pawn again in hostage negotiations, this time over the release of 25 Lebanese security personnel threatened with execution by IS and Al Nusra after being seized last August. A Lebanese Salafist attempting to mediate their release claimed to have received a letter from IS demanding Dulaimi’s release in return for those kidnapped. However, if she does end up dying for her twisted cause, Dulaimi would be far from the first member of her extraordinarily-militant family to meet a bloody end. Her father was a high-ranking jihadist who may have arranged her marriage to seal an alliance with Baghdadi as the self-proclaimed caliph began his rise to power. He was reportedly killed in September while fighting against the Syrians. She has three brothers, all thought to be militants fighting in Syria and Iraq. One is said to have been caught and sentenced to death for a bombing in Basra. Her sisters include one reported to have died in a suicide attack, while a second was arrested with 13lb of explosives wrapped around her body in the Kurdish city of Irbil, northern Iraq. This is indeed an extraordinary life story that seems like a film script. But sadly it would be for the darkest and most blood-drenched of stories, starring a deadly woman playing a key role in the horrific events ripping apart the Middle East.","For radicalised Muslim women, Saja al-Dulaimi is the ultimate icon .

"Fans of Gary Glitter (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court where he was convicted of sexual offences) expressed support of singer in Amazon reviews . Amazon is still carrying glowing reviews of Gary Glitter CDs, with fans describing the paedophile as 'not a vile monster' despite his numerous convictions for sexual offences against children. Among products for sale on the website are the artist's Greatest Hits album, with 23 customers rating the CD with five stars, the highest possible review on the site. Most made reference to his chequered criminal past but said it had 'nothing to do' with his abilities or success as a musician. One fan even cast doubt over his convictions, writing: 'He would have been massive in America before his ""crimes"" came to light'. The 70-year-old was found guilty of sexual attacks at Southwark Crown Court this month, his youngest victim an eight-year-old girl. It was the latest in a string of convictions relating to indecency and children, having been jailed for three years over separate incidents in 2006 and tried in court in 1997 after police found child pornography on his computer. Among the most supportive comments is one written by a fan calling himself 'R N Smith'. It reads: 'Gary glitter is a genius and should have been more popular than Elvis, I believe he would have been massive in America before his “crimes” came to light. 'I personally could listen to his music every day and I very often do. 'I don't believe for one minute that he is this vile monster everyone paints him to be, most of you claim to know so much about what he has supposed to have done and yet hardly anything has ever been published regarding his crimes.' Another said they felt sympathy for the paedophile who they had grown up listening to. 'I am so upset for this guy - yes I know he has gone to places people don’t wish to speak of. 'But I grew up in the Seventies and I thought him the Sweet, Mud, Slade, T rex - Suza Q, Showaddywaddy, etc were great send up fun. 'Do you remember when it was the thing to go to Glasgow and watch the New year GG show ? well I do and went a few times too..... a great night out - what a deep shame... coz it was very very good.' Among reviews for the singer's many CDs are some which dismiss his convictions for sexual assaulting children . Among comments of support for the musician were others describing him as a 'lowlife'. Many fans acknowledged his convictions but said they should be kept separate from his body of work. Amazon has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment on the matter. Earlier this month Glitter was found guilty of a string of sexual assaults on children as young as eight. It comes after the paedophile was first found guilty of possessing child pornography in 1997. After being sentenced to four months imprisonment he fled the UK. After settling in Cambodia, in 2002 he was deported to Vietnam having been accused of the rape of a child. Three years later he was arrested trying to board a flight to Thailand. Six girls and women, aged 11 to 23, came forward to say they had had sex with the musician. Following his conviction of offences this month he was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 27. Glitter was arrested in Vietnam in 2006 over the sexual assault of children. Last month he was convicted of more offences in London . The singer was previously convicted of possessing child pornography. Above, he addresses the media at a 2000 press conference over other alleged assaults .","Dozens of reviews remain under singer's Greatest Hits album on the site .

"Alejandro Betts (pictured) who advises the Argentine government, has written books denouncing British rule of the Falkland Islands . A leading propagandist in Argentina’s long-running campaign to claim the Falklands has been denounced as a traitor – not just to the Falkland Islands, where he was born, but to his daughters and heavily pregnant former wife. Alejandro Betts, who advises the Argentine government, has written books denouncing British rule of the ‘Malvinas’, including a recently published work presented to Pope Francis, an Argentinian by birth, a few weeks ago. But the family he abandoned when he left the Falklands has spoken out, claiming the real reason he left was not to follow political principle but to pursue an Argentinian mistress Santina Toranzo, in June 1982. His British daughter, Magaly Betts, said: ‘We were brought up with the knowledge that my father had cheated on my mother and left her when she was heavily pregnant for an Argentine woman just before the Falklands War. ‘The reason my father left the Falklands was never political. He actually made a choice to abandon my pregnant mother for this woman and everyone on the islands knows about this. ‘Since he has left the islands for Argentina he has not acknowledged our existence and has chosen not to participate in our lives. I would not want anything to do with him.’ Now a senior Argentine civil servant, Betts remarried in Argentina and in 2007 unsuccessfully stood for mayor of Cordoba, which is the country’s second largest city. He is also a government adviser on the Falklands. He has been dubbed ‘the Falklands Lord Haw-Haw’ – after the notorious William Joyce, who broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK during the Second World War and was hanged for treason in 1946. Late last year, the Argentine embassy in London issued a book called Malvinas Matters in which Betts wrote a chapter about how he discovered the ‘truth’. He outlines Argentina’s historical claims, which centre on Spain’s control of the islands during the 18th Century, and his conviction that islanders were blocked from the truth by the British. Betts, a fourth generation Falklander, who changed his name from Alexander to Alejandro, has previously said: ‘I stood up for what I thought was best for the Malvinas, for the Falklands, and that is where my heart still lies.’ Yet for the family he abandoned, the book is another callous insult. Betts was born in 1947 and in 1978 he married his second wife Rosa, who was working in Government House in Port Stanley. In January 1981, Rosa, a Chilean, gave birth to Magaly and soon after became pregnant again. Now living in North Wales, Rosa, 62, remembers the day that Alex abruptly ended their relationship with a phone call when she was visiting her family in the Chilean port of Punta Arenas. Betts  married Rosa in 1978 (pictured) - she now lives in North Wales after he left her and their children . She said: ‘Just a few days before Christmas Alex phoned me and said: “I have got someone else. We have fallen in love. I want you to stay with your mother in Chile.” ‘I said: “Thank you, so you are washing your hands of us? No, thank you. We will sort this out when we are back in the Falklands.’ ‘Alex had come out to collect me and the children. But on the plane back he told me that when we arrived in the Falklands he would leave me. 'That’s exactly what he did. When we landed in Port Stanley he went off.’ In 1987 Rosa, Magaly and Zoe would move to the UK. Rosa said: ‘I was ill, I wanted a better future for my children and when Magaly was only three she was being taught how to recognise a bomb. I did not want them growing up with this. ‘But the main reason was that after the war Dawn used to go to school in the Falklands, and if her father spoke out publicly in Argentina, they would say, “Poor Dawn, your father is a traitor”. ‘What he did was not my fault, was not my children’s fault. I did not want Dawn to continue to suffer this and I did not want Magaly or Zoe growing up with this. ‘He does not mention in his book that we were married and had two children together. He never mentions to the Argentine people that he left a heavily pregnant woman. He was never pro-Argentine when we were married. On the contrary he was pro-British. He followed whatever the Argentine government told him to do. That’s it.’ Betts meanwhile is resigned to the fact that he can never go back to the Falklands. Of the family he left behind he will say only: ‘Anything Rosa might have to say doesn’t interest me. 'I am sure she tells a very neat version that fits into her life and way of thinking. I don’t think it is anything worth troubling about.’","Leading propagandist Alejandro Betts advises the Argentine government .

"Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa . The nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa. Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics being investigated. Their ‘fitness to practise’ is being assessed by regulators. According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported. In theory, if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards, they could be ‘struck off’. However, bearing in mind the nature of their lifesaving efforts in Africa, they are more likely to receive a slap on the wrist if they fail to clear their names. It is understood the investigation centres on claims that signs of Ms Cafferkey’s illness were ignored before she flew back from Sierra Leone to Scotland, potentially placing fellow passengers at risk. The inquiries are an embarrassment for the UK, given the plaudits the country received for the work of British medical staff in the ebola-hit area. The nurse, who had spent three weeks working for Save The Children at an ebola treatment centre, was diagnosed with the virus on her return to Glasgow in December. According to reports at the time, she had complained of feeling ill when she landed at Heathrow from Sierra Leone, but despite having her temperature tested seven times she was cleared to fly on to Scotland. When Ms Cafferkey, 39, became feverish, she was transferred by RAF Hercules back to London to be treated at the Royal Free Hospital. After being treated with blood plasma from an ebola survivor and an experimental new drug, she made a full recovery. Now Ms Cafferkey and two other nurses are being investigated by their governing body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, while two doctors in their party are subject to a General Medical Council probe. The investigation was launched after Department of Health officials carried out a review of the screening process at Heathrow for the 30 NHS staff who flew back from the affected region with Ms Cafferkey. Drama: Ms Cafferkey recovered after being flown from Glasgow (pictured) to London for treatment . An interim hearing to decide whether Ms Cafferkey should be placed on restricted duties could be held within days: the Nursing and Midwifery Council can bar or suspend nurses from the profession because of misconduct or incompetence, or on grounds of ‘character’ or poor health. Officials were forced to trace more than 200 passengers who had sat close to Ms Cafferkey during her journey from Sierra Leone. A Save The Children review concluded that she probably contracted the virus by wearing a visor as part of her protective equipment instead of goggles. At the time, the charity’s chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: ‘Lessons have already been learned and as a result of the findings we have further tightened our protocols and procedures.’ Dr Martin Deahl, who sat next to Ms Cafferkey on the flight to the UK, said screening procedures at Heathrow were ‘shambolic’. Last night, the nursing council and GMC confirmed they were investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses and two doctors. A spokesman for Ms Cafferkey said last night: ‘Since she returned from Sierra Leone, Ms Cafferkey has fully co-operated with all investigations being undertaken by the relevant bodies and she will continue to do so. 'These are ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate for her to make any public comment at the present time.’","Pauline Cafferkey became first Briton to be diagnosed with ebola in the UK .

"Mummified remains of a monk have been found encased in a Buddha statue dating back to the 11th or 12th Century. Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, led the study that determined the mummy was of Buddhist master Liuquan, who belonged to the Chinese Meditation School. The CT scan and endoscopy were carried out by Drents Museum at Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands. Ancient: A study led by Erik Bruijn, a Buddism art and culture expert, looked into mummified remains of a monk that were found encased in a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue . Reserachers knew that there were remains dating back to the 11th or 12th Century in the statue, but it wasn't until the CT scan that they discovered all of the monk's organs had been removed . While it was known before the scan that a mummy was inside the statue, it wasn't until then that researchers discovered that the monk's organs had been removed from his body, according to Colossal. Rolls of paper scraps covered in Chinese writing were discovered alongside the monk. After the scan, the mummy was taken to Budapest, where it will be on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015. Many practicing Buddhists believe that mummies like that of Buddhist master Liuquan aren't actually dead, but are rather in an advanced state of meditation, according to International Business Times. Many practicing Buddists believe that mummies like that of Buddhist master Liuquan aren't actually dead, but instead, they believe these monks are in an advanced state of meditation. Another mummified monk like the one in the statue was found in Mongolia in January . In January, mummified remains of a man apparently meditating in the lotus position were unearthed in Mongolia. The human relic is believed to be around 200 years old and was preserved in animal skin. Initial speculation is that the mummy could be a teacher of Lama Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov. Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, born in 1852, was a Buryat Buddhist Lama of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, best known for the lifelike state of his body. While researchers are still looking into their findings from the hollow statue, the mummy was taken to the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest where it will be on display until May 2015 .","Mummified remains in the statue date back to the 11th or 12th Century .

"Travelling to far-flung exotic destinations  can be a hugely rewarding experience that many women in the West take for granted. For most, it is an entirely safe and liberating adventure that they will never forget - for all the right reasons. But while wolf whistles, cat calls and belligerent taxi drivers may be an annoyance for some solo travellers, there are some countries  where women may be exposed to misogyny, pestering and, in some extreme cases, danger. Scroll down for video . There are some countries where women exposed to misogyny, pestering and, in some cases, danger . Horrific crimes against women have become worryingly commonplace in countries such as India, but there are a number of popular holiday hotspots, such as Turkey and Morocco, that may not be as female-friendly as you think, according to experts. Julie Kreutzer, co-owner of website the International Women's Travel Center, has written extensively on the issue of women's safety abroad, and believes that honesty is the best policy when it comes to discussing the dangers that solo female travellers face. She said: 'I'm truly appalled at how unsafe and how unfriendly some places are. You can't even enter some countries if you're a woman, yet most travel websites just skirt around the issue and prefer to focus on what lipstick a woman should wear. 'We're absolutely in favour of women being adventurous and having a great time, but let's not delude ourselves and say that women are welcome everywhere. Blogger and frequent traveller Amanda Williams advises female travels to be smart and listen to their gut . Source: YouGov . 'There's a big different from going to Brazil versus Denmark as a female traveller, at least let's be honest about what the dangers are.' Seattle-based American blogger Stephanie Yoder has travelled extensively and says she's  always felt relatively safe on her travels, and stresses the importance separating the reality from the hype. 'I've been very fortunate. I honestly don't feel like I've been anywhere particularly dangerous, but I was definitely more on edge in South America than anywhere else. 'Crime rates are higher there and tourists can be targets for muggings, so I was careful never to carry many valuables and not to be out alone after dark.' Expat traveller Ali Garland  now lives in Berlin and agrees that women have a few extra challenges to deal with than men while travelling, although she says it's no reason to stay at home. 'There certainly are places where women are sort of second class citizens, and that can be frustrating. But I just try to remember that most people are genuinely nice, and I do my best to dress appropriately so I don't attract unwanted attention.' And if you do travel to danger hot-spots, social media consultant and explorer Liz Borod Wright advises against being too forthcoming on when sharing your experiences. 'Be wary of posting real-time updates on social media about where are you in case someone is paying a little too close attention. It's safer to post that awesome photo to Instagram when you're on to the next destination, especially if you plan to geo-tag it. 'And while the instinct is to live-tweet your trip, it may be best to rave (or rant) about your accommodations after you have checked out.' Intrepid traveller and blogger Amanda Williams advises female travellers to use their common sense. 'I would say to women just be smart and listen to your gut. Don't do anything you wouldn't do at home - don't drink too much alone, don't go wandering alone at night, don't go home with strangers, and read up on common scams.' MailOnline Travel has rounded up a number of popular destinations that solo female travellers should visit with caution. Some reports suggest that a sexual assault is reported every twenty minutes in India . 1) India . Gang rapes of local women and tourists have reached worrying levels in parts of the country with reports suggesting that a sexual assault is reported every twenty minutes. The authorities struggle to bring many perpetrators to justice, and according to the country's National Crime Record Bureau crimes against women have increased by 7.1 per cent since 2010. Earlier this month a Japanese student was drugged and raped in northern India, and last week horrifying video footage of two woman being gang raped by grinning men was released by a campaign group  in a bid to name and shame the attackers. Ms Williams says India is the only place she would think twice about visiting, although not because she's concerned about her personal safety. 'It's just a personal thing. I know plenty of women who have been there and loved it. I just don't think I could deal with the grabbing and lack of personal space,' she explains. Reports of rape increased by 157% between 2009 and 2012, according to the Brazilian Health Ministry . 2) Brazil . Stunning images of scantily-clad women from Rio's world-famous Carnival does little to mask the fact that much of Brazil remains in the grip of widespread violence led by criminal gangs and abusive police. And, according to the Brazilian Health Ministry, rape increased by 157 per cent between 2009 and 2012, spurred the country's machismo culture. Two years ago, an American tourist was gang raped on a public bus while her handcuffed boyfriend looked on helplessly. The authorities tried to clean up their act for the FIFA World Cup last year, but rape, gender-based violence and gunpoint robberies of tourists remain a problem. Istanbul is just hours from London although it is poles apart when it comes to attitudes towards woman . 3) Turkey . Istanbul is less than a four-hour flight from London, but it is poles apart when it comes to attitudes towards woman. The attempted rape and subsequent murder of 20-year-old student Ozgecan Aslan last week thrust the thorny issue of gender-based violence directly into the headlines. The horrific crime sparked dozens of protests by women seeking to raise awareness of violence against women, which is still a taboo subject in Turkey. According to Thailand Domestic Violence Information Center, violence against women is a growing problem . 4) Thailand . Millions of tourists flock to Thailand every year, but the brutal murder of British backpackers David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, who was also raped, in Koh Tao last September lifted the lid on the country's seedy, and often violent, underbelly. In 2013, Thai police threatened to arrest a 20-year-old female Scottish student who had been gang raped when no witnesses came forward to support her claim. According to Thailand Domestic Violence Information Center, violence against women is a growing problem in Thailand, fuelled, in part, by the widespread availability recreational drug Yah Bah as well as alcohol. In the aftermath of the 2011 revolution Egypt has seen a wave of sexual violence against women . 5) Egypt . Package holidays to Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada have been the mainstay of tourism in Egypt for a number of years. But in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution the country has been gripped by instability and an unprecedented wave of sexual violence against women. With fewer police on the streets, a sharp increase in the number of sex attacks - including a British journalism student in Cairo's Tahrir Square - has seen visitor numbers at the country's famous ruins dwindle. Bogota, Colombia was found to have the most dangerous public transport system for women . 6) Colombia . Tourism in Colombia has enjoyed an enormous boost in recent years as the conflict-torn country works towards addressing it troubled past. But while the country is undoubtedly far safer than it was even 10 years ago, sexual violence against women remains widespread, particularly against displaced women in poorer areas. Colombia's capital Bogota, which has no train system but a network of red buses, was found to have the most unsafe public transport in a poll conducted by YouGov in 2014 for the Thomson Reuters Foundation. According to Human Rights Watch, corrupt police also have a poor track record when it comes to protecting women, and rapists are rarely brought to justice. More than 66,000 sexual offenses were reported in South Africa in 2012 and 2013 . 7) South Africa . With a new domestic airline - Skywise - launching in March, tourism in South Africa is going from strength-to-strength. Yet despite its continuing popularity, it remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world. The African nation has one of the highest rates of rape and sexual assault, and robberies at gunpoint are commonplace. More than 66,000  sexual offenses were reported in 2012-2013, a rate of 127 sexual offenses per 100,000 population. A popular short-haul destination with Britons, Morocco has a poor record when it comes to women's rights . 8) Morocco . Another popular short-haul destination with Britons, Morocco has a poor record when it comes to women's rights. Female travellers are advised to dress modestly and cover up in the conservative Muslim country. Although the Foreign Office advises that violent crime isn't currently major issue, it's common for female tourists, particularly those travelling on their own, to be routinely harassed by men. Many tourists travel to Mexico's beaches without problem, but violence persists in some parts of the country . 9) Mexico . Although millions of Americans - including high-profile celebrities - travel safely to Mexico every year, parts of the country remain in the grip of utter lawlessness. While the Mexican government does strive to protect tourist hotspots, such as Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, reports of gun crime and violence still persist. According to the Foreign Office, violent rapes against women travelling on public transport ('micros') is also a significant threat. A UN report said 'women of all ages, education levels, and social groups' are subjected to violence in Kenya . 10) Kenya . Kenya has built a thriving tourist trade on the back of its incredible wildlife and safari parks. What is less well-know, however, is its reputation for violence against women. According to a report from United Nations Development Fund for Women, 'women of all ages, education levels, and social groups, in rural and urban settings are subjected to violence in Kenya.' In 2010, a national survey indicated that 32 per cent of girls experienced sexual violence before becoming adults, and in November last year, a sex attack on a young woman wearing a short skirt provoked demonstrations by women highlighting the country's widespread violence against women. Kidnappings and sexual assaults against tourists are also not uncommon.","Experts warn female travellers to avoid geo-tagging their current locations .

"A fresh leak of highly radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean has been detected today. Sensors detected contamination levels up to 70 times greater than the already-high radioactive status seen at the plant campus, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) announced this morning. TEPCO said its emergency inspections of tanks storing nuclear waste water did not find any additional abnormalities, but the firm said it shut the gutter to prevent radioactive water from going into the Pacific Ocean. Dangerous leak: A member of the IAEA mission team inspects TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Okuma, Fukushima prefecture, earlier this month . The  contamination detected early this morning by sensors rigged to a gutter that pours rain and ground water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant to a nearby bay  showed radiation levels 50 to 70 times greater than usual, TEPCO said. Though levels have steadily fallen throughout the day, the same sensors were still showing contamination about 10 to 20 times more than usual, a company spokesman said. It was not immediately clear what caused the original spike of the contamination and its gradual fall, he added. 'With emergency surveys of the plant and monitoring of other sensors, we have no reason to believe tanks storing radioactive waste water have leaked,' the unnamed spokesman said. 'We have shut the gutter (from pouring water to the bay). We are currently monitoring the sensors at the gutter and seeing the trend,' he said. Big risk: Fukushima sensors detected contamination levels up to 70 times greater than the already-high radioactive status seen at the plant campus (stock image) Destruction: The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power plant after the massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 14, 2011 in Futaba, Japan . The latest incident, one of several that have plagued the plant in recent months, reflects the difficulty in controlling and decommissioning the plant, which went through meltdowns and explosions after being battered by a giant tsunami in March 2011, sparking the world's worst nuclear disaster in a generation. TEPCO has not been able to effectively deal with an increasing amount of contaminated water, used to cool the crippled reactors and molten fuels inside them and kept in large storage tanks on the plant's vast campus. Adding to TEPCO's headaches has been the persistent flow of groundwater from nearby mountains travelling under the contaminated plant before washing to the Pacific Ocean. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently said TEPCO has made 'significant progress' in cleaning up the plant, but suggested that Japan should consider ways to discharge treated waste water into the sea as a relatively safer way to deal with the radioactive water crisis.","Leak of highly radioactive water from Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean .

"A Chilean cyclist's quest to bike around the world in five years has ended with his death in a road accident in northeast Thailand. Police say the 47-year-old Juan Francisco Villa Honorato was hit by a pickup truck and immediately killed Saturday on a highway in Nakhon Ratchasima province. Col. Torsak Thammingmongkol says the driver was arrested on a charge of causing death by dangerous driving and released on bail. Juan Francisco Villa Honorato was killed Saturday after he was hit by a pickup truck in northern Thailand province of Nakhon Ratchasima . The pickup truck ended up on its roof, according to a Thai expat website. According to police and accounts on social media, Mr Guillermo was attempting to set a Guinness World Record by cycling 250,000 kilometers (155,350 miles) in five continents in five years. His journey started in November 2010 and was scheduled to end in November this year. The cyclist carried a sign that said he had been to 49 countries and four continents and had suffered from more than 700 flat tires during the process. When he reached Mexico in 2012, the 5'9'' man weighed 140 pounds, according to Diario Presente. He said he found and ate an anaconda while biking through Brazil. He left Chile with 20,000 and has now been all over the Americas, northern Africa and Europe, according to Montenbaik.com . Mr Guillermo's wife, who he met during his journey, was on another bicycle with their 2-year-old son Lucas and suffered a slight sprain in the accident, said police Col. Torsak Thammingmongkol. It was not clear how long they had accompanied Guillermo in his round-the-world cycling odyssey. Police said that the accident was caused by the driver and that the cyclists were in their own lane. In 2013, a British couple on a similar round-the-world quest was killed in a road accident in eastern Thailand. The driver in that case paid a $30 fine. The current offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Juan Francisco Guillermo's quest to go 155,000 miles on his bike in five years was cut short after the accident .","Juan Francisco Guillermo, 47, killed by driver in Nakhon Ratchasima .

"John Bercow ran up a £177 fare for a four-mile limousine trip, and the taxpayer picked up the bill. The cost of the Commons Speaker's return journey from Parliament to Euston station in north London came to more than his rail fare to Lancaster and back. The extraordinary bill emerged as Mr Bercow admitted to being 'bumptious and pompous'. The cost of the Commons Speaker's return journey from Parliament to Euston station in north London came to more than his rail fare to Lancaster and back . Mr Bercow has been repeatedly criticised for his jet-set lifestyle, embarking on globe-trotting trips funded by the taxpayer. Since becoming Speaker he has enjoyed flights to Australia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Greece, India, USA, South Africa, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Austria and Romania. But he now faces criticism for a short trip across London, which cost more than 10 times the price of travelling on the Tube. Latest figures show that Mr Bercow had his chauffeur-driven car take him from the Houses of Parliament to Euston station, and then picked up up and took him home at the end of the day. The four-mile round trip cost a total of £177, The Sun reported. The cost was higher than two train tickets, for Mr Bercow and an aide, to travel the 460-miles to Lancaster and back. The standard class rail far came to only £154 compared to £177.49 for the car. Detaiuls of his expenses also show that he charged £193.64 for a 24-mile return trip to Bromley, South East London and an eight-mile journey to and from Battersea was £138. Insight: The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow's stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons (pictured) Andy Silvester, of The TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is an outrageous waste. Why couldn't he have just hailed a black cab or, like most Londoners, jumped on the Tube?' A Commons spokesman said: 'Every effort is made to balance cost effectiveness and time efficiency.' However, some MPs have accused Mr Bercow of becoming too grand in his role. Now he has admitted that it cold be true. His frank admission comes in the final episode of Inside The Commons, the BBC2 fly-on-the-wall documentary. The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow's stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons. It also covers his reportedly fraught relationship with ex-Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers who quit last year after allegedly being told to 'f*** off' by the Speaker. In this week's documentary, alongside clips of Mr Bercow berating misbehaving MPs, Mr Cockerell says: 'Many MPs say John Bercow is his own worst enemy because of his manner.' The Speaker admits: 'Some critics say I'm bumptious and can be pompous. If people say that, there may be truth in it.' He defends efforts to modernise the Commons, saying: 'It's not possible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.' But he admits he 'lost' his battle last year to replace Sir Robert with Australian parliamentary administrator Carol Mills amid protests she knew nothing about Commons procedure. Her appointment was blocked after a revolt by senior MPs. Mr Bercow says: 'There will be people who say, 'the Speaker lost'. Well, that is undeniable. She has not been appointed.'","Commons Speaker's bill for chauffeur-driven car to drive across London .

"A female suicide bomber thought to be as young as seven has blown herself up killing five people at a market in north eastern Nigeria. The young girl, who had explosives strapped to her, detonated the bomb at a security checkpoint in the town of Potiskum. Witnesses say she refused to be searched at the gate to the market and after an ensuing argument, she let off the bomb, killing five others and injuring 19 people. A girl thought to be as young as seven has blown herself up killing five people at a market in Potiskum, Nigeria. Another young female suicide bomber targeted the market last month, pictured . They added she appeared to be as young as seven years old and is the latest in a string of child suicide bombers in Nigeria. Local vigilante leader Buba Lawan said: 'We sent her back four times, because given her age, she did not have anything to do in the market. 'When we were screening people, she bent and tried to pass under the ropes, some distance from our view. That was when the explosives went off.' It is the second such suicide attack around the same market, where new and second-hand mobile phones are sold and repaired. The first attack happened on January 11, when two suicide bombers, one of them appearing to be around 15-years-old, blew themselves up outside the market, killing six and injuring 37. Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the bombing, which bore the hallmarks of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has been terrorising Nigeria. The insurgents have suffered a string of defeats in a military offensive by Nigeria and neighbours Cameroon, Niger and Chad. The Islamist fighters appear to be on the run in many parts of Nigeria and regions near its borders, after being subjected to a major offensive on all sides, but retain the ability to mount deadly surprise attacks. The market repairs new and second hand mobile phones. Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The last attack, pictured, was carried out by Boko Haram . The use of female suicide bombers, sometimes young girls, has been a common tactic of Boko Haram since last year, as have revenge attacks on civilians when the group is under pressure. Nigerian forces backed by air strikes seized the north eastern border town of Baga from Boko Haram on Saturday, the military said, a significant victory and one of a string of recent successes. President Goodluck Jonathan, who has been strongly criticised for not taking tougher action against Boko Haram, faces an election on March 28 in which security is a key issue. Nigeria's military - west Africa's largest - has faced repeated criticism for failing to end the Islamist insurgency, as well as allegations of human rights abuses. Soldiers have complained of a lack of adequate weapons and even refused to deploy to take on the better-armed rebels. Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the bombing, which bore the hallmarks of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, pictured, which has been terrorising Nigeria . The UN children's fund said harrowing reports from survivors of the attack and the use of 10-year-old girls as human bombs 'should be searing the conscience of the world'. 'Words alone can neither express our outrage nor ease the agony of all those suffering from the constant violence in northern Nigeria,' UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement. 'But these images of recent days and all they imply for the future of Nigeria should galvanise effective action. For this cannot go on.' The violence of Boko Haram began soon after 276 schoolgirls were abducted from the Borno town of Chibok in mid-April. Nine months on, 219 are still being held.","Suicide bomber blew herself up at a Nigerian market killing five people .

"Ghostly creatures come to life in otherworldly light paintings in a collection of pictures by a Finnish art teacher. The pictures were made with LED lights by Janne Parviainen, 34, from Helsinki, Finland. The blue and green bodies appear to exist in another dimension as they walk through the human world. Janne Parviainen from Helsinki, Finland, takes up to 20 hours to create each light painting in his studio or at local landmarks . Each painting can take up to 20 hours to complete in Janne's studio or at Finnish landmarks. First, he draws with white paint on his black studio walls to create the base of the painting. Then using a long exposure, Janne uses his coloured LED lights to create the bizarre human shapes. Janne said: 'The most time consuming part of this is to calculate the perspective right since I don't use any projectors or such as a help.' First, Janne draws with white paint on his black studio walls to create the base of the painting, then, using a long exposure, he uses his coloured LED lights to create the  human shapes . Janne continued: 'I think it pays off to use your own brains instead of machines. 'The light painting is executed when the studio is completely dark so I can light the correct parts of the drawings in the desired effect and to draw the characters with LED light while the camera is on long exposure. 'As you can imagine, working in pitch black conditions and drawing in the air can be a bit hard so I usually need quite a lot of takes before I'm happy with the result.' Most of Janne's paintings take place in near or total darkness, which means he has to do several attempts before he is pleased with the result . Janne's antics in the centre of Helsinki attract a lot of attention. He said: 'I decided to create a spontaneous guerrilla light art piece and finally found a spot right in the centre of Helsinki and started drawing the figures on the asphalt with chalk sticks. 'I gathered quite a crowd on the set when I started light painting the upper parts of the figures since I had to sit on the ground on top of the chalk drawings and trace my body with a flashlight.

"An alleged gang member who is on bail for gun possession has been taunting police while enjoying his freedom, showing off his access to cash and party lifestyle on social media. Mohammad Qais Niazy, 23, posted pictures of himself shamelessly using $100 bills to write lewd messages directed at police and numerous pictures of him snorting a white powder. In the three months since he was surprisingly given bail, Niazy, from western Sydney, has posted a series of controversial images on Facebook despite his strict parole conditions. He has used $100 notes to spell out 'f*** all cops' and shared shameless videos and photos of himself snorting large amounts of a white substance. Mohammad Qais Niazy posted a photograph of himself snorting a white crystallised substance on December 27, shortly after he was released from prison under strict bail conditions . The 23-year-old flaunted his wealth by posting an photo on Facebook with 'F*** all cop' written in $100 notes . The alleged gang member posted a photo with huge eyes and copious amounts of bling, alongside the photos of him snorting a white powder . Another photo was posted on December 27 of the young man snorting a white, crystallised substance which had been used to form the phrase 'f*** all b*****'. 'Lol this will get you on the news!' commented one of Niazy's friends. Two other photographs were also uploaded of Niazy posing next to copious amounts of the same white substance, alongside huge piles of cash. In a brash move, the 23-year-old shared a photo of himself excitedly posing with the leader of the Nomads gang, Simon Taijour. 'The head of AMF Nd the head of NOMADS!!,' Niazy gushed alongside the photograph. Late last year, Niazy was formally charged with several firearms offences, including possessing a shortened firearm and contravening a firearms prohibition order, according to News Limited. The young man, who also goes by the names Ace Niazy and Ali Gewad, is accused of keeping a shortened semi-automatic shot gun at a residence in Wentworthville, western Sydney. It's alleged he used tape around the barrel of the gun in an attempt to avoid leaving fingerprints. However, traces of his DNA were found on the weapon, according to police documents. On two occasions the western Sydney man brazenly posted images of him appearing to snort a white substance alongside enormous piles of cash .

"The father of Kayla Mueller, the American woman killed after spending months in captivity under Islamic State militants, says the U.S. government 'put policy in front of' American lives. 'We understand the policy about not paying ransom but on the other hand... we tried and we asked. But they put policy in front of American citizens' lives,' Carl Mueller told NBC's Today show in an interview that will air Monday. Carl Mueller said he is sure the government will work on somehow changing policy. Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric spoke to Today's Savannah Guthrie about losing Kayla, 26, the U.S. aid worker who was killed earlier this month while in captivity in Syria, held by ISIS . Kayla Mueller, 26, was an aid worker who grew up in Prescott, Arizona. She was taken hostage in 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria . 'Any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home,' he said. In the interview with Today host Savannah Guthrie, Mueller's mother, Marsha, agreed with her husband. She said she believes the U.S. government hoped to do everything possible to get her daughter back. 'I think they wanted to but I think again it's the policy, and I don't think anyone had any idea how this group would be as powerful as they were,' Marsha Mueller said. Mueller's brother, Eric Mueller, also spoke with Guthrie. In a letter sent to her family last spring, Mueller wrote:'I DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any other option take it, even if it takes more time,' according to Today. Mueller's parents Carl and Marsha hold a candle each during the emotional vigil for their daughter in their hometown . Carl, second from left, and Marsha Mueller, center, bow in prayer at the candlelight memorial in honor of their daughter . Mueller's death was confirmed February 10 by her family and U.S. officials. The Islamic State group claimed she died in a Jordanian airstrike, but U.S. officials have not confirmed that. The Pentagon said it didn't know how she was killed. The 26-year-old international aid worker, who grew up in Prescott, Arizona, was taken in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria. She has been honored in the past week with memorials in her hometown and her alma mater in Flagstaff, Northern Arizona University. A vigil was held on Tuesday in a plaza of a central Arizona courthouse, when hundreds gathered to hear Eric Mueller offer a heart-wrenching tribute to his sister. Friends and family have dedicated memorials and held vigils for the slain aid worker who was taken captive by ISIS in August 2013 . Eric Mueller talked about his sister during the emotional vigil. He told the crowd that his sister Kayla was his first and best friend . Before the crowd, her brother offered a poignant message to his sister when he told her: 'You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world.' Mueller encouraged those in attendance to live as his best friend and sister had, by reaching out to others who were suffering. In the first public comments he has made since her death, he said: 'Only now will you be able to see how much you truly did for this world by looking down on it. You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world,' USA Today reported. He went on to implore the crowd to help those who are struggling - a belief his sister had dedicated her life to.

"A historic footbridge is in need of repairs – just weeks after multi-million- pound restoration work was completed. The 179-year-old Victoria Bridge in Bath – one of the world’s first taper suspension bridges – underwent a £3.4million refurbishment late last year amid safety concerns. But the council has now recalled contractor Balfour Beatty to fix a peeling surface on the structure, which was officially reopened last month. Victoria Bridge in Bath is already in need of more work just weeks after being unveiled to the public following a £3.4million refurbishment . Bath and North East Somerset Council has now been forced to contact the contractors to repair the damage. A statement said: 'The council is aware of this problem and the contractor will be returning to the bridge on Monday to rectify the problem at no cost to the local taxpayer.' The Grade II listed bridge, which crosses the River Avon, was built in 1836 to a design by James Dredge, who was a Bath resident, brewer and bridge builder. More than 50 further taper bridges were built throughout Britain, Ireland, India and Jamaica, using the same principle with Victoria Bridge the eldest of a small number of the survivors. It was temporarily shut in 2010 due to structural weaknesses and, in 2012, the council agreed funding to have the bridge restored. Balfour Beatty began work in 2014, completely dismantling the bridge before reconstructing it. The newly refurbished bridge was officially reopened on 15 January 2015 with English Heritage removing it from the Heritage at Risk Register.

"A former police officer and human rights activist has been named as one of the men involved in an allegedly racist incident on the Paris Metro last week involving Chelsea supporters. Richard Barklie, 50, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland was identified after the Metropolitan Police released stills of men they want to speak to in connection with the incident. Mr Barklie now works with human rights charity in Northern Ireland which helps people affected by the troubles. Scroll down for video . Richard Barklie, pictured, has been identified as one of the people wanted in connection with the Paris Metro racism row. Mr Barklie is a former RUC police officer from Northern Ireland and a human rights worker . Mr Barklie, right, released an image of the former police officer who has denied that he is a racist . Mr Barklie, left, addressed the World Human Rights Forum's conference in India in 2013 . He has flown around the globe, even addressing a World Human Rights forum in India in 2013 where he said he was a director of the World Human Rights Forum. The Sunday World newspaper in Dublin revealed that the former police officer and Chelsea season ticket holder was on the train at the time of the incident. Mr Barkley has since been suspended by the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast where he helped victims of the Northern Irish Troubles. The Chelsea season ticket holder is one of the three men whose images were released by Scotland Yard as part of an investigation into a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in the French capital on Tuesday. The incident happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain, which ended 1-1. Footage posted online showed the commuter - named in reports as Souleymane Sylla - being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. Mr Barklie, bottom right, admitted that he was involved in the incident on the train but denies being a racist . In a statement released tonight, Mr Barklie's solicitor said his client, centre, is a Chelsea season ticket holder . The statement claimed, Mr Barklie, centre, did not engage in any racist singing or chanting . Tonight, Mr Barklie issued a statement through his lawyer in which he admitted involvement in an 'incident' that resulted in Souleymane Sylla being 'unable to enter part of the train'. He said he had an account he wanted to provide to police that would explain the 'context and circumstances'. Mr Barklie denied singing any racist songs; said he travelled to the game alone; insisted he did not know any of the other individuals captured on video footage of the incident; and said he has never been part of any 'group or faction' of Chelsea fans. The statement was issued by Belfast solicitor Kevin Winters. 'We act on behalf of Mr Barklie identified as one of the people sought by authorities investigating an incident on the Paris Metro on 16/2/15 ,' it said. 'We contacted London Metropolitan Police today to advise that our client is happy to assist with inquiries. 'Pending formal engagement with police, our client is anxious to put on record his total abhorrence for racism and any activity associated with it. 'As someone who has spent years working with disadvantaged communities in Africa and India he can point to a cv in human rights work which undermines any suggestion he is racist. 'Today a senior official in the World Human Rights Forum confirmed their support for him. 'Mr Barklie is a Chelsea season ticket holder and has travelled to matches for over 20 years now without incident. 'He travelled alone to the Paris St Germain match and has no knowledge whatsoever of the identities of the other people depicted in recent YouTube video releases. He wants to stress that he was not and never has been part of any group or faction of Chelsea supporters. 'He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that. 'He accepts he was involved in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S was unable to enter a part of the train. 'He has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances as they prevailed at that particular time. 'In the meantime pending that, he wants to put on record his sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered by Mr Souleymane. 'He readily acknowledges that any judgement on the integrity of his apology will be kept in abeyance pending the outworkings of the investigation. 'Given the extremely sensitive nature of the issues engaged we urge upon all media outlets to exercise as much restraint as possible when commenting on the case. 'We accept on behalf of our client that public interest demands nothing but total indignation and condemnation from all media reporting but such reporting ought not to persist at the expense of undermining Mr Barklie's right to a fair trial . 'Tonight London Met confirmed with us that arrangements were in hand to take the investigation to the next stage.' Mr Barklie said he wants to explain to police what happened between him and Souleymane Sylla, pictured . Mr Barklie, right, said he offered 'his sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered' by Mr Sylla . The WAVE Trauma Centre, which supports victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles, tonight said it had suspended a part-time worker pending further investigation into the Paris incident. 'As this matter is subject to an investigation by the Metropolitan Police it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage,' said a spokesman for the charity. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested. A police spokesman said the force cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK but 'a number of people' have now been spoken to in relation to the incident. Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club are 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich is also 'disgusted'. Meanwhile, police are seeking a gang of men, believed to be Chelsea fans, who were heard shouting racist chants at London St Pancras station on Wednesday evening. A member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gare du Nord, British Transport Police (BTP) said. It is believed they were returning home after attending Chelsea's match with PSG.","Former RUC officer Richard Barklie identified as a Paris Metro race suspect .

"They are scared of vacuum cleaners and chase their own tails, but it seems dogs may be smarter than you think. Man's best friend can sense whether a person is lying to them or telling the truth, according to a new study. Dogs remember if a person is trustworthy and decide whether to follow their orders based on their opinion of the human, scientists believe. Dogs keep track of whether people lie or tell the truth so they can work out which humans they can rely on, especially when it concerns food (file picture) The latest research, published in Animal Cognition, suggests that canines learn which people they can rely on, especially when it concerns food. It is common knowledge that if a person points at something, a dog will usually follow the instruction and run and sniff out what they are being directed towards. A team at Kyoto University, in Japan, tested this theory on 34 dogs. Firstly, a researcher pointed each of the animals towards a container which had food hidden inside, which they ran over to before eating the treat. In the second test, the same researcher pointed each of the dogs towards an empty container, which they dutifully ran towards. When the scientist tried to direct them towards a third tub, which had food inside, most of the dogs ignored the instruction. Dogs will only follow orders, such as fetch, from people who have a track record of being trustworthy, research shows . However, when a new researcher pointed them towards the container, they keenly did as they were told and found the treat. Akiko Takaoka, who led the study, said this means that dogs can use their experience of the human to judge whether they can be trusted. She told the BBC that she was surprised that the dogs 'devalued the reliability of a human' so quickly. 'Dogs have more sophisticated social intelligence than we thought. This social intelligence evolved selectively in their long life history with humans,' she added. John Bradshaw, a veterinary scientist who specialises in human-animal interactions at the University of Bristol, said that dogs like their lives to be predictable. He said: 'Dogs whose owners are inconsistent to them often have behavioural disorders.'","Dogs can sense whether a person is lying or telling the truth, study shows .

"Mat Collins, a Professor in climate systems at Exeter University, said the storms have been driven by the jet stream . One of the Met Office’s most . senior experts yesterday made a dramatic intervention in the climate . change debate by insisting there is no link between the storms that have . battered Britain and global warming. Mat . Collins, a Professor in climate systems at Exeter University, said the . storms have been driven by the jet stream – the high-speed current of . air that girdles the globe – which has been ‘stuck’ further south than . usual. Professor . Collins told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is no evidence that global . warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this . winter. If this is due to climate change, it is outside our knowledge.’ His . statement carries particular significance because he is an . internationally acknowledged expert on climate computer models and . forecasts, and his university post is jointly funded by the Met Office. Prof . Collins is also a senior adviser – a ‘co-ordinating lead author’ – for . the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). His . statement appears to contradict Met Office chief scientist Dame Julia . Slingo. Last weekend, she said ‘all  the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to  play’ in the storms. Prof . Collins made clear that he believes it is likely global warming could . lead to higher rainfall totals, because a warmer atmosphere can hold . more water. But he said this has nothing to do with the storm conveyor . belt. He said that . when the IPCC was compiling its Fifth Assessment Report on climate . change last year, it discussed whether warming might affect the jet . stream. But, he went on, ‘there was very low confidence that climate . change has any effect on the jet stream getting stuck’. In the end, the . possibility was not even mentioned in the report. Prof Collins declined to comment on his difference of opinion with Dame Julia. Five . months ago, in a briefing on the IPCC report to Ministers, Dame Julia . conceded the consequence of warming for rainfall ‘is not simulated well’ by climate models – though they are the basis for most of what she and . other scientists say about the effects of climate change. Last . April, after the temperature fell to -11C in Aberdeenshire, the coldest . April temperature for more than 100 years, Dame Julia said the cold . winter and spring might also be due to global warming, because of ice . melting in the Arctic. Professor Collins' statement appears to contradict Met Office chief scientist Dame Julia Slingo . Meanwhile, the Met . Office has continued to issue questionable long-term forecasts. In . mid-November, two weeks before the first of the storms, it predicted . persistent high pressure for the winter, which was ‘likely to lead to . drier-than-normal conditions across the country’. It . added that its models showed the probability of the winter being in the . driest of five official categories was 25 per cent. The chances of it . being in the wettest category was 15 per cent. Infamously, . in April 2009, the Met Office promised a ‘barbecue summer’ – which then . turned out to be a washout. It forecast the winter of 2010 to 2011 . would be mild: it was the coldest for 120 years. In . 2007, the Met Office said that globally, the decade 2004-2014 would see . warming of 0.3C. In fact, the world has not got any warmer at all in . this period. At the . beginning of 13 of the past 14 years, the Met Office has predicted the . following 12 months would be significantly warmer than they have been. This, says the sceptic think-tank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, . indicates ‘systemic’ bias.

"Scam: Pauline Elfreda Barrett, 55, swindled £1.3m from the oil and tax giant she worked for . A payroll officer carried out an elaborate tax scam to swindle £1.3 million from the oil and gas giant she worked for. Pauline Elfreda Barrett, 55, convinced her bosses to cough up for thousands of pounds in fabricated tax bills in a shocking betrayal of trust. Barrett, of Ashford, Kent, doctored incoming emails from the firm's accountants, making it appear they were demands for payment from HMRC. Bosses at Saipem Limited – part of Italian giant Eni – would then approve the payments, with Barrett funnelling the funds into her own account. A judge heard how, between November 2010 and September 2014, she made at least 28 payments to her account in this way totalling £1.3m. The court was told that she was a trusted employee at the Kingston-based firm. Detective Sergeant Mick Walker from the Metropolitan Police said: 'For four years, Barrett abused her position. Her theft was calculated. 'She first made demands for small sums of money as she wanted to test the water. 'As her confidence grew, so did her demands. The largest payment she fabricated was for around £80,000.' Barrett was told at Kingston Crown Court that she faces jail after admitting one count of fraud by abuse of position. She will be sentenced on Friday. Barrett was told at Kingston Crown Court (pictured) that she faces jail after admitting one count of fraud by abuse of position.

"Dr Tony Shaw drove the 76-year-old patient to hospital in his own car . A family doctor has told how he took a seriously ill patient to hospital himself because no ambulance was available. Dr Tony Shaw drove 76-year-old Richard Moses to hospital in his own car after being told there would be a two-hour wait for paramedics to turn up. And when the two men arrived at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, there was no sign of a porter so Dr Shaw found a wheelchair and pushed his patient to a ward. Mr Moses had gone to Dr Shaw’s surgery in Darlington with what he thought was a virus. But his condition deteriorated as he waited for his appointment and staff diagnosed a heart condition which required the urgent fitting of a pacemaker. Dr Shaw tried to arrange for Mr Moses to be admitted to his local hospital, Darlington Memorial, but was told that, as the request was being made out of hours, he would need to travel 20 miles to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Dr Shaw arranged for an ambulance car and was told it would arrive within an hour. When that deadline passed, he was warned that the system was under such pressure that it would be another two hours before a replacement vehicle could be found. The GP was given the chance to upgrade the call to a blue-light emergency but that would have meant Mr Moses going to the Memorial Hospital. Dr Shaw said: ‘I made the decision to take him to James Cook in my car and one of our nurse practitioners very kindly offered to come with me. ‘We took an oxygen cylinder, defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. I drove and the nurse sat with Mr Moses and monitored his condition. 'When we reached James Cook we could not locate a porter so I found a wheelchair and pushed him to the ward.’ Mr Moses was fitted with a pacemaker and has made a full recovery. Dr Shaw said yesterday that A&E departments were ‘overloaded and inundated’ because too many patients were being referred by call handlers working for the NHS 111 helpline. He added: ‘The default position of 111 is, ‘‘Go to A&E.’’ They err on the side of caution but that adds to the pressure.’ Mr Moses, from Darlington, has since been back to the surgery to thank Dr Shaw for his help. The retired maintenance supervisor said: ‘He’s a wonderful man and a fantastic doctor.’ After arriving at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough (above) the pair could not find a porter .","Dr Tony Shaw drove his 76-year-old patient to hospital in his own car .

"The United States military should launch 'targeted' strikes against the 'terrorist army' of ISIS in Iraq - if the situation deteriorates so that it threatens the security of the West said David Petraeus. The retired general - who led commanded the surge eight years ago that rid the war-torn nation of al-Qaeda - said that he does support limited military action to stem the flood of ISIS troops. Former CIA chief Petraeus made these remarks on Thursday, the same day that President Obama declared he was sending 300 special forces advisers to Iraq in addition to the 275 'combat ready' troops he has deployed to protect the US Embassy in Baghdad. Scroll Down for Video . Action: (former) General David Petraeus (pictured here in 2011) has called for military strikes in Iraq to stem the flow of the ISIS terror army . In an exclusive interview with the UK's Daily Telegraph, Petraeus said that he favored using drones to specifically target the ISIS leader, Abu Bakr el Baghdadi. 'If ISIS is seen as a terrorist organization with the potential to engage in terrorist acts beyond the Middle East, then that could warrant the targeting of high value targets,' said Petraeus. He referenced the complicated sectarian friction that currently exists in Iraq between Sunni and Shia Muslims. 'We must be careful not to take sides if we offer military support. But the growing threat posed by Isis means that military action will be necessary,' said Petraeus to the Daily Telegraph.

'We must realize that Isis poses a threat not only to Iraq but to the UK and other countries as well. 'Isis poses two challenges, to the stability of Iraq, and also the emerging threat it poses beyond Iraq and Syria.' Speaking in London, Petraeus said that he was worried that Syria and Iraq could become havens for terrorist planners and was 'disappointed' that Iraq has descended into chaos again. 'I certainly do not think it was in vain,' he said to the Daily Telegraph. 'The surge provided Iraq with an excellent opportunity. However it is undeniably very sad to see the tragic turn of events in Iraq knowing personally how great the sacrifice and the cost was for the US, Britain, Iraq and all the other coalition partners.' Leader: (Then) General David Petraeus, commander of multi national forces in Iraq, walks down a street in the Ghazaliya neighborhood  August 18, 2007 in Baghdad, Iraq . On Thursday President Barack Obama announced his intention today to send up to 300 U.S. military advisers into Iraq to help train the country's military. The president expressly stated that the move does not 'foreshadow' a military intervention and said sending troops back into Iraq to fight radical extremists would not benefit the U.S. 'American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq,' Obama said, ' but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests, as well.' The president also said the U.S. was currently ‘identifying targets’ associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist group and that the U.S. would take ‘targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it' - an obvious nod to air strikes. President Barack Obama announced today that the U.S. would send in up to 300 soldiers to train and advise the Iraqi military. American forces still won't be engaging in combat he promised . After meeting with national security advisers early this afternoon, the president said in a statement that the U.S. intended would coordinate with Iraqi security forces, put up joint operation centers in Baghdad and share intelligence with the Iraqi government. Already, the president had deployed 275 armed marines to protect State Department personnel working at the embassy in Baghdad. He had also sent the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier with . its usual battleship escort, the USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport . ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters and armed F-18 Super Hornet warplanes to do surveillance. Obama told members of Congress during a meeting on Wednesday that he did not need their permission to take the actions he was considering. However, he said on Thursday that he would continue to work with Congress to provide additional equipment to the Iraqi military through his newly created Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and that he would consult Congress, as well as Iraqi leaders, if he decided to pull the trigger on air strikes. Iraqi . Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, has asked President Obama for air . strikes against the Sunni Islamist militants who have been carving a . wide swath through his country, but Obama has been slow to comply. The President told congressional leaders yesterday that the U.S. does not have strong enough intelligence at this time to carry out the strikes, an aide with knowledge of the discussion told the Huffington Post yesterday. Obama also expressed anxiety about the number of civilian casualties that the strikes could cause, as well concerns about instability within Iraq's government. The president said last week that he would not provide Iraq with military assistance until the country's leaders made serious moves toward putting their sectarian differences aside. Standing up for themselves: More than 200,000 Iraqis have volunteered to defend their country, including this group of farmers . Vice President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday with Maliki, the country's Sunni parliamentary speaker and the the . president of the country's self-ruled Kurdish region. He . praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in . a televised show of unity against ISIS, the White House said. Lawmakers . have been putting pressure on Obama to call for Maliki's resignation . for days, and the Associated Press said reported Thursday morning that . Obama might ask Maliki to resign as a Hail Mary effort to stop the . country's civil war. However, Obama repeatedly said on Thursday, 'It's not the place for the United States to choose Iraq's leaders.' There . is an 'urgent' need for Iraq to convene a new parliament that gives all . Iraqis the sense that they are part of a unity government, though, Obama said. 'Right now what is happening is the fate of Iraq hangs in the balance.' The U.S. president hedged when asked at a presser Thursday after his statement if he had lost faith in Maliki to lead . the country and referred back to his previous statements. US President Barack Obama meets with Congressional leadership including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (2nd R), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L), House Speaker John Boehner (2nd L), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R), in the Oval Office of the White House on June 18, 2014 in Washington, DC. The leaders met to discuss strategy on Iraq . Former U.S. general David Petraeus, . who led the 'surge' that finally brought calm to Iraq, struck a cautious . note on Western intervention on Wednesday. Speaking . at a conference in London, General Petraeus said the Iraqi government . needed to reach out to the Sunni minority before the US got involved . militarily. He said: 'If . the US is to support the Iraqi government it would have to be a . government against terrorism, rather than one side in a civil war.' 'This . cannot be the United States being the air force for Shia militias, or a . Shia on Sunni Arab fight,' he told the Margaret Thatcher Conference on . Liberty. President Obama . expressed concern at doing just that on Thursday and again called on . Iraq's government to come together to fight the common treat to their . nation. He also fired a warning shot at Iran. The . U.S. welcome's the country to play a 'constructive role' in Iraq, he . said, but 'If Iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of . the Shia, and it is framed in that fashion, that probably worsens the . situation.' 'Obviously . what has happened in Syria in part is the result of Iran coming in hot . and heavy' on one side, Obama said, referring to the upheaval in that . country. Obama said he hopes Iran will take a 'more promising path' in Iraq, 'but old habits die hard.' Deployment: F-18 launches off the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W.

Reports . first surfaced on Twitter from ABC, NBC and Fox News about the sorties, . which are taking off and landing on the USS George H.W. Bush, an . aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. The Obama administration had already authorized 'manned and unmanned' surveillance flights, Fox News reported. But F-18s are not surveillance aircraft. They are attack planes. A . U.S. official hinted to Fox that part of the strategy is to project . strength by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo . missions. 'It's not so much about looking as it is being seen,' the official said. The White . House told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the president is still . undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that . once hosted 143,000 American servicemen and women. Obama said on Thursday that he would prefer Iraq's neighbors in the region step up instead. On that note Obama said he would be sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the Middle East and Europe to meet with the U.S.'s allies abroad about working together to quell the violence in Iraq. 'Rather than play whack-a-mole where these terrorist networks pop up,' the president said, the U.S. has to be able to build effective partnerships.

"Philip Hammond announced the medal in the Commons today . The Falklands are to be awarded a special medal in recognition of the 'indomitable will and personal commitment' of the islanders  during the Argentine occupation. The South Atlantic Medal has been awarded to almost 30,000 troops and civilians who served during the operation to liberate the Islands in 1982. Among its holders is the Duke of York, who flew helicopters for the Royal Navy during the war. Eligibility for the medal was recently extended, following a review, to cover individuals involved in the clean-up period after the Argentine surrender. But the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has now announced, in a statement to the House of Commons, that the medal is to be awarded to the whole archipelago next year. 'I am pleased to inform the House that in 2015 the South Atlantic Medal will be presented, on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen, to the Falkland Islands, in recognition of the assistance provided to the Forces of the United Kingdom during the liberation of the Islands in 1982,' Mr Hammond said. 'The islanders' individual acts of courage exemplified the indomitable will and personal commitment to defending the islands' right of self determination.' The award of a medal to islands is not unique. Malta was granted the George Cross in recognition of its inhabitants' bravery during the Second World War. David Cameron, in his Christmas message to the Islanders, said next year would also see the unveiling of a bronze statue of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands. He said 2015 would be a year when 'the British government, again, steadfastly defends the freedom she helped you secure'. The Prime Minister said: 'One hundred years ago, the Allies defended their base in Stanley from German aggression and this month we honour the sacrifice that so many made. 'And three decades ago, UK forces stood with the islanders as they faced a direct and grave threat to their sovereignty and it is absolutely right that we will be recognising this next year, when your islands will collectively receive the South Atlantic Medal and that you'll be unveiling a bronze statue to honour someone who played such an important role in that liberation - Baroness Thatcher.'

Roger Edwards, chair of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, said: 'It is an honour for the Falkland Islands to be awarded the South Atlantic Medal. 'We will never forget the sacrifices made by all to protect our home. 'The Falklands have come a long way since the dark days of 1982 when many in the Islands faced extreme difficulty with steely resolve. 'It is a testament to the resourcefulness, integrity and determination of our proud community that the islands are now one of the United Kingdom's most dynamic and successful overseas territories with opportunities for all.'","South Atlantic Medal  awarded to almost 30,000 troops and civilians .

"New Defense Secretary Ashton Carter has said that the US may keep more troops in Afghanistan than expected. The Pentagon head, who met with the Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Saturday, said that the Obama administration was considering 'possible changes to the timeline for the drawdown of U.S. troops'. He said that there could be a slowdown because the Afghan government was becoming a more reliable partner. Scroll down for video . Defense Secretary Ashton Carter (left), making his first trip abroad since taking the position, met with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani (right) Carter said that the Obama administration was considering making changes to the timeline of troop withdrawals . Former Afghan president Hamid Karazi had previously criticized the US military. The new unity government with Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, which took office in September, could help with stability, Carter said. His trip to Afghanistan, his first journey abroad as Defense Secretary, comes as Ghani is scheduled to visit President Obama at the White House next month. There are currently 10,000 US soldiers in the country, though its security is the responsibility of the Afghan security forces, who number about 350,000. At one point in 2010-2011 there were 100,000 US personnel in Afghanistan. American and NATO forces transferred control of their bases to local forces last year and the number of troops is expected to half this year before falling to near zero by 2017. Carter did not say that the president was thinking of elongating troops' stay in the country. The US plans of keeping a security cooperation office in Afghanistan's capital Kabul after 2016. It is not known how a slowdown would affect the current plan for troop withdrawals, which has been criticized by Obama's Republican critics who say that extremists could return to the country like they did after US troops left Iraq. The Afghan military (pictured) took over responsibility for their country's security last year, and fierce fighting between the military and insurgents has raged since . Afghan soldiers (pictured, December 2014) have been fighting Taliban fighters in the Helmand province, but also face threats from Al Qaeda remnants and now militants pledging support to Islamic State . General John F Campbell, the top commander in the country said that there is progress in how Afghan forces are fighting and said 'We've got a government here that wants us to be here.' There are still remnants of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in addition to Taliban fighters, as well as fears that Islamic State militants could recruit or become powerful in the Middle Eastern country. In January an Afghan general said that fighters loyal to ISIS were active in some southern regions, though Gen Campbell says that the situation is not like that in Iraq, where the extremists control large swaths of territory. Carter called ISIS's presence in Afghanistan 'aspirational'. Taliban forces remain the largest threat to the Afghan government, and dialogue with their lingering forces is expected to begin as soon as March. Last year was the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since 2001, with 5,000 Afghan security forces and more than 3,000 civilians killed, according to the BBC. The period since the US handed control over to the Afghanis has seen fierce fighting between the government's forces and insurgents, largely Taliban in the Helmand province. Carter (left, with General John F Campbell) said that Afghanistan was his first visit 'because [it] is where we still have 10,000 American troops and they come first in my mind, always' Carter said that 'a lot has changed here, so much of it for the better' since his last visit to Afghanistan in 2013. Ghani has said he supports a slower withdrawal. Both he and Carter said they would discuss 'reality on the ground' with President Obama. The new defense secretary officially took over for Chuck Hagel earlier this week, and said Afghanistan was his first visit 'because this is where we still have 10,000 American troops and they come first in my mind, always'. The appointee also stressed continued resource and equipment support for the Afghan government to establish progress. Carter also met with US commanders in Afghanistan General Lloyd J. Austin and General Campbell, in addition to US Ambassador P Michael McKinley . US troop levels have fallen since reaching 100,000 in 2010-2011 and are now at roughly 10,000 soldiers.

Suspension: Tau Kappa Epsilon will be suspended from Cal State Northridge for approximately three-and-a-half years (file photo) Tau Kappa Epsilon will be suspended from January 21, 2015 through July 20, 2018, according to the Los Angeles Times. CSUN was looking into a fall 2013 retreat at which hazing and sexual misconduct allegedly took place, the newspaper reported. Noblitt told the newspaper someone requested a fraternity pledge snap a woman's chest, which had the TKE letters on it. The student refused and told authorities what happened, Noblitt said. CSUN had already prohibited on-campus pledging, the Los Angeles Times noted. 19-year-old Armando Villa died in 2014 and suffered dehydration on a July Pi Kappa Phi hike, according to the newspaper, which said that the fraternity is no longer operating. Pi Kappa Alpha's Zeta Omicron chapter was received a six-year-ban from CSUN in October 2014, according to the Los Angeles Times. A spokesman for Tau Kappa Epsilon's international headquarters declined to comment. On Monday, Noblitt told Daily Mail Online in an emailed statement 'Hazing is prohibited at CSUN and any organization failing to comply with university policies are subject to a variety of punishments or sanctions. Individuals who participate in acts of hazing are personally accountable under the CSUN hazing policy, regardless of the outcome of any related case brought against a student group or organization.' Noblitt also said that 'CSUN has a zero-tolerance policy regarding hazing — every complaint is investigated and disciplinary action is taken for any violations.' He added 'We have made it abundantly clear how seriously we take these issues. This has resulted in CSUN suspending three organizations, including one permanently. CSUN President Dianne F. Harrison and Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. William Watkins are leading a cultural shift here at CSUN. Taking the unprecedented step to halt all pledging or new member intake clearly shows that CSUN is backing its words with actions.

"The $35 million program to retrain New York City cops in the aftermath of Eric Garner's death last July has been branded a big flop by a high-ranking NYPD official. To date a fifth of the city's 20,000 strong force has taken the course which was introduced last December by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton in a bid to address criticism of the illegal chokehold maneuver that resulted in the death of the father-of-six. Once officers gave completed the three-day 'smart policing' course they are asked to fill out a survey, but the results have been less than impressive. The $35 million 'smart policing' program to retrain New York City cops in the aftermath of Eric Garner's death last July has been branded a big flop by a high-ranking NYPD official . A high-ranking official – who wasn't named - told the New York Post that of the 2,000 surveys reviewed eight out of every ten officers have branded the exercise a waste of time. The problem says the insider is that the course involves too little practical training and two days of boring eight-hour lectures that have caused some cops to fall asleep. 'It's three days, it's boring and there's no real tactics,' said the Post's source. 'They're not putting them in scenarios. Cops felt they would get more tactical training in light of the Eric Garner case.' On Day 3 of the course officers are taught the 'high-low takedown,' in which two cops apprehend a suspect, one from behind at the legs, the other from the front at the torso. Mayor de Blasio had ordered a review into training within the department following Garner's death. The 43-year-old died after NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a illegal chokehold during an attempted arrest on Staten Island on July 17, 2014. Julian was appointed to the NYPD by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured, after the Garner death . Officers were attempting to arrest Garner because they suspected he had been selling untaxed cigarettes illegally. 'The training that's going to happen here in this building will change the future of this city,' said de Blasio when he introduced the scheme. 'It will have not just an impact on thousands of people, it will have an impact on millions of people, because every interaction that every officer has with their fellow New Yorkers after they are trained again will be different.' A deputy NYPD commissioner appointed to reform the department in the wake of Garner's death has lasted just two months in the job, it was announced Saturday. Michael Julian has been moved to a less controversial position after he proposed officers be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they would be easier to remove.. MIchael Julian, pictured, tried to introduce a number of controversial new training methods within the NYPD following the July 2014 death of Staten Island man Eric Garner who died as he was being arrested . A source told the New York Post: 'He would come up with these wacky ideas. We would roll our eyes and move on.' Julian ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the NYPD headquarters building. The mints were due to be deployed to individual officers, who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear. Julian believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth, he would no longer want to curse. Earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down. He claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily. It is understood that Julian was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department.","Eric Garner died last July when police officers used a chokehold maneuver while attempting to arrest him .

"His dialogue is renowned for his extended pauses, yet even by the standards of Harold Pinter, 15 years is a long wait. But now two new plays by the writer – who died in 2008 aged 78 – are being unveiled in the first premieres of his work since 2000. The announcement by Radio 4 of the productions is sure to cause great excitement in the literary world – and also among fans of Game Of Thrones star Rose Leslie, who has been cast in one of the new works. The productions also feature Last Tango In Halifax’s Anne Reid and Hollywood actor Mark Strong. Two new plays by Harold Pinter – who died in 2008 aged 78 – are being unveiled in the first premieres of his work since 2000. The radio dramas are based on Pinter’s adaptations for the screen of Joseph Conrad’s 1915 novel Victory and his screenplay for Karen Blixen’s short story of love and loss, The Dreaming Child. Pinter found fame as a playwright in the 1950s. He established himself as one of Britain’s most prolific screenwriters and is perhaps best known for his collaborations with maverick director Joseph Losey in the films The Servant and The Go-Between. The new scripts form the centrepiece of Radio 4’s Unmade Movies series. BBC drama commissioner Jeremy Howe says: ‘It isn’t often that you can announce the premiere of a script by the late great Harold Pinter, one of the leading dramatists of the 20th Century, and then two come along, both wonderfully Pinteresque and both utterly different in tone. This will be a treat for listeners.’ Mark Strong will star in Victory, alongside narrator Simon Russell Beale and Bjarne Henriksen, the Danish actor who played the grieving father in the first series of TV’s The Killing. Conrad’s novel is a tragic tale of love, deceit and murder in the Dutch East Indies. Henriksen will play Axel Heyst, whose life spirals out of control when he comes to the rescue of a female musician molested by a local hotel owner. Strong, whose film credits include Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, will play the murderous Ricardo, sent to punish Heyst for his intervention. Harold Pinter found fame as a playwright in the 1950s . When Pinter completed the screenplay for Victory in 1982, he was riding high on the success of the French Lieutenant’s Woman which starred Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep. But the film never materialised because of financial problems. Pinter’s adaptation of The Dreaming Child is set in Bristol in 1868 and tells the story of childless couple Emily and Tom Carter and their decision to adopt a boy from the slums. But happiness eludes the couple because Emily continues to be haunted by her passionate fling with a young soldier who was killed at sea. It will be narrated by Anne Reid, who plays Celia in the Bafta-winning Last Tango In Halifax, and stars Rose Leslie. Pinter was originally commissioned to write the screenplay by Hollywood star Julia Ormond, who at the time had signed a production deal with 20th Century Fox. She was delighted with Pinter’s work but the project collapsed when she insisted on directing the film as well as producing it. Pinter later commented: ‘It was this that brought the project to its knees. The money-men simply wouldn’t give her the chance.’ In his official biography of the playwright, critic Michael Billington said the screenplay for The Dreaming Child compared favourably with Pinter’s very best work. The new adaptation of Victory will launch the series of Unmade Movies when it is broadcast next Saturday, February 28, at 2.15 pm on Radio 4.","Two of Harold Pinter's plays to be unveiled in first premieres since 2000 .

"A letter written in Italian by Albert Einstein in 1925 has sold for almost £50,000 at auction . A letter by Albert Einstein that is unusually written in Italian has fetched £49,000 at auction. The Austrian genius’s 1925 missive to Italian electrical engineer Giovanni Giorgi defends his 1915 theory of relativity in the face of strong criticism. It also speaks of ‘God’ as a scientific concept despite Einstein not believing in a deity. The letter was penned after the scientist faced the criticism of American physicist Dayton Miller  who sought to disprove his theory in a series of experiments. Dismissing his findings, Einstein wrote to Giorgi: 'I agree with your opinion on the fact that the movement of an ether with a [mathematical formula] so high is particularly impossible. 'God created the world with more intelligence and elegance. You’re right to compare with Miller’s works, the laws of aberration. 'The theory of Stokes-Planck is very artificial and can not - in my opinion - explain this law of aberration. 'I would be very curious to know the real cause of the Miller’s phenomenon.. I do not doubt the validity of the theory of relativity.' Although Einstein was fluent in Italian having lived in Italy with his family in the mid 1890s letters written by him in the language are scarce. A spokesman for RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts, where the sale was held, said: 'This magnificent letter is rife with intriguing content - each and every sentence contains a revelatory turn and could be expounded upon at length within the context of Einstein’s life and work. 'That it is written in Italian is notable in itself. His family had moved to Italy for a few years in the mid-1890s and, although he was fluent, letters in Italian are seldom seen. 'While in Italy at just 16 years old, Einstein published what is generally considered his first scientific paper, entitled ‘On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field.’ 'This presents a nice connection to the letter, which refutes some of the concepts surrounding that very topic. The Austrian scientist was fluent in Italian after living in Italy with his family for some time as a teenager . 'Especially interesting is the strong stance he takes in defence of the theory of relativity at the conclusion. 'Einstein had dedicated much of the previous decade to refining the study of relativity after introducing his ‘General Theory of Relativity’ in 1915.. 'As Einstein’s revolutionary theory grew in acceptance within the scientific community through the 1920s, a small but vocal minority emerged in opposition. Einstein, who famously did not believe in God, makes reference to the deity in the rare letter . 'Dayton Miller, an advocate of ether theory and absolute space, was one such opponent and offered Einstein experimental evidence to support his ideas. 'While Einstein acknowledged that a positive result for the existence of ether would invalidate the theory of special relativity, he asserted that Miller’s results were erroneous and tainted by environmental factors. 'The discussion of God as a creator is also fascinating. Although he did not believe in a personal deity, Einstein was not averse to speaking of God in a scientific context when discussing differing interpretations of quantum physics. 'In 1929, he said that he believed ""in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists,"" and in the 1950s he wrote ""If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."" 'It is this conception of God that appears in the present letter, with the idea of a world designed with ""intelligence and elegance"" corresponding with these later notions of structural harmony. 'It was these harmonious structures - the things at the very core of creation - that Einstein hoped to uncover and describe in his quest for knowledge as a physicist, forming a bridge between the scientific and the spiritual. 'All together, this is a truly exceptional letter that encompasses a varied range of Einstein’s thoughts during this period.'","The letter was written in 1925 and addressed to engineer Giovanni Giorgi .

"ASIO is currently investigating thousands of terror leads and suspects, with at least 400 people being deemed high risk, it will be announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday. This is double last year's figure, and Mr Abbott will also warn that Australia is heading for a 'long-term era' of heightened terror threat, when he announces the appointment of a National Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator. In a major secutiry speech, the prime minister is also expected to announce the creation of new strategies for counter-terrorism, following a review of Australia's current defence, Fairfax reported. The review, separate to the one into the Sydney siege whose findings were released on Sunday, will show that 'Australia has entered a new, long-term era of heightened terrorism threat, with a much more significant home-grown element,' Mr Abbott will say, according to Fairfax. Scroll down for video . In a speech to Parliament on Monday Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce new counter-terrorism measures and a National Counter-Terrorism Coordinator . 'It assesses that the terrorist threat in Australia is rising. On all metrics, the threat to Australia is worsening,' he also says, according to Fairfax. The prime minister is expected to announce an increase in funding for national security agencies, and present a more cohesive plan that would see state and national efforts brought in alignment. Plans to strip dual citizens of their citizenships should they present as a terror threat and a crackdown on extremists groups are also believed to be included in Monday's address. The public will have more information available to them about the country's current terror threat - which now sits at high - so they can better understand the system and its levels. On Sunday when Mr Abbott released the review into the Sydney siege, he said that a shift in the balance between individual freedoms and community safety. 'There is an ongoing and inevitable debate in a country such as ours … between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community,' he said. The prime minister is also expected to announce an increase in funding for national security agencies, and present a more cohesive plan that would see state and national efforts brought in alignment . Mr Abbott may also reveal that another attack, like the one carried out by Man Haron Monis (pictured) is likely . 'My judgment is that – while having always to respect both – the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn.' Meantime The Australian reported that Mr Abbott will also announce that another terrorist attack is likely given the current climate. This comes as the review into Sydney's Martin Place siege was released, revealing crazed gunman Man Haron Monis 'slipped through the cracks of the system'. Despite an apparent 18 calls to ASIO in the days leading up to December 15 when Monis took 18 people hostage in the Lindt Cafe, authorities had deemed him as not a threat. The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege. The new counter terrorism mechanisms are aimed at stopping home grown terrorists like Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar . The announcement will come a day after an review into the Sydney siege was released . 'Plainly, this monster should not have been in our community,' Mr Abbott said. 'The difficulty is that while he was well and truly on a lot of radar screens, he was routinely assessed as not being a threat to himself or to the community. 'Plainly, at some stage he did become a threat. We obviously do need more checks and more scrutiny in the visa process, in the citizenship process.' The new counter-terrorism measures set to be announced on Monday are going to deal increasingly with 'home-grown terrorists', like Australia's most wanted jihadists Mohammed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf. The review found that despite multiple reports to ASIO about Monis, he slipped through the cracks of the system to hold hostages for nearly 17 hours on December 15 and 16 . Sharrouf and Elomar both fled Australia to join the Islamic State insurgents fighting in Syria and Iraq in 2013 and in July 2014 the Australian Federal Police issued arrest warrants for the disturbed pair. Sharrouf flew out of Sydney in December 2013 using his brother’s passport and was soon followed by his convert wife Tara Nettleton who brought their five children to the Middle East with her. The men gained notoriety as part of the more than 100 Australians who have joined Islamic State after they posted disturbing photos of themselves holding up decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers last year. Sharrouf even got his seven-year-old son to hold up the severed head of a soldier in the Syrian city of Raqqa, accompanied with the caption 'that's my boy', in an image that shocked the world.","In a speech on Monday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce new counter-terrorism measures .

The married mother-of-two campaigned for her uncle's 2012 presidential campaign and served as the Michigan representative for the Republican National Committee, a position she said she will now step down from, according to the Detroit Free Press. McDaniel, whose father Scott is Mitt Romney's brother and mother Ronna was a former U.S. Senate candidate, was the front-runner for the chairman seat. She was endorsed by the party and also supported by a number of tea party activists. During her acceptance speech, McDaniel said the state needs to work on getting a Republican in the White House in 2016. 'We might not agree on everything, but we can agree that seven years of liberal Obama policies have a destructive effect on our nation,' she said. McDaniel (pictured here with father Scott, who is Mitt Romney's brother) was serving as the state's representative for the Republican National Committee and was the front-runner for the seat .

McDaniel added that she hopes she can win the 'support and trust' of the people who did not support her on Saturday. She later told reporters that the theme of her campaign is 'unity'. Activist Mike Farage told the Free Press he voted for McDaniel because she wants the party to reach out to minority voters. McDaniel succeeds Bobby Schostak, the party's state chairman for the last four years. He did not seek reelection.","Ronna Romney McDaniel, 41, won 55 per cent of the vote on the first ballot .

"The international team searching the Indian Ocean for the Boeing 777 are now considering the seemingly impossible scenario of the aircraft having 'landed' somewhere, instead of crashing in the southern Indian Ocean. 'We may have to regroup soon to look into this possibility if no positive results come back in the next few days,' sources within the International Investigation Team were quoted as telling the New Straits Times today. Scroll down for video . Looking: Captain Flt Lt Tim McAlevey of the Royal New Zealand Air Force flying a P-3 Orion during a search trying to locate missing Malaysia Airways Flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean . While the sources have not suggested which country the aircraft might have landed - or crashed - in, the possibility that an entirely new search in a different area is in line with suggestions by the Mail weeks ago that alleged sightings of a low-flying aircraft could have located it in a different place than the ocean. 'The thought of it landing somewhere else is not impossible, as we have not found a single debris that could be linked to MH370,' sources were quoted as telling the paper. 'However, the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane when more than 20 nations are searching for it, seems absurd,' said the sources. But they admitted that it was difficult to determine if the plane had really ended in the Indian Ocean, despite calculations seeming to point to that direction. The Mail reported early in the search that fishermen and villagers living in north east Malaysia had filed official statements with police claiming to have seen - or heard - a low-flying aircraft at the time when MH370 lost all contact with ground control. The plane has been missing for more than six weeks and sources are now considering the previously unthinkable prospect that it has landed somewhere . The search for the plane has been concentrated on an area of the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Western Australia . Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has now been missing for 46 days - an important milestone as it allowed U.S. lawyers to pursue Boeing in U.S. courts. A 45-day rule, enforced by the National Transportation Safety Board, means that families can now file suits in U.S. courts against Boeing, an American manufacturer. 'We don't feel we have a whole lot of other choices because we're certainly not getting any answers without (legal action),' Sarah Bajc told CNN. Ms Bajc, whose partner Philip Wood was on the flight, said she hoped that pressure in the courts might lead to the Malaysian government releasing important data. One key problem however could bt the lack of any plane. 'If we don't have the ""black box"" with all the critical information on it, or we don't have any part of the wreckage, it would be very hard to maintain a claim against Boeing in any court in the United States,' Daniel Rose, an aviation attorney from Kreindler & Kreindler, told CNN. Their descriptions of a 'very loud engine' and headlights like those switched on by an aircraft about to land at night suggested that the aircraft was flying to the west, across jungle, very fast, at a low altitude. The sources told the government-controlled paper that it was difficult to determine if the plane had really ended in the Indian Ocean, although calculations pointed to that direction. The Malaysian-led investigation team, along with experts from Inmarsat and the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, had to rely on an Inmarsat communications satellite, which did not provide any definite details, including the aircraft's direction, altitude and speed. One of the sources told the New Straits Times: 'A communications satellite is meant for communication...the name is self explanatory. 'The reason investigators were forced to adopt a new algorithm to calculate the last known location of MH370 was because there was no global positioning system following the aircraft as the transponder went off 45 minutes into the flight.' The source added that the international team was looking at adding more ships and aircraft to the existing search area in the Indian Ocean - as well as widening the area because there were fears that searchers had been 'looking for the plane in the wrong place'. 'We can't focus on one place too long as the ocean is very big, although the search team has been following the leads received and analysed. 'It is by luck if we find the wreckage using the Bluefin-21 (the US-owned underwater search vehicle). 'There is no physical evidence and we are totally depending on scientific calculations since day one, including the pings.' With the search now into its 45th day, . Malaysian authorities are hoping more countries will come forward to . share their crucial satellite and radar data. A map of the search area, which is 5,700 feet off the coast of Perth. The area that had been search, as of Sunday 20th April is shown in grey . A source told the New Straits Times that if they were to find debris from the jet it would be down to 'luck' and they might need to expand the search . Sources said that while the plane could be on land, the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane was 'absurd' The paper said it understood that the team had not been receiving as much information from countries as it had hoped. Suggesting that national security of various countries was involved, the source added: 'We have mainly been provided with selective data.' The source said that because the information potentially involved the national security of the country from which it was requested, only partial raw data had been provided, making it difficult for Malaysian authorities to get the full picture. 'The data involved would be official information, so the (foreign) country cannot simply give it to us on paper or in soft copy - they will select only the ones that can be revealed.' The Malaysians had asked the US government to view data collected by its secret base, Pine Gap, in the Australian outback. But the request had been denied, sources said, after the US had said that no contact had been made with MH370. 'We can't be forcing them to show us the data, as they had already said there was nothing,' one source said. The search is currently in its 45th day and sources told the New Straits Times that the search team might be looking in the wrong place .

"Parents of preschoolers at a  St Louis school say their kids have been heartbroken after losing one of their favorite teachers. Kelly Hahn was put on leave from Wilkinson Early Childhood Center last December, just two weeks after being named the St Louis Public School district's 'Pre-K Teacher of the Year.' Fox2Now reports that children were coming home in tears after learning their favorite teacher was gone, and a rumor spread that Hahn had been diagnosed with cancer. Leave: Kelly Hahn was put on leave two weeks after being named St Louis Public School district's 'Pre-K Teacher of the Year' over an incident involving a student who came to school in a pull-up diaper . 'She is one of those people that I would say is the glue that holds Wilkinson together,' PTO President Dana Evans told KMOV. But sadness turned to anger after parents learned that Hahn had received a letter saying she'd been dismissed for child neglect and endangerment, which parents say stemmed from an incident over a diaper. A three-year-old had come to school one day in a pull-up diaper, which is against the rules at Wilkinson. After Hahn discovered the diaper, she let the child keep it on instead of removing it, and simply notified the parents. Another teacher notified Missouri Department of Family Services, which conducted an investigation that found no signs of neglect. St Louis Public Schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams says that the district has separate standards of conduct, though he did not comment specifically on Hahn. Early education: Wilkinson Early Childhood Center is a pre-K to second grade school under the St Louis Public Schools system . 'That’s the handcuffs that we have relating to personnel, we cannot discuss specific personnel issues,' Adams told Fox2Now. Even the parent of the child who came to school in a diaper says the punishment wasn't deserved. 'Regardless of the policy, what happened is so minor that it couldn’t possibly warrant incriminating a fabulous teacher,' said Cynthia West. Now, parents say, their children are under the supervision of a substitute who isn't certified. They've send more than 100 emails trying to get Hahn reinstated. 'I just want what`s best for her, what’s best for my kids,' said parent Sue Gilmor. 'And what’s best for him is having his teacher back. She loves those kids, and there’s no substitute for that.'","Kelly Hahn was put on leave from Wilkinson Early Childhood Center last December, two weeks after being named Pre-K Teacher of the Year .

"A two-year-old girl’s entire shoulder was left burned and blistered after she suffered a severe allergic reaction to a plaster that claims to promote skin healing. Doctors say Jayda Johnson could be scarred for life after wearing the Savlon plaster for just one day. Her family have complained to the plaster’s manufacturers as her shoulder now looks ‘disgusting’ from just one tiny cut. Jayda had a tiny graze on her shoulder after cutting herself on the sofa. Her father Daniel put a plaster from a £3.99 pack of Savlon dressings on her shoulder to stop her from scratching the wound. Scroll down for video . Jayda Johnson, two, suffered a severe allergic reaction after wearing a plaster from a pack of £3.99 Savlon Hydrocolloid Dressings. Doctors say  she may be scarred for life after wearing the plaster for just one day . Jayda's father put the plaster on his daughter on a Sunday morning after she  cut herself on the sofa. He checked the plaster on Monday morning and found it had burned through his daughter's skin (left). Her whole shoulder and part of her back became inflamed due to the allergic reaction (right) A doctor said the reaction could scar Jayda for life. She has been told to return to see a nurse every two days to get her dressing changed and is on a course of antibiotics after the wound became infected (pictured) The instructions advised leaving it on for up to a week. But when Mr Johnson checked the cut the next day, he was horrified to find the plaster had burned through his daughter's skin. The plaster was only 7.5cm long by 5cm wide, but Jayda’s entire right shoulder and part of her back had become inflamed. Doctors said Jayda had suffered a severe allergic reaction to the dressing, and could be scarred for life from it. The packaging for the Savlon Hydrocolloid Dressing says the plasters 'help prevent scarring' and 'promote faster healing'. Hydrocolloid plasters and dressings are said to absorb moisture from the wound but at the same time create a protective barrier so that oxygen, water and bacteria cannot get into the wound. This creates a moist, humid environment which promotes faster healing, and prevents scarring as a hard scab doesn't form. The Savlon plasters also claim to be hypoallegenic - which means the product is claimed to cause fewer allergic reactions. Mr Johnson, a father-of-two, from Harlow, Essex, said: 'It's not good. It's definitely affected her, she's fully aware of it and it looks terrible, to be honest. 'She had a little nick from the edge of the sofa so I put a plaster over it. 'I applied it on Sunday morning and then when I took it off on Monday when she got home from nursery I noticed it had burned her massively. The packaging for the Savlon Hydrocolloid Dressing says the plasters 'help prevent scarring' and 'promote faster healing' 'It seemed to be burning into her skin. The packet said to leave it on for four to seven days. 'I'm terrified that if I had left it on for the full seven days it would've burned down to the bone.' Mr Johnson, 31, noticed the burn on January 26 and took Jayda to see a doctor the following morning while his wife Lisa, 29, was at her telesales job. Mr Johnson, a coach driver, added: 'The doctor said it must have been an allergic reaction to the patch. 'It looks awful, like a second degree burn. 'She doesn't seem to be in too much pain from it, which makes me worry her nerves may have been damaged.' There have been reports of people suffering allergic reactions to hydrocolloid wound dressings . One report found the allergic reaction was caused by an ingredient called  'pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin' as a tackifying agent, to make the plaster sticky - though it is not known if this ingredient caused Jayda's reaction. Jayda has now been told to return to see a nurse every two days to get her dressing changed and is on a course of antibiotics after the wound became infected. Her grandmother Margaret Johnson said: 'She's only two and it's going to scar her. 'The doctor said it could scar her for life and it was only for a nick on the shoulder. 'It looks like it is spreading. I'm very concerned for her. 'If it had been on her face it could have been 20 million times worse - she has never had any sort of skin reaction before. Jayda's father Daniel Johnson, 31, said she had what looked like a second degree burn after just one day. He said: 'I'm terrified that if I had left it on for the full seven days it would've burned down to the bone' 'For all we know she might be a model when she's older. 'She's a stunning little girl but this is disgusting.' The family have written to Savlon owners Novartis Consumer Health to complain about the product. A company spokesman said: 'Novartis Consumer Health (NCH) is aware of a recent case concerning a patient who has experienced a skin reaction on the application site of Savlon Hydrocolloid dressing. 'Patient safety is our highest priority. 'As with any NCH products, we monitor carefully any adverse reports received and forward them to Health Authorities according to local legislation. 'NCH is investigating this report in line with regulatory requirements.'","Jayda Johnson cut her shoulder on the sofa and had a tiny graze .

"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, attempting to lay to rest his controversial remarks about President Barack Obama's patriotism, is now admitting that he can't question the Commander in Chief's 'mind or heart.' 'My blunt language suggesting that the president doesn’t love America notwithstanding, I didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart,' Giuliani said in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'My intended focus really was the effect his words and his actions have on the morale of the country, and how that effect may damage his performance. Let me explain.' Giuliani, who has taken heavy fire for the remarks he made last week at a New York City dinner hosted by prominent conservatives, argued that Obama is guilty of 'criticizing his country more than other presidents have done.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, pictured here on the set of Cavuto in September, attempted to lay to rest his controversial remarks about President Barack Obama's patriotism today in an op-ed this weekend. He is now admitting that he can't the the Commander in Chief's 'mind or heart' 'Furthermore, this president sometimes seems to have a difficult time in expressing adequate support for important allies, particularly Israel, Ukraine and Jordan,' he added. The 2008 Republican presidential candidate claimed that he bears Obama 'no ill will, and in fact think that his personal journey is inspiring and a testament to much of what makes this country great'. But he expressed doubt that Obama 'can rise to the occasion and underscore America’s greatness as our history and values merit.' 'If he does so, I will be the first to applaud him,' Giuliani wrote. 'But I can only be disheartened when I hear him claim, as he did last August, that our response to 9/11 betrayed the ideals of this country. 'When he interjected that “we tortured some folks,” he undermined those who managed successfully to protect us from further attack,' he asserted. Giuliani said he also takes issue with Obama's past critiques of American exceptionalism. To say the U.S is 'no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country in the world, does not suggest a becoming and endearing modesty, but rather a stark lack of moral clarity,' he argued. Fondly referred to as 'America's mayor' for his tenure as New York City's top political official during the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Giuliani's legacy has taken a hit in the last week following his stern rebuke of Obama. 'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' Giuliani said during the speech. 'He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.' The flap ballooned as Giuliani repeatedly tried to clarify his remarks. The day after the dinner, the Republican told Fox News he was not, in fact, questioning Obama's 'patriotism' and was being reported. 'He's a patriot, I'm sure,' Giuliani told the news station. 'What I'm saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear him say the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say, about how much he loves America.' And on Friday, Giuliani told the New York Daily News his concern about the president's morals dates back to young Obama's introduction to Frank Marshall Davis, a communist organizer, via his grandfather, and his relationships with quasi-communist' figures Saul Alinsky and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor whose radicals sermons caused a stir in the months before the 2008 presidential election. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker walks through a crowd to take his seat for the opening session of the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington on Saturday, where he floundered in the face of tough questions about Giuliani's remarks and his beliefs about Obama's faith . Also attending the Manhattan dinner at which Giuliani spoke was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who also made remarks, but they were deemed off the record. Walker, considered likely to bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, offered a muddled response when asked about Giuliani's comments. 'I don’t know, I honestly don’t know, one way or the other,' Walker told the Washington Post on Saturday when he was again asked to give his views on Obama's patriotism. He also refused to say whether he believes that Obama is a Christian, adding a new dimension to the discussion. 'I’ve actually never talked about it or I haven’t read about that,' Walker said of the president's faith. 'I’ve never asked him that.' 'You’ve asked me to make statements about people that I haven’t had a conversation with about that. How [could] I say if I know either of you are a Christian?' he asked the Post reporters. His spokeswoman subsequently claimed he was trying to highlight 'gotcha' questions from 'the media' out of 'principle'. It is unclear if he was ever previously articulated such a principle. Other likely contenders for the White House opted to distance themselves from Giuliani. 'Governor Bush doesn’t question President Obama’s motives. He does question President Obama’s disastrous policies,' aides to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a statement on Friday. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave a similar response to a local radio station on Friday when the subject came up. 'I think it’s a mistake to question people’s motives. It’s one thing to disagree on policy,' he said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said he doesn't think it's his responsibility 'to answer for every person in my party that makes a claim.' 'I’ll suffice it to say that I believe the President loves America; I think his ideas are bad,' the freshman senator said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told ABC News on Sunday, 'Well, I love Rudy, but I don’t want to go there. The nation’s very divided, President Obama has divided us more than he’s brought us together and I don’t want to add to that division.' He added: 'I have no doubt that he loves his country, I have no doubt that he’s a patriot. But his primary job as President of the United States is to defend this country, and he’s failing miserably.' Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a potential dark horse candidate for the presidency, likewise praised Giuliani when questioned about his claims on Sunday morning, calling him 'a great American,' in the context of the 9/11, of Fox News Sunday. However, he said, 'I don’t think it helps to question the president’s patriotism or motives.' The rumble led one of Giuliani's former communications aides, Mike Paul, stating that his previous employer had 'lost the throne' as America's mayor and that his remarks were an 'abomination,' according to Mediaite. Speaking about the dust up on Friday, the president's spokesman said Friday he felt sorry for Giuliani. 'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday that Giuliani's statements were 'very regrettable.' 'His comments were not helpful...And I'm sorry to see statements like that coming from the former mayor whose response to 9/11 in 2001 I admired very much,' Johnson said on CNN's State of the Union.","'I didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart,' Giuliani said in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.

"The Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat instructed his bodyguards to apprehend a Palestinian man who had just stabbed an ultra-Orthodox Jew in the stomach in the middle of a busy street. Mr Barkat said he and his staff were travelling in a car when he noticed the 'terrorist' with a knife. He and his bodyguard leaped from their car to stop the attacker. Scroll down for video . Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, pictured, was driving through Jerusalem when he saw the ultra-Orthodox Jew being attacked by an 18-year-old Palestinian man with a knife in IDF Square earlier today . Mr Barkat, centre, praised his security detail, pictured, for the way they deal with the armed attacker . The 27-year-old victim, pictured, suffered a stab wound to his stomach and was taken to hospital . The bodyguard drew his firearm and wrestled the 18-year-old attacker to the ground and held him until police arrived. The 27-year-old victim suffered a stab wound to the stomach and was only 'lightly injured' according to police. The stabbing took place between the Old City and the western sector’s city hall. A police spokesman said the suspect was in Israel illegally and has being taken into custody for questioning. Speaking to the Jerusalem Post, Mr Barkat said: 'I was driving my car near [IDF] Square when suddenly my team saw the terrorist near us with a knife . 'Both myself and my bodyguard immediately jumped out of my car, my guard drew his weapon and we held the terrorist until police arrived, and immediately took care of the casualty who fortunately was lightly injured.' Police said the 18-year-old alleged attacker, pictured, was in Israel illegally and is being held for questioning . Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said: 'Police force are on heightened alert in Jerusalem after the attack. The Palestinian is being questioned by the police . He said that an investigation into the attack is continuing although there has been an increase in the level of security patrols around the centre of Jerusalem following the incident. The motive for Sunday’s attack was not clear but it came after a series of knife assaults by Palestinians on Israelis in recent months. Last month, a knife-wielding Palestinian attacked passengers on a morning rush-hour bus in Tel Aviv, wounding 12 people, before being shot and wounded by a passing prison officer. In December, a knife-wielding Palestinian wounded two Israeli police officers in Jerusalem’s Old City.

"A 43-year-old man jumped to his death from the third floor escalator at Debenhams 'after a psychiatric hospital refused to admit him', an inquest heard. Painter and decorator Percival James, who had battled with schizophrenia for many years, was told he did not 'pass the threshold' for admission, according to his former partner and carer. Donna Burney told Westminster coroner's court she had repeatedly tried to have him sectioned by Maudsley Hospital as his schizophrenia worsened. Percival James, 43, jumped to his death from the third floor escalator at Debenhams in central London (pictured) 'after a psychiatric hospital refused to admit him', an inquest heard . Mr James was admitted to the hospital six times between 2007 and 2010, but had not taken any medication or been treated at the hospital since 2010. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'I find it very striking that there were six admissions in three years and then no admissions in four years.' The 43-year-old from Lambeth died at the flagship Debenhams store in central London in front of hundreds of shocked customers and staff in November last year. The Debenhams store in Oxford Street, pictured, has seven floors in total . Witness Serpil Veira told the court she saw a man run towards her before throwing himself over the escalator barrier, according to the Evening Standard. A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple trauma and head injury. Mr James had been under the care of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust since 2007. His former partner Ms Burney told the inquest he 'believed he had to fight demons and was often heard crying out in anxiety by his neighbour'. Coroner Dr Radcliffe expressed concern at the impact that reorganisations at the Maudsley were having on the quality of patient care. A report found staff to be 'overwhelmed with clinical duties'. The coroner adjourned the inquest, saying she wished to hear from the trust's medical staff who had cared for Mr James, as well as from a senior official about the reorganisations. It is expected to reconvene in the summer. A spokesman for South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust said it would not provide a comment until the inquest had been completed.

"A distraught father has criticised doctors after they repeatedly failed to diagnose his son’s brain tumour after he suffered nose bleeds for four months. Ten-year-old Stewart Sheridan had visited his GP surgery regularly over a number of months after suffering from severe nose bleeds. But time after time he was sent home and on his last visit to his family GP he was prescribed with an anti-viral nose cream with doctors at his local surgery believing he had a virus. But just days later his condition worsened and his father, Michael, rushed him to hospital where a scan revealed that he had a malignant brain tumour. Now medics are saying he has just months to live with a serious grade three tumour that is inoperable. Stewart Sheridan, 10, from Manchester has just months to live, after a scan revealed he had an inoperable, cancerous brain tumour. He had been taken to the GP several times over a number of months after suffering nose bleeds . The youngster was first taken to see his GP in November last year after he began suffering from persistent nose bleeds. But over a four-month period Stewart was repeatedly sent home without referral to specialists with the GP telling his family he had ‘excess blood’. On February 2 this year, he was sent home from school with a bloody nose and dizziness and was suffering hallucinations, diarrhoea and vomiting. When he arrived home his father said his son began to behave ‘strangely’ punching the air and speaking out loud. The same evening Mr Sheridan, 46, took his son to their family GP at the Ribblesdale Medical Practice in Bury, Greater Manchester. But the GP, who is said to have been ‘running behind’ on his appointments prescribed the youngster with a viral cream for his nostrils to stem the blood flow. Three days later Stewart complained of a headache and wobbly legs and was again behaving unusually when Mr Sheridan decided to take him to hospital. The youngster was given a CT scan which revealed a brain tumour. He was taken by ambulance to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where he remains. Doctors now say he has just months left to live. He is currently heavily sedated with his mother Kelly and his grandmother Carole Sheehan by his bedside. His devastated father, Michael, has now made a formal complaint to the GP practice saying his sons’ symptoms should have been picked up earlier. He said: ‘That night when my son was unwell I took him to the doctor, told him the symptoms and he said it was a virus and gave me a cream to put up his nostrils. On his last visit to see a doctor he was prescribed a nose cream, the GP suspecting he was suffering a virus. But days later his condition worsened and his father Michael rushed him to hospital. It was there, that scans revealed Stewart was suffering a brain tumour . Now medics are saying Stewart, pictured with his nana Carole Sheehan, has just months to live with a serious grade three tumour that is inoperable . ‘He should have picked up that it was something more serious, but he didn’t. ‘It makes me feel very annoyed. He did not do his job properly. ‘That night he (the GP) was running late, with his appointments behind schedule, and I feel like he rushed to get it done.’ Stewart now faces intense radiotherapy sessions at specialist cancer hospital, The Christie, to shrink the tumour, but medics fear the treatment will only delay the inevitable. Mr Sheridan, added: ‘They don’t know how long he has had the tumour – or whether the nose bleeds were connected to it – but it is right in the middle of his brain which means it is inoperable. ‘The radiotherapy will just shrink it, but the doctors said he has months to live. ‘I asked them if he had years, weeks or days left and they said months. We’re all devastated. 'He’s still out of it, even when he’s awake he doesn’t know what’ s going on. When they told us, I had to go out of the room, I couldn’t believe it. Mr Sheridan urged other parents to obtain a second opinion on their child’s symptoms. He said: ‘I just want to let parents know, so that if anyone is in the same situation or going through anything similar they know to take their child to a hospital and get them checked over. ‘Everyone is so worried about him – his friends, our family, even people who do not really know him. I am so cut up about it.’ Stewart’s grandmother Mrs Sheehan said: ‘I haven’t slept properly since we found out. I haven’t stopped crying. We’re just hoping for a miracle.’ Mr Sheridan, pictured with his son and mother, said: 'I just want to let parents know, so that if anyone is in the same situation or going through anything similar they know to take their child to a hospital and get them checked over' Mr Sheridan made a formal complaint to Ribblesdale Medical Practice on February 6 and was called back by the practice manager four days later. He was told the GP involved was ‘devastated’ and offered to apologise, but Mr Sheridan declined to speak to the GP. A spokesman for Ribblesdale Medical Practice said: ‘This is obviously a very difficult time for the patient, and our thoughts are with him and his family. ‘However, we are unable to comment further due to patient confidentiality.’ Medical director for Lancashire and Greater Manchester at NHS England, Raj Patel, said he was awaiting a formal complaint from the family. He said: ‘We would like to offer thoughts to this patient and their family, at what must be a difficult time for them. ‘We have not received any formal complaint regarding this patient’s care, however we take complaints about the services we commission very seriously, and would be happy to speak to the family about the care and treatment that the patient has received from their GP practice.’","Stewart Sheridan visited his GP regularly for months suffering nose bleeds .

"The gap between British boys and girls in school science performance is one of the biggest in the world, figures show. Boys in the UK are outperforming girls by 13 percentage points in international tests, while the average gap across other participating countries is just one point. Author Shirley Conran, adviser to the Government on girls, blamed sexism and poor teaching, telling the Sunday Times: ‘Maths and science are a feminist issue. It is a myth that boys are better at them than girls.’ Gap: British boys are further ahead of girls in science than in almost any other country (posed by models) Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said girls formed a ‘great reservoir of untapped talent’ but were getting the impression that science was ‘male-dominated and not for them’. The report, due to be published by the OECD next week, ranks Britain in the bottom five for gender equality in science, just above Colombia and alongside Costa Rica. The gap in Colombia is 18 points and the UK is one of four countries with gaps of between 10 and 15 points. Experts said the narrow gap in other countries proved that girls could perform as well as boys – but simply were not reaching their potential in the UK. Support: TV science presenter Brian Cox said girls formed a ‘great reservoir of untapped talent’ They said the tests suggested girls were being denied the chance to access to well-paid science jobs because they were being held back at school. In some countries in the rankings, including Finland and Singapore, girls performed as well as boys in science or even better. Pupils in 67 countries took Pisa international tests in maths, science and reading at the age of 15. British boys taking part in the 2012 Pisa tests did better than girls in maths by 12 percentage points, one point higher than the OECD average gap. Girls meanwhile outperformed boys by 25 points in reading; the OECD average was 35 points higher for girls. Andreas Schleicher, OECD special adviser on education, said there was ‘no biological reason for girls to do badly.’ He added: ‘It’s not the case that boys are good at science and girls at reading, that’s just not true. People say boys are better at maths and science and girls at reading but there is simply no evidence from our research to support that. ‘Aged 9 and 10, both girls and boys in the UK think science is really interesting; by age 15 girls in the UK think it is really boring. ‘The study choices girls are making do not lead to the best-paid occupations. Too many schools are not giving them the answers to why are we studying this, what jobs will it lead to, what life opportunities it is opening up. 'There is a lot of work to do in terms of attitudes, expectations and careers for girls. Parents can play a part in tackling these social and emotional factors and so can teachers.’ Experts said one solution currently under consideration is the introduction of ‘gender policies’ in schools which would challenge assumptions about suitable roles for girls and boys. They said phrases like ‘man up’ could be considered sexist but are often used by teachers and in the playground. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ‘Last year as many girls as boys achieved grade C and above in science GCSEs and the number of girls taking physics A-level has gone up by almost 1,000 in the last four years. In the same period, the number of girls taking biology and chemistry have also risen significantly. ‘Developing the best schools and skills is a key part of our plan for education, and the skills taught by subjects like maths and science are some of those most valued by employers and universities.'","Gap which has opened up in OECD rankings shows stark differences .
British boys taking part in 2012 tests also did 12 points better in maths .
TV physicist Brian Box: Girls should not see science as 'male-dominated'"
"The legality of parking tickets issued by enforcement firms is being challenged in a landmark case at the Appeal Court. In a stand against what he calls 'bullying' tactics, Barry Beavis, who owns a fish and chip shop in Billericay, Essex, will say today that an £85 fine for exceeding his two-hour free stay by 56 minutes was disproportionate and should not be enforced. If he wins, what critics see as a nauseating bonanza will end and new systems will be put in place to manage parking on private land. His action comes after the Daily Mail exposed the antics of 'parking cowboys' last year. McDonalds in Uxbridge is one of many McDonalds identified by the Mail last summer as installing signs and cameras in  car parks warning customers they can stay a maximum of 90mins or face a £100 fine . In a hard-hitting campaign, we revealed how the rogue firms are making tens of millions of pounds from fines handed out to motorists who overstay – sometimes for only a few minutes - in car parks at hospitals, railway stations, shopping centres and fast food outlets like McDonald's. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment has over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking squads who issue official-looking £100 tickets. Mr Beavis, who owns The Happy Haddock fish and chips takeaway in Billericay, Essex, says he's making his stand against a firm called ParkingEye Ltd on behalf of every motorist in the country. He has dedicated hundreds of hours and made three court appearances in an attempt to change the law that allows 'bullying' parking operators to 'extort' money from people. He said: 'I'm not an activist, I'm not an armchair lawyer. I was just someone who got a ticket. 'But as I researched my case I became incredibly angry with the way parking companies operate and bully people because they exploit human weakness – doing what we're told. 'There's lots of strongly worded language saying you must pay, with ANPR photos. It's all deliberately made to look like parking tickets but they are just speculative invoices. 'I thought what it would be like if it happened to my mother-in-law – she would have been afraid and frightened and would have paid immediately.' Mr Beavis received a demand for £85 – discountable to £50 if paid within 14 days - after parking at Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford on April 15, 2013. The site offers two free hours of parking and he returned 56 minutes late. He ignored the first three demands from ParkingEye Ltd after researching his rights on the internet but had no option but to fight his case when he received a court summons. A close-up of the sign: We revealed how the rogue firms are making tens of millions of pounds from fines handed out to motorists who overstay . Mr Beavis's case centres on the argument that the ticket was unfair because it was a disproportionate sum for an hour's parking. A judge found against him at Cambridge County Court last year, where he was not legally represented. The ruling stated operators like ParkingEye Ltd are entitled to impose charges higher than their outgoings – and more expensive than typical parking charges in the area – to act as a deterrent. Now A barrister, Sa'ad Hossain QC, has offered to represent Mr Beavis pro bono at the Court of Appeal hearing in London next week . The 47-year-old added: 'I'm hoping that parking companies will no longer be allowed to act in the current way. 'I agree there is a need for parking management. In the place where I overstayed it's close to the train station and if there was no management system it would be clogged up with commuters. So something is needed but this is not it.' His wife, Wendy, added the free parking system at Riverside Retail Park was unfair because drivers sometimes spent up to half an hour waiting for a space after driving in. She added: 'Barry has put in a hell of a lot of time but he should still pursue it. It's not just about him – it's about other people that panic when they get one of those letters. 'I'm proud of him for standing up to those bullies.' Mr Beavis's case has been strengthened by new research by the RAC Foundation which suggests hundreds of thousands of drivers are likely to have been illegally penalised for overstaying their welcome whilst parking on private land - and could be entitled to repayments totalling many tens of millions of pounds. It says that parking companies are levying huge charges on drivers 'out of all proportion' to the losses suffered by landowners as a result of motorists' actions. Although the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 banned clamping on private land, drivers who stay longer than the time they have paid for are still likely to receive tickets that demand payments of up to £100, and in some cases significantly more. In his paper for the RAC Foundation barrister John de Waal QC argues that this is likely to be several times more than compensation for a genuine loss. Mr de Waal, who will NOT be a witness at Mr Beavis's case, says: 'Payments at the level that operators presently demand as sanctions are unlikely to count as genuine pre-estimate of loss; they should be seen by the Courts as penalties, which means they are unenforceable.' If the courts agree with Mr de Waal that many of the tickets issued are 'extravagant and unconscionable', drivers are potentially in line to receive tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds in refunds. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'We would like to see this legal argument tested in a higher court so that a binding precedent is set. At the same time we would like the government to do what it should have done at the outset and set out what are reasonable charges.' A ParkingEye spokesperson said: 'ParkingEye cannot comment on the outcome of a yet unheard case but remains confident in its position.'","If he wins, what critics see as a nauseating cash bonanza will end .
New systems must then be introduced to manage parking on private land .

"Travelers at airports across the U.S. can expect further travel misery this week with the Siberian Express impacting the eastern half of the country predicted to bring two additional cold spells over the coming days. The cold weather is sweeping south after causing havoc on the northeast with cities as New York and Boston being battered by frequent heavy snowstorms, while the NOAA reports that over half of the U.S. is currently snow-covered. Temperatures across much of the country are predicted to be 25 to 30 degrees below normal on Monday, according to the National Weather Service and anything from rain to sleet to snow is possible in many areas. However there is some good news on the way with the extreme cold expected to ease up next week as we enter March . Scroll down for video . Fort Worth, Texas: Winter hasn't loosened its grip on the U.S. just yet, as evidenced by freezing rain in North Texas and more arctic air in New England and New York on Monday . Snow is on the ground in 48 out of 50 states - with only Florida and South Carolina currently without, according to WSI . New York: Travelers were forced to sleep at JFK International Airport over the weekend after icy weather closed the airport on Sunday morning and crews worked to clear the runways of ice, slush and snow . Additional waves of frigid air will continue to flow southward out of Canada and into the central and eastern United States this week, but there are indications the worst of the cold will ease up next week . Up to an inch of ice is possible in parts of North Texas through late Monday. Already, more than 900 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport have been cancelled in anticipation of another powerful winter storm that is due to hit the south spreading ice, snow and freezing rain. Over the weekend travelers were forced to sleep at New York's JFK International Airport after the icy weather closed the airport on Sunday morning and crews worked to clear the runways of ice, slush and snow. According to Flight Aware, as of 5 pm on Monday more than 2,900 flights are currently delayed because of the weather and some 1,500 are cancelled. Fortunately there are indications that the worst of the extreme cold will ease up next week. ‘Indications are the pattern will change next week so that the cold is much less severe from the Midwest to the Northeast,’ said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson. ‘Temperatures from the Midwest to the Northeast will still average below normal, but they will be much less extreme.’ Rather than temperatures averaging 20-30 degrees F below normal, temperatures may average 10 F or less below normal. During March, normal temperatures will rise by a degree every few days. Texas: Up to an inch of ice is possible in parts of North Texas through late Monday. Already, more than 900 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were cancelled on Monday morning . More than 175 million people from the Upper Midwest to the interior South and the Northeast will have to endure more extreme cold conditions this week . Parts of the South, including Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama, and Charlotte, North Carolina, may break out into some warm early spring weather next week. Highs may in the 60s on a few occasions. ‘The pattern shift will allow frigid air to take aim more at the northern Rockies,’ Anderson said. As a byproduct of the weather pattern change, a series of storms may track from the Southwest states to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Valley. The stormy pattern may translate to wintry mix events that transition to rain for the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Snow is currently on the ground in at least 48 of 50 U.S. states according to three separate national snow cover maps, reports USA Today. None of the maps show snow in Florida, but they all differ slightly with regards the other snow free state as the country is pummeled by another cold front. Depending on which map you consult the other snow free state is either South Carolina, Louisiana or Mississippi. With snow forecast to fall this week in all three states, Florida could be the only state without snow by the weekend. Ice on the East River: New York City and much of the East Coast has been experiencing frigid temperatures over the past week with heavy snow and sleet accumulations . Some small children take advantage of the unseasonably cold temperatures in Enid, Oklahoma, to head down the side of the north Van Buren overpass in their cardboard sled . Dallas/Forth Worth airport was forced to cancel around half all incoming and outgoing flights on Monday in anticipation of another powerful winter storm that is due to hit the south spreading ice, snow and freezing rain . The maps don’t feature Hawaii and Alaska, although both also have snow, although the National Weather Service says it is the second least-snowy winter on record in Anchorage. The lack of snow has saved the city about $1 million in snow removal and related public services, reports the Alaska Dispatch News. After a brief flirtation with sunshine and slightly higher temperatures on Sunday, arctic air returned to parts of New England and New York on Monday. Wind chills will send temperatures diving below zero in northern parts of the U.S. starting Monday afternoon into the night. Winds could cause Bennington, Vermont, to drop to 17 below zero, while Lake Placid, New York, could see minus 30. In Michigan, Saginaw, Bay City and Midland dropped to 10 below zero early in the day, breaking the area's record of minus 2. Dallas firefighters respond to an accident on Central Expressway on Monday as freezing rain affected travel in nearly half of Texas and winter storm warnings were issued in the northern part of the state . New York: Travelers sleep in Terminal 4 of JFK International Airport in New York on Sunday morning before the airport re-opened with lengthy delays for travelers . Further travel misery is predicted this week with two additional cold spells dropping southward from Canada over the coming days . The cold weather is predicted to remain this week, but then temperatures should start to climb as we enter March. Normal temperatures will rise by a degree every few days next month . Texas: Workers clear ice from sidewalks in front of City Hal in Fort Worth as sleet covers the ground after an overnight winter storm on Monday . Downtown Fort Worth, Texas, is quiet and empty as sleet and freezing temperatures hit the area on Monday . In Canton, Massachusetts, a man was killed on Sunday when he fell through a snow-covered skylight on the roof of a building. In Portland, Maine, chunks of ice described as the size of end tables slid off the roof of a five-story building and crashed through the front and rear windows of an unoccupied car on Sunday. In rural western Pennsylvania, a man and a woman were found dead in the snow outside their home on Sunday afternoon, but their causes of death weren't immediately clear. Winter storm warnings and advisories have also been posted in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, calling for freezing rain and snow. In Texas, a 31-year-old Amarillo man died Sunday when he lost control of his car on icy Interstate 27. Monday's icy weather also delayed the murder trial of the ex-Marine charged with killing Navy SEAL and American Sniper author Chris Kyle. The trial will resume on Tuesday in Stephenville, Texas, and the jury could receive the case this week.

Stephenville, Texas: Monday's icy weather also delayed the murder trial of the ex-Marine charged with killing Navy SEAL and American Sniper author Chris Kyle . Multiple locations including Boston, New York City, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Chicago are likely to finish the month within the top three coldest Februaries on record. In some cases, temperatures for the remainder of the month may deliver the coldest February on record and could rank as the one of the coldest months ever, reports AccuWeather. The coldest month ever was in January 1977, with an average temperature of just under 13 degrees, but the city is on track to break that record. Boston's transit agency is slowly returning to normal after a series of crippling snowstorms and low temperatures. Most subway and trolley branches had service restored on Sunday just in time for the Monday morning commute. Buses were running on a regular weekday schedule, but cautioned there might be delays and commuter rail passengers were told to expect delays and cancellations. Colorado's lawmakers were told to stay at home on Monday because of snowy weather, prompting a hearing on a contentious bill limiting penalties on businesses in discrimination to be rescheduled. The cold snap has caused numerous water main breaks and leaks in suburban Washington, D.C., with 75 broken mains needing repair on Sunday alone. The Great Lakes are going the way of Niagara Falls and Sioux Falls and are freezing over. Lake Erie is nearly totally frozen, and Lakes Huron and Superior are nearly 80 percent frozen. Storms and freezing temperatures last week in Tennessee are being blamed for 22 deaths. As an upper-level system ejects out of the Southwest, another winter storm may take shape in the South on Tuesday night through Wednesday.

"Dark history: Virginia Roberts accused two young men of rape in 1998, just months before she was recruited to join billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's underage harem. Pictured above in January 2015 in Denver . The woman who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew during her time as a 'sex slave' for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein is now having her credibility questioned following a new report that reveals she previously accused two young men of rape. Virginia Roberts, 31, is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to 'service'. Both men strongly deny the claims. It has now been revealed that just months before she was introduced to convicted-pedophile Epstein, then 14-year-old Roberts accused two acquaintances of rape. The Daily News uncovered court records which show prosecutors decided not to press formal charges due to Roberts' 'lack of credibility' as a victim. According to the records, police started investigating the case on the insistence of Roberts' mother and after a report made by a social worker at a group home. While officers at first had a hard time getting in contact with Roberts because she was living at a medical facility, she eventually told them her side of the story. She reported that in early February 1998, she had been drinking alcohol and smoking pot in a wooded area near West Palm Beach with friends Josh, 18, and Kevin, 17, when she passed out. (Their full names were not reported since they were not formally charged with a crime.) She says she later woke up to both of the young men taking turns raping her - an ordeal she says went on for about five to seven hours. Royal connection: Roberts went on to work as a 'sex slave' for Epstein for three years, during which she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew (pictured together above) Roberts recalled being dropped off at Josh's house later where he had sex with her again. When officers tracked down the two men later the following summer, both testified that it was a consensual threesome. A detective who spoke with Josh reported that the young man said the girl was tired and that he urged her to do to sleep. He says she then 'said to him something to the effect of ""why don't you keep me awake.""' So he thought it was consensual when they had sex following that statement. Accusations: The 1998 rape case never went to trial because prosecutors said Roberts lacked credibility. She went on to serve as a sex slave for Epstein (left) for three years. In addition to having sex with Prince Andrew, she says she was forced to service attorney Alan Dershowitz (right) as well. Dershowitz and the Prince have strongly denied the claims . 'At no point did I hear no, I guess that's the important thing,' Josh said, according to the police report. Josh surrendered to police in August 1998 and was booked on a charge of lewd assault upon a child. He told the Daily News that he only saw Roberts once again after that night and that he was completely surprised by the accusation. Kevin was processed as a juvenile. However,  prosecutors decided to drop the case in October 1998 due to Roberts' 'lack of credibility and no substantial likelihood of success at trial.' Michael Salnick, the defense lawyer who represented Kevin in the rape allegations, says the fact that prosecutors didn't believe Roberts would be a believable victim could hamper her current lawsuit. 'She needs to be careful the past doesn’t come back to haunt her,' he told the Daily News. But one of Roberts'  current lawyers says the previous case proves nothing. 'For the prosecutors to describe her as not credible means only that they did not think they had sufficient evidence to win. But she was raped,' attorney Sigrid McCawley said in a statement. 'And to be victimized all over again with the leak of sealed juvenile records is disgraceful.' All alone: Epstein is alleged to have taken his harem and wealthy businessmen to vacations on his private island in the Caribbean (pictured above) According to court records connected with Roberts' current lawsuit, she maintains that she was recruited to join Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and named Prince Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with. Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get  his name removed from the suit, claiming Roberts made the entire story up. Epstein, 61, has already served 13 months behind bars after admitting to soliciting sex from the underage girls.

"A final challenge to the presidential decree denying Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran clemency has failed. Judge Hendro Puspito said the Administrative Court in Jakarta was not authorised to hear the challenge. 'Clemency is the president's prerogative,' Judge Puspito said. Scroll down for video . Todong Mulya Lubis, the pair's lawyer, said that their legal team would appeal the judge's decision . Lawyers for Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) will challenge the presidential decree that denied them clemency in a Jakarta court . 'It is the president's right to give pardon therefore clemency is not about technicalities,' The Age reported Judge Puspito as saying. The human rights lawyers informed the court that they intended to appeal the decision. Earlier on Tuesday, their lawyer, Todong Mulya Lubis, admitted they didn't have 'much chance' of succeeding with the appeal but  said: 'I hate not to try'. 'I hate not to do it, because when we talk about human life, we have to do everything possible,' the human rights lawyer told ABC Radio. Lawyers for the pair argued that Indonesian President Joko Widodo did not follow due process when he denied the Bali Nine pair clemency. They claimed that President Joko did not consider their circumstances  because the pair were death row drug offenders. The only other case ever deemed to be outside the realm of the court was brought against fellow Australian Schapelle Corby. It's a rare challenge, and the only one like it was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to another Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby . Advisers to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (pictured) say he should get the executions over and done with . When the same challenge was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to the convicted drug smuggler in 2012, the court ruled that it had no power to overturn presidential decrees. The 37-year-old is now free on parole. Authorities say it's 'very likely' the Bali Nine duo will this week be relocated to the island where Indonesia plans to execute them. Reports from the Indonesian government indicate that the duo will be transported via military planes to Nusakambangan penal island. It has not been confirmed whether the government will use a Hercules plane which will mean a journey by both air and land for the pair, or the smaller airforce fighter jets which can land directly on the island. Four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport.It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan . Four jets from Denpasar airport have the capacity to land in the regency of Cilacap, where Nusakambangan is located, and would take an estimated three hours to fly the 900 kilometres from Bali to the island where the Australians are scheduled to be executed. If the Indonesian government made the decision to deploy a Hercules from Densapar, where the pair are being held, to Yokyakarta, the former capital in East Java, Chan and Sukumaran would then have a four-hour road journey to reach the Cilacap port to be ferried to Nusakambangan Island. Chan and Sukumaran were to be transferred from their Bali jail cells to the island last week, but it was found to have inadequate isolation cells. Indonesian Attorney General HM Prasetyo on Monday said preparations were now 'about 80 per cent' complete.

Chinthu Sukumaran arrives at Kerobokan Prison in Bali last week to visit his brother Myuran who is facing execution by firing squad in Indonesia with fellow Australian Andrew Chan . Construction materials have been arriving on the island and a jail official has said there are orders to accelerate the works for completion within days. The Indonesian Military has also made plans to secure the transfer of the men from Bali to central Java. A squadron of Sukhoi jets has arrived at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport, where air force commander Sugiharto Prapto said they were yet to receive orders related to the Bali Nine pair, but were there for seven days if needed. If they use a charter plane, we're ready to secure it so that the operation can be implemented safely and smoothly, he said. Indonesian news agency Antara reports Indonesian Military commander General Moeldoko has given orders for a Hercules aircraft to transport the men to Nusakambangan, guarded by the jets. Both Michael and Chintu spoke on behalf of their brothers who are awaiting execution at the prison . Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew love Indonesia and the respect they have shown them during their 10 years in prison .

'Don't try to disrupt the executions by any means. The military is prepared. Don't try to introduce a scenario that will disrupt the executions,' Gen Moeldoko reportedly said. Meanwhile Mr Joko appears to be keen to let tensions with Australia over Chan and Sukumaran simmer down. Asked about Prime Minister Tony Abbott drawing a link between tsunami aid to Indonesia and the death sentences on Monday, Mr Joko reportedly said: 'There's already been clarification. Don't you heat this up.' Asked if it would affect plans to execute the convicted drug smugglers, Mr Joko said: 'No, that's our sovereign law', as quoted by Indonesian news website detik.com. Tensions between Canberra and Jakarta boiled over last week after Jakarta perceived Mr Abbott's comments as threats and warned that 'no one responds well to threats'.

"Parents know all too well that sickening feeling when they turn around to discover their child has unbuckled their seatbelt but a new invention will now put their minds at ease.

Although as many as 99 percent of parents say they always restrain their children at the beginning of the trip - it is the potential for what can happen when the driver's eyes are peeled to the road which is the concern. However, an Australian-made seatbelt safety system aptly called, buckle me up, could take that worry away for adults. Deborah Khoury, pictured with her three girls, Sarah, Hannah and Amelia, has trialled the buckle me up device for three weeks which has worked a treat both times one of her children has unbuckled while she was driving . The small device, similar to an E-Tag, is mounted to the dashboard, and wirelessly connects with small monitors on seatbelts so the driver is alerted both visually and with sound if a child unbuckles their belt . The small device, similar to an E-Tag, is mounted to the dashboard, and wirelessly connects with small monitors on seatbelts so the driver is alerted both visually and with sound if a child unbuckles their belt. Only NSW and WA have statistics of fatalities of children not wearing seatbelts: . Mother-of-three Deborah Khoury, from Sydney, has been trialling the device for three weeks which has worked a treat both times one of her children has unbuckled while she was driving. 'It's really comforting because it comes on in a second so I just press the button at the start of the trip and then don't have to take my eyes off the road to see if they are buckled up,' she said. 'I think it will happen less and less because it's teaching them that when the alarm goes off something serious has happened.' Ms Khoury feels extremely fortunate to not have experienced accidents when her children has taken off their belt without her knowing. 'It can make me quite emotional really,' she says. 'I have had to put the brakes on quickly and the kids move forward which is when I've realised they are unrestrained which makes you think of all of the terrible accidents that could have happened like going through the windscreen.' Greg Pace, a Northern Sydney region firefighter for 18 years, knows all to well the dangers involved when children have undone their belts during the journey . According to a 2013 study by Monash University Accident Research Centre, children are 12 times more distracting to a driver than talking on a mobile phone while at the wheel. Greg Pace, a Northern Sydney region firefighter for 18 years, is very familiar with the dangers involved when children have undone their belts during a car journey. Mr Pace recalls attending the scene of a car crash a few years ago when a five-year-old boy had undone his lap sash around his booster seat and was thrown underneath the passenger side seat. 'It took me and my team over an hour just to remove the child from under the seat due to the injuries he sustained,' he said. 'Once we got him out of the car, he was rushed to hospital with a broken leg - it was the femur which is a very hard bone to break, a broken arm and a broken nose.' 'The mother of the child was in hysterics – she was crying as she had sworn she’d buckled up the child at the start of the journey.' Ms Khoury is a psychotherapist who has counselled clients that have lost children in car accidents when they were unbuckled from their seats. 'Losing a little one is serious stuff - it's devastating,' she said. 'It isn't something that you would ever get over - it will stay with you forever especially if it's something that you could have been avoided - it could haunt you for the rest of your life.' This device could save not only a child's life but also a lifetime of unbearable guilt endured by parents .","90 percent of Australian cars don’t have seatbelt alert system for backseats .

"A teenager born without any fingers on his left hand has been given a Darth Vader-style 'bionic' limb which was made using a 3D printer. Joe Oxenbury, 15, was born six weeks premature with an upper limb deficiency in his left hand which meant his fingers did not form properly while in the womb. But in September last year, his father Chris, 40, read an article about 3D printing techniques and contacted an organisation about the niche process. Joe Oxenbury, 15, who was born without fingers on his left hand, has now been given a 'bionic' limb, which took 20 hours to make using a 3D printer . A volunteer used the measurements of Joe's right hand and a design inspired by George Lucas' iconic Star Wars films to produce the £30 hand . Four months later, Joe and his father were 'lost for words' when the £30 hand arrived at their home in Stourbridge. The hand was crafted by a volunteer from Enabling The Future, James Holmes-Siedle, a global collective which encourages owners of 3D printers to make hands for those who need a prosthesis. Joe said: 'It is a bit like the one Darth Vader had in Star Wars. 'I chose it deliberately as I was going for that kind of style and colour. I was very happy when it arrived. It was better than I thought it would be. 'It is not robotic at all, which is great and it feels really comfortable on. I'm able to do things I haven't before.' The charity used the measurements of Joe's right hand and a design inspired by George Lucas' iconic Star Wars films to produce the 'bionic' limb, which took 20 hours to make. Mr Oxenbury, a full-time artist, said: 'I was just browsing the internet last September and saw that a three-year-old from Hawaii had a 3D printed hand done. 'I was amazed. I got in contact with the same charity who put me in touch with James, a 3D-printing charity based in the U.S. Joe, who lives in Stourbridge, said: 'It is a bit like the one Darth Vader had in Star Wars' 'They use a special tool to measure Joe's hands and I sent the measurements across online after that. 'It came the post last Wednesday, it was amazing. It just came in the post and we were flabbergasted. I was lost for words.' He added: 'Because it is mechanical and not electric at all, it is organic and it is all really functional. 'It only costs £30 to make because they are volunteers we didn't have to pay anything - we are incredibly grateful. 'Within five or ten minutes, he was picking up bananas and picking up oranges. It seems very intuitive. 'The arm uses strings and no electronics at all. The strings act as tendons would do. It's like something off Star Wars.' His father Chris, 40 (pictured left), decided to contact a group of volunteers who specialised in 3D printing techniques after reading an article about the niche process . Mr Oxenbury said the 3D-printed version was 'more organic' than previous prosthetics which he said can be very expensive and 'more cosmetic than practical'. He added: 'This new hand feels like part of him. When he rotates his wrist, his fingers clench. 'It is quite rare in the UK. I know someone in Wales had one done but that is it really. 'When Joe gets older and grows, we can just print out a new one or new parts to fit him. It is always going to be printable. That is the beautiful thing about it. 'When Joe was born, I thought some kind of technology would be able to help him, and now, 15 years on, we are there. 'It is great to get the word out there that there is hope for kids, and adults, with limb deficiency.' James Holmes-Siedle, the volunteer who made the model, said: 'It's a complicated bit of technology and it took about 20 hours to print the hand.' Jo Dixon, from charity Reach, who work with children with limb deficiency, added: 'It's something that's moving really fast because printers are so accessible. 'The 3D hands are not as all-singing, all-dancing as they could be, but prosthetic hands for children can be very heavy and cumbersome. The 3D printed ones are much lighter and they look funky and robotic.'","Joe Oxenbury, from Stourbridge, was born with upper limb deficiency .

"Police have released CCTV images of three men suspected of a possible racist attack on a woman who had her hair set on fire in a branch of McDonald's. Detectives appealed for the men to get in touch for questioning over the incident, which took place in the early hours of the morning in Canterbury, Kent last week. Now police are investigating the possibility that the attack was racially motivated, after one witness said the woman queuing for food was targeted 'simply because she is not white'. CCTV: This image shows three men whom police want to speak to over an alleged racist attack which saw a woman's hair get set on fire in McDonald's in Canterbury . Appeal: Detectives investigating the incident want the men featured in the footage to contact them . Those present said that the men who carried out the assault filmed the incident on a mobile phone then ran away before they could be apprehended. Detective Sergeant Barry Carr, of Kent Police, said: 'Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse. 'This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible.' After the incident on Friday morning, a friend of the victim wrote on a Kent University Facebook page: 'To the disgusting person in McDonald's tonight who set my friend's hair on fire simply because she is not white. 'You are disgusting and a disgrace to the human race, she did absolutely nothing to you as she was simply waiting around for myself and others who were waiting for food. Attack: Witnesses claim the victim had her hair set on fire only because she was non-white . Venue: The attack took place in the early hours of Friday morning at McDonald's, pictured . 'The fact you targeted her is disgusting, and that you left like a wimp without owning up to your criminal act makes you even more despicable. 'I cannot believe that in this day and age there are still people who are as racially discriminative and backwards thinking as you.' Kent Police confirmed today that they were investigating the claim that the attack was motivated by racism. McDonald's said in a statement: 'We are aware of the incident and are co-operating with the police fully.' Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on 101.","Woman had her hair set on fire while queuing in Canterbury McDonald's .

"Ryan McDonald, a physics student at Oxford University, said his prospective trip to Mars is putting a dampner on his love life . One of the British volunteers who wants to be chosen for a pioneering mission to Mars has admitted that the prospective one-way journey  is hampering his love life. Ryan McDonald, 21, is the youngest - and the only man - among five Britons who have been shortlisted for the Mars One Mission, which is aiming to send people to live in space by 2025. The Oxford University physics student, who is also president of Oxford University Space and Astronomy Society, applied for the trip because he wants to leave a legacy. But he said today that the potential life-changing mission leaves him with little hope of finding love. He told The Daily Mirror: 'Being single makes it easier for me at the moment because what kind of conversation start is it to say ""I'm going to be leaving the planet in the next 10 years"". 'I'm full-on focused on the mission... So I wouldn't be able to have a future with anyone if I started a relationship.' But Mr McDonald, from Derby, said he 'wouldn't rule out' an extra-terrestrial relationship once he has been propelled into space. Mr McDonald has been shortlisted for the mission alongside Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham University, Dr Alison Rigby, 35, a lab technician from south east London, Maggie Lieu, 24, an astrophysics student at the University of Birmingham, and Clare Weedon, 27, a systems information manager from Addlestone, Surrey. The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews. They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. The majority of the 100 applicants come from the U.S., 31 from Europe, 16 from Asia, seven from Africa and seven from Australia. The team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth. Mr McDonald, a sci-fi fan, is currently designing a Thermal-IR camera for a future sample return mission to Mars’s moon Phobos, which could one day select the first landing site on the moons of Mars. Of his enthusiasm for the Mars One mission, he said: ‘To search for evidence of past or present life, to speak to and inspire school children back on Earth, to build the first civilisation on another planet… How could anyone say no to that!’ He added: 'The most important thing to do in life is to leave a legacy. A lot of people do that by having a child, having a family. For me this would be my legacy.' Mr McDonald (left) has been shortlisted alongside Clare Weedon (right), 27, from Addlestone, Surrey . Maggie Lieu (pictured), 24, an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Birmingham was also chosen . While the experience may be amazing, it will certainly be tough. The crew of four will have to contend with temperatures as low as -62C and high radiation levels. They could also be at risk of suffocation, starvation and dehydration. If all goes well, additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars. There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation. In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission in 2011. In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions' to test individuals' responses to stressful situations, the current shortlist will be reduced to 40. Hannah Earnshaw (left) a PhD student in astronomy at Durham University and Dr Alison Rigby, a 35-year-old laboratory technician from Kent (right) are also through to the next round of selection . Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the Red Planet. Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice. Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission. Last year, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that any manned mission to Mars would result in the crew dying after 68 days, while critics have pointed out that the estimated cost of Mars One is a fraction of the amount proposed by Nasa. The privately-funded mission is estimated to cost $6 billion (£4 billion). The robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022. The time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list, but candidates are expected to know whether they have made the cut by the end of this year.","Ryan McDonald, 21, is the youngest Briton to be shortlisted for Mars trip .
